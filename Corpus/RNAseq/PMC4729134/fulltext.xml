In plants, they are associated to numerous development processes most notably those related to reproductive development: flowering induction, specification of inflorescence and flower meristems, establishment of flower organ identity, as well as regulation of fruit, seed and embryo development. Genomic analyses of MADS-box genes in different plant species are providing new relevant information on the function and evolution of this transcriptional factor family. We have performed a true genome-wide analysis of the complete set of MADS-box genes in grapevine (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>), analyzed their expression pattern and establish their phylogenetic relationships (including MIKC* and type I MADS-box) with genes from 16 other plant species. This study was integrated to previous works on the family in grapevine.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 90 MADS-box genes were detected in the grapevine reference genome by completing current gene annotations with a genome-wide analysis based on sequence similarity. We performed a thorough in-depth curation of all gene models and combined the results with gene expression information including RNAseq data to clarifying the expression of newly identified genes and improve their functional characterization. Curated data were uploaded to the ORCAE database for grapevine in the frame of the grapevine genome curation effort. This approach resulted in the identification of 30 additional MADS box genes. Among them, ten new MIKC<sup>C</sup> genes were identified, including a potential new group of short proteins similar to the SVP protein subfamily. The MIKC* subgroup contains six genes in grapevine that can be grouped in the S (4 genes) and P (2 genes) clades, showing less redundancy than that observed in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Expression pattern of these genes in grapevine is compatible with a role in male gametophyte development. Most of the identified new genes belong to the type I MADS-box genes and were classified as members of the M&#x003b1; and M&#x003b3; subclasses. Ours analyses indicate that only few members of type I genes in grapevine have homology in other species and that species-specific clades appeared both in the M&#x003b1; and M&#x003b3; subclasses. On the other hand, as deduced from the phylogenetic analysis with other plant species, genes that can be crucial for development of central cell, endosperm and embryos seems to be conserved in plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The genome analysis of MADS-box genes in grapevine, the characterization of their pattern of expression and the phylogenetic analysis with other plant species allowed the identification of new MADS-box genes not yet described in other plant species as well as basic characterization of their possible role, particularly in the case of type I and MIKC* genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-016-2398-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keyword</title><kwd>Genomic analysis</kwd><kwd>Gene expression</kwd><kwd>Grapevine</kwd><kwd>Phylogenetic analyses</kwd><kwd>MADS-box genes</kwd><kwd><italic>SVP</italic> subfamily</kwd><kwd>Transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Econom&#x000ed;a y Competitividad (ES)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RYC-2011-07791</award-id><award-id>AGL2014-59171-R</award-id><award-id>BIO2014-59324-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grimplet</surname><given-names>J&#x000e9;r&#x000f4;me</given-names></name><name><surname>Mart&#x000ed;nez-Zapater</surname><given-names>Jos&#x000e9; Miguel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The MADS-box family of transcription factors is present in all eukaryotic genomes analyzed so far, although with higher number of gene members in plant genomes than in other kingdoms. Plant MADS-box genes were initially identified as regulators of flower development but later work showed that they control all major aspects of the life of land plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This family of transcription factors is defined by the presence of a conserved domain, the MADS-box, in the N-terminal region, involved in DNA binding and dimerization with other MADS-box proteins. Ancestral MADS-box gene duplication predating divergence of plants and animals separated the two main lineages, type I and type II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], but the presence of around 100 genes in the genomes of angiosperm species suggest that they have considerably expanded in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Type II group genes include MEF2-like genes of animals and yeast and MIKC-type genes only found in plants. MIKC-type genes received this name because, apart from the MADS (M) domain, they contain three additional conserved domains, the weakly conserved Intervening (I) domain, the conserved Keratin-like (K) domain and the highly variable C-terminal (C) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] where the latter usually contains conserved subfamily-specific sequence motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The I domain is responsible for specificity in the formation of DNA-binding dimers, the K domain mediates dimerization and the C domain functions in transcriptional activation and formation of higher order protein complexes. MIKC-type genes have been further divided in two subgroups, MIKC<sup>C</sup> and MIKC* based on divergence at the I and K domains and on exon-intron structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Type I group genes show a simpler gene structure. They are shorter, generally encoding a single exon and lack the K domain.</p><p>MIKC<sup>C</sup>-type genes were initially identified as floral organ identity genes in <italic>Antirrhinum majus</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Further genetic and molecular analyses grouped their biological functions in flower organogenesis into five classes: A, B, C, D and E, which are required, in different combinations, to specify the identity of sepals (A&#x02009;+&#x02009;E), petals (A&#x02009;+&#x02009;B&#x02009;+&#x02009;E), stamens (B&#x02009;+&#x02009;C&#x02009;+&#x02009;E), carpels (C&#x02009;+&#x02009;E) and ovules (D&#x02009;+&#x02009;E). In Arabidopsis, genes belonging to these functional classes were <italic>APETALA1</italic> (<italic>AP1</italic>) in class A, <italic>PISTILATA (PI)</italic> and <italic>APETALA3</italic> (<italic>AP3</italic>) in class B, <italic>AGAMOUS</italic> (<italic>AG</italic>) in class C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], <italic>SEEDSTICK/ AGAMOUS-LIKE 1</italic> (<italic>STK/AGL11</italic>) and <italic>SHATTERPROOF (SHP)</italic> in class D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and <italic>SEPALLATA</italic> (<italic>SEP1, SEP2, SEP3, SEP4</italic>) genes in class E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. MIKC<sup>C</sup> genes in the <italic>AG</italic> and <italic>APETALA1/FRUITFULL</italic> (<italic>AP1</italic>/<italic>FUL</italic>) subfamilies also participate in fruit and seed development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Other MIKC<sup>C</sup> genes were later identified as involved in different regulatory networks controlling flowering time and flower initiation: <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C</italic> (<italic>FLC</italic>), <italic>SUPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANTS 1</italic> (<italic>SOC1</italic>) and <italic>SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE</italic> (<italic>SVP</italic>) are involved in the regulation of flowering transition by the integration of signals from different flowering time regulatory pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These genes function as either positive (<italic>SOC1, AGL24</italic>) or negative regulators (<italic>FLC</italic>, <italic>SVP</italic>) of flower meristem identity genes together with other subfamilies such as <italic>AGL15</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], <italic>AGL12</italic> and <italic>AGL17</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The MIKC* subgroup (or M&#x003b4; group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]) has a small size in all plant species examined so far, ranging from two genes in the basal eudicot (Eschscholzia) and the basal angiosperm (Aristolochia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] to six genes in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]<italic>.</italic> MIKC* structure is very similar to MIKC<sup>C</sup> genes but the K-domain is poorly conserved in its last part and gene structure show an exon duplication in its 5&#x02019; region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Phylogenetic analyses of MIKC* genes from a broad variety of vascular plants confirm the existence of two clades (S and P) previously determined in Arabidopsis and rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In Arabidopsis, MIKC* regulatory function depends on the formation of heterodimers between proteins of the S (AGL66 and AGL104) and P clades (AGL30, AGL65, AGL94). With the exception of AGL67 (S) that seems to be involved in late embryo development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] these genes are crucial for development of the Arabidopsis male gametophyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. MIKC* genes seem to retain a conserved and essential role in gametophyte development during the evolution of land plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Type I genes are very variable in number among flowering plants, ranging from 11 to 229 members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In Arabidopsis, this group has 61 members distributed in three subclasses: M&#x003b1; (25 genes), M&#x003b2; (20 genes) and M&#x003b3; (16 genes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Contrary to the evolution of MIKC-type genes, mostly related to genome duplications, type I MADS-box genes seem to be predominantly duplicated via segmental duplications. This idea is supported by their proximity in the Arabidopsis genome and by their phylogenetic analyses in different species, since species-specific clusters of type I genes have been found in many species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Expression of type I Arabidopsis genes in central cell, antipodal cell and chalazal endosperm of the embryo sac, indicate that they play an important role in female gametophyte and early seed development in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Type I proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] interact predominantly among them. M&#x003b1;-type proteins preferentially form heterodimers with M&#x003b2; or M&#x003b3;-type proteins whereas interactions within the same subclass are rare.</p><p>The genome of the PN40024 grapevine was first established from a 8X assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and later updated with a 12X assembly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Species/Vitis/Data-Sequences">https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Species/Vitis/Data-Sequences</ext-link> from which a gene annotation (VCOST) was performed and is available at the ORCAE platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The MIKC<sup>C</sup>-type genes were previously analyzed within the 8X version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and recently the whole MADS-box gene family was analyzed on an early annotation version (v0) of the 12X assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Here, we report a thorough, unbiased identification and analysis of the grapevine MADS-box gene family. This work does not represent a new characterization of an advanced annotation version but we have detected new genes and curated all their sequences. This work also represents a direct application of the published grapevine nomenclature recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] on the annotation of a complex gene family.</p><p>Our analysis has permitted to complete the MIKC<sup>C</sup>-type genes set with the discovery of 10 new genes, mainly belonging to the SVP, AGL17, BSister (BS) and AGL6 subfamilies, as well as the characterization of the complete set of MIKC* and type I MADS-box genes of grapevine.</p><p>Phylogenetic analyses of MIKC* and type I MADS-box genes within a wide range of plant species have permitted to infer homologies for key genes that could be involved in gametophytes development. Furthermore, <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of gene expression corroborate the expression patterns described for MIKC<sup>C</sup>-type genes and additionally support the results of the phylogenetic analysis of MIKC* and type I MADS-box genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>MADS-box gene identification, annotation and mapping within the grapevine genome</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Gene identification and structural annotation</title><p>Genes that were previously identified as MADS-box [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] were used to perform sequence comparison analyses, either against the most up to date gene predictions from CRIBI V1 and V 2, the NCBI refseq (on the 12Xv1 of the genome assembly) and the VCOST (on the 12Xv2 of the genome assembly) as well as directly against the reference genome sequence to check whether any potential gene could had been missed by these predictions. In this way, we identified 169 genome regions that shared homology with at least one of the genes. Forty two regions did not contained MADS-box genes since there was no MADS domain. Thirty seven regions had a MADS-box domain but deduced genes did not appear to be functional given their truncation or the presence of stop codons inside the sequence (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In fifteen of them, the non-functional condition might be due to incomplete sequence data in the assembly or to natural genetic variation within grapevine, with the corresponding gene being functional in another cultivar. Finally, a total of 90 MADS-box genes with a functional structure were identified in the grapevine genome (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Compared with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], performed on the Genoscope grapevine annotation v0 version, 37 new genes were detected. Thirty genes were also new when compared to the CRIBI V1 annotation and 19 were new with respect to Refseq (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/</ext-link>). Overall, 14 of these genes had never been detected before in any of the automatic gene model predictions.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Grapevine MADS-box genes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Locus ID</th><th>Position</th><th>Locus ID</th><th>Position</th><th>Locus ID</th><th>Position</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vitvi00g00586</td><td>chr00:13358491..13359102</td><td>

These data, that included unpublished work, were particularly valuable in the present context since they include expression information of reproductive organs that are susceptible to show expression of MADS-box genes. This data also allowed evaluating the expression of newly detected genes, not represented in microarray data, by redoing the bioinformatics analysis of original RNAseq data with an updated GFF file. Gene structure described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] was confirmed for 38 genes. One of them previously allocated to the unknown chromosome was discarded because it already existed on chromosome 15. The structures of 15 other genes were curated.

Within type I and type II MADS-box genes, 42 grapevine genes correspond to MIKC<sup>C</sup> genes (previously we had identified 32 of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]), 6 to MIKC* genes (or M&#x003b4;-type), 23 to M&#x003b1;-type I and 19 to M&#x003b3;-type I genes. No M&#x003b2;-type I genes seem to be present in grapevine (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). For MIKC<sup>C</sup> genes, when the gene had already been described and the symbol fit the recommendations of the sNCGGa, the same symbol was conserved. For genes that had not been described before and had an Arabidopsis ortholog, Arabidopsis gene symbol was used. For the rest of the genes, the symbol was composed of the subfamily symbol and a number or a letter to differentiate the different members. For the MIKC<sup>C</sup> genes previously identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], symbols were kept with minor corrections (e. g. <italic>VviSOC1.1</italic> is now called <italic>VviSOC1a</italic>). Symbols used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] were not kept because they were attributed according to their respective chromosome position, which made no more sense with the inclusion of 37 additional genes and because that system was not functional (e.g. the symbol <italic>VviAGL15a</italic> indicates that the gene is a member of the subfamily AGL15 of the MIKC<sup>C</sup> while M<italic>ADS25</italic> gives no information). The new <italic>VviSVP</italic>-like sequences were designed <italic>VviSVPS1</italic> to 5. Following the recommendations of the sNCGGa, we named the MIKC*-subgroup (or M&#x003b4;) as MADSD; the M&#x003b1;-type I subclass as MADS1A and the M&#x003b3;-type I subclass as MADS1G. Within the MADSD we distinguished three clades, two corresponding to the previously described S and P clades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and a third one. Consequently gene clades were designed as MADSD1, 2 and 3 and the individual genes were discriminated with a letter attributed randomly. Within the MADS1A we distinguished three clades that were designated as MADS1A1, MADS1A2 and MADS1A3. Within the MADS1G we distinguished also three clades denominated MADS1G1, MADS1G2 and MADS1G3.

The first group of eight genes was located on chromosome 17 (<italic>MADS1G1b, MADS1G1a</italic> and <italic>MADS1G1c</italic>), chromosome 15 (<italic>MADS1G1d, MADS1G1e, MADS1G1g</italic> and <italic>MADS1G1f</italic>) and on chromosome 5 (<italic>MADS1G1h</italic>). These genes formed a grapevine-specific group with no clear homology to genes from other species. The second group contained two grapevine genes located on chromosome 15 (<italic>MADS1G1i</italic> and <italic>MADS1G1j</italic>) as well as genes from Medicago, soybean and some of the Rosaceae species. <italic>MADS1G1j</italic> showed orthology with apple, this was the only homology with other species detected in the M&#x003b3;1 clade (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic tree of the M&#x003b3;-type I proteins in plants. <italic>Green</italic>: grapevine deduced proteins. <italic>Pink</italic>: Arabidopsis deduced proteins</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2016_2398_Fig8_HTML" id="MO8"/></fig></p><p>Within the M&#x003b3;2 clade there was a group of seven grapevine genes, five in chromosome 5 (<italic>MADS1G2c, MADS1G2d, MADS1G2e, MADS1G2f</italic> and <italic>MADS1G2g</italic>) and two on chromosome 2 (<italic>MADS1G2a</italic> and <italic>MADS1G2b</italic>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).

The closest genes in the phylogenetic tree correspond to a group of apple genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), which suggests that in both of these fruit species the duplication occurred recently.

In addition to public functional annotations, we flagged some regions that might represent functional MADS-box genes in other areas of the genome. This supposes the identification of 90 functional genes what adds 37 new genes to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Chromosome localization, gene structure, phylogenetic analyses with other sequenced genome species and expression analysis allowed to propose an extended characterization of this gene family in grapevine and to draw hypothesis on the function of the yet undescribed genes.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Grapevine MIKC<sup>C</sup> &#x02013;type II genes</title><p>A total of 42 MIKC<sup>C</sup> &#x02013;type II genes distributed in 13 subfamilies were found in grapevine, representing a similar number to what has been described in other plant species. These numbers include the addition of ten new genes to the previous descriptions of this group. Interestingly, we did not found putative one-to-one orthologs for these 10 new genes in other plant systems as detected for the remaining MIKC<sup>C</sup> genes in previous analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Grapevine shows a notable expansion of the SVP subfamily as has been described in other woody species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In addition, the new members in the VviSVP subfamily (<italic>VviSVPS 1</italic> to <italic>5</italic>) showed special features not yet found in any other species. The identification of new genes could result from our more thorough analysis over a 12x genome which, in comparison to automatic annotation methods, permits the isolation of genes with low similarity to other species and not strongly expressed, as automatic method rely on transcript data (EST, RNAseq) and sequences from other species.</p><p>The most significant data among the new genes found were the sequences called <italic>VviSVPS</italic> that appeared in the VviSVP subfamily. The MADS-box of VviSVPS proteins are highly similar to VviSVP and they were named in this way because of this similarity. They also showed similarities with the tomato <italic>JOINTLESS</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] that controls flower abscission. <italic>VviSVPS</italic> genes are located near <italic>VviSVP</italic> genes in grapevine. Three of these sequences (<italic>VviSVPS1</italic>, <italic>VviSVPS2</italic> and <italic>VviSVPS3</italic>) map linked to <italic>VviSVP4</italic> on chromosome 3 and showed a singular pattern of expression, partially overlapping with the expression of <italic>VviSVP</italic> genes but also expressed in other tissues. The same happened with sequences <italic>VviSVPS4</italic> and <italic>VviSVPS5</italic> which are linked to <italic>VviSVP3</italic> on chromosome 15. <italic>VviSVPS</italic> genes are however much shorter than <italic>VviSVP</italic> and <italic>JOINTLESS</italic>. The encoded proteins only contain the MADS-box and a short sequence of about 30 aminoacids that permits to discriminate VviSVPS2 and VviSVPS3 on one hand and VviSVPS1, VviSVPS4 and VviSVPS5 on the other hand (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Compared with grapevine <italic>VviSVP</italic> genes, they seem to lack a large part of the I region but showed homology at the end of the I region and the beginning of the K domain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The conservation of the C-terminal small non-MADS-box sequence within the two groups indicates that this region is probably of functional interest. In addition, their specific expression pattern also suggests that these genes are probably functional. Short MADS-box genes have also been found in other species. Notably, one of them seems to be associated with dormancy in leafy spurge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], whose expression could be in agreement with the expression pattern observed for <italic>VviSVPS2</italic>, <italic>VviSVPS4</italic> and <italic>VviSVPS5</italic> in grapevine. Short MADS-box proteins as the VviSVPS (&#x0003c;100 amino acids) and with sequence similarities to them were also detected in <italic>Arabidopsis, Prunus persica, Ricinus communis, Citrus clementina, Populus trichocarpa, Glycine max, Citrus sinensis and Witheringia coccoloboides</italic> in their respective predicted automatic annotations. <italic>VviSVPS</italic> genes had no homologs in the monocot species considered suggesting that duplication events giving rise to these new genes were rather recent and might actually play a role in dicot-specific developmental mechanisms. Their wide range and diversity of expression suggest that those mechanisms are rather diverse and establishment of their biological function will require further studies. The I and K domains are important for dimerization, The K-domain promotes dimerization via forming amphipathic helices, which interact with those of another K-domain-containing protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The I domain influences the specificity of DNA-binding dimer formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In VviSVPS, I-region is twice shorter than usual, and K-domain consists of 10&#x02013;14 amino acids compared to 70&#x02013;100 amino acids K-domain in MIKC proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), i.e. only 3&#x02013;4 coils are formed instead of 20&#x02013;30 coils in full-length K-domain alfa-helix. The proofs of their expression and their conservation in other species tends to indicate that they are functional, however, whether or not these proteins form complexes with other MADS-box proteins is unclear. A similar role could also be proposed for <italic>VviTM8b</italic>, although the truncated protein only contains the MADS-box and the expression of the corresponding gene could not be detected.</p><p>Regarding <italic>VviAGL6b</italic>, it showed a decreasing level of expression along inflorescence development but increased expression along tendril development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] suggesting a possible involvement in development of this organ. The expression data (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) indicate that the <italic>VviAGL6a</italic> probe set in the Grapegen array might have been compromised since expression was never detected in this platform, while it is clearly expressed in many tissues. Nevertheless its expression seems to be low in tendrils. Thus a new function acquired in this subfamily for tendril development was suggested for <italic>VviAGL6b</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], as was also proposed for other members of the AP1/FUL subfamily in grapevine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] where additional subfamily members also show a differential pattern of tendril expression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Grapevine MIKC<sup>*</sup>&#x02013;type II genes</title><p>The grapevine genome contained six genes in this group belonging to the two previously defined clades (S and P) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], that are typical of euphyllophytes (angiosperm, gymnosperms and ferns).

Arabidopsis genes within this clade (<italic>AGL66</italic> and <italic>AGL104)</italic> seem to function redundantly in pollen development since their loss has significant effects on pollen performance but only when both AGL66 and AGL104 MADS-box containing complexes are reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Thus, we could think of a possible equivalent role for the complex (MADSD2b/MADSD2c<italic>) /</italic> MADSD1a as complexes AGL65/AGL104 or AGL65/AGL66 role in Arabidopsis pollen development. This is supported by their expression pattern since although <italic>MADSD1a</italic> and <italic>MADSD2b/MADSD2c</italic> have quite different patterns of expression they share the feature of peaking in pollen.</p><p>Arabidopsis and rice MIKC<sup>*</sup> genes are almost exclusively expressed in pollen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] with the exception of the <italic>AGL67</italic> gene which is expressed in embryos and is candidate for regulating aspects of late embryo development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, grapevine MIKC<sup>*</sup>genes are expressed outside male gametophytes with the exception of <italic>MADSD1a</italic> that was only detected in flower and pollen, which could suggest additional biological functions for these genes. Similarly, expression of P-clade genes was detected in sporophytic tissues in Prunus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], in the female gametophyte in lycophytes as well as on hermaphrodite gametophytes in the fern Ceratopteris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], suggesting that MIKC* genes could also function outside the male gametophyte in other systems. The basal angiosperm Eschscholzia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] contains two MIKC<sup>*</sup>genes highly expressed in pollen with the one belonging to the P clade also expressed in sporophytic tissues. In Arabidopsis, heterodimers seems to exist only in pollen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], suggesting a role of these genes also restricted to male gametophyte development in spite of the expression of the P clade gene. This could be also the case of grapevine with a broad expression of <italic>MADSD2b</italic> but with a more restricted expression for their S putative partners.</p><p>Finally, clade 3 contained a single grapevine gene, <italic>MADSD3a</italic>, which encodes truncated proteins with the MADS-box domain followed by five amino acids. <italic>MADSD3a</italic> is expressed in berry and seed.

Our analyses showed that no gene could be classified as M&#x003b2; in grapevine although a reduced clade of two genes might cover their biological roles. These genes numbers were very similar to those described in Arabidopsis with M&#x003b1; (25 genes) and M&#x003b3; (16 genes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], although Arabidopsis displays a large group of M&#x003b2; genes (20). Type I genes number is variable among plant species without clear homologies within subclasses and this is also the case in grapevine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Our phylogenetic analysis showed the presence of grapevine-specific clades both in the M&#x003b1; and M&#x003b3;-subclasses with only a few genes having clear homologs in other species. Gene clustering on chromosome location for many of these genes is also in agreement with their proposed origin through segmental duplications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>The M&#x003b1;-type I genes</title><p>Three clades were identified in grapevine MADS1A1 and MADS1A2, that are phylogenetically related and MADS1A3. In Arabidopsis, the M&#x003b1; type I genes are separated into two groups according to their expression. The first group contains genes distinctly expressed while the genes in the second group are weakly expressed. In the first group, two clades with differential expression pattern were additionally found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In grapevine, the first clade, MADS1A1, contained the genes showing the highest homology with this first clade of the first group of Arabidopsis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This conservation was also observed in other plant systems. This clade in Arabidopsis contains genes with a proposed functional role in central cell development, endosperm development and early embryo sac and seed development (<italic>DIA/AGL61</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], <italic>AGL62</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], <italic>AGL23</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]). The expression detected for <italic>MADS1A1</italic> genes in grapevine is very low, probably due to expression of these genes in few and specific cells, never evaluated in grapevine and during short times along development. No Plant Ontology was attributed to any genes, but expression higher than the background noise were observed for three genes (<italic>MADS1A1a</italic>, <italic>MADS1A1c</italic> and <italic>MADS1A1e</italic>). The expression of <italic>MADS1A1a</italic> and <italic>MADS1A1c</italic> in berry and first stages of seed development (mainly in the case of <italic>MADS1A1a</italic>), and <italic>MADS1A1e</italic> in seeds would be in agreement with a role in seed development similarly to what has been proposed for their Arabidopsis homologs. Out of five of these genes that clustered on chromosome 5, only two might be expressed. This could be a consequence of segmental duplication that can derive in non-functionalization, as has also been observed in Arabidopsis and other plant systems. This was one of the few groups of grapevine type I genes that showed clear homology with genes from other plant species (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), suggesting they might regulate conserved functions during reproductive development.</p><p>Regarding the second clade of grapevine genes, MADS1A2, their expression is generally very low except for two genes that are clearly expressed. Both <italic>MADS1A2a</italic> and <italic>MADS1A2</italic> were expressed in a diversity of tissues, senescing leaves, winter buds, post v&#x000e9;raison berry tissues, seedling and pollen. In general, <italic>MADS1A2</italic> genes showed only little homology to genes from a few other species (papaya, soybean, medicago, tomato and poplar). The MADS1A2 clade do not seem to have any counterpart in Arabidopsis and cannot be related to the second group of Arabidopsis M&#x003b1;-type I genes composed by genes weakly expressed in the female gametophyte. Interestingly, Arabidopsis genes belonging to the clade without grapevine counterparts were the ones interacting with M&#x003b2; genes, a group of genes also missing in grapevine. Considering that M&#x003b2; genes seem to be absent or partially absent in several species (Eucalyptus, soybean, medicago and grapevine), it is tempting to speculate the existence of alternative regulatory mechanisms for the development of the female gametophyte in plants, including grapevine. The third clade of M&#x003b1;-type I genes in grapevine, MADS1A3, is phylogenetically related in the species analysis to the second clade of the first group of M&#x003b1;-type I genes of Arabidopsis but do not show specific gene homologies. Grapevine genes also show reduced homology with other species, with the exception of <italic>MADS1A3a</italic> (and <italic>MADS1A3e</italic> to a lesser extend). In the species analysis, <italic>MADS1A3</italic> genes are in the same clade than the four Arabidopsis paralogs <italic>AGL57</italic>, <italic>AGL58, AGL59</italic> and <italic>AGL64</italic> which are expressed in the embryo and the peripheral endosperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We did not detected expression for <italic>MADS1A3a, MADS1A3b, MADS1A3c</italic> and M<italic>ADS1A3d</italic> but <italic>MADS1A3e</italic> was expressed in older tissues (senescing leaves, late ripening) and <italic>MADS1A3f</italic> and <italic>MADS1A3g</italic> only show signs of expression slightly over background noise.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>The M&#x003b3;-type I genes</title><p>Three clades were distinguished within this subclass, MADS1G1, MADS1G2 and MADS1G3. The first clade MADS1G1 is grapevine-specific (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). All these grapevine MADS-box genes, except <italic>MADS1G1d</italic>, were identified for the first time in this work. Thus, there is no microarray data available to analyze their expression. RNAseq experiments detected no expression for <italic>MADS1G1a, MADS1G1b, MADS1G1e</italic> and only traces for <italic>MADS1G1d</italic> and <italic>MADS1G1e</italic>. By contrast, <italic>MADS1G1f, MADS1G1g</italic> and <italic>MADS1G1h</italic> were clearly expressed in shoot tips. More detailed studies will be required to address the possible biological function of this group of genes. Genes within the other group, <italic>MADS1G1i</italic> and <italic>MADS1G1j</italic>, were already identified in the grapevine genome. These two genes are linked in the genome and co-expressed with <italic>MADS1G2a</italic> appearing to be flower-specific. <italic>MADS1G1j</italic> is also the only gene displaying homology with genes in other species (apple, MDP0000753870).</p><p>Although no gene could be classified as M&#x003b2;-type I in grapevine, <italic>AGL47</italic> and <italic>AGL82</italic>, a subgroup of Arabidopsis M&#x003b2;-type I genes were located closely to the MADS1G1 clade in the phylogenetic tree (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). <italic>AGL47</italic> was expressed during early megagametogenesis and <italic>AGL82</italic> in central cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Although these organs and cell types were not analyzed here, expression of <italic>MADS1G1i</italic> and <italic>MADS1G1j</italic> in flowers could suggest that they might fulfill the role of the M&#x003b2;-type I subclass in grapevine.</p><p>In the second clade (MADS1G2) there was a group of genes, <italic>MADS1G2a</italic> to <italic>MADS1G2g</italic>, clustering together and a single gene, <italic>MADS1G2h</italic>, with homology to the Arabidopsis genes belonging to the <italic>AGL34, AGL35, AGL36, AGL37, AGL80, AGL86, AGL90</italic> and <italic>AGL92</italic> group of expression, all involved in endosperm development. M&#x003b3;-type I genes are preferentially expressed in the developing seed in Arabidopsis, whereas <italic>AGL80</italic> is predominantly expressed in the central cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Multiple <italic>MADS1G2</italic> genes have <italic>AGL80</italic> as best match with <italic>MADS1G2h</italic> having the highest homology (homology percentage of 65&#x000a0;%, compared to 50&#x000a0;% for the others). <italic>MADS1G2h</italic> also had one-to-one orthologs in all dicot species analyzed, but none in monocots. AGL80 together with AGL61 (DIANA) are involved in central cell formation in the Arabidopsis embryo sac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Interestingly, no grapevine homologs were identified for <italic>AGL37 (PHERES1),</italic> functionally characterized and involved together with <italic>AGL62</italic> in endosperm development. The group of grapevine <italic>MADS1G2a</italic> to <italic>MADS1G2g</italic> genes had an expression pattern restricted to seed in several cases although other genes were expressed in earliest reproductive stages (flower and inflorescences). In addition, the putative <italic>AGL80</italic> homolog <italic>MADS1G2h</italic>, was expressed in post-harvest berry and seed.</p><p>The third clade (MADS1G3) contained a single M&#x003b3; gene, <italic>MADS1G3a</italic>, which belonged to a clade with Arabidopsis genes <italic>AGL95, AGL96</italic> and <italic>AGL48. MADS1G3a</italic> did not share homology with any gene in the analyzed species and was slightly expressed in seeds. <italic>MADS1G3a</italic> might be the gene fulfilling the role of these Arabidopsis genes whose biological roles were described as redundant in embryo development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>In summary, grapevine type I genes include a few conserved members that could be crucial for embryo and endosperm development in parallel to the role of Arabidopsis <italic>AGL80</italic> the putative ortholog of <italic>MADS1G2h</italic> and <italic>AGL61</italic> and <italic>AGL62</italic>, putative orthologs of MADS1A1 clade genes. Processes related to central cell, embryo and endosperm development could be conserved under the same regulatory networks. Regarding the development of the female gametophyte, which in Arabidopsis is controlled by interaction between the second group of Arabidopsis M&#x003b1;-type I genes and the M&#x003b2;&#x02013;type I genes, grapevine genes are less conserved since no homologous to those M&#x003b1;-genes were identified and M&#x003b2; genes might be absent or only represented by two members in grapevine.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our identification of MADS box proteins in the grapevine genome revealed, for this specific gene family at least, that automatic approaches were limited in gene prediction since most of type I genes had not been identified previously. Our genomic analysis of MADS-box genes in grapevine allowed the discovery of genes belonging to the BS, AGL17, AGL6 and TM8 subfamilies that had no homologs in other plant species. In addition, five sequences related to the VviSVP subfamily, named as VviSVPS could represent a new type of MADS-box genes not yet characterized in other plant systems.</p><p>Characterization of the MIKC*-subgroup confirm the proposed existence of S and P clades genes although the grapevine genome seems to have less redundancy in the P clade with only two members. Expression of these grapevine genes was detected in the male gametophyte but also in other tissues which support additional roles outside pollen development.</p><p>We have extensively described grapevine type I genes for the first time. We identified two subclades of M&#x003b1;-type I and three subclades of M&#x003b3;-type I genes, but no genes could be clearly classified as M&#x003b2; in grapevine. Phylogenetic analysis among species showed that only few members of type I genes have clear homologs in other plant species and that grapevine-specific clades appeared both in the M&#x003b1; and M&#x003b3;-subclasses. Comparing with Arabidopsis and other species type-I genes, we observed conservation of genes that could be crucial for development of central cell, embryo and endosperm. Further functional analysis will be required to understand the biological role of this complex gene family in grapevine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec29"><title>Identification of MADS-box genes</title><p>Genes previously identified as MADS-box genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] were blasted (blastp and tblastn) against the grapevine genome 12x.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Species/Vitis/Data-Sequences/Genome-sequences">https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Species/Vitis/Data-Sequences/Genome-sequences</ext-link>), the non redundant list of genes in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and the COST annotation gene set available at the ORCAE website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/orcae/">http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/orcae/</ext-link>).
