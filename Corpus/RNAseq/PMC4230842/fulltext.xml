In plants, DNA methylation is not only critical for transcriptionally silencing transposons, but can also affect phenotype by altering expression of protein coding genes. The extent of its contribution to phenotypic diversity over evolutionary time is, however, unclear, because of limited stability of epialleles that are not linked to DNA mutations. To dissect the relative contribution of DNA methylation to transposon surveillance and host gene regulation, we leveraged information from three species in the Brassicaceae that vary in genome architecture, <italic>Capsella rubella</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic>, and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. We found that the lineage-specific expansion and contraction of transposon and repeat sequences is the main driver of interspecific differences in DNA methylation. The most heavily methylated portions of the genome are thus not conserved at the sequence level. Outside of repeat-associated methylation, there is a surprising degree of conservation in methylation at single nucleotides located in gene bodies. Finally, dynamic DNA methylation is affected more by tissue type than by environmental differences in all species, but these responses are not conserved. The majority of DNA methylation variation between species resides in hypervariable genomic regions, and thus, in the context of macroevolution, is of limited phenotypic consequence.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that has received a great deal of attention in plants because it can be stably transmitted across generations. However, the rate of DNA methylation change, or epimutation, is greater than that of DNA mutation. In addition, different from DNA sequence, DNA methylation can vary within an individual in response to developmental or environmental cues. Whether altered characters can be passed on to the next generation via directed modifications in DNA methylation is a question of great interest. We have compared how DNA methylation changes between species, tissues, and environments using three closely related crucifers as examples. We found that DNA methylation is different between roots and shoots and changes with temperatures, but that such changes are not conserved across species. Moreover, most of the methylated sites are not conserved between species. This suggests that DNA methylation may respond to immediate fluctuations in the environment, but this response is not retained over long evolutionary periods. Thus, in contrast to transcriptional responses, conserved epigenetic responses at the level of DNA methylation are not widespread. Instead, the patterns of DNA methylation are largely determined by the evolution of genome structure, and responsive loci are likely short-lived accidents of this process.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (SPP1529 Adaptomics), a Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) Long-Term Fellowship (DK), and the Max Planck Society.

These observations suggest that DNA methylation may regulate developmental processes and that it could potentiate phenotypic variation during evolution.</p><p>Unlike mutational processes acting on DNA sequences, our understanding of the factors contributing to meiotically stable variation in DNA methylation is in its infancy <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Heard1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The different molecular mechanisms governing DNA methylation constitute one factor impacting stability and subsequent inheritance at symmetric and asymmetric sites. In the plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, initiation and maintenance of methylation at CG and CHG sites is divided primarily between DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1) and CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3) <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Lindroth1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Bestor1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Finnegan1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. During DNA replication these two enzymes copy symmetrically methylated cytosines onto the newly synthesized DNA strand using the parental strand as a template <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Leonhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Chuang1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Unlike symmetric cytosine methylation, CHH methylation cannot be replicated from the template strand <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Pelissier1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Instead, methylation at newly synthesized CHH sites is established after cell division by the RdDM RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway through the concerted action of small RNAs (sRNAs) produced from the methylated locus and the de novo DNA methyltransferases DRM1/DRM2 (DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE1/2) <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Pelissier1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Law1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In addition, RdDM-independent asymmetric DNA methylation relies on DDM1 (DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION1) and CMT2 <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Zemach2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>The extent to which DNA methylation varies at individual sites across generations, or the epimutation rate, has only recently been characterized in isogenic plant lines <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Becker1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Schmitz2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Repeat-associated methylation was remarkably stable over 30 generations, but some variability arose outside of repeats in euchromatic sequence <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Becker1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Schmitz2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Changes in DNA methylation accumulated non-linearly, indicating that a subset of methylated sites is particularly prone to spontaneous changes in methylation and, as a result, the absolute DNA methylation differences quickly reach saturation <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Becker1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Schmitz2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Variation of methylation across generations has been linked to the transgenerational cycling of transposon and repeats between methylated and unmethylated states in the germline <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Calarco1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>Armed with the knowledge of within-species epimutation rate, the degree of epigenome stability over short evolutionary periods, within a single species, for example, can be addressed <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Schmitz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Using <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, intraspecific variation in methylation was surveyed in 140 geographically diverse accessions <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Schmitz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Most single site and RdDM-derived regional epimutations were rare, occurring in only a few of the 140 accessions <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Schmitz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The lack of intermediate frequency epimutations in these categories is consistent with the view that the vast majority of new methylation variants within a species may only exist for brief periods during evolution. Not too surprisingly, a significant subset of both rare and intermediate frequency RdDM-derived regional epimutations were associated with previously unknown structural variants <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Schmitz1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Expansion and contraction of repeat-associated sequences leads to intraspecific structural variation; therefore, as a result of RdDM silencing, such structural variants should be linked to methylation variation.</p><p>Over longer evolutionary periods, broad similarities in DNA methylation are observed across a variety of genomic features. Large-scale patterns of methylation are shared across flowering plants, including extensive methylation of heterochromatic transposon and repeat-associated sequences <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Zilberman1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Rabinowicz1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Regulski1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Takuno1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> likely due to conservation of the RdDM machinery in plants. Over shorter divergence times, similar levels of gene body methylation have been observed at orthologous genes within the grasses <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Takuno1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Takuno2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Similarly, in vertebrates, where most of the CG sites in the genome are methylated, absence of methylation at so-called CpG islands is usually found in all species examined <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Long1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Regardless of organism, the degree of DNA methylation conservation depends on both the evolutionary time scale under consideration and on the genomic feature of interest.</p><p>Here we compare at single base resolution DNA methylation in three closely related Brassicaceae - <italic>Capsella rubella</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic>, and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. These three species, which diverged about 10 to 20 million years ago <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Beilstein1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, vary in genome size and architecture <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Slotte1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Both <italic>C. rubella</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic> have a Brassicaceae typical set of eight chromosomes, while <italic>A. thaliana</italic> has only five chromosomes <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Yogeeswaran1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Lysak1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Both the <italic>A. lyrata</italic> and <italic>C. rubella</italic> genomes are about 50% larger than that of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, but for very different reasons. Expansion of centromeric, heterochromatic regions has enlarged the <italic>C. rubella</italic> genome, but predominantly euchromatic regions have expanded in <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, driven by insertions of transposable elements (TEs) adjacent to genic sequences <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Slotte1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Reflecting these differences in genome architecture, the reference genome assemblies represent about 85% of the entire genome in <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, about 75% in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, and about 60% in <italic>C. rubella</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004785.s015">Table S1</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Slotte1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-The1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Swarbreck1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Lysak2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Bennett2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. We show that the difference in genome structure is a major factor influencing the evolution of DNA methylation in these species. Furthermore, while overall DNA methylation is similar between species at many sites, dynamic DNA methylation responses between environments and tissues are rarely conserved.

The close relationship of the species used in our experiments allows us to make inferences at base pair resolution.

In theory, such variation could control changes in gene expression. We found evidence for DNA methylation variation in all three species across both tissue type and environment. The changes in DNA methylation were in all three species much greater between tissues, and consistently resulted in lower methylation levels in the root <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Widman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Differences between the root and shoot tissues also explain a majority of the expression variation in the transcriptional data, but these changes are not directional. We found no evidence that changes in DNA methylation across tissues is associated with changes in gene expression. In fact, a large proportion of methylation changes were found in repetitive sequences. This pattern may result from the increased stringency of transposon silencing in the shoot, which includes the plant germline <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Baubec1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>.</p><p>While transcriptional responses are highly conserved across all three species, we found no evidence for conservation of DNA methylation response at the sequence level. MRs and DMRs are predominantly found in the rapidly evolving repeat-rich regions of the genome and rarely reside in or near the same orthologous gene in more than one species.

DNA mutations rarely revert and occur in a largely random fashion throughout the genome <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. In contrast, recent studies have shown that the transgenerational stability of DNA methylation is very context dependent <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Becker1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Schmitz2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

While the majority of single site and regional methylation is found in repetitive sequences that are unlikely under evolutionary constraint, the remaining observed patterns in euchromatic sequence reflect lineage-specific evolution of transposons. This is particularly obvious in <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, which has experienced a recent invasion of transposable elements into euchromatic sequences <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and subsequent elevation in the methylation rate of euchromatic features, particularly introns.</p><p>Large-scale structural changes that have perturbed the genome-wide DNA methylation landscape have also occurred in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>

Loss of three repeat-rich centromeres in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> caused a decrease in DNA methylation in sequences flanking the ancestral centromeres. The impact of lineage-specific transposon evolution and subsequent methylation is similarly evident in genic sequences. Approximately 40% of methylation in conserved exon sequence is species-specific. These sites are non-uniformly distributed near the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; edges of genes, likely due to spreading from adjacent transposons <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Arnaud1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Saze1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. These observations support the hypothesis that surveillance of transposons is the primary contributor to the genomic distribution of DNA methylation in plants. Since transposon content and genome structure vary extensively even over short evolutionary time periods, DNA methylation appears to be similarly variable. This is supported by the poor resolution of species relationships in a principal component analysis of DNA methylation and a nearly ten-fold increase in divergence between <italic>A. lyrata</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> when comparing DNA methylation as opposed to nucleotide sequence <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.

Our results indicate that the rapid evolution of repeat sequences is the major contributor to the equally rapid changes in the genomic distribution of DNA methylation. In this respect, it is more reasonable to regard DNA methylation primarily as a molecular phenotype resulting from the underlying genetic sequences. Although a few &#x0201c;pure&#x0201d; epialleles have been identified in nature, the majority of natural epimutations are linked to nearby transposon insertions or other genetic changes <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Morgan1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Das1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

Briefly, each cytosine can be in either an unmethylated or methylated state. The model trains methylation rate distributions for each state and sequence context (CG, CHG, CHH) independently using genome-wide data. In addition, transition probabilities between the states are trained. To make the original HMM implementation applicable to plant data, three different (beta binomial) distributions were estimated for each state (methylated and unmethylated) instead of just the single distribution used in mammals, which have almost only CG methylation <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Molaro1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. To prevent identification of regions over uncovered bases, the genome was split at locations that lacked a covered cytosine position for 50 adjacent base pairs.

Replicates of each treatment combination were combined for this analysis.

For each identified region, pairwise statistical tests were performed for the relevant comparisons listed above.

The statistical test compares the individual sample distributions to the joint distribution using a log-odds ratio. This ratio is compared against a chi-squared distribution to obtain confidence values. For each identified region, samples were assigned to groups by separating the samples with statistically significant methylation. To confirm groupings, we first combined read counts from treatment combinations in the same group.

First, expression analysis was performed within species. There were 12 samples consisting of three replicates and four unique treatment combinations. All representative gene models were considered. The following custom GLM model was used: expression&#x0223c;tissue*treatment. This included the main effects of tissue and treatment as well as their interaction. Secondly, we performed differential expression analysis between all species simultaneously. In this case, there are a total of 36 samples consisting of three replicates of each species, tissue, and treatment combination. Only 1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1 orthologous gene pairs were considered (14,395 in total). The following custom GLM model was used: expression&#x0223c;species*tissue*treatment. This includes the main effects of species, tissue, and treatment as well as all two and three-way interactions. Corrections for gene length were performed, but this did not impact the results and was subsequently ignored.</p></sec><sec id="s4o"><title>Repeat annotations</title><p>Transposon and repeat annotations for all three species were derived from the <italic>Capsella rubella</italic> genome paper <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Slotte1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Maumus1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004785-Maumus2" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1004785.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Effects of intron insertions of transposons on gene expression.
