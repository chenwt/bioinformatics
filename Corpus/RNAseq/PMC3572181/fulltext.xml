Its role in human cancer is complex and controversial with both pro-oncogenic and anti-oncogenic activities reported. To clarify its role in human cancer and provide clinical relevance to its signaling activities, we examined SnoN expression in normal and cancerous human esophageal, ovarian, pancreatic and breast tissues. In normal tissues, SnoN is expressed in both the epithelium and the surrounding stroma at a moderate level and is predominantly cytoplasmic. SnoN levels in all tumor epithelia examined are lower than or similar to that in the matched normal samples, consistent with its anti-tumorigenic activity in epithelial cells. In contrast, SnoN expression in the stroma is highly upregulated in the infiltrating inflammatory cells in high-grade esophageal and ovarian tumor samples, suggesting that SnoN may potentially promote malignant progression through modulating the tumor microenvironment in these tumor types. The overall levels of SnoN expression in these cancer tissues do not correlate with the p53 status. However, in human cancer cell lines with amplification of the <italic>snoN</italic> gene, a strong correlation between increased SnoN copy number and inactivation of p53 was detected, suggesting that the tumor suppressor SnoN-p53 pathway must be inactivated, either through downregulation of SnoN or inactivation of p53, in order to allow cancer cell to proliferate and survive. These data strongly suggest that SnoN can function as a tumor suppressor at early stages of tumorigenesis in human cancer tissues.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study is supported by NIH RO1 CA101891 and RO1 DK090347 to K.

In mammals, SnoN contains both pro-oncogenic and anti-oncogenic activities. The pro-oncogenic activity of SnoN is dependent on its ability to bind to the Smad proteins and antagonize the cytostatic responses of TGF-&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Deheuninck1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Jahchan1">[6]</xref>. Suppporting its pro-oncogenic role, SnoN expression is elevated in most human cancer cell lines, and reduction of SnoN expression by shRNA in invasive breast cancer and lung cancer cell lines inhibits tumor growth both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Zhu1">[7]</xref>. More importantly, overexpression of SnoN in the mouse mammary gland accelerates breast cancer development and pulmonary metastasis induced by the Polyoma middle T antigen (PyVmT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Jahchan2">[8]</xref>, providing the first <italic>in vivo</italic> support for the pro-oncogenic activity of SnoN. In recent years, however, more and more evidence have emerged indicating that SnoN can also act as a tumor suppressor. Heterozygous mice lacking one copy of the <italic>snoN</italic> gene show an increased susceptibility to carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis, suggesting that SnoN may protect mice from carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Shinagawa1">[9]</xref>. We have recently shown that high levels of SnoN inhibit oncogene-induced transformation of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic> and block tumor development <italic>in vivo</italic> in a two-step skin carcinogenesis mouse model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Pan1">[10]</xref>. This anti-oncogenic activity of SnoN is independent of its ability to repress TGF-&#x003b2; signaling and likely stems from its ability to induce stabilization of p53. In response to cellular stress, high levels of SnoN is recruited to the PML nulcear bodies where it induces stabilization of p53, leading to increased cellular senescence and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Pan1">[10]</xref>. Thus, high levels of SnoN in cells may activate the PML-p53 tumor suppressor pathway to inhibit tumor growth. Finally, SnoN may also inhibit tumor metastasis since reducing SnoN expression enhances epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of lung and breast cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumor metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Zhu1">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Given the complex roles of SnoN in tumorigenesis, it is important to determine its expression pattern in normal human tissues and monitor how it changes during malignant progression. SnoN is ubiquitously expressed in all embryonic and adult tissues. Its expression is upregulated during specific stages of embryogenesis and organ morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Pelzer1">[11]</xref>. In untransformed cells and normal tissues, SnoN can be detected in both cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas in cancer cell lines, SnoN is largely nuclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Jahchan2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Krakowski1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Zhang1">[13]</xref>. In addition, SnoN expression can be regulated at the level of gene amplification, transcriptional activation and protein stability. The human <italic>snoN</italic> gene is located at chromosome 3q26.2, a locus frequently amplified in many cancer types, including that of esophagus, ovary and many others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Deheuninck1">[5]</xref>. In agreement with this, SnoN expression is upregulated in many cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Jahchan1">[6]</xref>. However, whether SnoN expression is also increased in human cancer tissues remains controversial. A number of studies have examined this issue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Zhang1">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Zhang2">[18]</xref>, but no consistent pattern has emerged. While some studies reported an increase in SnoN RNA and protein levels in some cancer tissues and that this higher SnoN expression correlated with poor differentiation, deeper invasion and poor patient survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Zhang1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Akagi1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Imoto1">[16]</xref>, others detected a decrease in SnoN expression in similar cancers, particularly in dysplastic and highly invasive cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Chia1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Villanacci1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Zhang2">[18]</xref>. The potential relationship between localization of SnoN and malignant status of cancer also varied from study to study. These conflicting data suggest a more complex relationship between SnoN expression and malignant transformation and justify the need for a broader examination of SnoN expression in normal and cancer tissues of different malignant stages.</p><p>In this report, we examined SnoN expression in four types of normal human tissues and matching cancer tissues of various clinical stages of malignancy to assess whether alterations of SnoN expression correlate with tumor malignancy and/or status of p53 inactivation. These four types, esophageal, ovarian, breast and pancreatic tissues, were chosen because SnoN has been implicated in the development of these cancers and/or in the normal functions of these tissues. Esophageal and ovarian cancers often involve amplification of the 3q26 amplicon, and the copy number of the <italic>SnoN</italic> gene as well as SnoN transcript levels have been found to increase in these cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Akagi1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Imoto1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Nanjundan1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Nanjundan2">[20]</xref>. However the expression pattern of SnoN protein in normal ovary and in ovarian adenocarcinoma have not been defined. Pancreatic cancer is closely associated with the TGF-&#x003b2;/Smad pathway, and Smad4 is inactivated in nearly 60% of pancreatic cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Truty1">[21]</xref>. As a negative regulator of Smad4, SnoN may also play a role in the development of pancreatic cancer. Finally, our recent studies using various mouse models have shown that SnoN expression is dynamically regulated during mammary gland development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Jahchan2">[8]</xref> and is implicated in the malignant progression of breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Zhu1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Jahchan2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Krakowski1">[12]</xref>. By examining the location and levels of SnoN expression in these tissues, we hope to gain a better understanding of the functions that SnoN play during tumorigenesis in both the epithelium and stromal environment and how this may correlate with p53 inactivation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Normal and Cancer Tissue Arrays</title><p>All arrays were purchased from Biomax (Cybrdi Inc).

These esophageal adenocarcinoma samples have been classified clinically from grade I to III. Notably, the multi-layered tissue structure seen in normal esophageal tissue has been lost completely in these adenocarcinoma samples, and tumor stromal cells are interspersed with tumor epithelium. Our semi-quantitative analysis showed that compared to the normal squamous epithelium, SnoN expression was significantly reduced in grade I (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.00016) and to a lesser extent, grade II tumors (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.142) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055794-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). Interestingly, as tumors progressed to a more malignant stage (grade III), SnoN expression recovered gradually to a level comparable to or higher than that in normal controls (two representative samples, one similar to normal and one higher are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055794-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). SnoN expression in the stromal cells and connective tissue in grade I and II tumors were also decreased significantly from that in normal tissues. Grade III tumor stroma, however, showed a significant upregulation of SnoN expression than grade I tumors (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0068), reaching a level similar to and in 55% of the samples, higher than that in normal tissues (last panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055794-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), especially in infiltrating fibroblasts and inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, leukocytes and phagocytes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055794-g002">Figure 2A and 2C</xref>). However, due to the large variations among individual grade III samples, the mean change in stroma SnoN levels over that in WT tissues was not statistically significant. Notably, SnoN remained largely cytoplasmic in these tumor samples.

As a result of this heterogeneity, statistical analysis showed that there was no overall difference in SnoN expression between normal ovarian tissue and grade III tumor samples.

Interestingly, although in any individual cell in the DCIS tissues, the level of SnoN expression was similar to or in a few cases, lower than that in cells in normal tissues, due to a markedly increased epithelial content in DCIS samples, the overall SnoN level in the whole tissue was much higher than that in normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055794-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, the overall increase in SnoN level in DCIS samples reflects the significantly elevated epithelial contents in these tissues but not the upregulation of SnoN expression in individual cells.</p><p>Taken together, unlike previously proposed, SnoN expression is reduced in lower grade malignant tumors of esophagus, breast, pancreas and ovary (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055794-t001">Table 1</xref>). In esophageal and ovarian cancer, and to a lesser degree in pancreatic cancer, SnoN expression gradually recovered in grade III tumors. This finding is consistent with the model that SnoN may function initially as a tumor suppressor in malignant progression, possibly through activating p53. The model further predicts that in order for tumor cells to overcome the tumor suppressive activity of the SnoN-p53 pathway, they have to either inactivate p53 or delete SnoN.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Elevated SnoN Expression Correlates with Inactivation of p53 in Human Cancer Cell Lines but not in Primary Tumor Tissues</title><p>In contrast to its reduced expression in primary tumor samples, SnoN have been shown previously to be elevated in esophageal, ovarian and breast cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Zhu1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Imoto1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Nanjundan1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Nanjundan2">[20]</xref>, due possibly to gene amplification and/or transcriptional activation. Since this elevated SnoN can activate p53 to trigger senescence, these cancer cells are predicted to inactivate this p53-dependent pathway in order to sustain proliferation. We therefore tested the hypothesis that cancer cells with elevated SnoN may also show inactivation of p53. We analyzed 914 cancer cell lines in the Novartis cell line encyclopedia (CLE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Barretina1">[23]</xref>, in which copy numbers and mutations of SnoN and p53 genes were characterized using Affymetrix SNP6 microarray or RNAseq technology, to determine whether samples with increased copy number of the <italic>SnoN</italic> gene also tend to show inactivation of p53 as indicated by a loss of p53 copy number or the presence of known inactivating mutations. Based on the mutation status of p53, we classified cell lines into mutant or wild type, and copy number of SnoN were compared among these two groups. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055794-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, we identified significant enrichment of SnoN amplification events in p53 mutant or p53 deleted cell lines (p value: 7.25E-009), indicating a potential association between the two genetic events. To further assess the association of p53 mutation and SnoN amplification, we partitioned cell lines by lineage into 18 sub-groups, and determined the frequency of SnoN amplification and the frequency of p53 mutation within each group and for all groups. A striking correlation between the frequency of p53 mutation and the frequency of SnoN amplification was detected (The Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient was 0.7), where the lineages with higher incidence of p53 mutation tended to have higher incidence of SnoN amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055794-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

In all normal tissue samples, p53 was absent as expected (data not shown). In contrast, majority of ovarian tumor samples exhibited a strong p53 nuclear staining, indicating the presence of inactivating mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Goh1">[24]</xref>. The levels of p53 correlated with the malignant stage of the tumors, but showed no significant correlation between SnoN and p53 expression levels (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.817) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055794-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Similarly, no significant correlation was detected between SnoN expression levels and p53 mutation status in esophageal, breast and pancreatic cancer samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055794-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). This is not entirely surprising as most cancer tissues we tested seem to downregulate SnoN protein. This downregulation of SnoN protein is sufficient to abolish its tumor suppressor activity and therefore presents no need to additionally inactivate the downstream p53.</p><p>Together our study suggests that SnoN is likely to play a tumor suppressor role in the initial stages of human cancer development, and inactivation of this pathway by targeting either SnoN itself or p53 is necessary for malignant progression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report, we found that SnoN is expressed in the normal human esophageal, ovarian, pancreatic and breast tissues predominantly in the cytoplasm of both the epithelium and stroma. The intracellular localization of SnoN did not alter significantly in tumor samples, but its expression is downregulated in all four types of tumor epithelia at lower malignant grades, but gradually recovered in higher grade tumors and markedly upregulated in the stroma of esophageal and ovarian cancer tissues. These results suggest that SnoN expression may vary at different stages of tumor progression and that SnoN may play different roles at different stages of malignancy. In particular, the initial downregulation of SnoN in the tumor epithelium is consistent with its anti-tumorigenic activity. The later upregulation of SnoN in the stroma microenvironment in esophageal and ovarian cancers suggests that it may play a role in promoting tumorigenesis in an indirect manner. Thus, the pro-oncogenic activity of SnoN in human cancer may be non-tumor cell autonomous and through affecting the tumor microenvironment.</p><p>Our results differ somewhat from those published previously, in particularly those that reported an increase in SnoN levels in cancer tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Zhang1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Imoto1">[16]</xref>. Although the reason for this difference is not known at this time, several possible causes could be speculated. First, the difference could potentially be due to the variations among different samples. Indeed we found that even normal breast tissue samples from different individuals showed a certain level of heterogeneity in term of SnoN levels, possibly due to the different conditions (tissue damage, stress, etc) or treatment procedures that the tissues have experienced. It is therefore quite possible that some cancer samples may also show variations in SnoN levels as a result of the diverse and complex tissue environment under which the tumors develop. However, the overall trend in all four cancer types with over hundreds of tumor samples in our hands is a consistent reduction of SnoN in the tumor epithelium. The level of SnoN may also change depending on the malignant stages of tumors and vary from tissue to tissue. While in esophageal and ovarian cancer, SnoN is downregulated in low grades adenocarcinoma but again elevated in grade III tumors, grade III breast cancer did not show any elevation even when compared to low grade tumors. Similarly, while high SnoN expression is found in stroma of high grade esophageal and ovarian cancer, pancreatic and breast cancer did not show a strong elevation in stroma SnoN expression. Thus, SnoN may play different roles in the progression of different cancer types and possibly through different mechanisms. Another reason may be related to the methods used to measure SnoN expression. Since SnoN expression is upreguated in the stroma while decreased in the tumor epithelium, it is possible that by measuring overall SnoN levels by western blotting, one might detect an increase in the overall expression of SnoN. Finally, the difference could be due to the different antibodies used in the staining. The commercial anti-SnoN antibodies commonly used before showed a high background and sometimes detected nonspecific signals in our hands (data not shown). The anti-SnoN C-terminal peptide antibody has been carefully characterized, and antigen competition experiments demonstrated the specificity for the SnoN signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055794-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Jahchan2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Krakowski1">[12]</xref>. Moreover, using this antibody, we have detected dynamic changes in SnoN expression during normal tissue morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Jahchan2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Krakowski1">[12]</xref> and malignant progression, providing additional support that the signals we detect are specific.</p><p>Our study has revealed a previously unappreciated role of SnoN in the tumor microenvironment. Especially in esophageal and ovarian tissues, multiple stromal cell types showed high levels of SnoN expression, including smooth muscle cells, blood cells, fibroblasts and infiltrating lymphocytes. Interestingly, the cancers of esophagus and ovary tend to harbor 3q26 amplification and show SnoN copy number increases, and they also display a stronger increase in stroma SnoN levels. Thus, the high SnoN expression in the stroma may be related to gene amplification, and this in turn may enhance malignant progression in these tissues. More and more studies have indicated that tumor-associated stromal cells and infiltrating lymphocytes promote epithelial tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis, and cancer inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-McAllister1">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Kenny1">[27]</xref>. In addition, infiltrating B- and T-cell lymphocytes can regulate solid tumor development through their abilities to regulate myeloid cell function in solid tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-DeNardo1">[28]</xref>. Interestingly, TGF-&#x003b2; is a well-known regulator of the tumor microenvironment by modulating the proliferation of fibroblasts, secretion of chemokines and cyokines that control inflammation, recruitment of bone-marrow-derived myeloid cells and host immunosurveillance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Bierie1">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Yang1">[31]</xref>. As a negative regulator of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, it is conceivable that SnoN may also modulate the tumor microenvironment and tumor-host interaction. Our results clearly indicate that this is an important area to focus on in future studies.</p><p>High levels of SnoN have been shown to directly stabilize and activate p53. Thus, tissues or cells that show elevated SnoN expression (either due to gene amplification or other means) may cease proliferation due to p53-mediated senescence or cell cycle arrest. Malignant cells have to overcome this barrier in order to maintain their survival and expansion and may do so by either inactivating/deleting SnoN itself or any downstream steps in the SnoN-p53 pathway. Indeed, our analysis of CLE cell lines has indicated a significant correlation between increased SnoN copy number and p53 inactivation, supporting the idea that the tumor suppressive SnoN-p53 pathway must be inactivated to allow malignant progression. A previous study of human breast cancer tissue samples also note a correlation between SnoN upregulation and elevated p53 expression, which is indicative of inativating mutation of p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0055794-Zhang1">[13]</xref>. However, in human cancer tissue samples that we have tested, no correlation between SnoN expression and p53 status can be detected. This is not entirely surprising given that these tumor tissues have already downregulated SnoN expression and therefore had no pressing need for additionally inactivating p53.</p><p>In summary, we have found that SnoN is expressed in both epithelial and stromal cells in normal human esophageal, ovarian, pancreatic and breast tissues. Unlike what has been depicted in the current models, SnoN expression is downregulated at the protein level in the tumor epithelium in low grade tumors in all four tissues, consistent with its anti-tumorigenic activity. In contrast, SnoN expression is markedly upregulated in tumor stroma in some cancer types, especially at late stages of malignancy. Giving the importance of tumor stroma in influencing malignant progression, this result promopted us to speculate that SnoN may also regulate tumorigenesis through modulating tumor microenvironment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs.
