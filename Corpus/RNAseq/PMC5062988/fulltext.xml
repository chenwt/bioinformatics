Both enzymes were reported recently to participate in piRNA biogenesis in silkworm and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, respectively. To get insights on the role of mammalian PNLDC1, we characterized the human and mouse enzymes. PNLDC1 shows limited conservation compared to PARN and represents an evolutionary related but distinct group of enzymes. It is expressed specifically in mouse embryonic stem cells, human and mouse testes and during early mouse embryo development, while it fades during differentiation. Its expression in differentiated cells, is suppressed through methylation of its promoter by the <italic>de novo</italic> methyltransferase DNMT3B. Both enzymes are localized mainly in the ER and exhibit <italic>in vitro</italic> specificity restricted solely to 3&#x02032; RNA or DNA polyadenylates. Knockdown of <italic>Pnldc1</italic> in mESCs and subsequent NGS analysis showed that although the expression of the remaining deadenylases remains unaffected, it affects genes involved mainly in reprogramming, cell cycle and translational regulation. Mammalian PNLDC1 is a novel deadenylase expressed specifically in cell types which share regulatory mechanisms required for multipotency maintenance. Moreover, it could be involved both in posttranscriptional regulation through deadenylation and genome surveillance during early development.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>14 October 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Deadenylases represent a diverse group of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonucleases, found in all eukaryotes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Their main role is the shortening of 3&#x02032; poly(A) tails, which is the first step during mRNA decay, thus regulating the translational rates (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Their discovery was based on early observations showing that maternal mRNAs stability, controlled expression and clearance, was important during early development (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Two deadenylase superfamilies (termed EEP and DEDD) exist, with several members each, and three major deadenylase activities, the CCR4&#x02013;NOT (Carbon Catabolite Repressor 4 &#x02013; Negative on TATA) complex, the poly (A) nuclease (PAN) complex and the poly(A) specific ribonuclease-PARN have been widely studied (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In many cases, interactions of specific RNA-binding proteins with several <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements on mRNAs or miRNA-mediated targeting, trigger recruitment of deadenylases and ensure specificity (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). As a result, different combinations of interactions can either modulate deadenylase activity or can recruit deadenylase complexes for mRNA decay (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The conservation of deadenylases varies among species and attempts to clarify the role of each member in several model organisms concluded that PAN and CNOT complexes are the major deadenylases responsible for mammalian cytoplasmic mRNA decay (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). On the other hand, PARN seems to have a more specific role in regulating discrete subsets of mRNAs and it was shown to have additional exonuclease activity beyond mRNA deadenylation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). It is known that PARN catalyses the miRNA-mediated TP53 degradation and participates in the biogenesis of several non-coding RNAs, like snoRNAs, scaRNAs, miRNAs and the telomerase RNA moiety (TERC) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Most recently, PARN was reported as the enzyme which catalyses the 3&#x02032; pre-piRNA trimming in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In the same report, the recombinant PARN-1 was characterized <italic>in vitro</italic> as a 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; exonuclease, as <italic>C. elegans</italic> has two genes for PARN (PARN-1 and -2) which, however, can both be severely knocked down without any obvious phenotype (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The unexpected role of PARN beyond mRNA deadenylation, indicates that is evolved most likely to control specific mRNA functions required for specific events during early development, such as the meiotic process in oocyte maturation or plant embryogenesis (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Several homologous genes encoding putative deadenylases exist with elusive biological role (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). A new group of genes is represented by <italic>PNLDC1</italic> [poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN)-like domain containing 1 or PARN-like], a PARN homologue. <italic>PNLDC1</italic> genes are detected in lower eukaryotes (i.e. <italic>Cnidaria</italic>) and co-exist with PARN in almost all amniotic vertebrates and in arthropods, including silkworm (<italic>B. mori</italic>). Interestingly, it is absent from model organisms like <italic>S. pombe</italic> (replaced possibly by Triman), <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (replaced possibly by Nibbler) and <italic>C. elegans</italic> that expresses PARN-1 and PARN-2 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Interestingly, the activity responsible for 3&#x02032; pre-piRNA trimming in silkworm (<italic>B. mori</italic>), termed Trimmer, was attributed to PNLDC1 in a recent report (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Trimmer depends on the presence of Papi for the piRNA maturation that takes place on the mitochondrial surface. In the same report, the authors conclude that PNLDC1 is Trimmer after knocking down each of the nucleases, but no further biochemical or imaging characterization was reported (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we report the characterization of the human and mouse PNLDC1 in an effort to get insights on the properties and role of the enzyme in mammals. We show that PNLDC1 has 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; exonuclease <italic>in vitro</italic> activity and substrate specificity restricted only to DNA or RNA polyadenylates. Interestingly, attempts to detect PNLDC1 in various cells lines and tissues revealed specific expression in embryonic stem cells and testes. In addition, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence experiments and imaging analysis verified exclusive localization of PNLDC1 in the cytoplasm of stem and spermatogenic cells. The expression of PNLDC1 gradually diminishes during early mouse embryo development and is epigenetically suppressed during mESCs differentiation. Previous high-throughput analyses have suggested that PNLDC1 promoter region is target for methylation by the <italic>de novo</italic> methyltransferase DNMT3B (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Treatment of HEK 293 cultures with 5-AZA-CdR, a specific methyltransferase inhibitor, restored <italic>PNLDC1</italic> expression. Knockdown of <italic>Pnldc1</italic> did not affect the expression of the major known deadenylases, including PARN, an observation that supports the previously reported functional individuality of deadenylases (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Subsequent NGS and functional enrichment analysis indicated genes involved mainly in epigenetic reprogramming, chromatin assembly and regulation of cell cycle and translation. Based on the results presented and the notion that stem cells and germline must share common mechanisms to maintain multipotency, we propose that PNLDC1 could play role in both genome integrity maintenance and posttranscriptional regulation and surveillance, considering the recent discovery of polyadenylated piRNAs in mammalian early embryos (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cloning, expression and purification of recombinant proteins</title><p>Nucleotide sequences of both human isoforms and mouse PNLDC1 were obtained from NCBI nucleotide database (NM_001271862.1 NM_173516.2 and NM_001034866.1, respectively).

For the cloning procedure specific primers bearing <italic>Nde</italic>I and <italic>BamH</italic>I restriction sites were used (Supplementary Table S1). PCR products were cloned in all cases in pET28b plasmid for heterologous expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) strains (Novagen).

The strains with the recombinant plasmids were used to inoculate initially 5 ml of Luria&#x02013;Bertani medium supplemented with 50 &#x003bc;g/ml kanamycin and grew overnight at 37&#x000b0;C. The cultures were diluted (1:100) in the same medium and grown until an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4&#x02013;0.6. The optimal expression of soluble His<sub>6</sub>-tagged HsPNLDC1 recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG and growth at room temperature, overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 9000 <italic>xg</italic>, disrupted by sonication and the extract was further centrifuged at 100 000 <italic>xg</italic>. The soluble protein fraction was analysed on an SDS&#x02013;PAGE. Both human and mouse His<sub>6</sub>-tagged PNLDC1 enzymes were purified with affinity chromatography using a 5 ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). To improve the purity of the recombinant proteins, 20 mM imidazole was added to the wash solution to eliminate non-specific binding of the bacterial proteins. Optimal soluble protein elution was obtained between 120&#x02013;150 mM imidazole after applying a step gradient (50&#x02013;250 mM imidazole). Further purification was achieved through size exclusion of contaminant proteins on a 16/40 Sephacryl S200 High Resolution gel filtration column attached to an &#x000c4;KTA P&#x02013;500 FPLC. The elution was isocratic in the presence of 20 mM HEPES&#x02013;KOH, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol.

A survey for the the detection of either PNLDC1 or PARN showed that either one is present in very low metazoa (i.e. PARN in <italic>Placozoa</italic> and PNLDC1 in <italic>Cnidaria</italic>) and both of them are present in arthropods (including <italic>B. mori</italic>) and mainly in amniotic vertebrates. A phylogenetic tree produced based on an extensive sequence alignment and using the <italic>Trichoplax adhaerens</italic> PARN as root, shows that both enzymes have a common ancestor, but the bootstrap values indicate an early separation (Supplementary Figure S2 red dots). PNLDC1 enzymes from higher eukaryotes form an evolutionary distinct group from that of PARN (Supplementary Figure S2 red and blue box, respectively). A separate group is also formed by the PNLDC1 from arthropods (Supplementary Figure S2 green box). Interestingly, <italic>C. elegans</italic> PARN-1 and PARN-2 cluster with the clade that gave rise to PNLDC1 in higher eukaryotes, but form a separate group.</p><p>Further bioinformatics analysis predicted that HsPNLDC1 produces two isoforms by alternative splicing of the full length transcript that contains 19 exons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The peptide residues 1&#x02013;25 (MDVGADEFEESLPLLQELVQEADFV) of isoform 1 are replaced by the peptide residues 1&#x02013;14 (MFCTRGLLFFAFLA) in isoform 2 (according to the NCBI annotation). The sequences of isoform 1 (termed PNLDC1-1, 531 aa, average MW 61.3 KDa) and isoform 2 (termed PNLDC1-2, 520 aa, average MW 60.1 KDa,) exhibit 21.4% and 20.6% identity with human PARN, respectively. Mouse PNLDC1 has one predicted isoform (531 aa, average MW 61.3 KDa) with 22.2% sequence identity to mouse PARN (Supplementary Figure S1). As inferred from the X-ray crystal structures of HsPARN and MmPARN (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), the corresponding nuclease domain of HsPNLDC1 residues 1&#x02013;142 and 243&#x02013;414 displays sequence identity of 31% (98/314 residues) and only two 4-residue gaps (&#x0003c;4% total gaps) with respect to HsPARN (Supplementary Figure S3). Therefore, a homology model of HsPNLDC1 nuclease domain homodimer was generated, refined and examined with molecular dynamics simulations (see Supplementary Data and Figures S4&#x02013;S7 for details). Comparative interface analysis of the crystallographic HsPARN dimer and the model of HsPNLDC1 nuclease domain exhibited similar characteristic properties (Supplementary Table S3), suggesting that HsPNLDC1 can probably form homodimers. Examination of the RNA-binding sites of HsPNLDC1 and HsPARN revealed similarities in the spatial arrangement of the catalytic DEDDh-motif and other RNA-interacting residues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). However, a number of non-conserved residues that potentially interact with the substrate might be responsible for a different selectivity profile of HsPNLDC1 with respect to HsPARN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and Supplementary Figure S8). It is also worth mentioning that the N-terminal residues 1&#x02013;18 of HsPNLDC1 (isoform 2) form a putative signal peptide, indicating possible localization of HsPNLDC1 to the ER.</p><p>Recombinant human and mouse enzymes were isolated after heterologous expression and optimization of the expression conditions, from <italic>E. coli</italic> soluble fractions (Supplementary Figure S9A). Initial purification schemes included affinity and gel filtration chromatography. The elution profiles after gel filtration chromatography were consistent with a dimeric form of PNLDC1 (Supplementary Figure S9B). Unfortunately, from the 3 commercially available antibodies that were tested using immunoblotting, only one could detect the overexpressed His<sub>6</sub>-tagged recombinant enzymes but not the native forms of the enzyme (Supplementary Figure S9A) and a different one was suitable for the detection of both native human and mouse enzymes in immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">E</xref>). Dynamic light scattering analysis yielded a HsPNLDC1 hydrodynamic diameter of about 10.1 nm and a calculated molecular weight of about 150 kDa (Supplementary Figure S9E), verifying that the dimeric form of the protein is the prevalent species in solution (monomer MW 62 kDa). Preliminary assays and time plots in the presence of either human or mouse PNLDC1 showed similar activity profiles, using as substrate a synthetic 24-mer RNA molecule bearing 3 codons and a 15-mer poly(A) tail. The optimal reaction conditions were pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 37&#x000b0;C and, as expected, PNLDC1 activity was observed only in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (Supplementary Figure S9C). HsPNLDC1-1 had better purification yields after two purification steps and was used for further characterization together with the mouse enzyme. Both enzymes exhibited specific deadenylation activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, with very high specificity for recognition of poly(A) or poly(dA) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Interestingly, PNLDC1 enzymes cannot hydrolyse substrates that are not polyadenylated, a striking difference compared to PARN enzymes, which can additionally degrade quite efficiently poly(U) and to some extent other polymer substrates (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). To test whether PNLDC1 could use RNA substrates with more complex secondary structures, we used as substrate a pre-tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> (Supplementary Figure S9D). Under optimum conditions tested, PNLDC1 didn't show any activity on tRNA neither could trim its 3&#x02032; trailer sequence (Supplementary Figure S9D). Therefore, we concluded that the <italic>in vitro</italic> PNLDC1 substrate recognition and activity is restricted solely to single-stranded RNA or DNA polyadenylates. Next, we determined the kinetic values for both enzymes that were found similar, both in affinity and turnover rates (Supplementary Table S2). Mammalian PNLDC1 degrades poly(A) in a processive mode, as can be judged by the time course progress of the reaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Finally, when we used a 5&#x02032;cap analogue in a broad range of concentrations we couldn't observe any modulation of PNLDC1 activity. The 5&#x02032; cap structure has been reported to stimulate PARN activity even when supplied <italic>in trans</italic> as an allosteric regulator in low concentrations and as an inhibitor in higher concentrations (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Both human and mouse PNLDC1 lack at least one of the conserved residues of PARN (W468 and W475 in mouse and human PARN, respectively) responsible for stabilization of m7G interaction with the RRM domain, which is only partially represented in PNLDC1 sequence. This observation supports further the absence of cap-binding ability of mammalian PNLDC1 (Supplementary Figures S1 and S3).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>PNLDC1 is localized predominantly in the ER</title><p>In a next step, we transfected HEK 293 cells with either human (both isoforms) or mouse PNLDC1-EGFP recombinant proteins to monitor their subcellular localization. The EGFP tagged the respective C-termini to avoid background signals from random sorting. Both human isoforms, as well as the mouse enzyme are localized exclusively outside the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Initial observations and subsequent quantification and calculation of the Mander's co-localization coefficient value indicated significant ER distribution and subsequent co-localization experiments were performed with the mTurquoise2 protein tagged with an ER sorting peptide signal. The confocal microscopy analysis in transfected HEK 293 cells showed that PNLDC1 is localized mainly in the ER (&#x0223c;80%), with a certain degree of diffusion in the cytoplasm (&#x0223c;20%). In addition, PNLDC1 does not shown any specific co-localization on the mitochondrial surface when transfected in HEK 293 cells (Supplementary Figure S10). However, the possibility that a portion of the protein could also be associated to the mitochondrial surface through interactions with partner proteins (as has been suggested for BmPNLDC1) cannot be excluded. The co-localization results clearly show that PNLDC1 is a deadenylase that is excluded from the nucleus and most likely, its function occurs mainly in the ER. This result distinguishes PNLDC1 from PARN that has been reported to shuffle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, using similar methodology (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). During the analysis, both human recombinant isoforms were localized within the same context and intensity, an observation that requires further investigation in order to clarify possible intracellular specific roles. As for the endogenous enzymes, they most likely exhibit similar localization pattern, since PNLDC1 is absent from many cell lines and the antibody specificity that was used for immunohistochemical and fluorescence analysis cannot discriminate between the two isoforms. Therefore, which human isoform is dominating (either in a cell-specific or a tissue-specific manner), remains an open question.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Confocal fluorescence microscopy images showing the subcellular localization of EGFP (control), HsPNLDC1-1-EGFP, HsPNLDC1-2-EGFP and MmPNLDC1-EGFP in comparison with the localization of the ER targeted protein mTurquoise-ER in transfected HEK 293 cells.

This result prompted us to look for possible epigenetic control of <italic>PNLDC1</italic> expression that could explain its apparent absence in differentiated cells. A closer examination of the promoter region of <italic>PNLDC1</italic> revealed a 34 bp CpG island that is potential target of DNMT3B and thus, demethylation could induce the expression of PNLDC1. Therefore, we treated HEK 293 cells with 5-AZA-CdR, a compound that inhibits DNA methylation and has been studied as potent inhibitor of DNMT3B (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).

Interestingly, during the induction of <italic>PNLDC1</italic> expression, the expression of <italic>PARN</italic> remained unaffected, an observation that indicates lack of expression synchronization or feedback correlation between the two deadenylases.

After screening of several mouse tissues using RT-qPCR, <italic>Pnldc1</italic> was found highly expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (E14) and testes, whereas expression in skin, late embryos and ovaries was almost undetectable (albeit slightly higher in ovaries than other organs) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). This result indicates that Pnldc1 is present in early mouse development and in a next step, we examined for a detectable similar expression pattern during early embryo development. After we examined mouse embryos at different developmental time points (6.5, 10.5 and 15.5 days), we observed that <italic>Pnldc1</italic> although present very early shows a gradual and significant reduction of relative expression, compared to the expression in mESCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> inset). This behaviour could be more likely attributed to epigenetic reprogramming that takes place during early development in association with various RNA binding proteins and might be related to the regulation of transition from pluripotency to multipotency (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In addition, the presence of PNLDC1 at the protein level was verified by immunofluorescence in mESCs and mouse testes and by immunohistochemistry analysis in human testes. Histological analysis of sections obtained from human testes with intratubular germ cell neoplasia unveiled that HsPNLDC1 was strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of the spermatogenic tumor cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Intratubular germ cells neoplasia is characterized by the presence of neoplastic cells which show some degree of immaturity that is characteristic of undifferentiated cell state. This type of neoplasia is a pre-malignant condition that under specific circumstances can progress to fully developed cancer. Therefore, HsPNLDC1 upregulation is expected due to undifferentiated-pluripotent state of the neoplastic cells in the examined tissue sections. Notably, mature fibromyocytes that surround the seminiferous tubules were devoid of PNLDC1 immunoreactivity. Immunofluorescence analysis in mouse testes revealed that PNLDC1 is highly expressed in meiotic spermatocytes showing a perinuclear granular pattern (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). The presence of PNLDC1 in mESCs was also verified by immunofluorescence and found again in the cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>).</p><p>To obtain further information, we examined the <italic>Pnldc1</italic> expression pattern during mESCs differentiation after, either withdrawal of LIF or under conditions which induce differentiation to neuronal cells.

After <italic>Pnldc1</italic> silencing, we monitored the expression of all the major dedadenylases <italic>via</italic> RT-qPCR. In addition, cDNA libraries prepared from total RNA from the same experiment (before and after knockdown) were used for NGS analysis.

As was initially observed for PARN, the expression profile of all major deadenylases is independent from the expression of <italic>Pnldc1</italic>, an observation that supports our results for specific spatial and temporal expression of PNLDC1. Finally, after the NGS analysis the functional enrichment of genes with statistical significant change of their expression showed that <italic>Pnldc1</italic> silencing affects mainly the expression of genes that participate in the epigenetic reprogramming, chromatin assembly and organization and regulation of cell cycle and translation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, Supplementary Figure S12). In addition, to the genes that encode important proteins including several histones, Trim proteins, ribosomal proteins, translation initiation factors and Poly(A) binding protein (PABP), few important non-coding RNAs were also found upregulated, such as the RNA subunits of telomerase (TERC), RNAse P and RNAse MRP and the long non-coding RNA DANCR (Supplementary Table S7).

There is plenty of evidence suggesting that among deadenylases, PARN is mainly responsible for the decay of specific mRNA subsets as well as the biogenesis of several non-coding RNAs (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This is elaborated by the existence of several regulatory elements and protein interactions that regulate PARN's activity and fine-tune its specificity (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). It is also supportive of the general notion that many more deadenylases must exist which, either as individual enzymes or as part of larger complexes may participate simultaneously in different networks or cellular events, exhibiting temporal and spatial expression across tissues and cell types. Hence, most likely depending on the organism, deadenylases could acquire roles in a genome-dependent, tissue-dependent or cell-type dependent context (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>PNLDC1 represents a new entry in the DEDD exonuclease superfamily. Given the simultaneous presence of PNLDC1 together with PARN in all higher eukaryotes, we characterized the human and mouse enzymes in an effort to get insights on its possible role in mammals. PNLDC1 is evolutionarily distant from PARN and a PARN gene duplication event has been proposed to explain its existence (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Mammalian PNLDC1 is a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exonuclease that degrades substrates in a processive mode. The reaction kinetic parameters between the human and mouse enzymes are comparable and similar to other deadenylases. Although PNLDC1 shows low similarity of the corresponding characteristic PARN-type RRM motif, and despite the absence of many residues that contact the 5&#x02032; cap of mRNAs in PARN, it exhibits narrow specificity which is restricted only to RNA or DNA polyadenylates, under the <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions tested (Supplementary Figure S1, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">E</xref>). The molecular dynamics simulation of the putative active site of PNLDC1 also supports our observations at the structural level. Whether this is the case also <italic>in vivo</italic>, remains a question for further studies. Therefore, it seems that at least <italic>in vitro</italic>, PNLDC1 is a more poly(A) specific deadenylase than PARN.</p><p>Another interesting feature of PNLDC1 comes from the observation that it is exclusively localized in the cytoplasm. PARN on the other hand, shuffles between nucleus (found in the cytoplasm, the nucleolus and Cajal bodies) and cytoplasm (as part of RNA granule containing exosome). Recently, both PARN and PNLDC1 were reported to provide the elusive 3&#x02032; pre-piRNA trimming activities in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>B. mori</italic>, respectively (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Based on previous annotated enrichment of PNLDC1 in mouse testes in relevant databases, both reports implied that MmPNLDC1 could be the elusive trimmer in the mammalian piRNA pathway (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Our data confirm the expression of Pnldc1 in testes and more specifically in meiotic spermatocytes where the pachytene piRNAs are in their peak during spermatogenesis. It has been reported that <italic>Bm</italic>PNLDC1 in association with PAPI is anchored on the mitochondrial surface, where piRNAs trimming takes place. In the case of the mammalian PNLDC1 a putative transmembrane domain (residues 506&#x02013;525 in HsPNLDC1) could facilitate such an anchoring with the help of partner proteins. In the same report, co-expression of MmPNLDC1 with the MmTdrkh (a Papi homologue) can reconstitute pre-piRNA trimming activity in 293T cell extracts (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, previous studies reporting immunoprecipitation of TDRKH, MIWI and MILI, from mouse testes and subsequent proteomics analysis failed to identify PNLDC1 as a binding partner (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Therefore, based on previous reports and our results, a possible role of PNLDC1 in mammalian piRNA biogenesis, although strongly suggested, awaits further verification. Finally, the localization of the protein may also be facilitated either by other interactions or by substrate abundance as has been described for PARN that can accumulate in cellular compartments with high substrate concentration by self-association (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p>The most interesting finding of this study is that <italic>Pnldc1</italic> is expressed only early in development and upon differentiation, the expression gradually diminishes as a result of epigenetic events. In HEK 293 cells, PNLDC1 was detected only upon treatment with 5-AZA-CdR (5-Aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine, decitabine) and correlated with the expression of DNMT3B methyltransferase which is essential for <italic>de novo</italic> methylation during mammalian development and responsible for gene silencing in human cancer cells (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).

This is the first report of a deadenylase expression regulated through epigenetic silencing. It is important to note that additional experimentation following mESCs differentiation, under two different conditions (LIF withdrawal, or neuronal differentiation), showed the same correlation. The gradual silencing of <italic>Pnldc1</italic> expression coincides with an increase in <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> expression and underlines the possible involvement of this synchronization in the transition from pluripotency to multipotency.</p><p>The fact that PNLDC1 was found specifically expressed in mESCs and human and mouse testes, was also an interesting observation. As described previously, deadenylases regulate cell's fate in early development where the dynamics of maintenance and clearance of maternal mRNAs, can either maintain multipotency and self-renewal or induce differentiation. Something similar has been shown for the CCR4-NOT complex that is involved in maternal mRNA deadenylation and decay by the piRNA pathway in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. In addition, it exhibits a distinct expression pattern during neural development and contributes to generation of induced pluripotent stem cells in mice (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Moreover, during late spermatogenesis, pachytene piRNAs derived from non-transposon intergenic regions in pachytene spermatocytes (where PNLDC1 is highly expressed) mediate a synchronized massive degradation of mRNAs through a piRNA-induced silencing complex (pi-RISC) and recruitment of CAF1 deadenylase, in a process similar to that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). For this purpose, pachytene piRNA-guided MIWI-CAF1 complexes (and possibly additional protein partners) are selectively assembled in elongating spermatids to mediate mRNA deadenylation and decay <italic>via</italic> a mechanism that resembles the action of miRNAs in somatic cells (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The recent identification of 3&#x02032; polyadenylated piRNAs in mammalian early embryos (where PNLDC1 is also present) and the very rapid developmental adaptation due to changes in poly(A)-tail length could also involve PNLDC1 in mechanisms similar to that of pachytene piRNA induced silencing (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>).</p><p>The effective knockdown of <italic>Pnldc1</italic> in mESCs did not affect the expression of the remaining deadenylases, with the exception of a moderate upregulation observed for <italic>Cnot6l</italic>. The fact that <italic>Pnldc1</italic> is specifically expressed in pluripotent cell types (or cells that retain their pluripotency to some point) points towards a specific role in common mechanisms shared by both stem and germ cells. In the same line, our immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PNLDC1 is detected in the cytoplasm of human neoplastic spermatogenic cells (deriving from surgically removed testes of patients with intraepithelial germ cell neoplasia) which are less differentiated. The possible involvement of PNLDC1 in early development through regulation of transcripts that are important for re-programming and translational regulation is also evident from the functional enrichment analysis that followed NGS experiments. The genes that are affected participate predominantly in chromatin assembly and regulation of translation and cell cycle. In accordance to the previous, the enriched molecular functions included genes with role in DNA-dependent ATPase activity and histone, rRNA, single strand DNA, mRNA and poly(A) binding. It is also noteworthy that some snoRNAs known to guide 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl modifications in rRNA, the RNA component of telomerase, the RNA subunit of RNase P and MRP and the long non-coding DANCR RNA are also found significantly upregulated. Although these observations require further investigation, they consist a strong indication of the central role of PNLDC1, beyond mRNA decay at least in some (if not all) of the above pathways. It is interesting to note that previous reports showed that DANCR RNA increases stemness in association with CTNNB1 (&#x003b2;-catenin) which in turn, through the &#x003b2;-catenin-dependent WNT signalling pathway regulates several diverse cell behaviours, including cell fate, proliferation and differentiation (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Finally, the modulation of PNLDC1 activity by RNA structural elements and/or binding proteins, as has been suggested for PARN, cannot be excluded. Overall, it seems that PNLDC1 has distinct and independent intracellular activity and moreover, it affects the expression of pathways that are mainly involved in multipotency maintenance, genome surveillance and re-programming in early development.</p></sec><sec id="SEC5"><title>ACCESSION NUMBERS</title><p>Raw sequencing and summarised data are available in the GEO repository with accession number GSE83405.</p></sec>
