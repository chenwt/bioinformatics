These consistent metabolic alterations are associated with normoxic stabilization of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs)<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, secondary to <italic>von hippel-lindau</italic> (<italic>VHL</italic>) mutations that occur in over 90% of ccRCC tumours<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. However, kidney-specific <italic>VHL</italic> deletion in mice fails to elicit ccRCC-specific metabolic phenotypes and tumour formation<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, suggesting that additional mechanisms are essential. Recent large-scale sequencing analyses revealed loss of several chromatin remodelling enzymes in a subset of ccRCC (<italic>polybromo 1</italic> [<italic>PBRM1</italic>] ~40%, <italic>SET domain containing 2</italic> [<italic>SETD2</italic>] ~15%, <italic>BRCA1 associated protein-1</italic> [<italic>BAP1</italic>] ~15%, etc.)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, indicating that epigenetic perturbations are likely important contributors to the natural history of this disease. Here we utilized an integrative approach comprising pan-metabolomic profiling and metabolic gene set analysis, and determined that the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> is uniformly depleted in over six hundred ccRCC tumours examined. Importantly, the human <italic>FBP1</italic> locus resides on chromosome 9q22, whose loss is associated with poor prognosis for ccRCC patients<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Our data further indicate that FBP1 inhibits ccRCC progression through two distinct mechanisms: 1) FBP1 antagonizes glycolytic flux in renal tubular epithelial cells, the presumptive ccRCC cell of origin<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, thereby inhibiting a potential &#x0201c;Warburg effect&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, and 2) in pVHL-deficient ccRCC cells, FBP1 restrains cell proliferation, glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathway in a catalytic activity-independent manner, by inhibiting nuclear HIF function via direct interaction with the HIF &#x0201c;inhibitory domain&#x0201d;. This unique dual function of the FBP1 protein explains its ubiquitous loss in ccRCC, distinguishing FBP1 from previously-identified tumour suppressors (<italic>PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1</italic>, etc.) which are not consistently mutated in all tumours<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">We performed pan-metabolomic analysis (<bold>Methods</bold>) on 20 primary human ccRCC tumours and matching normal kidney tissues. Levels of metabolites involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glucose-related sugar metabolism were highly elevated in tumours, suggesting that reprogramming of glucose metabolism is critical for ccRCC progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Furthermore, metabolic gene set analysis<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> on TCGA ccRCC RNAseq data indicated that the &#x0201c;carbohydrate storage&#x0201d; group was the most significantly underexpressed gene set in ccRCC tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), including three genes controlling renal gluconeogenesis<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> (<italic>glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic subunit</italic> [<italic>G6PC</italic>], <italic>phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1</italic> [<italic>PCK1</italic>], and <italic>fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase 1</italic> [<italic>FBP1</italic>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b&#x02013;c</xref>). Elevated HIF activity in ccRCC tumours stimulates aerobic glycolysis by increasing the expression of glycolytic genes, including <italic>phosphoglycerate kinase 1</italic> (<italic>PGK1</italic>) and <italic>lactate dehydrogenase A</italic> (<italic>LDHA</italic>), and shunting glycolytic flux away from the TCA cycle by activating <italic>pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1</italic> (<italic>PDK1</italic>)<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. However, our integrative analyses identified suppression of gluconeogenesis as an additional component of glucose regulation in ccRCCs. Next, we determined that the rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzyme FBP1 was inhibited at the level of protein accumulation in almost 100% of ccRCC tumours examined (n&#x0003e;200, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a&#x02013;c</xref>) compared to normal kidney tissue. Similar results were observed for hepatocellular carcinomas and normal liver tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2d&#x02013;e</xref>). FBP1 inhibition is not mediated by ccRCC-associated HIF activation, because HIF1&#x003b1; ablation failed to de-repress FBP1 expression in RCC4 ccRCC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2f</xref>). Moreover, HK-2 proximal tubule cells (from which ccRCCs appear to be derived<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>) exhibited HIF1&#x003b1;-dependent induction of FBP1 under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2g&#x02013;h</xref>). Compared to FBP1, the other two gluconeogenic enzymes G6PC and PCK1 were either modestly suppressed (G6PC), or exhibited no consistent change (PCK1) in ccRCC tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a&#x02013;b</xref>). Interestingly, the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase (liver type, PFKL), which functionally antagonizes FBP1 in glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>), was expressed at equal levels in ccRCC and normal kidney tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>). In addition, lower <italic>FBP1</italic> expression correlates significantly with advanced tumour stage and worse patient prognosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c&#x02013;d</xref>), whereas <italic>PFKL</italic> expression does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3d&#x02013;e</xref>), suggesting that FBP1 may harbour novel, non-enzymatic function(s).</p><p id="P3">To investigate functional roles for FBP1 in ccRCC progression, we ectopically expressed FBP1 in 786-O ccRCC tumour cells to levels observed in HK-2 proximal tubule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). FBP1 expression significantly inhibited 2D culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), anchorage-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>), and xenograft tumour growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). Similarly, enforced FBP1 expression inhibited growth of RCC10 and 769-P ccRCC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4d&#x02013;e</xref>), and A549 lung cancer cells preferentially under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4f and 4g</xref>). These results demonstrated that FBP1 can suppress ccRCC and other tumour cell growth, an effect significantly pronounced when coupled with HIF activation. In HK-2 cells, FBP1 depletion, but not G6PC ablation or ectopic PFKL expression, was sufficient to promote HK-2 cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4h&#x02013;j</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Since FBP1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, we manipulated FBP1 expression in renal cells and measured glucose metabolism. FBP1 inhibition increased glucose uptake and lactate secretion in HK-2 cells cultured in 10 mM glucose, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), an effect augmented by lowering glucose levels to 1 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5a&#x02013;b</xref>). To assess glycolytic flux, we performed isotopomer distribution analysis using [1, 2-<sup>13</sup>C] glucose as the tracer, which produces glycolytic and TCA intermediates containing two <sup>13</sup>C atoms (M2 species), as well as corresponding M1 species from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). We observed elevated M2 enrichment of four TCA intermediates (malate, aspartate, glutamate, and citrate) in FBP1-depleted HK-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b&#x02013;c</xref>). In contrast, G6PC inhibition failed to promote glucose-lactate turnover (data not shown), suggesting that FBP1, but not G6PC, is a critical regulator of glucose metabolism in renal cells. Consistent with this result, ectopic FBP1 expression in a <italic>VHL</italic>-deficient ccRCC cell line (RCC10) reduced glucose uptake, lactate secretion, and glucose-derived TCA cycle intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d&#x02013;e</xref>). Reduced glucose-dependent TCA flux is known to increase anaplerotic glutamine flux<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, and we also observed elevated glutamine uptake and enrichment of glutamine-derived TCA cycle intermediates (M4 species) in [U-<sup>13</sup>C] glutamine-labelled RCC10 cells expressing FBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5d&#x02013;f</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Pan-metabolomic analyses of ccRCC tumours revealed a marked elevation of reduced glutathione (G-SH)<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5g</xref>). G-SH synthesis requires the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), generated primarily though the PPP in human cells<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). Consistent with increased PPP flux, ccRCC tumours display significant accumulation of G-SH and PPP-related metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5g</xref>), an effect partially recapitulated in FBP1-depleted HK-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5h&#x02013;j</xref>). Conversely, FBP1 re-expression in RCC10 cells significantly reduced NADPH levels and PPP flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5k&#x02013;l</xref>). Interestingly, FBP1-mediated changes in PPP flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5j and 5l</xref>) were comparable to the changes in glucose 6-phosphate (G6P; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5m&#x02013;n</xref>), the entry metabolite of PPP pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>), suggesting that FBP1 affects PPP flux primarily through regulating glycolysis. Surprisingly, the ability of FBP1 to reduce glycolysis and NADPH levels was completely abolished in RCC10VHL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d and 2f</xref>), where wild-type pVHL was introduced into RCC10 to exclude normoxic HIF expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5o</xref>), indicating that HIF proteins are required for FBP1-mediated effects on glucose metabolism in ccRCC tumour cells.</p><p id="P6">To investigate a mechanistic link between FBP1 expression and HIF activity, we employed two <italic>VHL</italic>-deficient ccRCC lines, RCC4 and RCC10, which express both HIF1&#x003b1; and HIF2&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). HIF1&#x003b1; and HIF2&#x003b1; are induced at different stages of ccRCC and play cooperating and contrasting roles in tumour progression<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. HIF1&#x003b1; and HIF2&#x003b1; function by binding hypoxia response elements (HREs) within target genes, including those modulating cellular metabolism<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Interestingly, ectopic FBP1 expression suppressed HIF activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and promoted oxygen consumption in RCC4 and RCC10 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6b&#x02013;c</xref>). Furthermore, FBP1 expression in RCC10 cells restored PDH activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6d&#x02013;f</xref>), which was otherwise inhibited by HIF1&#x003b1;<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Conversely, FBP1 ablation enhanced HIF activity in RCC10 cells, which express detectable levels of FBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). This inverse correlation between <italic>FBP1</italic> expression and HIF activity was recapitulated in primary ccRCC tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In contrast, <italic>G6PC</italic> expression did not correlate with HIF activity in ccRCC cells or tumour tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6g&#x02013;h</xref>). Interestingly, FBP1 also inhibited HIF activity in A549 lung cancer cells cultured at 0.5% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), demonstrating that this effect is not specific to renal cells. Moreover, FBP1 expression reduced canonical HIF target (<italic>PDK1, LDHA, glucose transporter 1</italic> [<italic>GLUT1</italic>, also known as <italic>SLC2A1</italic>], and <italic>vascular endothelial growth factor</italic> [<italic>VEGF</italic>]) mRNA levels in RCC4, RCC10, and hypoxic A549 cells, but not in normoxic RCC10VHL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6i&#x02013;k</xref>). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses indicated that FBP1 was enriched at the HREs of <italic>PDK1, LDHA, GLUT1</italic>, and <italic>VEGF</italic> promoters, but not in the non-hypoxia responsive <italic>ribosomal protein L13A</italic> (<italic>RPL13A</italic>) promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). ChIP-reChIP analyses revealed co-localization of HIF1&#x003b1; and FBP1 at these HREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>), suggesting that FBP1 directly inhibits HIF in the nucleus, a conclusion supported by cellular fractionation and immunofluorescent staining of primary human kidney tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7c&#x02013;d</xref>). Furthermore, a nucleus-excluded form of FBP1 (FBP1 NES) containing a potent nuclear export sequence<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> fused to the FBP1 C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7e</xref>) failed to inhibit HIF target gene expression as efficiently as wild-type FBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7f</xref>). Expression of FBP1 NES neither suppressed RCC10 cell growth nor altered glucose-lactate turnover, in contrast to wild-type FBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7g&#x02013;h</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrated that nuclear FBP1 is required for inhibiting HIF and glucose metabolism in <italic>VHL</italic>&#x02013;deficient ccRCC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7i</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To determine whether FBP1 enzymatic activity is required to inhibit HIF, we expressed a previously described, catalytically inactive FBP1 G260R mutant<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8a&#x02013;b</xref>) in RCC10 and 786-O cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8a and 8c</xref>). FBP1 G260R inhibited cell growth to a comparable level of wild-type FBP1 at 10 mM glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8d</xref>). FBP1 also inhibited glucose metabolism, NADPH production, and HIF target gene expression to the same extent of wild-type FBP1 in RCC10 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8e&#x02013;h</xref>). These results suggest that FBP1 interferes with HIF function through a catalytic activity-independent mechanism. In normoxic RCC10VHL cells (low HIF activity), the ability of the FBP1 G260R mutant to inhibit cell growth, glucose metabolism, NADPH production, and HIF target gene expression was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8c and 8i&#x02013;m</xref>), further confirming that FBP1 impacts ccRCC cell metabolism and growth by regulating HIF, independent of its enzymatic activity. Nevertheless, wild-type FBP1 suppressed RCC10 and 786-O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9a&#x02013;b</xref>) cell growth more potently than the G260R mutant under low glucose conditions, presumably because the enzymatic inhibition of glycolysis by wild-type FBP1 is more profound when glucose supply becomes limited.</p><p id="P8">To explore the molecular mechanism(s) whereby FBP1 inhibits HIF activity, we separated the FBP1 protein into an N-terminal regulatory (&#x0201c;R&#x0201d;) domain containing allosteric regulatory sites and a C-terminal (&#x0201c;C&#x0201d;) domain containing the catalytic site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Interestingly, ectopically expressing the FBP1 &#x0201c;R&#x0201d; domain in RCC10, RCC4, and 786-O cells was sufficient to inhibit HIF activity, whereas expressing the &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; domain was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9c&#x02013;d</xref>). As 786-O cells express HIF2&#x003b1; but not functional HIF1&#x003b1;<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, we conclude that FBP1 inhibits both HIF1&#x003b1; and HIF2&#x003b1;, presumably through a similar mechanism. To further map critical FBP1 regions for HIF recognition, we systematically deleted each exon from full-length FBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9e</xref>). All seven FBP1 truncations exhibited minimal catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9f</xref>), whereas only the N-terminal Exon 1 and Exon 2 truncations significantly lost their ability to inhibit HIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9g</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We further demonstrated the association of FBP1 and HIF1&#x003b1; by co-immunoprecipitating epitope-tagged and/or endogenous proteins from 293T or RCC10 cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9h&#x02013;i</xref>).

Pan-metabolomic analysis was performed on 20 primary ccRCC tumours and 20 adjacent normal kidney tissues (obtained from Cooperative Human Tissue Network) with the assistance of Metabolon. Specifically, sample preparation was carried out using the automated MicroLab STAR&#x000ae; system (Hamilton). Standards were added prior to the first extraction step for quality control purposes. Metabolite extracts were divided into two fractions; one fraction was analysed by a gas chromatography &#x02013; mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and the other by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Samples for GC-MS analysis were dried under vacuum desiccation for 24 hours prior to derivatization under nitrogen with bistrimethyl-silyl-triflouroacetamide (BSTFA) treatment. The GC column was 5% phenyl and the temperature ramp was from 40 to 300 &#x000b0;C in a 16-minute period. Samples were analysed by a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole mass spectrometer using electron impact ionization. The LC-MS/MS portion of this analysis was based on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC and a Thermo-Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer, which consists of an electrospray ionization (ESI) source and linear ion-trap (LIT) mass analyser. Sample extracts were split into two aliquots, dried, and reconstituted separately in acidic or basic solvents. One aliquot was analysed in acidic positive ion optimized conditions and the other in basic negative ion optimized conditions using dedicated columns. Extracts reconstituted in acidic conditions were gradient eluted using water and methanol containing 0.1% formic acid, while the basic extracts were eluted using water and methanol containing 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The MS analysis alternated between MS and MS/MS scans using dynamic exclusion. Compounds were identified by comparison to an in-house metabolomic library with purified standards. More than 3000 commercially-available standard compounds have been registered for determination of their analytical characteristics. The combination of chromatographic properties and mass spectra gave an indication of a match to a specific compound or an isobaric entity.

Briefly, direct glycolysis of [1, 2-<sup>13</sup>C] glucose (without going through the PPP) produces M2 labelled lactate, while flux going through the oxidative portion of PPP removes the first carbon from glucose and releases it in the form of CO<sub>2</sub>. The resultant M1 labelled intermediates are recycled back to glycolysis to produce M1 labelled lactate through the non-oxidative potion of PPP. The ratio of M1 to M2 labelled lactate indicates the ratio of flux going through the PPP versus flux directly going through glycolysis.
