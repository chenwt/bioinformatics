Besides the need for earlier diagnosis, there is a high need for additional effective therapies. In this work, we investigated the feasibility of a lung cancer progression mouse model, mimicking features of human aggressive NSCLC, as biological reservoir for potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We performed RNA-seq profiling on total RNA extracted from lungs of a 30 week-old K-ras<sup>LA1</sup>/p53<sup>R172H&#x00394;g </sup>and wild type (WT) mice to detect fusion genes and gene/exon-level differential expression associated to the increase of tumor mass. Fusion events were not detected in K-ras<sup>LA1</sup>/p53<sup>R172H&#x00394;g </sup>tumors. Differential expression at exon-level detected 33 genes with differential exon usage. Among them nine, i.e. those secreted or expressed on the plasma membrane, were used for a meta-analysis of more than 500 NSCLC RNA-seq transcriptomes. None of the genes showed a significant correlation between exon-level expression and disease prognosis. Differential expression at gene-level allowed the identification of 1513 genes with a significant increase in expression associated to tumor mass increase. 74 genes, i.e. those secreted or expressed on the plasma membrane, were used for a meta-analysis of two transcriptomics datasets of human NSCLC samples, encompassing more than 900 samples. SPP1 was the only molecule whose over-expression resulted statistically related to poor outcome regarding both survival and metastasis formation. Two other molecules showed over-expression associated to poor outcome due to metastasis formation: GM-CSF and ADORA3. GM-CSF is a secreted protein, and we confirmed its expression in the supernatant of a cell line derived by a K-ras<sup>LA1</sup>/p53<sup>R172H&#x00394;g </sup>mouse tumor. ADORA3 is instead involved in the induction of p53-mediated apoptosis in lung cancer cell lines. Since in our model p53 is inactivated, ADORA3 does not negatively affect tumor growth but remains expressed on tumor cells. Thus, it could represent an interesting target for the development of antibody-targeted therapy on a subset of NSCLC, which are p53 null and ADORA3 positive.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study provided a complete transcription overview of the K-ras<sup>LA1</sup>/p53<sup>R172H&#x00394;g </sup>mouse NSCLC model. This approach allowed the detection of ADORA3 as a potential target for antibody-based therapy in p53 mutated tumors.</p></sec></sec></abstract><conference><conf-date>21-23 May 2013</conf-date><conf-name>Tenth Annual Meeting of the Italian Society of Bioinformatics (BITS) </conf-name><conf-loc>Udine, Italy</conf-loc></conference></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Lung cancer is the most common cause of neoplasia-related death worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The vast majority of lung cancer cases (approximately 80%) are non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and the remaining fraction is small cell lung cancers. Only a minority of NSCLC patients is suitable for radical treatment as curative care. Approximately two thirds of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, and of the remaining patients who undergo curative surgery, 30-50% have a recurrence with metastatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The 5-year relative survival rate among patients diagnosed with NSCLC is only 15%. Thus, the conventional treatments (i.e. surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy), have apparently reached a plateau of effectiveness in improving survival of advanced NSCLC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Thus, the treatment of NSCLC is a major unmet need and new therapies focusing on the molecular mechanisms of lung tumorigenesis are urgently needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The discovery of new biomarkers for targeted therapies could greatly change the management and prognosis of many patients with NSCLC. Further, knowledge of the molecular pathways and mutational drivers of lung cancer will expand the use of targeted treatments. Hopefully, the identification of new therapeutic targets will provide personalized and precise treatments for lung cancer patients in the near future.</p><p>Indeed, considerable efforts were made to discover new molecular biomarkers associated to lung cancer, which could be used as early diagnostic markers or as new specific therapeutic targets to treat patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In our opinion, the identification of oncoantigens (i.e. tumor associated antigens that have a causal role in the promotion of tumor progression) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] could provide new and more promising targets for personalized treatment in NSCLC.</p><p>In this study, we sought to identify new candidate biomarkers and/or potential oncoantigens involved in both initiation of lung cancer and/or its progression to an aggressive cancer phenotype. To this aim, we adapted to the lung cancer disease our consolidated pipeline for oncoantigen detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Thanks to the RNA-seq technology we also extended our pipeline to the detection of tumor specific transcript isoforms and fusion proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Our pipeline requires the availability of an animal model for the cancer under study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Thus, we used one of the models most closely simulating human metastatic lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This model is based on the combination of a latent mutant K-ras allele at the endogenous locus (K-ras<sup>LA1</sup>), which is spontaneously activated in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and a particular mutation generated at the endogenous p53 allele containing an arginine-to-histidine substitution at codon 172 (p53<sup>R172H&#x00394;g</sup>), corresponding to the hot spot mutation at human codon 175 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This mouse model develops lung adenocarcinomas with a high incidence of metastases and gender differences in cancer-related death. The use of our pipeline in the framework of metastatic lung cancer model, combined with the power of RNA-seq technology, allowed the identification of ADORA3 as new putative target for antibody-based therapy in mutant p53 tumors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Characterization of lung tumors of K-ras<sup>LA1</sup>/p53<sup>R172H&#x00394;g </sup>mice by non invasive MRI</title><p>A colony of K-ras<sup>LA1</sup>/p53<sup>R172H&#x00394;g </sup>double transgenic mice has been generated in our laboratory, by crossing one p53<sup>R172H&#x00394;g </sup>male with one K-ras<sup>LA1 </sup>female, kindly provided us by Dr. Lozano (University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center). These mice develop autochthonous lung adenocarcinomas with a high incidence of metastases and gender differences in cancer related death thus providing a realistic model of human metastatic lung cancer and an immunocompetent system for studying NSCLC and its prevention by novel agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. By using non-invasive imaging techniques (MRI) for small rodents, a quantification of the number and the size of tumor lesions of K-ras<sup>LA1</sup>/p53<sup>R172H&#x00394;g </sup>mice during time was performed. The progression of lung tumors was monitored at 10, 20 and 30 weeks of age.

The analysis of images collected at weeks 10, 20, and 30 weeks of age showed a significant increase in the total tumor volume in both K-ras<sup>LA1</sup>/p53 <sup>R172H&#x00394;g </sup>males and females during cancer progression (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Moreover, starting from the 10<sup>th </sup>week of age, a significant increase in the number and size of lung lesions was observed between males and females, with females developing more lesions than males, as previously reported for survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These gender differences remain evident from early to advanced/late-stage of the disease (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Non-invasive imaging techniques (MRI) for small rodents</bold>.

These early lesions increase in number and dimensions and, at 20 weeks of age, become sub-pleural and intra-parenchymal tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, respectively), growing in masses with lepidic and solid growth aspects. Like in humans, in which the prevalence of adenocarcinomas of mixed subtypes led, in 2011, to a new WHO classification in which invasive adenocarcinomas are classified by predominant pattern and to the routinely definition of the percentage of histologic subtypes in clinical pathological reports, at 30 weeks of age (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>), lung adenocarcinomas of K-ras<sup>LA1</sup>/p53<sup>R172H&#x00394;g </sup>mice display, besides a predominance of zones with solid growth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>), several types of differentiation, sometimes with prominent papillary growth pattern (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>), sometimes with less differentiated zones and aspects of large cell carcinoma (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>).

The comparison did not show any significant difference at the transcription level (not shown), suggesting that the differences in growth rate might be due to the endocrinological differences existing between male and female. Thus, we run a pair-end RNA-seq on two prototypical situations, WT and K-ras<sup>LA1</sup>/p53<sup>R172H&#x00394;g </sup>mice (MT), to detect genes/transcripts associated to the increase of tumor mass that might represent potential targets for precision medicine applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Fusion events detection</title><p>Direct sequencing of messenger RNA transcripts using the RNA-seq protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] is rapidly becoming the standard method for detecting and quantifying expressed genes in a cell. One of the key features observed after cancer genomes analysis is a chromosomal abnormality. Genome rearrangements could result in aberrant gene fusions, and a number of them have been found to play important roles in carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The discovery of novel gene fusions can lead to a better comprehension of cancer progression and development. Fusion events were detected in WT and MT samples using ChimeraScan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Since fusion detection tools are error prone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we filtered the putative fusions, reported by ChimeraScan, retaining only common events between the MT and not reported in the WT replicates. The detected fusions (AK029407:Ank3, Gimap1:Gimap5, Pisd-ps2:Pisd-ps) were subsequently discarded since they were all either read through events or fusions between homologue genes. Thus it seems that fusion products are not prominent events in tumors developing due to the presence of constitutively active K-ras and inactive p53.</p></sec><sec><title>Exon-level analysis</title><p>Exon level analysis was run using DEXSeq Bioconductor package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and provided 33 genes with differential exon expression between WT and MT groups (FDR &#x0003c; 10%). Among them six (ITGAD, COL17A1, DCSTAMP, PTPRN, PTPRM and Klrb1c) codify for proteins that were located on the plasma membrane and three (VWF, DMKN and TIMP3) for proteins secreted in the extracellular space. For 11 of the 33 detected genes, exon-level data for 509 tumors together with their clinical annotation were retrieved from the cancer genome atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">http://cancergenome.nih.gov/</ext-link>). We scored the exons for their oncological power (see methods), which essentially represents the association between exon skipping/retention and poor outcome.

We focused our analysis on 74 genes encoding for secreted and membrane bound proteins having a human ortholog (74). Thus, we run a meta-analysis on a set of public available transcriptomes of 989 NSCLC patients characterized by clinical outcome for survival and metastasis (see methods). The data set was divided in test and validation set, of 695 and 294 samples each, respectively. We scored the identified genes for their oncological power (CO score, see methods), which represents the association between up-modulation of a gene and poor clinical outcome.</p><p>SPP1 (osteopontin) was the only molecule whose over-expression resulted statistically related to poor outcome regarding both survival and metastasis formation in NSCLC patients examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

It has been reported to be involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor growth control both in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It has been recently shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] that ADORA3 is involved in the induction of p53-mediated apoptosis in lung cancer cell lines. Since in our model p53 is inactivated, ADORA3 does not negatively affect tumor growth, but remain expressed on tumor cells. Although it does not represent a suitable oncoantigen, since its expression does not strictly affect tumor behavior; however, since it is a tumor associated antigen it could represent an interesting target for the development of antibody-mediated therapy on the subset of NSCLC which are p53 null and ADORA3 positive.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The combination of powerful transcriptomics analysis, i.e. RNA-seq, genetically engineered mice models prone to develop tumors and large collection of human tumor transcriptomes offers new opportunities for the discovery and validation of therapeutic targets in the framework of personalized medicine. The identification of a known biomarker as osteopontin in the NSCLC mouse model confirmed the efficacy of our pipeline to detect targets in precision medicine. Moreover, our approach also allowed the identification of a new putative target, ADORA3, as well as a new putative biomarker, GM-CSF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>The heterozygous K-ras<sup>LA1 </sup>mice were crossed with heterozygous p53<sup>R172H&#x00394;g </sup>mice (both kindly provided by Dr. G.

Mice were maintained in the transgenic unit of the Molecular Biotechnology Center (University of Torino) under a 12 hour light-dark cycle and provided food and water ad libitum. Genotyped and individually tagged mice of the same age were treated in conformity with national and international laws and policies as approved by the Faculty Ethical Committee and all animal experiments were performed in accordance with European Union guidelines and national institutional regulations.
