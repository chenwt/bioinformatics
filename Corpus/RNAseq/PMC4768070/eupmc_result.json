    "Host cells respond to viral infections by activating immune response genes that are not only involved in inflammation, but may also predispose cells to cancerous transformation. One such gene is BST-2, a type II transmembrane protein with a unique topology that endows it tethering and signaling potential. Through this ability to tether and signal, BST-2 regulates host response to viral infection either by inhibiting release of nascent viral particles or in some models inhibiting viral dissemination. However, despite its antiviral functions, BST-2 is involved in disease manifestation, a function linked to the ability of BST-2 to promote cell-to-cell interaction. Therefore, modulating BST-2 expression and/or activity has the potential to influence course of disease."
