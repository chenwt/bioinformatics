Unfortunately, a large fraction of patients have primary or acquired resistance to the HER2-targeted therapy trastuzumab, thus a multi-drug combination is utilized in the clinic, putting significant burden on patients. We systematically identified an optimal HER2 siRNA from 76 potential sequences and demonstrated its utility in overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib in 18 HER2-positive cancer cell lines. We provided evidence that the drug-resistant cancer maintains dependence on HER2 for survival. Importantly, cell lines did not readily develop resistance following extended treatment with HER2 siRNA. Using our recently developed nanoparticle platform, systemic delivery of HER2 siRNA to trastuzumab-resistant tumors resulted in significant growth inhibition. Moreover, the optimal HER2 siRNA could also silence an exon 16 skipped HER2 splice variant reported to be highly oncogenic and linked to trastuzumab resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>siRNA</kwd><kwd>HER2</kwd><kwd>trastuzumab resistance</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>nanoparticles</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women in the United States. Among various subtypes of breast cancer, overexpression and amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2; <italic>ErbB2/neu</italic>) accounts for about 20% of all cases and is a predictor of aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. HER2, a member of the HER family, is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase and has been well characterized as an oncogenic driver of human breast and ovarian cancer [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Activation of HER2 downstream signaling requires either self-dimerization or dimerization with other HER family members [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Downstream signaling is mainly mediated through activation of AKT and ERK pathways, leading to cellular proliferation and survival [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Overexpression of HER2 increases downstream activity by increasing the probability of homo- and heterodimer formation [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and/or by increasing the production of a highly oncogenic HER2 splice variant that lacks exon 16 hereafter referred to as delta16 HER2 [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>FDA-approved targeted therapies for HER2-positive breast tumors include trastuzumab (Herceptin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Genentech), pertuzumab (Perjeta<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Genentech), T-DM1 (Kadcyla<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Genentech) and lapatinib (Tykerb<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Norvatis). Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are humanized monoclonal antibodies that bind to the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor and block receptor dimerization, thus preventing receptor activation [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. T-DM1 is trastuzumab conjugated to the cytotoxic agent emtansine. Lapatinib is a small molecule dual kinase inhibitor that actively blocks HER2 signaling by binding to the HER2 and/or EGFR kinase domain [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite the use of the aforementioned HER2-targeted therapies, patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer still develop resistance to the best combination regimens (e.g., trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel) and progression-free survival is still only 18.5 months [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Clearly, more durable treatments are needed.</p><p>Recent studies have shown the potential use of HER2 siRNA as therapeutics for treating HER2-positive breast cancer [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. One group has demonstrated its potential to overcome resistance to trastuzumab [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, these works have been limited to in vitro studies due to the lack of readily available in vivo delivery platforms. In addition, the siRNA sequences used in prior works have not been systematically screened. Some studies have infected cancer cells ex vivo with HER2 siRNA [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] or shRNA [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] prior to tumor inoculation in order to demonstrate the in vivo activity of HER2 suppression. However, to make RNAi clinically relevant, effective in vivo delivering of siRNA to tumors is necessary. Although viral-based siRNA and shRNA strategies are effective, concerns regarding immunogenic response and insertional mutagenesis remain major issues [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Recent advances in nanobiotechnology have made non-viral based siRNA delivery viable. Inoue et al. showed that a polymalic acid-based nanobiopolymer conjugated with HER2 antisense and trastuzumab can inhibit tumor growth in BT474 tumor xenografts [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Two additional studies have utilized siRNA against PLK1 delivered systemically with peptide fusion protein [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] or PLA-PEG [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] to successfully treat BT474 tumors in mice. However, these studies utilized BT474 derived tumors, which are sensitive to trastuzumab.</p><p>This article addresses several aforementioned shortcomings in the field. We have identified the most optimal HER2 siRNA duplex from a pool of 76 potential sequences. We then demonstrate the in vitro efficacy of the optimal HER2 siRNA to overcome both intrinsic and acquired drug resistance in HER2-positive cancer cell lines, followed by the in vivo efficacy by utilizing our recently optimized nanoparticle platform [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] to systemically deliver siRNA to solid tumors. We elucidate that the drug-resistant cancer still relies on HER2 pathways, substantiating the utility of a HER2 siRNA treatment strategy to overcome drug resistance. Importantly, we also address whether HER2-positive cancer can develop resistance to HER2 siRNA after long-term treatment as it does with HER2-targeted therapies. Lastly, we show that our optimal HER2 siRNA can silence both wild-type HER2 and the more oncogenic delta16 HER2 splice variant to the same extent.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Screening and validation of HER2 siRNA</title><p>76 potential HER2 siRNA candidates plus 2 scrambled siRNAs, an siRNA against luciferase and an siRNA against GFP, were tested for their HER2 mRNA knockdown efficiency in the HER2-positive cell lines BT474, SKBR3 and HCC1954.

The five most effective sequences from this evaluation were further ranked according to the number of off-target matches by utilizing BLAST (BLASTN 2.2.31+, RefSeq, NCBI Reference Sequence Database) with a minimum threshold of 70% sequence homology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The sequences d75 and d4 had the fewest off-target matches and were further validated in a larger panel of 18 HER2-positive cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>) and 2 HER2-negative cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Both sequences yielded comparable cell killing in the 18 cell lines and showed similar treatment specificity (i.e., were less likely to kill HER2-negative cells). However, d75 had fewer off-target matches than d4 (2 vs. 6) and d75 generated more consistent mRNA knockdown and cell viability reduction among the HER2-positive cell lines tested. Low off-target was also apparent when tested in T47D (HER2-negative) cell line, in which GI50 was not achieved even when the concentration of d75 was increased to 80 nM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). We selected sequence d75 for further development based on these results. Henceforth, d75 will be referred to as siHER2<sup>d75</sup> and the AllStar non-targeting control siRNA will be referred to as siControl (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p><p>The ability of siHER2<sup>d75</sup> to decrease HER2 protein levels and induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest was assessed subsequently (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Visual and quantitative analyses of the intensity of anti-HER2 immunofluorescence staining before and after treatment with siHER2<sup>d75</sup> showed that HER2 protein levels on the cellular membrane and in the cytoplasm decreased significantly in BT474 cells after 10 nM siHER2<sup>d75</sup> treatment for 72 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

They also represent HER2 amplification in both the luminal and basal subtypes. The concentrations of trastuzumab and lapatinib needed to inhibit growth by 50% (GI50) in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;3B</xref> are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. BT474 was sensitive to both trastuzumab and lapatinib with GI50 values of 0.12 &#x003bc;g/ml and 0.05 &#x003bc;M, respectively. However, JIMT1 was highly resistant to both HER2-targeted therapies, and HCC1954 showed a marginal response to lapatinib (GI50 of 0.39 &#x003bc;M) and was largely resistant to trastuzumab. Although lapatinib showed some ability to inhibit growth in all three cell lines, the dose required to inhibit the resistant cell lines (HCC1954 and JIMT1) exceeded 2 &#x003bc;M, which starts to be toxic to some HER2-negative cells [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Not surprisingly, differential sensitivity to siHER2<sup>d75</sup> was also observed across the three cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, with representative HER2 reduction in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) as evident in the calculated GI50 values, which ranged from 0.19 to 6.78 nM (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). However, an siHER2<sup>d75</sup> dose of only 10 nM could inhibit the growth of BT474, HCC1954, and JIMT1 by 95%, 80%, and 70%, respectively. This suggests that the intrinsically resistant HCC1954 and JIMT1 cell lines still require HER2 for growth, and silencing of HER2 using siRNA in the low nanomolar range is a viable therapeutic strategy.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Evaluation of growth inhibition with HER2-targeted therapies in representative breast cancer cells</title><p>The % Growth of BT474, HCC1954 and JIMT1 breast cancer cell lines treated with <bold>A.</bold> trastuzumab, <bold>B.</bold> lapatinib, or <bold>C.</bold> siHER2<sup>d75</sup> at the indicated dose range. <bold>D.</bold> Reduction of HER2 protein by various doses of siHER2<sup>d75</sup> vs. 10 nM of siControl after 72 h.

One exception was the UACC893 cell line, which has the highest HER2 expression but only moderately responded to siHER2<sup>d75</sup> treatment.

Nonetheless, the GI50 values for all these cell lines ranged between 0.15 and 7 nM, thus still supporting the potency of siHER2<sup>d75</sup> in achieving growth inhibition. In general, HER2 protein level was more predictive of the response to siHER2<sup>d75</sup> than HER2 mRNA level generated with RNAseq [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><title>Overcoming acquired resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib with siHER2<sup>d75</sup></title><p>We used the BT474 cell line to study acquired resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib.

We focused on BT474-LR since it was resistant to both trastuzumab and lapatinib. Untreated BT474-LR displayed a level of phosphorylated HER2 similar to that in the parental BT474. This suggests that BT474-LR cells are still dependent on HER2 signaling. Lapatinib given at 100 nM could block the phosphorylation of HER2, AKT and ERK in the parental BT474 at 72 h post-treatment, whereas a dose of 500 nM was barely able to do so in BT474-LR. On the other hand, 10 nM siHER2<sup>d75</sup> was effective in BT474-LR displaying reduced phosphorylation of HER2, AKT and ERK to levels that were similar to those achieved in the parental BT474.

We assessed that by treating BT474, HCC1954 and JIMT1 cells with 1 nM siHER2<sup>d75</sup> or siControl weekly for 15 weeks. The resulting cell line derivatives were designated as BT474-H15, HCC1954-H15 and JIMT1-H15 (siHER2 for 15 weeks), and BT474-C15, HCC1954-C15 and JIMT1-C15 (siControl for 15 weeks). One nanomolar of siHER2<sup>d75</sup> was sufficient to reduce the expression of HER2 by approximately 98% in BT474, 72% in HCC1954, and 95% in JIMT1 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). When leaving 1 nM siHER2<sup>d75</sup> in the medium following transfection, the silencing effect as gauged by HER2 mRNA level reduction lasted for at least 7 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>). Thus, the siHER2<sup>d75</sup> transfection was repeated at 7-day intervals when medium change was also needed. Immunofluorescence imaging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>) confirmed that HER2 reduction occurred uniformly across the BT474 cell population. Because 1 nM siHER2<sup>d75</sup> did not eradicate the entire cell population, cells that survived under low HER2 conditions were selected over the 15 weeks. After 15 weeks, the remaining cells designated BT474-H15, HCC1954-H15 and JIMT1-H15 were expanded upon the withdrawal of siHER2<sup>d75</sup> for further characterization.

Studies to understand the intrinsic and acquired resistance to HER2-targeted therapies have implicated post-translational variants, splicing variants, and mutations of HER2 as potential mechanisms. One variant, p95-HER2, is a truncated form of HER2 that lacks the extracellular domain thus rendering it incapable of binding trastuzumab [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, this form retains a functional HER2 kinase domain, and its level is enhanced in nodal metastatic tissues and is inversely correlated with disease free survival [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Another HER2 variant is delta16 HER2, which lacks exon 16 [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The absence of exon 16 exposes a cysteine residue, which promotes receptor homodimerization and activation [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The exogenous overexpression of delta16 HER2, but not wild-type HER2, was sufficient to evoke an aggressive breast cancer phenotype in the otherwise non-tumorigenic MCF-10A mammary epithelial cell line [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Clinically, delta16 HER2 expression was found in approximately 90% of HER2-positive breast cancer (data from 46 human HER2-positive BCs) and is highly correlated with dissemination to local lymph nodes [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Delta16 HER2 has also been shown to activate entirely different signaling pathways than wild-type HER2 [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which may alter how cells respond to targeted therapies. A mutation in the kinase domain of HER2 also has been reported in cells [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and in patient tissue samples [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which may hinder the binding of lapatinib making it ineffective at blocking HER2 phosphorylation [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Other proteins have also been implicated in drug resistance of HER2-positive cancer. For instance, Wang et al. [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported that upregulation of estrogen receptors was primarily responsible for the initial resistance to both trastuzumab and lapatinib. However, in the later stage of resistance, cancer cells once again became reliant on HER2 signaling. Masking the HER2 receptor by a membrane-associated glycoprotein, MUC4, has been shown to prevent the binding of trastuzumab in HER2-positive JIMT1 cells [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In addition, MUC4 [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and another family member MUC1-C [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], have also been shown to maintain HER2 phosphorylation in MCF7/HER2-18 (MCF7, engineered to overexpress HER2) and in BT474R and SKBR3R (resistant to trastuzumab after long term selection) cells, respectively. Lastly, increased expression of HER2 receptor ligands that can stimulate HER2 activation, has been reported in a BT474 cell line with acquired resistance to lapatinib [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>These mechanistic studies suggest that resistant cancers still depend on HER2, while highlighting the shortcomings of monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors targeting HER2 in the resistant cells. Herein, we show that RNA interference (RNAi) by siRNA, which halts protein synthesis at the mRNA level, can potentially overcome these shortcomings. Moreover, siRNA can be designed to target mutated HER2 or HER2 variants if needed.</p><p>Our success in delivering effective doses of siHER2<sup>d75</sup> to treat intrinsically resistant HCC1954 tumors [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] prompted us to test it in a model of HER2-positive cancer having acquired resistance to trastuzumab (BT474-TR) and lapatinib (BT474-LR). For HER2 siRNA screening in vitro, we used a non-specific commercial transfection agent instead of our nanoparticle delivery platform to avoid confounding siHER2 effects with those of trastuzumab, which is used as the homing target agent on our nanoparticles. Our resistant BT474-TR and BT474-LR behaved similarly to those previously reported by Wang et al. [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; their growth was not fully inhibited by exceedingly high doses of trastuzumab and lapatinib, respectively. In contrast, siHER2<sup>d75</sup> was effective in inhibiting growth of both BT474-TR and BT474-LR cells. The results translated well to the trastuzumab-resistant BT474-TRgf tumor xenografts.</p><p>In our study, we showed that cancer treated long-term with siHER2<sup>d75</sup> remained sensitive to the siHER2, lapatinib and trastuzumab without significant changes in the downstream phosphorylation patterns. This suggests that HER2 signaling is still the preferred signaling pathway and that the cells remained addicted to HER2-mediated survival and proliferation. Cancer is less prone to develop acquired resistance to siHER2<sup>d75</sup> treatment because it circumvents many resistance mechanisms reported for small molecule inhibitors or antibodies. Specifically, siHER2<sup>d75</sup> decreases HER2 mRNA, and therefore the cells are unable to synthesize more HER2 proteins to compensate for the loss of HER2 through receptor recycling and degradation. Removing HER2 by siHER2<sup>d75</sup> can also negate resistance mechanisms relying on the presence or stimulation of HER2 proteins as aforementioned. In addition, siHER2<sup>d75</sup> is not susceptible to resistance caused by mutations in the kinase domain or truncation of extracellular domain of HER2 that could otherwise prevent the binding of trastuzumab and lapatinib.</p><p>In all, our results suggest that siHER2<sup>d75</sup> is a promising alternative to current HER2-targeted therapies. Moreover, HER2-positive tumors that have progressed on trastuzumab or lapatinib are likely to remain treatable with siRNA against HER2 while there is minimal risk of developing further resistance to this RNAi strategy. Thus, the clinical translation of HER2 siRNA to treat resistant HER2-positive cancer is highly viable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Design and synthesis of HER2 siRNA</title><p>Seventy-six siRNA duplexes targeting the coding region of human HER2 (NM_001005862) were designed, each with 3&#x02032; UU overhangs and no other modifications.

The cells were seeded (cells/well in 96-well plate) at 20,000 (HEK293), 250,000 (HEPG2), 120,000 (MCF10A), and 7,500 (HUVEC), respectively, for 24 h to achieve about 80% confluency. The cells were then treated with efficacious dose of T-siHER2<sup>d75</sup>-NP (60 nM as siHER2<sup>d75</sup>, 42 &#x003bc;g/mL as nanoparticle, [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]) or acetaminophen (APAP, Tylenol) as a drug benchmark at 25 mM following the NCL's protocol [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Cell viability was measured at 24 h post-treatment with the CellTiter-Glo assay, which measures adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an indicator of metabolically active cells, and reported as percent of the untreated control's viability.</p></sec><sec id="s4_7"><title>Immunofluorescence imaging</title><p>Cells were seeded in 96-well black wall plates (Corning&#x000ae; Costar&#x000ae;) 24 hours prior to transfection. Three days after transfection, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature and then permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X. After blocking for one hour in 2% BSA, cells were stained overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with primary antibodies. Secondary antibody incubation was carried out at room temperature for one hour the next day. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 dye (Life Technologies). Plates were imaged on an Olympus IX81 Scan^R automated fluorescence microscope. Images were analyzed, and signal intensities were quantitated using the included analysis software package.</p></sec><sec id="s4_8"><title>Western blot</title><p>Cells were seeded in 6-well plates 24 hours prior to transfection or drug treatment. Samples were harvested 48 hours after drug treatment and 72 hours after transfection. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. Running samples were prepared with 4X Novex NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Life Technologies) and supplemented with 10% beta-mercaptoethanol. Twenty micrograms of protein were loaded per lane of 4&#x02013;12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels (Life Technologies) and ran in MOPS buffer. Proteins were then transferred to PVDF-FL membrane (Millipore) in Tris-Glycine transfer buffer. Primary antibody incubation was carried out overnight at 4&#x000b0;C on a rocking platform. Secondary antibody incubation was carried out at room temperature the next day. Proteins were detected using the LI-COR Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). Image analysis and protein quantitation were performed with ImageJ (NCI).</p></sec><sec id="s4_9"><title>Cell cycle analysis</title><p>Cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes at 1-2 x10<sup>6</sup> cells per dish. After an overnight settling period, cells were transfected with selected siRNAs. After 48 or 72 hours, cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol. Cells were incubated with 50 &#x003bc;g/ml RNase A in PBS for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C and then stained with 50 &#x003bc;g/ml propidium iodide.

Analysis of cell cycle results was carried out using FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc.).</p></sec><sec id="s4_10"><title>Apoptosis analysis</title><p>Apoptotic cells were detected using Yo-Pro-1 staining. Briefly, BT474 cells transfected with 10 nM siHER2 or siControl were stained with 1 &#x003bc;mol/L of Yo-Pro-1 dye and 10 &#x003bc;g/mL of Hoechst 33342 for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. The fluorescence dyes were detected by high content imaging (Olympus IX81 Scan^R automated fluorescence microscope). The percentage of apoptotic cells were calculated by the ratio of Yo-Pro-1 and Hoechst positive cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4_11"><title>Targeted delivery of siHER2<sup>d75</sup> in a mouse model of HER2-positive breast cancer xenograft</title><p>All animals were used under an approved protocol of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) and the experiments were carried out under the auspices of the Department of Comparative Medicine of OHSU. BT474-TRgf cells (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of six-week-old athymic nu/nu mice (Taconic) and allowed to grow to an average size of &#x0223c;100 mm<sup>3</sup>. Mice were then grouped and proceeded to receive twice a week of siHER2<sup>d75</sup> or siSCR loaded on our mesoporous silica based nanoconstructs containing trastuzumab (T-NP) for targeted delivery over a period of six weeks via tail vein injection. Days of injection and doses were specified in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>. Details on the nanoconstruct design, composition, and synthesis procedures can be found in our previous report [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Trastuzumab was administered intravenously twice weekly at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURES AND TABLES</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="oncotarget-07-14727-s001.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1279" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Drs.
