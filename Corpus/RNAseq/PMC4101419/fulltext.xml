As with all estuarine species, individual oysters must be able to regulate their osmotic balance in response to constant temporal variation in salinity. At the population level, recurrent viability selection may be an additional mechanism shaping adaptive osmoregulatory phenotypes at the margins of oyster salinity tolerance. To identify candidate genes for osmoregulation, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated the transcriptome of wild juvenile eastern oysters from &#x02018;high&#x02019; and &#x02018;low&#x02019; salinity regimes. Annotations and candidates were mostly based on the Pacific oyster (<italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic>) genome sequence so osmoregulatory relevance in <italic>C. virginica</italic> was explored by testing functional enrichment of genes showing spatially discrete patterns of expression and by quantifying coding sequence divergence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The assembly of sequence reads and permissive clustering of potentially oversplit alleles resulted in 98,729 reftigs (contigs and singletons). Of these, 50,736 were annotated with 9,307 belonging to a set of candidate osmoregulatory genes identified from the <italic>C. gigas</italic> genome. A total of 218,777 SNPs (0.0185 SNPs/bp) were identified in annotated reftigs of <italic>C. virginica</italic>. Amino acid divergence between translations of <italic>C. virginica</italic> annotated reftigs and <italic>C. gigas</italic> coding sequence averaged 23.2 % with an average dN/dS ratio of 0.074, suggesting purifying selection on protein sequences. The high and low salinity source oysters each expressed a subset of genes unique to that group, and the functions for these annotated genes were consistent with known molecular mechanisms for osmotic regulation in molluscs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Most of the osmoregulatory gene candidates experimentally identified in <italic>C. gigas</italic> are present in this <italic>C. virginica</italic> transcriptome. In general these congeners show coding sequence divergence too high to make the <italic>C. gigas</italic> genome a useful reference for <italic>C. virginica</italic> bioinformatics. However, strong purifying selection is characteristic of the osmoregulatory candidates so functional annotations are likely to correspond. An initial examination of <italic>C. virginica</italic> presence/absence expression patterns across the salinity gradient in a single estuary suggests that many of these candidates have expression patterns that co-vary with salinity, consistent with osmoregulatory function in <italic>C. virginica</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1471-2164-15-503) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Crassostrea virginica</italic></kwd><kwd>Osmoregulation</kwd><kwd>Transcriptome</kwd><kwd>dN/dS</kwd><kwd>Gene enrichment</kwd><kwd>SNP</kwd><kwd>Cd-hit</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The eastern oyster (<italic>Crassostrea virginica</italic>) builds reefs that support productive estuarine communities and provide important ecosystem services[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, overfishing, disease pressure, and environmental stress have led to the loss of approximately 90% of biomass across the eastern oyster&#x02019;s home range since the early 1900&#x02019;s
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Two important topics in oyster biology and restoration are the mechanisms by which oysters respond to stress
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and the ability of oyster populations to either acclimate to stress through phenotypic plasticity or adapt via selection. The majority of work on eastern oysters has focused on immune response to pathogens
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] with a few observational studies on other environmental stressors
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Spatial and temporal variation in salinity is a given for estuaries, and phenotypic buffering of cell volume through osmolyte control is an essential adaptation for all organisms that live there.</p><p>Eastern oysters are found along salinity gradients ranging from near freshwater conditions (salinity of 5) to oceanic salinities (salinity of 35)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Their greatest abundance is typically at intermediate salinities, with the adult physiological optimum posited to be as narrow as salinities of 15&#x02013;18
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. At the margins of this environmental envelope, recent results suggest that post-settlement viability selection is one important process for sustaining adult populations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. While the genes involved in osmoregulation have not been well characterized in the eastern oyster, recent studies on the Pacific oyster (<italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic>)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] provide valuable tools for investigating the genetics of osmoregulation. Generating genome-scale resources such as transcriptome sequences for <italic>C. virginica</italic> can facilitate studies of gene expression and the physiology of osmoregulation in order to better understand responses to osmotic stress at the individual and population levels.</p><p>Oysters regulate cell volume in response to changing salinity through multiple mechanisms. Oysters are osmoconformers with no ability to osmoregulate their extracellular fluid
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Salinity fluctuations therefore result in energetically costly processes to maintain isoosmostic balance by accumulating or releasing osmotically active solutes (osmolytes)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These osmolytes include both inorganic ions such as N<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> and organic substances such as free amino acids (FAA) and quaternary amines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Oysters, like many organisms when under great osmotic stress, primarily use organic osmolytes such as taurine, alanine, aspartic acid, glycine, and betaine
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Organic osmolytes are able to provide osmotic bulk under high osmotic stress without the direct physiological trade-offs that inorganic ions would have
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, organic osmolytes can stabilize proteins and protect cells from oxidative stress
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A variety of functional classes of enzymes are likely involved in osmoregulation, including peptidases to catalyze the hydrolysis of peptides into amino acids, kinases to phosphorylate plasma membrane proteins, and transporters to move molecules across cell membranes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Most molecular physiological studies of osmoregulation in oysters have focused on the products of single genes, such as taurine transporter
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The <italic>C. gigas</italic> genome sequence and the initial evaluation of gene expression between salinity treatments
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] demonstrated differential expression for hundreds of genes. Genomic studies of <italic>C. virginica</italic> gene expression across natural salinity gradients have also shown many genes responding to this environmental gradient
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. To enable more focused future studies on osmoregulation in <italic>C. virginica</italic>, a first step is the identification of candidate genes involved in this core physiological process.</p><p>Our objective was to identify genes putatively involved in osmoregulation in the eastern oyster by sequencing, assembling, and annotating the transcriptome from low- and high-salinity source populations of juvenile oysters by using 454 sequencing technology. Using annotations and differential expression data from <italic>C. gigas,</italic> we identified <italic>C. virginica</italic> transcripts that are candidates for osmoregulatory function. Given that these congeners shared a common ancestor more than 82 Mya
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], we explored the functional appropriateness of these annotations in two ways. First, we quantified the distribution of coding sequence divergence and estimated the strength of purifying selection maintaining similar polypeptide sequences in the two species. Second, we tested for predicted expression patterns in normalized cDNA libraries from low- and high-salinity wild oysters. Specifically, we predicted that transcripts found in one salinity population but not the other would be enriched for candidate osmoregulatory genes and for osmoregulation-related gene ontology terms (GO; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org">http://www.geneontology.org</ext-link>). Our evaluation of this transcriptome and results of these associated analyses provide some confidence that these candidate genes are a comprehensive starting point for experiments investigating the physiological and evolutionary responses of eastern oysters to osmoregulatory challenges in their estuarine environment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample collection and archiving</title><p>Shell substrate was deployed at a &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; salinity field site (27&#x000b0;10&#x02019;58.2&#x0201d;N 80&#x000b0;12&#x02019;22.2&#x0201d;W; mean salinity&#x02009;=&#x02009;15.9, max&#x02009;=&#x02009;33.5, min&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.6) and at a &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; salinity field site (27&#x000b0;13&#x02019;11.2&#x0201d;N 80&#x000b0;13&#x02019;38.9&#x0201d;W; mean salinity&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.0, max&#x02009;=&#x02009;18.2, min&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.0) in the St. Lucie River, Florida, on June 2, 2010. Water temperature, salinity, and percent dissolved oxygen were recorded every hour at both sites from March 23, 2010 until July 1, 2010 with a Sonde (YSI 600OMS V2). Over this time interval these two sites were significantly different in salinity (Figure&#x000a0;

Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics, Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. We chose to normalize the libraries in order to increase the likelihood that rare transcripts would be sequenced, leading to a more complete transcriptome with limited sequencing effort. For each library, messenger RNA was isolated from 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of pooled total RNA with the Oligotex kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The messenger RNA was then converted to a primary cDNA library with adaptors compatible with the 454 system using Multiplex Identifier (MID) tags to distinguish the two population pools
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The libraries were diluted to 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> molecules/&#x003bc;L, pooled, and sequenced on a full plate using the 454 Genome Sequencer FLX&#x02009;+&#x02009;system according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT). Signal processing and base calling were performed using the bundled 454 Data Analysis Software v2.6.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Transcriptome assembly and clustering</title><p>The two barcoded sets of reads were independently trimmed prior to assembly. Reads were trimmed from each end using a phred-scale quality score of 20 with fastq_quality_trimmer (FASTXToolkit). When the trimmer encountered a base pair with a quality less than 20, the closest read end was trimmed up to that base. Reads with less than 70% of the original length remaining were discarded. Trimmed reads were then imported into Newbler (gsAssembler, 454 Life Sciences, Roche Diagnostics). Any remaining adapters were trimmed, and reads were filtered against an <italic>E. coli</italic> database to remove contaminants. Reads were then assembled <italic>de novo</italic> using the default settings except for a minimum overlap length of 30&#x000a0;bp (default 40&#x000a0;bp). The quality of the initial assembly was evaluated by comparing assembly statistics to other published molluscan transcriptomes from 454 sequencing. Newbler reports consensus &#x0201c;contigs&#x0201d; using the overlap-layout-census (OLC) approach, which merges reads into contigs when their alignments overlap. Reads with no alignment overlap with other reads are denoted as singletons. Because singletons may belong to unique genes that were not highly expressed, they were included in further analysis. We defined a reference transcriptome as the combined set of 200&#x000a0;bp or longer contigs (consensus from multiple overlapping reads) and singletons and hereafter refer to these as &#x0201c;reftigs&#x0201d; (reference transcriptome sequences).</p><p>Large indels, highly polymorphic sequences, and other <italic>de novo</italic> assembly challenges can often lead to redundancy in sequences between singletons and contigs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Particularly in highly polymorphic species such as oysters, alleles will often assemble into separate contigs or remain as singletons. This redundancy complicates downstream applications of the resulting transcriptome, such as gene expression analyses
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], because reads from some single copy genes will not map uniquely within the transcriptome and may be discarded. We assumed that the reftigs from the Newbler assembly included many oversplit loci, so to improve the transcriptome we consolidated redundant reftigs by clustering. Cd-hit
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] was used to cluster reftigs with various sequence identity thresholds ranging from permissive clustering at 80% to conservative clustering at 99% using a k-mer word size of 5 to 10 increasing incrementally with the threshold (e.g. word size 5 with threshold 80%).</p><p>Several approaches were used to evaluate whether clustering improved the transcriptome. For the 80% and 95% clustering results we compared statistics bearing on transcriptome quality including the percent of reftigs that were annotated, the distribution of annotation between contigs and singletons, and the number of osmoregulatory candidates (identified in <italic>C. gigas</italic>) recovered.</p><p>Additionally, we evaluated the two clustering results by comparing the proportion of Illumina reads from a barcoded individual that uniquely mapped to annotated reftigs based on a pilot RNA-seq experiment. The barcoded individual was from an oyster reef in Delaware Bay with a salinity regime ranging from 6.5 to 14.5. The mRNA from 30&#x000a0;mg of gill tissue was extracted using Dynabeads&#x000ae; mRNA DIRECT&#x02122; kit (Life Technologies). The library was prepared with NEBNext&#x000ae; mRNA Library Pep Reagent Set for Illumina&#x000ae; (New England BioLabs Inc.). The library constituted 16.25% of a single 100&#x000a0;bp Hi-Seq Illumina lane and was sequenced at the Biotechnology Resource Center Genomics Facility of Cornell University. The resulting reads were trimmed following the same procedure as the 454 reads, and any remaining adapters were clipped using fastx_clipper (FASTXToolkit).

The annotated and unannotated reftigs were then compared with respect to the proportion of contigs and singletons as well as GC content in order to explore if unannotated reftigs may represent non-oyster contamination in the 454 sequences. The number of unique genes represented by the transcriptome was then identified by grouping reftigs that shared the same GenBank gene identifier.</p><p>We considered genes as osmoregulatory candidates if they were included in the 1,241 annotated genes found to be differentially expressed in <italic>C. gigas</italic> adults in response to six different salinity treatments when compared to a control salinity of 30 Table S21 in

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], clustering of assembled reftigs was explored as a method of consolidating alleles that remained apart after assembly. Consolidating alleles is an important consideration before using a transcriptome assembly as a reference for RNAseq expression analyses because oversplit alleles in the assembly will decrease the number of reads that map uniquely. A total of 136,000 reftigs (86.7%) were longer than 200&#x000a0;bp and used for clustering at different sequence identity thresholds. Comparing the change in total reftig number resulting from increasingly permissive clustering, the rate of reftig consolidation was initially rapid based on thresholds from 99% to 95%; then the rate of change slowed and was nearly constant between 95% and 80% (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As the sequence identity threshold decreased, the ratio of contigs to singletons increased as expected if singletons were being clustered with greater frequency than contigs (Table&#x000a0;

The clustering threshold has a trivial effect on the proportion of reftigs annotated and the number of osmoregulatory candidates recovered. With 42.8% of Illumina reads uniquely mapping, transcriptomes based on more permissive clustering have a greater percentage of annotated reftigs with reads mapped to them as well as a greater percentage of uniquely mapped reads.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Transcriptomes resulting from both the 95% and 80% sequence identity thresholds were annotated for comparison. Both transcriptomes had a similar percentage of reftigs successfully annotated, with a similar distribution of contigs and singletons. Likewise, 1,014 osmoregulatory candidates (see below) were obtained with the 95% threshold and this dropped by only seven candidate genes at the 80% threshold (Table&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The large percentage (99.4%) of candidate genes that remain in the transcriptome at the 80% threshold compared to the 95% threshold suggests that any potential paralog clustering resulted in a minimal loss in the number of uniquely annotated genes, particularly osmoregulatory candidates.</p><p>We mapped 100&#x000a0;bp Illumina RNAseq reads from a single individual to the 95% and 80% transcriptomes to test whether oversplit alleles were consolidated by clustering. Relative to the 95% transcriptome, the 80% transcriptome had a higher percentage of annotated reftigs with mapped reads, but the effect was small (Table&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In terms of the proportion of Illumina reads that mapped, two percent more reads mapped uniquely to the 80% transcriptome than the 95% transcriptome. The increase in the percent of uniquely mapped reads in the 80% transcriptome suggests that consolidation of allelic reftigs was achieved by clustering, resulting in more reads mapping uniquely. Based on these results the 80% threshold transcriptome was chosen for further analysis.</p><p>In one cluster examined in more detail, an original contig annotated as Heat Shock 70 kDA Protein 12 was ultimately clustered with three singletons. Two singletons clustered at the 95% threshold. The third singleton (330&#x000a0;bp) was unannotated at the 95% threshold. With a similarity of 84.55% estimated by Cd-hit, it was clustered with the contig and the other two singletons at the 80% threshold. An alignment between this third singleton and the original contig showed five indels ranging in size from 1 to 17&#x000a0;bp and two polymorphisms as the cause for the 84.55% sequence identity. We suspect these indels represent 454 sequencing error because they were partially shared across the three singletons, most of them would disrupt the reading frame, and they occurred within simple nucleotide repeats and low complexity sequence. Some of the SNPs present in the singletons may also be sequencing error but not obviously so; most were not adjacent to indels and they were already represented in the original contig. Therefore, clustering provided two distinct transcriptome improvements: (1) oversplit alleles were consolidated, facilitating downstream mapping to the transcriptome for RNAseq expression analysis, and (2) more of the 454 sequencing coverage was used to call SNPs.</p><p>The optimum balance between consolidating oversplit alleles and clustering paralogs or sequence errors is impossible to know because it depends on the distribution of allelic sequence differences relative to paralog differences in any particular species as well as the sequencing error rate. The comparative approach used here was ad hoc and took advantage of computational efficiencies when clustering consensus sequences from an assembly rather than exploring parameter values in separate assemblies. When no reference genome is available, this comparative empirical approach can be a valuable method of improving transcriptome quality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Annotation results</title><p>The BLASTx search against multiple databases provided annotation for 50,736 reftigs (51.4%) representing 20,249 unique GenBank accessions and 16,392 distinct putative proteins that we will refer to as genes.

Singletons made up ~74% of the reftigs in the full (annotated and unannotated) 80% transcriptome and less than half of the singletons were successfully annotated. Other studies using 454 sequencing also have described singletons as comprising a large proportion of their transcriptome (e.g. 81.7%

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]; 55.3%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]) with a subset getting annotated. Singletons are the inevitable consequence of assembling transcripts with low coverage, so they are not necessarily indicative of contamination. However, here the mean GC content for annotated reftigs was 44% (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.4%), very similar to the 45.2% (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.3%) average for <italic>C. gigas</italic> coding sequences (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In contrast, the unannotated portion of the <italic>C. virginica</italic> transcriptome had a significantly different mean GC content of 34.5% (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.8%) (Figure&#x000a0;

Also, given that buffering against osmotic stress is a chronic physiological need for oysters, lower asymmetry among osmoregulatory candidates might reflect the proportion of genes within this functional category that have constitutive expression across salinities.</p><p>It is difficult to know how much asymmetry to expect by chance for genes with a given level of expression in normalized libraries. However, enrichment of functional categories within the set of population-specific genes is not expected from stochastic variation in library normalization or read coverage. Our prediction was that among asymmetric genes, annotations related to osmoregulatory function should be the most highly enriched relative to the frequency of functional ontologies in the overall annotated transcriptome. We initially built a frame of reference by testing for functional enrichment among the entire set of osmoregulatory candidate genes in <italic>C. virginica</italic> and found 12 cellular component GO terms and 86 molecular function GO terms significantly enriched compared to the complete annotated gene set (Figures&#x000a0;

For the high salinity population, significant enrichment was found for potential osmoregulatory terms related to &#x02018;substrate-specific transporter&#x02019; and &#x02018;transmembrane transporter&#x02019; activities such as &#x02018;receptor activity&#x02019; (GO:0004872, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.8e-06), &#x02018;gated channel activity&#x02019; (GO:0022839, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.00022), and &#x02018;ion gated channel activity&#x02019; (GO:0022839, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0022) (Additional file

These enrichment results are consistent with expectations for differential expression of osmoregulatory genes by juvenile eastern oysters from different salinity regimes. Furthermore, it confirms the functional relevance in <italic>C. virginica</italic> of osmoregulatory candidates identified in <italic>C. gigas</italic>.</p><p>At the level of reftigs, rather than genes, among those with annotations linked to osmoregulatory function in <italic>C. gigas</italic> (9703 reftigs), 57.3% showed expression in only one of the two populations. This high frequency of asymmetry is in striking contrast to the 11% asymmetry measured at the gene level among osmoregulatory candidates. One possible explanation for this pattern is that asymmetric reftigs represent differentially expressed splice variants of genes expressed by both populations. This hypothesis will be testable with the benefit of this transcriptome as a reference for RNA-seq analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>SNP Discovery and dN/dS ratio with C. gigas</title><p>The transcriptome we present here provides the most comprehensive estimate of polymorphism to date for <italic>C. virginica</italic>. Among 13,108 annotated contigs, there was 12,355,575&#x000a0;bp of aligned sequence within which 218,777 SNPs were identified. Average SNP density was 0.0185 per base pair with a standard deviation of 0.0238 (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Ninety percent of contigs had at least one predicted SNP. This SNP density falls within the range previously reported for the eastern oyster. Quilang et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] found a rate of 0.0059 SNPs/bp from 4,688 EST sequences. In contrast, Zhang and Guo
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] estimated 0.042 SNPs/bp based on resequencing 6.8&#x000a0;kb of ESTs. Similarly, a single gene study of serine protease inhibitor reported an overall SNP frequency of 0.044/bp
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. For comparison, SNP density averaged across all exons in wild-caught <italic>C. gigas</italic> was 0.0102 per bp
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Our finding is therefore consistent with previous estimates of nucleotide heterozygosity in <italic>C. virginica</italic> and tentatively supports the contention that this species is more polymorphic than <italic>C. gigas</italic>

Also, the ratio of substitution rates at nonsynonymous and synonymous sites can help to identify genes undergoing positive selection. After various filtering steps to remove potential artifacts and paralog gene pairs, 26,102 annotated reftigs from <italic>C. virginica</italic> were paired with an ortholog from <italic>C. gigas</italic>. Estimates for the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site ranged from near 0 to 0.012/bp per ortholog gene pair (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>A) while the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site ranged from 0.0003 to 0.66/bp (Figure&#x000a0;

<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>C) indicates a pervasive role for purifying selection maintaining similar amino acid sequences. The mean protein similarity was 76.8%, and the mean nucleotide similarity was 74.2%. It is possible that these divergence estimates between the oyster congeners are biased downward because filtering steps (see Methods) inevitably removed some more divergent ortholog pairs.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>

At the same time, transcriptomes in these two species are probably too diverged to expect <italic>C. gigas</italic> genomic reference sequences to help with <italic>C. virginica</italic> bioinformatics. A simulation study by Vijay et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] demonstrated that reference genomes with average nucleotide sequence divergence up to 15% can help improve transcriptome assemblies while with greater divergence there was no improvement over a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly. Similarly, the potential for a heterologous reference genome to provide improved RNA-seq analyses, relative to a <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly, was determined to be at nucleotide sequence divergences less than 15%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The goal of our study was to assemble and annotate the <italic>C. virginica</italic> transcriptome with particular focus on potential osmoregulatory genes. Largely with the benefit of the Pacific oyster genome, we assigned provisional annotations to 50,736 reftigs representing over 16,000 putative proteins. More than 80% of the osmoregulatory gene candidates identified in <italic>C. gigas</italic> experiments with adults were identified here in wild juvenile samples from different salinities. The low dN/dS between <italic>C. virginica</italic> and <italic>C. gigas</italic> indicates purifying selection in the coding regions of orthologous genes and provides justification that genes identified as osmoregulatory in <italic>C. gigas</italic> are likely to maintain the same function in <italic>C. virginica.</italic> Even stronger justification is reported for a subset of osmoregulatory candidates that were expressed in only one of the two different salinity populations. Genes with an asymmetric expression pattern across the salinity gradient were significantly enriched for functions that may be related to osmoregulation, consistent with these genes having osmoregulatory functions in <italic>C. virginica</italic>.</p><p>Additionally, we have demonstrated that permissive clustering of contig and singleton sequences may improve downstream applications of assembled transcriptomes. In some <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly studies, the singleton reftigs are discarded and only the contigs are analyzed. Such a stringent filter, if applied here to <italic>C. virginica</italic>, would have eliminated 37,717 singletons that were successfully annotated. The goal of clustering is to keep the singletons and reduce redundancy across reftigs that can result from <italic>de novo</italic> assembly challenges due to factors such as sequencing error and high levels of polymorphism. Several studies employing programs such as Cd-hit to cluster sequences based on similarity used a threshold of 95% similarity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. We explored a range of threshold values from 99% down to the lower limit of the algorithm at 80%. The improvement in uniquely mapped reads may be beneficial for downstream applications, depending on experimental goals. For RNA-seq experiments, a greater number of uniquely mapped reads means that a greater percentage of data can be retained for the estimation of expression. Future development of these clustering procedures should focus on evaluating trade-offs, particularly with respect to the incorporation of sequencing error at more permissive clustering thresholds.</p><p>Finally, we have provided a valuable set of resources for eastern oyster research. We have annotated 50,736 reftigs, doubling the 48,183 <italic>C. virginica</italic> transcriptome contig sequences provided by Zhang et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. After careful filtering of these reftigs, we identified 218,777 candidate SNPs for use in genetic mapping or for population analyses. The 1,007 candidate genes for osmoregulation identified here will provide a reference for future studies on the molecular basis of osmoregulation in <italic>C. virginica</italic>, phenotypically plastic responses to salinity stress, and patterns of selective differentiation across heterogeneous environments.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Availability of supporting data</title><p>The data sets supporting the results of this article are available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Short Read Archive, accession numbers SRS502377 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SRS502377">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SRS502377</ext-link>) and SRS502378 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SRS502378">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SRS502378</ext-link>), and in FigShare (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.873865">http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.873865</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec17"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12864_2013_6237_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx"><caption><p>Additional file 1: Table S1: Annotation of osmoregulatory candidate transcriptome reftigs from C. virginica.
