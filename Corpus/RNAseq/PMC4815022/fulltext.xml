In the embryo, glycine and GABA are depolarizing due the immature chloride gradient, which is only reversed to become hyperpolarizing later in post-natal development. We previously showed that glycine regulates neurogenesis <italic>via</italic> paracrine signaling that promotes calcium transients in neural stem cells (NSCs) and their differentiation into interneurons within the spinal cord of the zebrafish embryo. However, the subjacent molecular mechanisms are not yet understood. Our previous work suggests that early neuronal progenitors were not differentiating correctly in the developing spinal cord. As a result, we aimed at identifying the downstream molecular mechanisms involved specifically in NSCs during glycine-dependent embryonic neurogenesis. Using a <italic>gfap:GFP</italic> transgenic line, we successfully purified NSCs by fluorescence-activated cell sorting from whole zebrafish embryos and in embryos in which the glycine receptor was knocked down. The strength of this approach is that it focused on the NSC population while tackling the biological issue in an <italic>in vivo</italic> context in whole zebrafish embryos. After sequencing the transcriptome by RNA-sequencing, we analyzed the genes whose expression was changed upon disruption of glycine signaling and we confirmed the differential expression by independent RTqPCR assay. While over a thousand genes showed altered expression levels, through pathway analysis we identified 14 top candidate genes belonging to five different canonical signaling pathways (signaling by calcium, TGF-beta, sonic hedgehog, Wnt, and p53-related apoptosis) that are likely to mediate the promotion of neurogenesis by glycine.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>interneuron</kwd><kwd>glycine</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Canadian Institutes of Health Research<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000024</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Fonds de Recherche du Qu&#x000e9;bec &#x02013; Sant&#x000e9;<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000156</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="32"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurogenesis is a crucial step in vertebrate development and it requires multiple and integrated signals throughout development to be achieved correctly (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Urban and Guillemot, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Mitrousis et al., 2015</xref>). Many factors have already been identified as regulators of neurogenesis in the spinal cord (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Jessell, 2000</xref>) and glycine signaling has been recently shown to be one of those (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">McDearmid et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to being the smallest and the simplest of the essential amino acids, glycine is also a neurotransmitter involved in inhibitory circuits. With gamma-aminobutyric acid or GABA, they are the two major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system, with glycine acting mainly in the brainstem and in the spinal cord.</p><p>During development, prior to glutamatergic innervation, neural activity mainly relies on glycinergic and GABAergic neurotransmission (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ben-Ari, 2002</xref>). Interestingly, although these neurotransmitters are mostly inhibitory in the adult neural system, they elicit an excitatory activity in the early embryo. Indeed, contrary to their hyperpolarizing role in adult neurons, GABA and glycine result in a chloride-induced membrane depolarization in the embryo, which generates the earliest forms of electrical signaling in the immature nervous system. This switch in the electrical activity of these neurotransmitters has been correlated with the late expression of the neuron-specific and extrusive chloride/potassium co-transporter2 (KCC2), which decreases chloride load in mature neurons and therefore underlies the hyperpolarisation of the cell when the glycine receptors (GlyRs) open. In contrast, in embryonic neurons the chloride load is higher and glycine binding to GlyRs provokes a release of chloride ions and therefore induces a depolarization of the cell. This excitatory effect of glycine during embryonic development is necessary for a broad range of neurogenic processes from formation to maturation of neuronal circuits (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ben-Ari, 2002</xref>). Of particular interest, mutations of glycine signaling, such as mutations in GlyRs (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Pilorge et al., 2015</xref>) and KCC2 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Merner et al., 2015</xref>), have recently been implicated in autism, arguably impacting on neurogenesis.</p><p>Previously, our group discovered an early role of glycine during neurogenesis in the spinal cord, which starts during the first day post-fertilization (dpf), prior to hatching after 2 dpf. Glycine acts to promote the differentiation of neural progenitors specifically into interneurons (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">McDearmid et al., 2006</xref>) in a process that is impeded upon KCC2 expression (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds et al., 2008</xref>). More recently, we showed that paracrine release of glycine is necessary and sufficient to drive correct interneuron differentiation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cote and Drapeau, 2012</xref>) and that this involves calcium transients in neural progenitors (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brustein et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, our previous work showed that unlike in wild type embryos, proliferating neural progenitors in the spinal cord of embryos in which glycine signaling is impaired are still very numerous at later stages of development (i.e., 3 dpf) as they fail to differentiate (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">McDearmid et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cote and Drapeau, 2012</xref>). As a result, we concluded that glycine signaling is most likely to play a role in regulating the differentiation of early neural progenitors or neural stem cells (NSCs) into interneurons during spinal cord development.</p><p>Although the requirement for glycine signaling for interneuron neurogenesis is now well established, the subjacent molecular mechanisms are not yet understood. In this work, we aimed at shedding light on the molecular action of glycine signaling during neural development and to identify the downstream molecular pathways involved. We took advantage of a transgenic line in which NSCs are fluorescently labeled in order to develop a protocol to specifically purify the NSC population from whole embryos by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). After mRNA purification, we performed next generation sequencing to access the transcriptome of NSCs purified from embryos in which glycine signaling had been disrupted by morpholino knockdown. This allowed us to compare the set of genes differentially expressed in NSCs purified from <italic>glra4a</italic> morpholino-injected versus control morpholino-injected and non-injected zebrafish embryos and we confirmed their differential expression by independent RTqPCR assay. Using pathway analysis and clustering tools, we identified several canonical signaling pathways involved in glycine-dependent neurogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Fish Husbandry</title><p>Wild-type zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were reared at 28.5&#x000b0;C, kept under a 12-h dark, 12-h light cycle, and staged as described previously (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Kimmel et al., 1995</xref>).

Since we aimed at studying the transcriptomic changes induced by GlyR knockdown specifically in NSCs, we set up a protocol to purify this population of cells from whole zebrafish embryos. As a result, we conserved the integrity of the embryonic <italic>in vivo</italic> context but <italic>in fine</italic> we only focused on our cells of interest. Using a protease cocktail (see Materials and Methods), we successfully dissociated 20 hpf embryos into single cells and we were able to perform a FACS purification of GFP+ cells (e.g., NSCs) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). As shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>, the quality of the single-cell dissociation was suitable for subsequent FACS with more than 50% healthy single cells. After doublet elimination and using a 530/30 BP filter, the GFP+ population (i.e., NSCs) was easily distinguishable from the negative batch as separate peaks in the cell count (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref></bold>). In order to prevent any contamination with GFP- cell types, we increased the stringency of the sorting by only selecting cells with a high GFP expression (&#x0003e;3,000 fluorescence units). Finally, to ensure the specificity of the sorting and the integrity of the purified cells, we performed a quality control by further analyzing the GFP+ sorted cells (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C,D</xref></bold>). We found that about 81% of cells survived and more than 97% of them were GFP+.

By filtering more stringently with a |logFC| &#x0003e; 2 (at least 4 fold up- or down-regulation), we could narrow down this number to 141 genes (dark red in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref></bold>).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of Pathways Involved in Glycine-Dependent Neurogenesis</title><p>Using the freely available DAVID bioinformatics resources (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Huang da et al., 2009</xref>) and through orthologous extrapolation from the IPA software (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, QIAGEN) we performed pathway analysis using our list of 1,162 specific genes differentially expressed in NSCs upon GlyR knockdown. To this aim, we used the KEGG annotation of identified pathways involving genes of our list. Interestingly, five main molecular pathways came out from this analysis as being enriched in our dataset (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;E</xref></bold>): signaling by (i) calcium, (ii) TGF-beta, (iii) sonic hedgehog, (iv) Wnt, and (v) p53-related apoptosis. Regarding calcium signaling, we found CACNA2D4B and other calcium channels (CACNG1, CACNG8B, and CACNB2B) to be upregulated. Consistently, upon GlyR knockdown, the ITPR1 intracellular calcium channel expressed at the endoplasmic reticulum was also upregulated. Besides, the expression of genes encoding the G&#x003b1;q GNA14 and the downstream phospholipases C (PLCD1A/4A), which activate ITRP1, were also upregulated in our dataset. Interestingly, we found that some calcium-dependent proteins such as calmodulin kinases CAMK2D1 and CAMK4, the proline-rich tyrosine kinase PTK2BB and the nitric oxide synthase 1 NOS1 were upregulated in NSCs upon GlyR knockdown. Finally, some transcription factors regulated by calmodulin kinases and belonging to the CREB complex were downregulated in our dataset (ATF4B2, ATF7IP, and ATF7A) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4</label><caption><p><bold>Identified signaling pathways downstream to glycine in NSCs.</bold> Representation of the pathways identified and of the key genes involved according to KEGG and IPA.

By specifically looking into these cells after GlyR gene knockdown, we identified five signaling pathways that are very likely to play a role downstream to glycine. One of the most interesting pathways that we found is calcium signaling. Its involvement is consistent with our previous work in which we found that glycine-induced calcium transients in neuronal progenitors are required for neurogenesis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brustein et al., 2013</xref>). Our present work suggests that calcium homeostasis is affected in NSCs upon GlyR knockdown and it identified specific members of this pathway as key molecular factors involved. Interestingly, although many proteins involved in intracellular calcium release (membrane calcium channels, ITPR1) as well as downstream effectors (CAMK4) were upregulated, the final targets of the pathway (ATF family transcription factors) were downregulated. This shows the complexity of the interpretation of such a large dataset. However, one could speculate that upon GlyR gene knockdown, calcium transients are disrupted in NSCs and that a compensatory mechanism is set up in order to rescue the entry of calcium into the cells. Moreover, it would be very interesting to identify among our dataset the secondary target genes that are likely to be misregulated because of the reduced expression of CREB complex members (AFT4B2, ATF7IP, ATF7A). These genes are normally regulated by these transcription factors and could be involved in NSC fate differentiation that would explain the specific loss of the interneuron population in the spinal cord.</p><p>Three other signaling pathways identified (TGF-beta, WNT, and SHH signaling) are also very good candidate since their implication in neurogenesis has been exhaustively reviewed (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aigner and Bogdahn, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Mathieu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Faigle and Song, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Varela-Nallar and Inestrosa, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Urban and Guillemot, 2014</xref>). Indeed, the three of them are widely involved in embryonic and/or adult neurogenesis through modulation of cellular behaviors and their identification here helps confirm the usefulness of our progenitor FACS/RNAseq approach.</p><p>Bone Morphogenetic Proteins are the largest subgroup of the TGFs and they have been involved in numerous biological processes from cell survival and proliferation to differentiation in particular during the development of the central nervous system (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Niswander, 2005</xref>). They have been characterized as inhibitors of neurogenesis during early development as they promote the development of ectoderm tissue at the expense of neuronal fate (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Wilson and Hemmati-Brivanlou, 1995</xref>). Furthermore, both noggin-mediated BMP inhibition and chemical BMP inhibition have been shown to promote proliferation of NSCs and therefore neurogenesis (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Neely et al., 2012</xref>). However, the role played by BMPs is more complex in the adult brain where their blockade leads to the depletion of the stem cell niches, suggesting a role of BMPs in the maintenance of stemness and therefore of long-term adult neurogenesis (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Mira et al., 2010</xref>). Our analysis indicates that BMP2B, BMP4 and BMP6 are all three upregulated in NSCs upon GlyR knockdown (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G,H</xref></bold>). According to the literature, this finding would be consistent with an inhibition of neurogenesis. Moreover, SMAD3 transcription factor, a target of TGFs that is also a crucial player promoting neurogenesis in adult mice (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Symes, 2010</xref>), is downregulated in our dataset (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I</xref></bold>). Altogether, these results suggest that the abnormal neurogenesis induced by GlyR knockdown could be, at least in part, due to misregulation of TGF-related proteins.</p><p>Sonic HedgeHog signaling is important for the patterning of the dorso-ventral neuron types within the developing neural tube where it promotes ventral identities (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Rowitch and Kriegstein, 2010</xref>). Therefore, its modulation could more likely be involved in a shift in cell fate. Although we did not previously observe that the lack of interneuron population upon GlyR blockade was made at the expense of another neuronal cell population (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cote and Drapeau, 2012</xref>), we can speculate that SHH signaling could be involved in the differentiation process of this specific interneuron population. Indeed, SHH signaling has been reported as modulating NSC proliferation and therefore the generation of newborn olfactory interneurons from the adult sub ventricular zone (SVZ) in mammals (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Palma et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>WNT signaling was shown as positively regulating neurogenesis in mammalian embryos (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Kalani et al., 2008</xref>). Not only is it required for the generation of different types of neurons, but it also plays a role in the self-renewal properties of NSCs. Two inhibitors of the WNT pathway (WIF1 and DKK1B) were upregulated upon GlyR knockdown (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5K,L</xref></bold>), thus allowing us to assume that Wnt-dependent neurogenic processes could be silenced in NSCs when glycine signaling is impaired. Consistently, it has been reported that WNT inhibition through DKK1 overexpression prevents neuronal production during mouse embryonic neurogenesis (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Munji et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, the downstream target FOSL1A (upregulated in our dataset, <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5M</xref></bold>) is a transcription factor regulating the expression of a broad panel of genes, some of them being necessary for cell proliferation although in endothelial cells (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Evellin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Even more interestingly, interactions between these signaling pathways have been recently shown to be requisite for stem cell differentiation. In fact, WNT and SHH pathways act downstream of TGF signaling to promote dopaminergic neuronal differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2013</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate WNT, SHH, and TGF-beta signaling as top candidate pathways involved downstream of glycine to promote neurogenesis, though the molecular mechanisms involved could be more complex through the integration of multiple canonical pathways.</p><p>Lastly, our gene expression analysis identified P53 as being upregulated specifically upon GlyR knockdown (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5N</xref></bold>). Interestingly, P53 activation has been recently shown as regulating neurogenesis by increasing proliferation and differentiation of hippocampal NSCs <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Grigor&#x02019;eva and Glazova, 2015</xref>). However, P53 is better known as a pro-apoptotic factor, suggesting that NSCs might die in the absence of glycine signaling. Our previous work did not detect an increase in cell death in the developing spinal cord of morphants at 48hpf (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">McDearmid et al., 2006</xref>), although it could occur at the earlier stage examined here (20 hpf). P53 is often upregulated after injection of morpholinos, but our 5 base-mismatched control morpholino injection did not show any upregulation of p53 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5N</xref></bold>). As a result, more discrete cell death could arise in a subpopulation of neural progenitors in the developing spinal cord.</p><p>The next step in deciphering the molecular aspects of glycine-dependent neurogenesis will be to perform functional genomics on the candidate genes we identified. Such a characterisation is beyond the scope of the present work as a large effort needs now to be deployed to understand the function of these molecular actors. Zebrafish would be a suitable model for such an analysis since the embryo is easily genetically accessible. Lastly, our present work widens the use of zebrafish as a model of developmental biology. Indeed, we took advantage of advanced cell purification techniques to precisely look within our cells of interest but without dismantling the <italic>in vivo</italic> context in which cells develop. As a result, zebrafish embryos can be considered as <italic>in vivo</italic> test tubes in which it becomes more and more easy to dig for molecular characterization of phenotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>AB validated the <italic>in vivo</italic> morpholino knockdown.
