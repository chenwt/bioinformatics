We identified 164 significantly differentially expressed transcriptional regulators and detailed the cellular programs associated with general and stressor-specific responses, many previously unexplored. Pattern-based, comparative genomic analyses enabled us, for the first time, to construct a detailed picture of the genetic circuitry underlying the stress response. Notably, a list of the regulons and DNA binding motifs of the stress-related transcription factors were identified: two heat-shock response regulators, HrcA and CtsR; the SOS response regulator LexA; the redox sensor Rex; and the peroxide sensor PerR. Moreover, several transcriptional regulators controlling stress-responsive amino acid and purine metabolism and their regulons were also identified, including ArgR (arginine biosynthesis and catabolism regulator), HisR (histidine biosynthesis regulator), CymR (cysteine metabolism repressor) and PurR (purine metabolism repressor).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Using an exceptionally large set of temporal transcriptional data and regulon analyses, we successfully built a STRING-based stress response network model integrating important players for the general and specialized metabolite stress response in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic>.

It can utilize a wide variety of substrates to produce metabolites useful as industrial chemicals and biofuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Most of these metabolites, and notably butyrate and butanol, are toxic to the cells greatly impacting their metabolism and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Several studies have been published in the last few years aiming to understand the transcriptional and translational basis of metabolite stress response, yet the regulatory network beneath these responses remains incompletely understood at the systems level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. What transpires from the data of these studies is that the metabolite stress response includes virtually all annotated genes of the core stress program (the so-called heat-shock protein (HSP) response) but also many other large programs, including amino-acid and nucleic-acid biosynthetic pathways. Such programs are apparently underlying the adaptive response of the cells to these toxic metabolites. This adaptive response includes changes in membrane composition, such as increasing the fatty acid tail length and percentage of saturated fatty acids, which is known as homeoviscous adaptation in response to the fluidizing effects of organic solvents and acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Many bacterial genome sequences have been completed and successfully annotated, but most lack information on the regulatory front of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Understanding the complex regulatory circuitry comprised of transcription factors (TFs) and their corresponding DNA targets, including the motifs or transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), is a fundamental requirement for understanding the complexity of responses in natural habitats and microbiomes, but also for building systems-level molecular models. Integrated use of detailed experimental data and <italic>in silico</italic> analyses is necessary for reconstructing transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], which improve our understanding of complex phenotypes and facilitate the development of novel strains using synthetic biology.</p><p>In this study, we applied a comparative-genomics, pattern-based approach to analyze a deep set of temporal transcriptional data to infer the transcriptional regulatory interactions underlying the metabolite stress response in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Using Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools (RSAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], footprint-discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] analysis (i.e., phylogenetic footprinting) was carried out, where the comparative analysis of the genomic context of <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> genes was successfully accomplished. Overrepresented oligonucleotides (words) or spaced pairs thereof (dyads) were detected and assembled into Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These matrices were compared against the PWMs of known TF binding DNA motifs from three public resources: RegPrecise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], RegTransbase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and PRODORIC databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] with the tool Tomtom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

For the common stress responses, facilitated by target-gene predictions for the core HSP TFs, HrcA and CtsR, we expand the list of Class I, III &#x00026; IV stress genes. For the specialized stress responses, we identify the genes and biological processes that display distinct expression patterns for each metabolite. This, coupled by a genome-scale analysis of transcriptional regulators (TRs) differentially expressed under the two stressors, led us to focus on core TFs that apparently orchestrate these stress responses. We analyzed the TFBSs and regulons of these TFs and examined the interconnectivity of their regulons thus arriving at a comprehensive picture of the transcriptional network that underlies the responses to two metabolite stresses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Overview: systems analysis identifies common and distinct cellular responses to butanol and butyrate stress</title><p>We use microarray analysis to examine the response of <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> to butanol and butyrate stress at mid-exponential phase (A<sub>600</sub>&#x02009;~&#x02009;1.0) of pH-controlled batch cultures up to 75&#x000a0;min post stress with 15&#x000a0;min intervals (0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75&#x000a0;min). For each metabolite, cultures were stressed with three different concentrations: 30&#x000a0;mM (low), 60&#x000a0;mM (medium) and 90&#x000a0;mM (high) of butanol, or with 30&#x000a0;mM (low), 40&#x000a0;mM (medium) and 50&#x000a0;mM (high) of butyrate. These stressor concentrations were selected based on previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] to obtain weak, moderate and strong stress responses. As described in the Methods section, we used a reference design to collect the data. Normalized microarray data were analyzed using significance analysis of microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] (SAM) to identify differentially expressed genes. We collected data from two biological replicates, with dye swaps for each of the 6 time points for each of the six stress conditions (butanol, butyrate; low, medium and high stress). Thus, we generated a total of 96 individual sets of stress data for each metabolite. These data constitute an extensive microarray data ensemble capturing the response of <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> to these two metabolites. The design of the microarrays based on the Agilent technology and the associated methods have been extensively validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This microarray technology offers extraordinary accuracy with many probes for each gene and multiple copies of each probe. Nevertheless, the expression data for a select subset of the genes (CAP0102, CAC1405, CAC3190, CAC0766 and CAC1391; see Methods section for details) were further validated using Q-RT-PCR from a third biological replicate.</p><p>Consistent with an earlier, lower resolution microarray study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], our data show that butanol and butyrate stress responses of <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> include not only upregulation of heat shock protein (HSP) genes, but also the differential expression of more than 1,000 genes related to many distinct physiological functions and cellular programs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Under butanol stress, 1,118 genes were differentially expressed (535 up, 575 down, 8 bimodal); whereas there are 1,390 differentially expressed genes for butyrate stress (710 up, 675 down, 5 bimodal). The union of the two includes 1,984 genes, for which K-means clustering results are shown for the butanol and butyrate stress (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S1A and B), respectively.</p><p>Comparative analysis of the butanol (BuOH) versus butyrate (BA) stress responses is essential for understanding the general (that is, the common) stress response as well as the specialized, stressor-dependent responses. Using FIVA (Functional Information Viewer and Analyzer) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], we identified the statistically significant differentially expressed functional categories based on annotated pathways (KEGG database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]) and Gene Ontology (GO) annotations (from UniProtKB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]) for the <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> genome. Each gene was assigned into one of four differentially expressed groups (up-regulation, down-regulation, bimodal and non-significant) for each stressor individually or in combination (e.g., BuOH-up/BA-up, BuOH-down/BA-down, BuOH-up/BA-down etc.). Then, the GO categories and the KEGG pathway classifications for each gene were utilized in FIVA to identify the significant functional categories enriched for each differentially expressed group.

The general stress genes are classified into four different categories based on the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> model as Class I, II, III and IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Class I stress genes are under the control of HrcA (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A), and include <italic>groES</italic>, <italic>groEL</italic>, <italic>grpE</italic>, <italic>dnaK, dnaJ</italic> and <italic>htpG</italic>. Class III stress genes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B) are under the regulation of CtsR (Class Three Stress Protein Regulator) and include <italic>clpP</italic>, <italic>clpE</italic>, <italic>clpX</italic> and the <italic>clpC</italic> operon. The operon information used in this study is based on the predicted transcriptional units by Paredes <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The HrcA and CtsR regulons are described in detail in the following sections. Class II stress genes in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> are defined as those under the regulation of the stress-specific sigma factor, &#x003c3;<sup>B</sup>. As there is no known ortholog for &#x003c3;<sup>B</sup> in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> (or any other sequenced <italic>Clostridium</italic> organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]), Class II stress genes are considered absent in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic>. Nevertheless, based on the conservation of the &#x003c3;<sup>B</sup> regulated Class II stress proteins and using OMA analysis, we identified 33 proteins in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> that are homologous to the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Class II HSPs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S2). Among them, the only genes that were differentially upregulated (i.e., CAC3187-CAC3192) belong to Class III in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic>, and the rest show weak differential expression, thus further supporting the absence of Class II HSP regulation in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic>. Class IV stress genes are defined as the stress related genes that are not under the control of HrcA<italic>,</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>B</sup> or CtsR. 72 genes that were overexpressed under both butanol and butyrate stress (SAM analysis; fold change&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1.5 at 0.05 FDR), but that they were not identified as Class I or III genes, were thus identified as Class IV stress genes in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S3). This is a much larger list than previously identified in this organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] or any <italic>Clostridium</italic>. This large Class IV set includes genes from carbohydrate metabolism, histidine metabolism, the <italic>sol</italic>-locus genes (CAP0162-CAP0165), genes related to biosynthesis of membrane and cell-wall components, and stress responsive transcriptional regulators/factors (TRs, TFs).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>The expression of predicted target genes for HrcA (A) and CtsR (B).</bold> The putative regulon structure is shown for HrcA <bold>(C)</bold> and CtsR <bold>(D)</bold> (see text for details).

Successful identification of TFBSs for many <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> genes suggests good similarity of binding motifs between <italic>Clostridium</italic> organisms and other Gram<sup>+</sup> bacteria. Among them, HrcA and CtsR are the two TFs orchestrating the core HSP response.</p><sec><title>The HrcA regulon</title><p>Parts of the HrcA and CtsR regulons in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> have been examined previously. Notably, it was shown that the <italic>dnaKJ</italic> and <italic>groESL</italic> operons are HrcA dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], whereas <italic>hsp18</italic> is not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Our sequence analysis indicates that phylogenetically conserved HrcA binding sites are present upstream of four operons: <italic>hrcA-grpE-dnaK-dnaJ</italic> (CAC1280-CAC1283), <italic>groESL</italic> (CAC2704-CAC2703), CAC2705 and <italic>htpG</italic> (CAC3315) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A &#x00026; C), with the first two corroborated by Bahl <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. All these operons, except for CAC2705, were highly overexpressed during the time course of all the tested butanol and butyrate stresses in this study, which is consistent with previous reports. Although its HrcA binding site is the same as for its adjacent <italic>groESL</italic> operon, CAC2705 shows significantly weaker overexpression than the other genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], thus suggesting that it is regulated by an additional TF. The function of the membrane protein CAC2705 or any of its orthologs is unknown. Overall, the function of HrcA in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> is likely similar to that in many other well studied organisms, which is to maintain low basal levels of expression of the <italic>dnaK</italic>, <italic>dnaJ</italic>, <italic>groESL</italic> and <italic>htpG</italic> operons in the absence of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Upon exposure to stress, these operons are no longer repressed and instead get strongly upregulated. The underlying regulatory mechanism is apparently complex because when <italic>hrcA</italic> transcription is upregulated, it should lead to the synthesis of more HrcA repressor protein and therefore the repression of these operons should get stronger. But this is in contrast to the fact that these operons get upregulated at the same time as <italic>hrcA</italic> is upregulated. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, complex post-transcriptional regulations of the <italic>hrcA</italic> operon, based on mRNA processing and stability, ensures the production of the operon&#x02019;s proteins in the amounts needed by the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Additionally, HrcA is activated by the free GroESL protein complex under normal conditions, but during stress, titration of GroESL by unfolded proteins constrains HrcA activation, thus ensuring additional post-translational control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The CtsR regulon</title><p>Phylogenetic footprinting analysis of the <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> genome revealed the presence of CtsR operator sites upstream of <italic>ctsR-yacH-yacI-clpC</italic> (CAC3192-CAC3189) and <italic>hsp18</italic> (CAC3714) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. By obtaining the <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> orthologs for all the target genes of CtsR regulons in RegPrecise, we found additional putative target genes in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic>, including the operon of <italic>sms-disA</italic> (CAC3188-CAC3187) and <italic>hrcA-grpE-dnaK-dnaJ</italic> (CAC1280-CAC1283) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B &#x00026; D), whose TFBSs are less similar to CtsR DNA motifs (via Matrix Scan, see Methods section) than those of <italic>ctsR</italic> and <italic>hsp18</italic> operons.

DisA (CAC3187) likely participates in a DNA-damage check-point that is active prior to asymmetric division when DNA is damaged, like in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. DisA in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> forms globular foci that rapidly scan along the chromosomes during sporulation, searching for lesions. When a lesion is present, DisA pauses at the lesion site. This triggers a cellular response that culminates in a temporary block in sporulation initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. CtsR, although a repressor of HSPs, was observed to have higher expression of its transcripts during the onset of stress, similar to HrcA. Repression of CtsR under stress is overcome by its inactivation through phosphorylation of arginine residues by YacI. YacI under normal conditions is bound to ClpC, but is activated under stress by YacH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Stressor-dependent stress responses</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>Many genes in the COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) category of amino acid transport and metabolism displayed different patterns of expression under the two stresses.

As shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, 5 genes (i.e., <italic>atpA, atpD, atpE, atpF</italic> and <italic>atpH</italic>) (within the CAC2872-CAC2864 operon), involved in ATP synthesis coupled to proton transport, were upregulated under butyrate stress only. Nine genes involved in polysaccharide catabolic processes (CAC0911-CAC0917, CAC3469 and CAC1359) were upregulated under butanol stress only, with a few genes among them also upregulated by transient butanol pulse in chemostat cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The majority of the genes involved in cobalamin biosynthesis were down-regulated under butyrate stress but not under butanol stress, which is consistent with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. They include 14 genes, <italic>cbiM, cbiG, cobT, cbiP, cobB, cbiC, cbiD, cbiT, cobI/cbiL, cbiF/cobM, cbiH/cobJ, cobU, cobS</italic> and <italic>cobC</italic>, which are part of the CAC1365-CAC1386 operon. This suggests a lowered need for cobalamin for the strain under butyrate stress. Cobalamin is a necessary cofactor for various reactions involving rearrangements including glycerol dehydratases for glycerol metabolism and transmethylation for the formation of methionine from homocysteine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. 27 out of 48 ribosomal protein-encoding genes were downregulated under butyrate stress. Among them, 18 were only downregulated under butyrate stress but not so under butanol stress (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S4). These data suggest that translation is suppressed during butyrate stress at all three stressor levels (low, medium and high), consistent with the previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Amino- and nucleic-acid biosynthesis</title><p><bold>

For example, their expression was more strongly upregulated at the low compared to high butyrate stress. In addition, they show different expression patterns from those reported by Alsaker <italic>et al.</italic> in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] when comparing the low and medium levels of butyrate stress at 30, 45, and 60&#x000a0;min post stress. These differences can be ascribed to the different experimental conditions used in the two studies. In the 2010 study, Clostridial Growth Medium (CGM) containing yeast extract was used without pH control in static-flask cultures, whereas in the current study, a defined medium was employed in agitated bioreactors with pH controlled at 5.0. Based on the fact that butyrate inhibition is pH dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and that pH-dependent growth play a crucial role in the cellular adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], our assessment is that these difference are predominantly due to the impact of pH, but also perhaps the presence of arginine or intermediates of its biosynthesis in the complex CGM medium. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and several other organisms, the arginine decarboxylase/antiporter-dependent acid-resistance (AR) system 3 (AR3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], is one of the four known AR systems protecting cells from acid stress. But as already discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], there are no ortholog genes to these or the other AR systems in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic>. Nevertheless arginine biosynthesis and transport in combination with culture pH apparently play an important role in carboxylic acid stress.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Expression patterns of genes in the arginine and histidine biosynthesis and cysteine metabolism, and the associated transcriptional regulators.

Homeoviscous membrane changes involving modifications of membrane fatty acid composition to counteract the fluidizing effects of butanol and other solvents have been extensively discussed in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

The response of these genes to butyrate stresses was strong in this study, and displayed different kinetics and strengths compared to results from Alsaker <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].

Many such identified TFBSs correspond to a subset of the core TFs in Bacillales. These include regulators that control the metabolism of amino acids and nitrogen (ArgR, CodY and CymR), carbohydrates (CcpA and CggR), biotin cofactor (BirA), fatty acids (FapR) and nucleotides (NrdR and PurR). These regulators also include TFs for metal homeostasis (Fur, MntR and Zur), respiration (Rex), sporulation (Spo0A), stress responses (CsoR, CtsR, HrcA, LexA and PerR), as well as the chromosomal replication initiation regulator DnaA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Next, we focus on selected regulators with target genes significantly differentially expressed, per our discussion above, in butanol and/or butyrate stressed <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic>. We start with the three stress-related regulators, which, unlike CtsR and HrcA, have not yet been examined at the systems level in <italic>Clostridium</italic>. We then discuss transcriptional regulators of amino acid and purine metabolism that appear to be part of the specialized metabolite stress response.</p></sec><sec><title>The core stress-associated transcription factors engaged in the butanol and butyrate stress response</title><sec><title>LexA</title><p>LexA is well-known as the primary TF controlling the SOS response, which is an inducible DNA repair system that allows bacteria to survive sudden increases in DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Even though it has been well studied in many bacteria, the LexA regulon has not been examined in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> so far. Therefore it was important to examine which genes might be under LexA control in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> and whether these SOS response genes are differentially regulated under butanol or butyrate stress. Butyrate stress, in particular, may cause acid-induced DNA damage, which is frequently compared to oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. RSAT footprint analysis led to the identification of four genes/operons with highly conserved <italic>cis</italic>-elements in their promoter regions that include LexA binding sites known as SOS boxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. These are <italic>lexA</italic> (CAC1832), <italic>recA</italic> (CAC1815), <italic>uvrB-uvrA-</italic>CAC0504-CAC0505-CAC0506-CAC0507<italic>-uvrC-</italic>CAC0509<italic>-murB</italic> (CAC0502-CAC0510), and CAC3343-CAC3344. In addition, the orthologs in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> for all target genes in LexA regulons from RegPrecise were collected using OMA search, and scanned for LexA binding site in their operon leader sequences. The operons with an identifiable LexA binding site (p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1e-3) were collected and the microarray data for their gene members are shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. Hierarchical clustering shows that <italic>lexA</italic>, <italic>recA</italic> and the <italic>uvrB</italic> operon are clustered well. This is consistent with the possibility that they are functionally correlated, like in other well studied bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Moreover, even though no ortholog of CAC3343 was listed as under LexA control in RegPrecise, our footprinting analysis together with expression data suggests that the CAC3343-CAC3344 operon is also putatively controlled by LexA. CAC3343 encodes a putative DNA modification/repair radical SAM protein and CAC3344 encodes a protein of unknown function. In addition, the operon of <italic>sbcD-sbcC</italic> (CAC2737-CAC2736; <italic>sbcD</italic>: DNA repair exonuclease; <italic>sbcC</italic>: ATPase involved in DNA repair) is clustered closely to <italic>recA</italic>, and its promoter region shows a potential LexA binding site (p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1e-3). The UvrABC repair system catalyzes the recognition and processing of DNA lesions. A damage recognition complex composed of 2 UvrA and 2 UvrB subunits scans DNA for abnormalities. Regulation of the UvrABC system by LexA is well established in many bacteria, including <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], but has not been examined in <italic>Clostridium</italic>.

As discussed, butyrate stress affects the cells similar to oxidative stress by damaging DNA, proteins and lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Therefore, we conclude that the LexA regulon in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> contains at least the following genes/operons (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>): <italic>lexA</italic> (CAC1832), <italic>recA</italic> (CAC1815), <italic>uvrB-uvrA</italic>-CAC0504-CAC0505-CAC0506-CAC0507<italic>-uvrC</italic>-CAC0509-<italic>murB</italic> (CAC0502-CAC0510), CAC3343-CAC3344, and <italic>sbcD-sbcC</italic> (CAC2737-CAC2736).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>The LexA regulon.</bold> Expression patterns <bold>(A)</bold> of predicted LexA target genes, among which, those displaying differential expression similar to <italic>lexA</italic> and <italic>uvrB</italic> (inside orange box) are shown in <bold>(B)</bold> in operon organization together with the predicted LexA DNA binding motif (the sequence logo is made with 10 TFBSs).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1752-0509-7-120-5"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Rex: the redox sensor</title><p>Rex (encoded by CAC2713) is a member for the Rex family, which includes regulators that modulate transcription in response to changes in cellular NADH/NAD&#x02009;+&#x02009;levels and more generally the redox state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].

Furthermore, our <italic>de novo</italic> motif prediction with MOTIFATOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>] suggests an ArgR binding site upstream of CAC0380. CAC0380 was previously annotated as a periplasmic amino acid-binding protein, but now with our prediction of ArgR binding site for this gene, we suspect it is an arginine-binding protein with a possible role in AR3 mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>HisR: histidine biosynthesis regulator</title><p>As discussed, histidine biosynthesis genes are dynamically upregulated under both butanol and butyrate stress (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S6). RSAT phylogenetic footprinting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] analysis shows a well conserved motif upstream of the <italic>hisZ</italic> genes in organisms of the Clostridia class. The <italic>C. acetobutylicum hisZ</italic> gene is in an operon of 10 genes (CAC0935-CAC0944), including <italic>hisZ</italic>, <italic>hisG</italic>, <italic>hisD</italic>, <italic>hisB</italic>, <italic>hisH</italic>, <italic>hisA</italic>, <italic>hisF</italic>, <italic>hisI</italic>, <italic>hisE</italic> and <italic>tkt</italic>. Nine of them show a dynamic upregulation under both butanol and butyrate stress (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). The <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the upstream region of <italic>hisZ</italic> genes in Clostridia class (identified by phylogenetic footprinting) bear high similarity to the DNA motif recognized by HisR of <italic>Staphylococcaceae</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S9). According to OMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>], CAC2675 is an ortholog of <italic>hisR,</italic> which is predicted to be present in several other Gram<sup>+</sup> organisms in RegPrecise. Based on its orthology to the corresponding target genes assigned in HisR regulogs in RegPrecise and identification of potential HisR-binding site in its promoter region, <italic>hisC</italic> (CAC3031) is also a putative target gene for HisR. To sum, the HisR regulon in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> is proposed to include the <italic>hisZ-tkt</italic> operon and <italic>hisC (</italic>CAC3031<italic>)</italic> (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>CymR: cysteine metabolism repressor</title><p>In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, CymR is a master repressor of cysteine metabolism. It controls the expression of genes involved either in cysteine synthesis from sulfide (<italic>cysK</italic>), sulfonates (<italic>ssu</italic>), or methionine (<italic>mccAB</italic>) or in cysteine uptake (<italic>tcyP</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. The activity of CymR is positively regulated by CysK in response to cysteine availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. When cysteine is present, the pool of O-acetylserine (OAS) is low, which leads to the formation of a CymR-CysK complex and transcriptional repression of the CymR regulon occurs. In the absence of cysteine, the OAS pool is high and the CymR-CysK complex is mostly dissociated, leading to a faster dissociation of CymR from its DNA targets and the lifting of CymR-dependent repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Proteins CAC2236 and CAC1675 are the best BLAST hits for the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> CymR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic>. Both proteins belong to the Rrf2 family, with winged helix-turn-helix transcription repressor DNA-binding domain. RegPrecise database assigns CAC1675 as iron-sulfur cluster assembly transcription factor IscR. Indeed, CAC2236 shows slightly higher sequence similarity to CymR than CAC1675 (64.63% vs. 60.69%), whereas CAC1675 has better sequence similarity to IscR in <italic>E. coli</italic> than CAC2236 does (53.09% vs. 49.39%). Therefore it is possible that CAC2236 functions as CymR in <italic>C. acetobutylicum,</italic> and CAC1675 as IscR. In <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic>, CAC2235, immediately downstream of CAC2236, codes for a cysteine synthase (CysK). In addition, the STRING network for CAC2236 further supports its involvement in regulating cysteine metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. On the other hand, RSAT footprinting analysis indicates that CAC1675 has a promoter element conserved in Clostridia class that partially aligns well with the CymR motif from <italic>Staphylococcaceae</italic> (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C). In fact, the IscR- and CymR-binding DNA motifs share quite significant sequence similarities (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, both CAC2236 and CAC1675 have identifiable CymR-binding sites when searched with the PWM built from TFBSs in <italic>Staphylococcaceae</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Seven operons with potential CymR-binding sites in their promoter regions were identified based on orthology to the CymR target genes in <italic>Bacillales</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcaceae</italic> in RegPrecise, and with pattern matched in promoter regions using Matrix Scan (p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1e-3). They include operons CAC0102-CAC0110 (including genes such as <italic>cysC</italic> (CAC0103), <italic>cysD</italic> (CAC0109), <italic>cysN</italic> (CAC0110); protein CysC and CysN are involved in hydrogen sulfide biosynthetic process) and CAC0878-0880 (amino acid ABC transporter system) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C). Making use of the distinct expression pattern of CAC0102-0110 and CAC0878-0880, the other cysteine-metabolism related genes/operons with similar expression pattern, i.e., <italic>cysK</italic> (CAC2235), operons of CAC0929-0931 and CAC3325-3327, were further analyzed for CymR-binding sites. Note that <italic>cysK</italic> and CAC0931 are putatively involved in cysteine biosynthesis from serine and in cysteine synthase activity respectively, whereas CAC3325-CAC3327 encodes protein orthologous to L-cystine-binding protein TcyABC transporter in <italic>Staphylococcus carnosus</italic>. Indeed, <italic>cysK</italic> (CAC2235), CAC0929 and CAC3325 have good match to the CymR-binding motif in their promoter regions (for the latter two, the predicted CymR-binding site is located more than 300 nts upstream their translation start codons). We conclude that the CymR regulon in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> likely includes at least the genes shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C.</p></sec><sec><title>PurR: repressor of purine metabolism</title><p>PurR (encoded by CAC3224) is a member of PurR family, which serves as repressor of purine metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. CAC3224 is upregulated under butanol stress, but not so under butyrate stress, which may explain the upregulation of several purine metabolism related genes when under butyrate stress. Interestingly, the majority of <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> genes orthologous to the PurR target genes in RegPrecise seem to contain only half of the PurR-binding DNA motif in Bacillales, which is a palindromic sequence comprised of two inverted repeats.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Complexity of the metabolite stress response as captured by the STRING-based stress response network (SRN)</title><p>The high-confidence functional interactions predicted by STRING (Confidence Score &#x02265; 0.700) were used as edges to construct the butanol/butyrate stress response network (SRN), which is shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S8. Cross-interactions are prevalent between most of the key regulons discussed above. Since the majority of the transcription factors and their target genes are highly conserved in a variety of organisms of the <italic>Clostridium</italic> genus (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Table S4), this SRN is likely largely applicable to the other <italic>Clostridium</italic> organisms, In addition, the complexity observed in these two core metabolite stresses may require additional layers of regulation, such as differential mRNA degradation and the regulation at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by non-coding small RNAs (sRNAs). The role of sRNA under metabolite stress has been investigated for butanol and butyrate stress based on RNAseq data, and quite a few stress-responsive sRNAs have been identified (Venkataramanan <italic>et al.</italic> 2013, BMC Genomics) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Several sRNAs were particularly up-regulated under both the metabolite stresses. They include 6S RNA (regulating availability of specific sigma factor and hence the expression of genes under their regulation), tmRNA (transfer-messenger RNA, which recycles ribosomes and ensures their availability during a change in the transcriptional and translational machinery of the cells along with labeling aberrant protein for degradation), SRP (signal recognition particle RNA, which regulates the trans-translation of the membrane bound proteins), <italic>solB</italic> (the repressor of the <italic>sol</italic> operon) and SAM riboswitch (regulating the expression of sulfur amino acid metabolism). Identifiable or likely targets of these sRNAs would suggest that these and other sRNAs are likely involved in regulating at least some of the genes in the core regulons discussed in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Gene regulatory networks play essential roles in living organisms to respond to both external environmental and internal metabolism changes. Understanding the connections and the activity levels of regulators is indispensible for the gene regulatory network research. This study produced a large set of high-resolution temporal transcriptional data. Using phylogenetic footprinting analysis and orthology inference, combined with pattern-based TFBS detection, the regulatory interactions proposed from our study provide important connections between transcription factors and their target genes that are important for butanol and butyrate stress response in <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic>. Utilizing predicted transcription factor activities in combination with transcriptome data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>] can be a future direction for reconstructing gene regulatory network of <italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic>. It is known that the analysis of transcriptome data does not always permit identifying the primary cause of a phenomenon observed. There are various levels of regulations apart from transcriptional ones, e.g., epigenetic regulation, translational regulations, mRNA stabilities, post-translational modifications. It remains a grand challenge to integrate all these regulation layers together to reconstruct a holistic stress response network. But promising systems biology methods are in development to provide solutions to the problem.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Microarray experiments and data analyses</title><sec><title>Strain and growth conditions</title><p><italic>C. acetobutylicum</italic> ATCC 824 was grown in a defined clostridial growth medium (40&#x000a0;g/L glucose) in BioFlo&#x000ae;310 Fermentors (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) equipped with controllers for pH, temperature, and agitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.0 and stressed with appropriate concentrations of butanol (low - 30&#x000a0;mM, med - 60&#x000a0;mM, high - 90&#x000a0;mM), or butyrate (low - 30&#x000a0;mM, med - 40&#x000a0;mM, high - 48&#x000a0;mM).

Separate reference pools were created for butanol and butyrate stress, respectively. Following hybridization, the slides were washed and scanned in an Agilent scanner; image analysis was carried out using Agilent&#x02019;s Feature Extraction Software (v9.5.1). Normalization was carried out using the LOESS method in R (Limma package from Bioconductor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]) using a custom script/algorithm developed in Papoutsakis lab based on SNN-LERN (Segmental Nearest Neighbor normalization method) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. Normalized outputs contained averaged, normalized values of replicates and dye-swaps with respect to the common reference pool.

For a gene to be identified as being differentially expressed for a metabolite stress, it had to be significant (5% FDR for SAM analysis) and have at least five time points out of the 18 with expression changes (6 time points for each stress level of Low, Medium and High) over 1.5 fold (up or down) for that metabolite stress. To be considered as bimodally expressed, the gene had to have at least five time points for 1.5 fold up and five time points for 1.5 fold down individually for that metabolite stress. Normalized ratios were grouped by K-means clustering (TIGR MeV, version 4.8.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]) and visualized with heat (or Eisen) plots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>] using TIGR MeV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. The K-means clustering was carried out with Euclidean distance metric. We chose K-Means clustering because the number of clusters produced can be directly controlled by the user-defined parameter K without having to somewhat arbitrarily cut a clustering tree like for the case of hierarchical clustering. The microarray data was validated using q-RT-PCR for 6 genes, which were validated for upregulation (CAP0102, CAC1391, CAC1405 &#x00026; CAC3190), downregulation (CAP0102, CAC0766 &#x00026; CAC1806), butanol stress (CAP0102, CAC1405, CAC1806 &#x00026; CAC3190) and butyrate stress (CAP0102, CAC1391 &#x00026; CAC0766).
