Most OR and VR genes were identified by comparative genomic techniques and therefore, in many of those cases, only their protein coding sequences are defined. Some also lack experimental support, due in part to the similarity between them and their monogenic, cell-specific expression in olfactory tissues. Here we use deep RNA sequencing, expression microarray and quantitative RT-PCR in both the vomeronasal organ and whole olfactory mucosa to quantify their full transcriptomes in multiple male and female mice. We find evidence of expression for all VR, and almost all OR genes that are annotated as functional in the reference genome, and use the data to generate over 1100 new, multi-exonic, significantly extended receptor gene annotations. We find that OR and VR genes are neither equally nor randomly expressed, but have reproducible distributions of abundance in both tissues. The olfactory transcriptomes are only minimally different between males and females, suggesting altered gene expression at the periphery is unlikely to underpin the striking sexual dimorphism in olfactory-mediated behavior. Finally, we present evidence that hundreds of novel, putatively protein-coding genes are expressed in these highly specialized olfactory tissues, and carry out a proof-of-principle validation. Taken together, these data provide a comprehensive, quantitative catalog of the genes that mediate olfactory perception and pheromone-evoked behavior at the periphery.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The sense of smell in mice involves the detection of odors and pheromones by many hundreds of olfactory and vomeronasal receptors. The genes that encode these receptors account for around 5% of the whole gene catalog, but they are poorly understood because they are very similar to each other, and are thought to be turned on randomly in only a small number of cells. Here we use multiple gene expression technologies to curate and measure the activity of all the genes involved in the detection of odors and find evidence of many new ones. We show that most genes encoding olfactory and vomeronasal receptors have complex, multi-exonic structures that generate different isoforms. We find that some receptors are consistently more abundant in the nose than others, which suggests they are not turned on randomly. This may explain why mice are particularly sensitive to some odors, but less attuned to others. We find that overall males and females differ very little in gene expression, despite having altered behavioral responses to the same odors. Thus diversity in receptor expression can explain differences in odor sensitivity, but does not appear to dictate whether sex pheromones are differentially detected by males or females.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (Grant No. 098051) and the EMBO Young Investigator Programme.

Mice heavily rely on their sense of smell to distinguish between animals from their own and different species, and to determine their identity <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Dulac1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Additionally, upon detection of specific semiochemical cues, these animals show certain behavioral responses, many of which are stereotypical and have been well characterized <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Chamero1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004593-Ferrero1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The mammalian olfactory system is formed by the olfactory mucosa (OM) and the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and is dedicated to sensing odorants and pheromones present in the environment. These cues are detected via olfactory (OR), trace-amine associated (TAAR), vomeronasal (VR) and formyl-peptide (FPR) receptors expressed by the sensory neurons in the epithelia of these organs. The OM detects mainly airborne molecules while the VNO identifies both volatile and non-volatile compounds <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Mombaerts1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The importance of a finely tuned olfactory system is reflected in the amount of genes specialized for the detection of odorants and pheromones. In the most recent assembly of the reference mouse genome (GRCm38) over 1,200 genes are annotated as coding for ORs and around 530 for VRs with a smaller number of TAAR and FPR genes. Together they comprise almost 5% of the complete gene catalog.</p><p>A large proportion of OR and VR gene repertoires have been identified through computational methods, based on homology searches to a few experimentally described reference receptors <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Niimura1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Accordingly most only have their protein coding sequences annotated in genomes. Indeed, for some of the genes annotated as VRs or ORs there is a complete absence of supporting evidence for them being expressed in the VNO or OM. ORs are also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, including the kidney, heart, lung, and testes <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Pluznick1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, where they have been shown to work as chemoreceptors in human sperm chemotaxis <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Fukuda1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Spehr1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This has raised the question of whether all OR genes encode true olfactory receptors <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Most olfactory sensory neurons express only one OR or VR gene, in a monoallelic fashion <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Chess1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Consequently only a small proportion of cells in each epithelium express any given receptor, which makes their detection challenging. Furthermore, high levels of sequence similarity within OR, and particularly VR subfamilies, means it is very difficult to ensure specificity when using hybridization based detection methods <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Among the behavioral responses elicited through olfactory signals, many are clearly distinct between adult male and female mice, including sexual conduct <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Haga1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Ferrero1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, aggressive responses to intruders <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Chamero1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and parental care <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Kimchi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, but the mechanisms that ensure such differentiated responses have not yet been fully elucidated in mammals <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Stowers1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In silk moths, this is achieved by only males expressing the receptor <italic>BmOR-1</italic> in their antenna, which detects the female-specific sex pheromone bombykol <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Sakurai1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In contrast, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> sex pheromone cVA is detected by both sexes and elicits dimorphic behavior by routing the signal via different third order neuronal circuits deep in the brains of males and females <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Kohl1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Sexual dimorphism in pheromone receptor expression has been reported in rats <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Herrada1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, but the best defined mammalian example is the detection of the male-specific pheromone ESP1 by Vmn2r116, which is capable of eliciting lordosis behavior specifically in female mice. Mice of both sexes appear capable of detecting this pheromone, suggesting the differential response is due to modifications in the downstream neural circuitry <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Haga1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>To determine the full receptor repertoire expressed in the mouse VNO and OM, and assess whether sexual dimorphism in olfactory-mediated behavior can be explained by differential gene expression in these organs, we used RNAseq to profile their transcriptomes in male and female mice. We show that a very high proportion of the annotated receptors are indeed expressed in the olfactory system, we experimentally characterize their full length transcripts for the first time and compare their abundances to previous estimates. There are a few differences in expression between the two sexes but only very minor distinctions in the levels of the receptor repertoires. However, genome-wide expression analysis revealed a large number of novel genes in olfactory tissues and some inter-individual variation for subsets of genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Expression profile of mouse VNO and OM</title><p>We conducted deep RNA-sequencing in whole VNO and OM of three adult male and three adult female biological replicates.

Only small sets of genes are unusually variable among replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004593-g001">Figure 1A&#x02013;B</xref>) and the distribution of gene expression is very similar between males and females (density plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004593-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We therefore averaged the FPKM values for each gene in each sex and tissue. In both tissues a few genes are extremely highly expressed. For example, in the VNO the 14 most abundant genes account for almost 50% of the fragments obtained from the whole tissue. The highest, <italic>Lcn13</italic>, has an average expression of around 97,300 FPKM, but more than 85% of the genes have values below 10 FPKM. A similar distribution is observed in the OM, though less extreme. The most abundant gene, <italic>Bpifb9b</italic>, is expressed at about 22,300 FPKM and the top 261 genes account for half the total expression; again, the overall majority of genes (83.9%) are expressed below 10 FPKM.</p><fig id="pgen-1004593-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004593.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The transcriptomes of the VNO and OM.</title><p>(A&#x02013;B) Representative scatter plots of the log<sub>10</sub> FPKM values for all genes in two biological replicates for the VNO (A) and OM (B).

The expression of the remaining genes shows a bimodal distribution of low- and high-expressed genes (density plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004593-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), characteristic of RNAseq datasets <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Hebenstreit1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. These can be decomposed into two normal-like overlapping distributions, and each gene can be assigned to either distribution with a degree of confidence. Low-expressed genes typically do not have active chromatin marks, are enriched in non-functional mRNAs and, unlike the high-expressed genes, lack correlative protein expression data <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Hebenstreit1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. We therefore focused our analysis of differential gene expression on those genes that have at least a 25% probability of being within the highly-expressed distribution: 17,698 genes in the VNO and 17,983 in the OM (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and methods</xref> for details). Among the 19,579 genes that are expressed in either tissue, 63.14% (12,363) are differentially expressed with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 5%. To explore these further, we selected the genes showing a fold change of four or higher and searched for enriched functional terms. As expected, those expressed higher in the VNO are enriched for VR genes, which are involved in the response to pheromones, odorant-binding and lipocalin-related proteins. Additionally, the calcium signaling pathway, ionic and voltage-gated channel activity, regulation of blood pressure and the immune response are significantly enriched. For the OM, enriched genes are dominated by those encoding ORs and, those involved in the olfactory transduction pathway and sensory perception. In addition, there is enrichment of ionic and ligand-gated channels. In contrast, &#x02018;housekeeping&#x02019; genes are expressed at similar levels in both tissues (scatter plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004593-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Another widely used technology to profile gene expression levels is microarrays.

Furthermore, the strong correlation between the qRT-PCR and the RNAseq data gives us confidence that these expression estimates are reproducible and specific, and provide a comprehensive characterization of olfactory transcriptomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Sexual dimorphism in olfactory expression profiles</title><p>To investigate whether sex-specific responses to olfactory cues can be accounted for by transcriptional differences in the VNO and OM, we searched for sexually dimorphic gene expression patterns.

Moreover, some subsets of these genes had very similar patterns of variation. For example, a group of eight lipocalins (six of which are significantly dimorphic) all showed at least a 130 fold increase in abundance in one male VNO sample over the two other replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004593-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004593.s002">S2A</xref>).

Due to the small size of the organ, the VNO samples we sequenced were pooled from three mice. Therefore we next extracted RNA from the VNO of 15 individual group-housed males and assessed the expression of four of the most variable lipocalin genes by TaqMan qRT-PCR. Two thirds of the animals showed equivalent expression values but the remaining five had increased expression levels up to ten fold higher than the mean expression across all animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004593.s002">Figure S2C</xref>).

Therefore the expression of any given receptor within the whole epithelium is low and this has hindered their study in a comprehensive manner. The GRCm38 mouse assembly contains 1,249 annotated OR genes and 530 VR genes. To ensure that these represent the complete repertoires, we took the cDNA sequences for the mouse VR genes as previously reported <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Young2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and aligned them to the genome with BLAST.

These were included in subsequent analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004593.s011">Table S2</xref>).

In both cases the receptors in the repertoire do not have equal abundances, as may be expected if receptor choice was a random process. Instead we observe a large dynamic range of expression: a few receptors are expressed at high levels and the vast majority of the receptors are expressed at relatively low levels. For the VR genes, the most highly expressed receptor, <italic>Vmn2r89</italic>, has a value of 131.86 FPKM. 42 receptors are expressed above 20 FPKM and the median expression for V2R genes is 0.66 FPKM with 0.45 FPKM for V1R genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004593-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004593.s003">S3A</xref>). 416 VR genes (77.6%) have at least one fragment mapped uniquely. From the other 120, 82 are pseudogenes, and 61 have reads that map to several genes (also called multireads). 59 VR genes have no mapped fragments, either unique or multi-mapped, but these are all annotated as pseudogenes. In the case of the OR genes the most abundant, <italic>Olfr1507</italic>, is expressed at 87.54 FPKM, and 11 genes are above 20 FPKM.

Despite their relatively low abundance, 1,180 (94.48%) of all the OR genes have at least one fragment mapped to their exonic region. Of the remaining 69 genes, 50 are annotated as pseudogenes and 16 have multireads that could indicate expression.

We closely examined the sequencing data for the 25 genes with the biggest 5&#x02032; differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004593-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). For 24 genes, we were unable to find any sequencing fragments consistent with the TSS proposed by nanoCAGE.

Olfactory tissue transcriptomes are likely to be a rich source of novel genes for three reasons. Firstly, they are not widely used in transcription based gene discovery and annotation pipelines. Secondly, olfactory organs tend to be enriched in specialized genes with highly restricted expression patterns. Third, genes involved in pheromone detection are often species-specific and functional orthologues are typically lacking in the human genome, which confound their detection by comparative genomic methods <xref rid="pgen.1004593-IbarraSoria1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>We found a surprisingly high number of novel transcripts that map some distance away from known genes, and encode consistent multi-exonic gene models.

To do so requires a technology that is both sensitive enough to detect highly diluted signals and that is capable of distinguishing between very similar paralogues. In an early attempt to characterize the expression of the receptor repertoire, Young <italic>et al.</italic> screened a cDNA library constructed from the olfactory epithelium, using degenerate olfactory receptor probes, and identified the expression of 419 distinct ORs <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Young3" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. This approach, however, suffers from biases in the library construction and screening which hinders the identification of certain classes of receptors. High-density oligonucelotide arrays were designed to target the computationally predicted 3&#x02032; UTRs of OR and VR genes and probe the expression of all receptors annotated in an early genome assembly <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Expression was confirmed for probes against 817 OR and 266 VR genes. Unfortunately these studies used a different strain of mouse and/or the gene-level expression data is not publically available, thus we were unable to compare those abundance estimates with the data reported here. To address this we used a commercially available expression microarray to estimate abundances. Compared with RNAseq we found that microarrays suffer from high levels of noise, possibly due to non-specific hybridization, and reach saturation with highly expressed genes <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Marioni1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. We were able to detect expression above threshold for only 39.8% of the 1107 OR genes present in the microarray and for 57.4% of the 197 VR genes represented in the array, consequently there are only moderate correlations between microarray and RNAseq receptor abundance estimates. Surprisingly, we also found that previously published nanoCAGE estimates of OR gene expression correlated poorly with our RNAseq data <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Plessy1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This is partly because some 5&#x02032; nanoCAGE tags were apportioned to the wrong OR transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004593-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), but other factors may also contribute to the disparity. The mice used by Plessy <italic>et al.</italic> were younger than used here and their tissue was collected by laser capture microdissection which could result in incomplete sampling of the whole epithelium. Moreover, nanoCAGE tags that mapped to multiple locations were distributed by algorithm, while we took a more conservative approach and did not include multi-mapped reads in abundance estimates.</p><p>More recently, NanoString nCounter technology has been used to detect OR expression in the OM <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Khan2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Probes could be designed to only approximately half of the predicted OR gene repertoire with confidence, resulting in expression quantification values for 531 OR genes in whole olfactory mucosa. NanoString nCounter is a hybridization probe based method, thus relative measures of abundance between different OR genes are not necessarily accurate. Nevertheless, we found OR gene expression estimates using this very different technology were consistent with our RNAseq data, lending support to both methods.</p><p>We obtained evidence of expression for all putatively functional VR genes and all but 9 potentially functional OR genes by RNAseq. We cannot rule out the possibility that these may be expressed at levels below the threshold of detection in our experiments. Indeed one (<italic>Olfr504</italic>) is present in the NanoString dataset where it was reported to be expressed, albeit at a low level <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Khan2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, some ORs are known to be ectopically expressed in mice <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Pluznick1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Pluznick2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Feldmesser1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, thus it is possible they may have evolved extra-olfactory functions. Alternatively, they could be expressed at a different age <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Khan2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, or they may be cryptic pseudogenes that have disrupted promoter elements and thus are no longer recognized by the machinery regulating olfactory receptor choice. Supporting this is our observation that approximately one third of both OR and VR genes with interrupted ORFs are not expressed in olfactory tissues, a bias that had been noted previously <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Young3" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Experimental disruption of the ORF of an OR allele does not ablate its expression, instead another OR allele is co-expressed in the same cell <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Shykind1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Fuss1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. However, this phenomenon clearly occurs less frequently with naturally occurring pseudogenes, which probably reflects a parallel degeneration of their regulatory sequences. By comparing the promoter sequences of expressed with non-expressed OR and VR genes and pseudogenes, it may now be possible to identify key genomic motifs that control receptor choice.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Receptor transcripts are complex</title><p>The generation of RNAseq data for a majority of ORs and VRs enabled us to obtain new, significantly extended gene models. The vast majority of receptor genes contain several exons and it is common to observe differential inclusion of these, diversifying the transcript set produced from each gene. In most cases the putative coding sequences of OR and V1R genes span a single exon and the additional exons contains only UTRs. In these instances the functional consequence of alternative splicing is unclear, as the same receptor protein would be generated from each transcript. In other cases alternative transcripts have introns interrupting the coding sequence, resulting in a truncated ORF that is likely to encode a non-functional receptor. However 1.5% and 1.3% of OR and VR genes, respectively, generate transcripts that can theoretically encode multiple, putatively functional receptor proteins. Further work will be necessary to verify the existence of transcripts, and determine their functional consequences.</p><p>Most receptors are annotated from comparative genomic studies <xref rid="pgen.1004593-Niimura1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, which means non-coding UTRs are frequently missing. Identifying UTRs is especially useful for VR and OR genes, since they provide additional sequence that is typically more divergent than the ORF. When we compare the complete gene models we have reconstructed with those currently annotated, both the amount of the receptor transcript sequence, and the proportion that is unique between receptors increases substantially. We anticipate this resource will permit the design of more specific probes for NanoString nCounter, TaqMan qRT-PCR, microarray or <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and thus increase the utility of these techniques in the olfactory system.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The use and care of animals used in this study was approved by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Animal Welfare and Ethics Review Board in accordance with UK Home Office regulations, the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>RNA sequencing</title><p>All mice used were C57BL/6J, 8 to 10 weeks old and group housed.
