This is an economically important species, and natural stocks are subject to intensive exploitation by professional and sport fisheries, thus raising future conservation and management issues. It is ranked fourth in European aquaculture production and, although undergoing domestication for the last three decades, selective breeding programmes are still in their infancy.</p><p>The European sea bass inhabits coastal waters, where reproduction occurs; however, it can also enter brackish waters in estuarine areas and coastal lagoons, and occasionally rivers. Thus, the European sea bass is an euryhaline fish tolerating a wide range of salinities (0&#x02013;60&#x02009;psu)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Although several genes involved in the physiological response to variation in salinity have been identified<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, the genetic basis of its broad halotolerance remains unclear. Because adaptation to varying environments may also involve gene duplications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, obtaining the complete genome sequence of the European sea bass may help to identify the genetic basis for adaptation to euryhalinity.</p><p>Atlantic and Mediterranean sea bass populations represent two genetically distinct lineages that naturally hybridize in the Alboran Sea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Describing genomic variation patterns that arise from the interaction between these two diverging lineages has important implications for understanding the evolutionary forces at play during the diversification of marine species. In addition, a detailed picture of genomic variation within and between lineages will provide useful information to orientate domestication and assist conservation management of sea bass populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>Here we produce a high-quality draft sequence of the European sea bass genome by combining high-throughput sequencing with genetic and physical maps<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The current assembly spans 675&#x02009;Mbp and contains ~86% of the contigs ordered and orientated along 24 chromosomes, representing one of the highest-quality fish genomes available. Most sea bass chromosomes are highly collinear with those of upper teleosts, confirming the evolutionary stability of fish genomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. We annotate 26,719 genes and identify gene family expansions, some of which are promising candidates for euryhaline adaptation. In addition, we characterize genome-wide variation patterns by restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD)-sequencing ~2.5% of the genome in 100 individuals from the Mediterranean and Atlantic lineages, using three individuals of the congeneric <italic>D. punctatus</italic> as an outgroup. We find that genomic variation within and between sea bass lineages is influenced by large-scale variation in local recombination rates and by diversifying selection translating into variable rates of introgression across the genome following post-glacial secondary contact. These results provide new insights into the genetic correlates of speciation, as it occurs in a typical marine species with high levels of gene flow and a large effective population size.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genome sequencing and assembly</title><p>We sequenced the whole genome of a single meiogynogenetic male of the European sea bass to an average coverage depth of 30 &#x000d7; using a combination of whole-genome shotgun, mate pair and BAC end sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

The 18,253&#x02009;bp of the whole mitogenome was assembled and annotated, and ranked among the largest in teleost fish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p><p>Repetitive DNA sequences within the sea bass genome accounted for 21.47% of the assembly, with 3.87% of class I transposable elements and 4.19% of DNA transposons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>), in line with what has been found in other fish genomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Similarly, the average GC content of the sea bass genome (40.4%) was comparable to that of other teleosts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. The distribution of GC content was rather homogeneous within chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). We found a lower percentage of GC in noncoding regions (39.6%) compared with protein-coding regions (52.6%), and the third-codon positions GC content was 60.7%, suggesting the effect of selection for codon usage, or a stronger effect of biased gene conversion in coding regions relative to noncoding regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. We found almost complete synteny and large blocks of collinearity between sea bass chromosomes and homologous chromosomes of the three most closely related teleost taxa that have a chromosome-scale assembly (<italic>G. aculeatus, Oreochromis niloticus and Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). This matches well with the position of sea bass relative to other derived teleosts on a phylogenetic tree reconstructed using 621 1:1 orthologous proteins from 20 sequenced fish genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Our phylogenomic analysis also supports the recently resolved relationships among fully sequenced percomorph fishes, which group sea basses and sticklebacks in a common clade<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Gene duplication and the evolution of euryhalinity</title><p>We evaluated the evolutionary consequences of gene expansion and differential duplicate gene loss on biological function pathways. Some pathways were enriched within certain chromosomes, including neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (LG2), cell adhesion molecules (LG13 and LG14), endocytosis (LG19), DNA repair and nucleotide excision repair (LG20). Among the enriched pathways, we detected gene family expansions that may have played a role in adaptation to euryhalinity. These include claudins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, aquaporins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, arginine-vasotocin (<italic>AVT</italic>) receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, prolactin (<italic>PRL</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and its receptor (<italic>PRLR</italic>). Although euryhalinity is an old innovation in aquatic vertebrates that has potentially favoured species diversification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, the sea bass genome provides new insights into the genomic modifications at play in this key adaptation.</p><p>While mammalian genomes have 27 claudins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <italic>D. labrax</italic> has 61 claudin copies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), thus exceeding the 54 copies found in the zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, which are largely explained by the teleost-specific whole-genome duplication (TGD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Chromosome blocks containing claudin genes are duplicated in LG13 (15 genes) and LG14 (14 genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>) and the two claudin clusters of 11 (LG13) and 10 (LG14) tandem genes exhibit conserved synteny to claudins 3 and 4 in human chromosome 7. Expansion of these clusters occurred before the TGD event<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, since the spotted gar <italic>Lepisosteus oculatus</italic> has both a single synteny block in LG22 (as in humans) and a tandem cluster of 10 claudins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). However, the coelacanth <italic>Latimeria chalumnae</italic> has a synteny block with only two claudin genes, indicating an expansion specific to the Actinopterygii lineage occurred<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. While synteny blocks 1&#x02013;3 seem to be part of an ancestral chromosome, both Sarcopterygii and Actinopterygii have gained lineage-specific insertions (blocks 4M and 4F) between blocks 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), which appear to have driven claudin expansion both in mammals and teleosts. After the TGD, the teleost-specific duplicate, block 4F on LG14, was translocated between blocks 2 and 3. The LG13 duplicate, block 4F, was eliminated, while block 3 was translocated to a distant part of the chromosome, blocks 1 and 2 being maintained together.</p><p>The sea bass and zebrafish genomes contain 18 members of the aquaporin family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), representing the largest repertoire of functional aquaporins in vertebrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Both sea bass and zebrafish share duplications of <italic>AQP0a-b</italic>, <italic>AQP1a-b</italic>, <italic>AQP10a-b</italic> and the putative loss of one of the two <italic>AQP4</italic>, <italic>AQP7</italic> and <italic>AQP12</italic> paralogs. However, the <italic>AQP5/1</italic> and one of the <italic>AQP9</italic> paralogs present in <italic>D. rerio</italic> are not found in the sea bass. Conversely, sea bass is the only teleost that retains four <italic>AQP8</italic> copies as a result of TGD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p><p>Teleost genomes contain a large diversity of <italic>AVT</italic> receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, with up to six in <italic>G. aculeatus</italic>, <italic>O. niloticus</italic> and <italic>O. latipes</italic> and seven in the sea bass. The latter included duplicated <italic>V1A</italic> and expansion of <italic>V2</italic> from four to five copies, including a novel <italic>V2B-like</italic> receptor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>While the majority of teleosts have maintained single copies of <italic>PRL</italic> and <italic>PRL-like</italic> genes, sea bass and <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> retained two <italic>PRL-like</italic> genes and <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic> retained two <italic>PRL</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). The <italic>PRL</italic> receptor gene (<italic>PRLR</italic>) is also duplicated in most fish species; however, an extra copy of <italic>PRLR-like</italic> homolog is present in sea bass, <italic>T. rubripes</italic>, <italic>G. aculeatus</italic> and in some cichlids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>The sea bass genome has the highest number of gene copies linked to ion and water regulation (94 genes) among fully sequenced teleosts. To test the hypothesis that this gene expansion is associated with the degree of euryhalinity in teleost fishes, a comparison was made to the copy number in the genomes of euryhaline (<italic>T. nigroviridis</italic>, <italic>O. latipes</italic>, <italic>O. niloticus</italic> and <italic>G. aculeatus</italic>) and stenohaline fishes (<italic>D. rerio</italic>, <italic>Gadus morhua</italic> and <italic>T. rubripes</italic>); however, no clear pattern was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). However, the analysis of the protein-coding sequences of each gene family showed accelerated evolution of the sea bass <italic>PRLR</italic> copies one to three and of the novel vasotocin receptor <italic>V2B-L</italic>, suggesting that relaxed purifying selection or positive selection has occurred for these genes in the lineage leading to sea bass (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 9&#x02013;12</xref>). Other osmoregulation-related gene duplicates also displayed signatures of positive selection, although not exclusively in sea bass (for example, <italic>PRL-L2</italic>). Altogether, these results suggest that the lineage leading to sea bass has retained a large number of genes involved in ion and volume regulation since TGD, and this may have facilitated the evolution of some genes conferring high tolerance to rapid salinity changes.</p><p>Searches for recently duplicated genes identified six paralogs that are specific to sea bass, five of which exhibit signatures of positive selection at several amino-acid positions in at least one of the duplicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 13</xref>). For one of these genes, the nuclear receptor co-activator 5 (<italic>NCOA5</italic>), sex-differential expression has been reported in Nile tilapia during larval development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Because sex-determining loci in teleosts often involve recently duplicated genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, <italic>NCOA5</italic> represents an interesting candidate component of the genetic system for sex determination in sea bass.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genome-wide patterns of polymorphism and recombination</title><p>A genetic variation map was produced from 100 wild-caught sea bass from the Atlantic Ocean and western Mediterranean Sea. We additionally analysed three spotted sea bass (<italic>D. punctatus</italic>) individuals as outgroup, in order to identify divergent sites between <italic>D. labrax</italic> and <italic>D. punctatus</italic> and to polarize single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within <italic>D. labrax</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 14</xref>). Genomic variation within and among individuals, lineages and species was examined at ~178,000 RAD tags<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, providing an average marker density of one pair of RAD tags every 7.5&#x02009;kb and a 2.5% genome coverage. A total of 234,148 SNPs were found (mean read depth 48 &#x000d7; per individual), revealing an average nucleotide diversity (<italic>&#x003c0;</italic>) of 2.52 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> in the Atlantic lineage, 2.60 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> in the Mediterranean lineage and 2.31 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> in the spotted sea bass. There was broad variation in nucleotide diversity within chromosomes, with a frequently observed fivefold reduced diversity in central chromosomal regions compared with the chromosomal extremities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>).

Seven alternative models of historical divergence were fitted to the joint allele-frequency spectrum of Atlantic and Mediterranean lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>), including scenarios of strict isolation, isolation-with-migration, ancient migration and secondary contact. The observed allele-frequency spectrum was not satisfactorily reproduced by standard demographic models that assume the gene flow parameter to be shared among loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). A custom secondary contact model with heterogeneous gene flow across the genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>) produced a significantly higher fit compared with all other alternative models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). This analysis revealed several key features of the divergence history of sea bass lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 15</xref>). Divergence accumulated during a period of isolation at least 20 times longer than the age of secondary contact. Genetic introgression following secondary contact was strongly asymmetric from the Atlantic to Mediterranean lineage, and occurred at highly variable rates across the genome. We estimated that ~35% of the genome did not freely introgress from one lineage to the other, which mirrors the proportion of the genome in which the windowed <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> lies above the genome-wide average differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>).

Compared with solely NGS-based genome assemblies, the sea bass genome assembly has benefited from low-coverage Sanger sequencing reads which, combined with data from two different NGS platforms, led to increased contig size. Scaffolding was also improved by combining mate pairs with BAC-end sequences, and a chromosome-scale assembly was obtained using available genetic linkage and radiation hybrid maps anchoring scaffolds to the 24 chromosomes comprising the sea bass karyotype. This genome assembly is a prerequisite to whole-genome or targeted resequencing, RNA-seq, chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq and Methyl-seq experiments, and will therefore catalyse genomic studies in sea bass. In addition, it will help to improve the assembly of newly sequenced genomes from related orders, since large regions of collinearity have been observed with the genome assemblies of other teleost fishes. The sea bass genome sequence may thus facilitate genomic studies in other economically important fishes.</p><p>Expansions of gene families related to ion and volume regulation were likely mediated through an elevated rate of duplicate gene retention after TGD, providing a genetic basis for adaptation to euryhalinity in the European sea bass and possibly other highly adaptable species. This finding questions the relative importance of whole-genome duplication events versus single-gene duplication in the evolution of euryhalinity in fish, which should motivate broader-scale comparative genomic and experimental studies in the future.</p><p>The European sea bass also provides an interesting model for understanding the evolutionary mechanisms involved in speciation. Our results imply genetically based reproductive barriers reducing gene flow between Atlantic and Mediterranean sea bass lineages. We reveal important aspects of the genetic architecture of differentiation between these two lineages, such as the disproportionate mapping of the genomic islands of differentiation within low-recombining regions. Evidence for differential gene flow after secondary contact implies that the genomic islands in sea bass are not simply an incidental consequence of reduced diversity in low-recombining regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, but also the product of reduced gene flow in these regions. Furthermore, some genomic islands of high differentiation are also observed in regions of high diversity. Therefore, the genomic landscape of differentiation in sea bass likely results from the preferential erosion of divergence in the genomic regions with high recombination rates. The question of the timing of gene flow has been partly answered by our modelling approach, which dated the secondary contact to <italic>ca.</italic> 11,500 years BP, and estimated the divergence time to <italic>ca.</italic> 270,000 years BP (using a per-generation mutation rate of 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> per bp and a generation time of 5 years). This puts the onset of secondary gene flow to the last glacial retreat and strongly supports the role of distributional range shifts caused by Pleistocene glacial periods in promoting divergence. The true evolutionary history is admittedly more complex, since quaternary glacial oscillations may have resulted in intermittent gene flow during divergence. This may explain the contrast between the divergence captured by our analysis of the nuclear genome and the 2.8% divergence found in the nonrecombining mitochondrial genome, which may be involved in old cytonuclear incompatibilities that have remained protected from fixation for a much longer period than the recent history revealed by the coalescence of the rest of the genome. This new picture of the dual origin of the genetic variability in European sea bass brings important data to explain the long-standing observation of genetic discontinuities at the Almeria&#x02013;Oran front in many marine species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. It reinforces the hypothesis of anciently diverged genetic backgrounds being trapped by the Atlantic/Mediterranean environmental boundary<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, and further supports the role of allopatric isolation as the main driver of marine speciation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sequencing strategy</title><p>All sequencing libraries were constructed from the genomic DNA of a single Adriatic sea bass individual (meiogynogenetic male 57)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> (kindly provided by the late A.
