Heat shocks of 37&#x000b0;C and above result in general inhibition of translation, and severe heat shock (41&#x000b0;C) results in sequestration of mRNA in granules. The mRNAs that are bound by the zinc-finger protein ZC3H11, including those encoding refolding chaperones, escape heat-induced translation inhibition. At 27&#x000b0;C, <italic>ZC3H11</italic> mRNA is predominantly present as an untranslated cytosolic messenger ribonucleoprotein particle, but after heat shocks of 37&#x000b0;C&#x02014;41&#x000b0;C, the <italic>ZC3H11</italic> mRNA moves into the polysomal fraction. To investigate the scope and specificities of heat-shock translational regulation and granule formation, we analysed the distributions of mRNAs on polysomes at 27&#x000b0;C and after 1 hour at 39&#x000b0;C, and the mRNA content of 41&#x000b0;C heat shock granules. We found that mRNAs that bind to ZC3H11 remained in polysomes at 39&#x000b0;C and were protected from sequestration in granules at 41&#x000b0;C. As previously seen for starvation stress granules, the mRNAs that encode ribosomal proteins were excluded from heat-shock granules. 70 mRNAs moved towards the polysomal fraction after the 39&#x000b0;C heat shock, and 260 increased in relative abundance. Surprisingly, many of these mRNAs are also increased when trypanosomes migrate to the tsetse salivary glands. It therefore seems possible that in the wild, temperature changes due to diurnal variations and periodic intake of warm blood might influence the efficiency with which procyclic forms develop into mammalian-infective forms.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>When trypanosomes are inside tsetse flies, they have to cope with temperature variations from below 20&#x000b0;C up to 37&#x000b0;C, due to diurnal variations and periodic intake of warm blood. In the laboratory, procyclic forms (the form that multiplies in the midgut), are routinely cultured at 27&#x000b0;C. When procyclic forms are heated to temperatures of 37&#x000b0;C and above, they decrease protein production, and at 41&#x000b0;C, mRNAs aggregate into granules. We show here that quite a large number of mRNAs are not included in granules and continue to be used for making proteins. Some of the proteins that continue to be made are needed in order to defend the cells against the effects of heat shock. Interestingly, however, a moderate heat shock stimulates expression of genes needed for the parasites to develop further into forms that can colonise the salivary glands. It thus seems possible that in the field, temperature variations might influence the efficiency with which of trypanosomes in tsetse flies become infective for mammals.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cl112/17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6384-0731</contrib-id><name><surname>Clayton</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was partially funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinshaft, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dfg.de">http://www.dfg.de</ext-link>, grant numbers Cl112/17-1 and Cl112/17-2.

Unlike other organisms, however, trypanosomes lack the ability to control the transcription of individual protein-coding genes [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Polymerase II transcription is polycistronic, and monocistronic mRNAs are created by 5' <italic>trans</italic> splicing of a capped spliced leader (<italic>SL</italic>) and polyadenylation [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The selectivity of the heat shock response, like other changes in gene expression, therefore relies on post-transcriptional mechanisms. <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> procyclic forms are the forms that grow inside the tsetse fly midgut. In natural infections, these forms migrate to the proventriculus, developing into epimastigotes, and from there to the salivary glands where they become metacyclic forms which are infective for mammals [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. After a tsetse fly bites a mammal, long slender bloodstream forms proliferate in the new host's blood and tissue fluids. Upon reaching high density, the parasites differentiate into non-dividing short stumpy forms [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which are pre-adapted for differentiation into procyclic forms upon uptake by tsetse [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Nearly all previous work on heat shock in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> has concentrated on cultured procyclic forms subjected to a one-hour heat shock at 41&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This is on the upper edge of temperatures that can be tolerated by most tsetse species in the wild [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], since tsetse prefer to rest in the shade and to feed on parts of animals that are not exposed to full sunlight [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, after the 41&#x000b0;C treatment trypanosomes recover quite rapidly upon return to the normal culture temperature of 27&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Heating to 41&#x000b0;C inhibits trypanosome transcription initiation [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and stimulates overall mRNA degradation [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], resulting in gradual loss of total mRNA [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, translation of most mRNAs is suppressed. After an hour at 41&#x000b0;C, there is almost no mRNA in polysomes, while three types of messenger ribonucleoproten (mRNP) granules appear. These granules contain most of the mRNA [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and various combinations of translation factors, the two poly(A) binding proteins PABP1 and PABP2, the helicase DHH1, the aggregation-prone protein SCD6, and the 5'-3' exoribonuclease XRN1 [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Cycloheximide treatment causes retention of mRNAs in polysomes at 41&#x000b0;C, inhibiting both mRNA degradation and granule formation [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thus, as in other organisms, granules are locations for storage and/or degradation of non-translated mRNAs.</p><p>Despite the general shut-down in gene expression after heat shock, synthesis of proteins that are required for survival during, and recovery after, heat shock&#x02014;such as protein refolding chaperones&#x02014;continues. We previously showed that the zinc-finger protein ZC3H11 binds to the 3'-UTRs of chaperone mRNAs, and is required both for target mRNA retention and for cellular survival after heat shock [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. ZC3H11 binds to MKT1 and to PBP1, which in turn recruits LSM12 and poly(A) binding proteins PABP1 and PABP2[<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. MKT1 and PBP1 remain distributed throughout the cytosol after heat shock. Starvation also causes the formation of mRNP granules, but in this case MKT1 and PBP1 colocalise with SCD6 in the granules [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Recently, we investigated how ZC3H11 itself is regulated [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. ZC3H11 is barely detectable in both bloodstream and procyclic forms grown at their normal culture temperatures of 37&#x000b0;C and 27&#x000b0;C respectively [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. When procyclic forms are incubated at 37&#x02013;41&#x000b0;C, the level of ZC3H11 protein progressively increases. This is partly caused by a loss of protein degradation, but more prominently by translational control. At 27&#x000b0;C, the <italic>ZC3H11</italic> mRNA migrates in sucrose gradients as a messenger ribonucleoprotein particle at or just above the small ribosomal subunits, but after a 1h heat shock at 37&#x000b0;C, 39&#x000b0;C or 41&#x000b0;C, nearly all of the <italic>ZC3H11</italic> mRNA is in the polysomal fractions and <italic>ZC3H11</italic> mRNA does not colocalise with heat shock granules [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this paper we have examined whether other mRNAs show similar translation regulation after a 39&#x000b0;C heat shock, and identified additional mRNAs that escape sequestration into stress granules after a 41&#x000b0;C heat shock.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Trypanosome culture</title><p>Trypanosome culture conditions were as described in [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

We were particularly interested in knowing which mRNAs show regulation similar to that of ZC3H11, since we hoped in that way to identify conserved sequence motifs. We chose 39&#x000b0;C because preliminary results showed that the treatment was sufficient to move <italic>ZC3H11</italic> mRNA into the polysomal fraction, while only partially inhibiting overall translation. It is also a treatment that could be tolerated by tsetse flies [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Lysates from procyclic-form trypanosomes with or without heat shock were fractionated on sucrose gradients, which were then divided into free (F), subunit (S), monosome plus light polysome (L) and heavy polysome (H) fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The 39&#x000b0;C heat shock caused a shift of the ribosomes from the polysomal towards the free subunit and monosome fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To find the proportion of mRNA that was in each fraction, we analysed samples by Northern blotting, using the spliced leader as probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and including inputs (non-fractionated samples) as controls. The total amount of mRNA from the 39&#x000b0;C-treated cells was 57% of that from the non-shocked samples, but the sucrose gradient distribution of mRNA was similar to that of the non-shocked parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s001">S1 Table</xref>, sheet 2).

We then calculated the percentage of each mRNA that was in the different sucrose gradient fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s001">S1 Table</xref>, sheet 6). (A summary of the control results at 27&#x000b0;C was included in [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].) The correlation coefficients for percentage in polysomes between replicates ranged from 87% to 99% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s006">S1 Fig</xref>). In the following discussion we will assume that mRNAs that migrate in the denser part of the gradient are being actively translated. However, there are two caveats to this. First, binding of ribosomes to an mRNA does not necessarily mean that the ribosomes are active in translation elongation. Second, although there are no microscopically visible granules at 39&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], some association of mRNAs with smaller aggregates cannot be ruled out. The percentages in polysomes ranged from 50&#x02013;70% for most mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, 'All&#x02019;), and there was a statistically significant (but very small) increase in these percentages after heat shock.</p><fig id="pntd.0004982.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0004982.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Analysis of mRNAs in polysome gradients.</title><p>(A) For each gene in the "unique gene" set, the percentage of the mRNA in polysomes (heavy and light combined) at 27&#x000b0;C (cyan) and after 1h at 39&#x000b0;C (pink) was calculated. The results for all of these mRNAs ("All") are displayed on the left as box plots. We then examined separately mRNAs that were reproducibly at least 3x enriched in a ZC3H11 pull-down (ZC3H11 bind 3x); and mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (Ribprot).

For this group, the percentage on polysomes was overall higher than average at 27&#x000b0;C, and lower than average after an hour at 39&#x000b0;C. A subset of these mRNAs was distinguished by poor translation even before heat shock (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s007">S2 Fig</xref>, subset A): it includes <italic>RBP33</italic>, cis-spliced poly(A) polymerase, <italic>PAG2</italic> and <italic>PAG4</italic> mRNAs. We placed these mRNAs into functional classes based on their encoded proteins. Transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins were notably enriched in the set of mRNAs with decreased translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g002">Fig 2A&#x02013;2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s001">S1 Table</xref>, sheet 9), and there was a slight over-representation of mRNAs encoding RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p><p>We next looked at mRNAs with a two-fold higher proportion in polysomal fraction after heat shock (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s001">S1 Table</xref>, sheet 7). 77 mRNAs, including that encoding ZC3H11, fell into this category. This group had almost universally been in the lighter fractions at 27&#x000b0;C and rather oddly, it was enriched in mRNAs encoding proteins of no known function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s001">S1 Table</xref> sheet 9). More detailed analysis of these mRNAs placed them into three categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s008">S3 Fig</xref>). At 27&#x000b0;C most of these mRNAs migrated in the free fraction, lighter than the subunits, and moved into the light polysomes after heat shock. Group (B) mRNAs started in the free fraction, but moved to both the subunit and light polysomal fractions after heat shock (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s008">S3 Fig</xref>). Group (A) mRNAs, which included <italic>ZC3H11</italic>, were distinguished from the others by the fact that they migrated mainly with the subunit fraction at 27&#x000b0;C. We have shown for <italic>ZC3H11</italic> that this is not due to association with a small ribosomal subunit [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and the reason for the different behaviour is unknown. The mRNAs that can bind to ZC3H11 showed slightly higher than average polysome loading at both 27&#x000b0;C and 39&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).</p><p>To find changes in overall abundances of total and polysomal mRNAs, we compared the read counts from total RNA samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s002">S2 Table</xref>, sheets 1 and 2). 260 mRNAs were significantly (&#x0003e;2x, Padj&#x0003c;0.01) increased in <italic>relative</italic> abundance after heat shock (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s002">S2 Table</xref>, sheet 3). However, comparison of the mRNA yields (measured by spliced leader hybridisation as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) revealed that the total amount of mRNA had decreased by about 40% after heat shock. As a consequence, the numbers of copies per cell of most mRNAs were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Those mRNAs for which polysomal association increased tended to show less severe decreases after heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). As noted above, it is not possible to assign cause and effect since translation could influence degradation and <italic>vice-versa</italic>.</p><p>The mRNAs that bind to ZC3H11 encode proteins that are always needed in high amounts, even at 27&#x000b0;C. These mRNAs were correspondingly strongly polysome associated at 27&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). This is probably ZC3H11-independent because ZC3H11 is barely detectable at 27&#x000b0;C and RNAi has no effect on cell proliferation or morphology [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Association of ZC3H11 target mRNAs with polysomes was more marked at 39&#x000b0;C, when ZC3H11 is expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), but the relative increases were not significantly different from those of the bulk mRNA population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Heat shock at 39&#x000b0;C changes the abundances of mRNAs associated with differentiation</title><p>We now looked at the proteins encoded by mRNAs whose relative abundances increased at least 2-fold after one hour at 39&#x000b0;C, or which moved from non-translated to polysomal fractions. As expected, these included mRNAs encoding several chaperones, including two ZC3H11 targets (Tb927.10.16100 and Tb927.2.5980) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004982.t001">Table 1</xref>). There was also a moderate increase in the mRNA encoding the major cytosolic HSP70. The surprise came when we compared this group of mRNAs with transcriptomes from various developmental stages. We found a very significant overlap with mRNAs that are increased during the differentiation of procyclic-form trypanosomes to epimastigotes, metacyclic forms, and bloodstream forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g003">Fig 3A &#x00026; 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s002">S2 Table</xref>, Sheet 3). Even three of the chaperones were in this category. Notable among the epimastigote- or salivary-gland-specific genes were several that are associated with meiosis, MND1, HOP1, SPO11 and MSH5 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004982.t001">Table 1</xref>). The MND1 homologue (Tb927.11.5670) mRNA was not only increased in the total RNA, but also moved towards polysomes (45% in polysomes at 27&#x000b0;C, 74% at 39&#x000b0;C). The HOP1 homologue (Tb927.10.5490) mRNA showed a similar shift towards the polysomal fraction, but no RNA abundance change. YFP-tagged versions of both proteins are restricted to the nuclei of epimastigote-like cells in salivary glands [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. SPO11 is probably also meiosis specific. MSH5 is annotated as a putative meiosis mismatch repair protein but there is no experimental evidence for this. Apart from these, mRNAs encoding several putative cell cycle regulators and a telomere-binding protein were increased in abundance or polysome association (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004982.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pntd.0004982.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0004982.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Heat shock induces some developmentally regulated mRNAs.</title><p>The Venn diagrams are constructed such that all areas are proportional to the numbers of genes included.

regulators of differentiation are induced at 39&#x000b0;C</title><p>The numerous changes in developmentally regulated mRNAs after an hour at 39&#x000b0;C suggested that some regulatory proteins might also have been affected. Indeed, mRNAs encoding 9 potential RNA-binding proteins were increased after heat shock (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004982.t001">Table 1</xref>). Of these, two mRNAs&#x02014;<italic>DRBD6</italic> and <italic>RBP6</italic> &#x02013;peak in salivary gland parasites [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Only 55% of the <italic>RBP6</italic> mRNA was in polysomes at 27&#x000b0;C, but 87% was in the fraction after heat shock. Induced expression of RBP6 in procyclic forms is known to trigger the procyclic-epimastigote-metacyclic differentiation cascade [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. <italic>RBP10</italic> mRNA, which also increased after heat shock, is most abundant in growing bloodstream forms [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Expression of ZC3H14 and ZC3H45 proteins has not yet been detected but the ZC3H45 mRNA is preferentially translated in bloodstream forms [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; and ZC3H46 protein is more abundant in bloodstream forms than procyclics [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. RBP7 protein is present in slender bloodstream forms and increased in stumpy forms [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. RNAi targeting RBP7 inhibits cAMP-induced stumpy-form differentiation, while overexpression of RBP7 causes G<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>0</sub> cell cycle arrest and causes initial gene expression changes associated with procyclic differentiation [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>In addition to these RNA-binding proteins, heat shock induced mRNAs encoding three protein phosphatases. Two of these have no known function, but <italic>PIP39</italic> mRNA is higher in stumpy and procyclic forms than in bloodstream forms, and PIP39 becomes phosphorylated during stumpy-to procyclic differentiation [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Movement of <italic>PIP39</italic>, <italic>RBP6</italic> and the Tb927.11.4990 kinetoplastid-specific phosphatase mRNA to polysomes, as well as some others with a similar pattern, was confirmed by Northern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Finally, to see whether a more moderate heat shock might also trigger changes in differentiation regulators, we grew procyclic forms at 37&#x000b0;C overnight. Indeed, the levels of both RBP6 and PIP39 proteins were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).</p><fig id="pntd.0004982.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0004982.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Confirmation of results for individual mRNAs.</title><p>(A) Extracts from cells grown only at 27&#x000b0;C, or subjected to a 39&#x000b0;C heat shock, were separated on sucrose gradients: the absorbance profiles of two typical gradients are shown.

(For comparison, a ribosome is just under 30nm across.) The trapped material can then be released with high salt, so that a further centrifugation yields a small granule (SG) supernatant and a large granule (LG) pellet. First, we examined cells growing at 27&#x000b0;C. The SG fraction contained about 3.2% of the mRNA, and the LG pellet just 0.8%, as judged by hybridisation with a spliced leader probe [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s004">S4 Table</xref>, sheet 2).

The replicates for total RNA of cells growing at 27&#x000b0;C did not correlate very well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s009">S4A Fig</xref>), perhaps because the cells had somewhat different cell densities at the time of harvest (about 3.7 x10<sup>6</sup> and 5 x 10<sup>6</sup>/ml). For the 27&#x000b0;C samples we therefore also compared the granule results for individual replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s004">S4 Table</xref>, sheet 4) with those for the input in the polysome experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s004">S4 Table</xref>, sheet 5, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s009">S4A Fig</xref>). Independent of the way the calculation was done, the proportion of mRNA that was trapped inside the microtubule corset in normally growing cells was determined mainly by the length of either the open reading frame or the complete mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g005">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s010">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>). This suggests that the trapping was due simply to the size of the polysome and had nothing to do with regulation or granule formation. There was no significant correlation between the percentage in granule fractions and the percentage in polysomes at 27&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). It was however notable that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins were not trapped in granule fractions at all.

First, we compared results for total mRNAs with those obtained at 39&#x000b0;C, and also with previously published results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s006">S1C&#x02013;S1E Fig</xref>). The variability in the 27&#x000b0;C dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s009">S4A Fig</xref>) meant that P-values for the total RNAs were high (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s005">S5 Table</xref>) and the overall correlation between different experiments was poor. This probably reflects differences in cell density as well as temperature. However, a core set of mRNAs was increased in at least 2, and often all three, datasets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004982.t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s002">S2 Table</xref>, sheet 11). In addition to a few chaperone mRNAs, these once again included mRNAs indicative of developmental regulation. They encoded CYC7, CYC11 and CYC10; SPO11 and MND1; bloodstream-specific alternative oxidase, pyruvate kinase and GPI-PLC; 6 protein kinases; 3 protein phosphatases including PTP1; and 8 RNA-binding proteins including both RBP10 and RBP6.</p><p>After one hour at 41&#x000b0;C, 6% of the total mRNA was in the small granule fraction, and 19% in large granules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s004">S4 Table</xref>, Sheet 2). At the level of mRNAs from individual genes, however, the distribution looked very different.This is because half of the sequence reads were contributed by the most abundant 10% of the transcripts. For most coding sequences, 20&#x02013;60% of the mRNA was in one of the granule fractions, usually with the large granule fraction predominating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). In contrast, a subset of very abundant mRNAs was not associated with granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). These included those encoding ribosomal proteins, procyclin, the major cytosolic HSP70, mitochondrial HSP60 and a DNAj (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g005">5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s009">S4C and S4D</xref>.). Other mRNAs that showed less than 20% association with heat shock granules were those encoding histones, alpha and beta tubulin, 10 additional chaperones, the cytochrome oxidase complex and a few proteins involved in ribosome assembly. An ANOVA test showed that the mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins were the only functional category that showed unique behaviour with regard to heat shock granule association (P = .00015 with Bonferoni correction). In subsequent analyses we therefore treated this group separately.</p><p>We previously showed that ZC3H11 prevents degradation of bound mRNAs after a 41&#x000b0;C heat shock [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Correspondingly, mRNAs that co-purify with ZC3H11 [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] tend to escape granule association. For the 23 mRNAs that showed the strongest enrichment in the ZC3H11-bound fraction [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], a median of 20% was associated with total granules, whereas for unbound mRNAs the median was 40% (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g005">5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g006">6A</xref>). A similar result was obtained if large granules alone were analysed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s009">S4E Fig</xref>). As previously noted, the ability to bind ZC3H11 also correlated with higher association with polysomes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g005">5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g006">6B</xref>). These results suggest that ZC3H11-bound mRNAs are protected against mRNA degradation, translational inactivation, and incorporation into granules. To check this hypothesis, we prepared granule fractions from cells with and without heat shock and / or <italic>ZC3H11</italic> RNAi. Without RNAi, two target mRNAs encoding HSP70 and an FKBP remained largely in the soluble fractions despite heat shock: as seen from the RNASeq results, only a tiny proportion was detected in the large granule fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). ZC3H11 depletion had very little effect on this distribution without heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g007">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>). After heat shock, however, granule-free <italic>HSP70</italic> and <italic>FKBP</italic> mRNA disappeared but neither mRNA accumulated in the large granule fraction either: instead, the mRNAs were simply destroyed.</p><fig id="pntd.0004982.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0004982.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Binding to ZC3H11 related to polysome association and granule incorporation.</title><p>The ability of mRNAs to associate with ZC3H11 was previously assessed by co-immunoprecipitation [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

The first conclusion generalises results that were already seen for reporters with the <italic>HSP70</italic> 3'-UTR, while the second is consistent with previous published data indicating that mRNAs in stress granules are not translated [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The mRNAs that are bound by ZC3H11 are already quite well translated at 27&#x000b0;C, and become even more so after heat shock: it is possible that this high translation protects them from incorporation into heat shock granules; alternatively ZC3H11 and its associated proteins [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] might prevent sequestration of bound mRNAs into granules.</p><p>Our results show that heat shock granules are not identical to starvation granules, despite sharing some of the same proteins and mRNAs. Some mRNAs that were excluded (&#x0003c;20%) from heat shock granules were also similarly absent from starvation granules [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Presumably these encode products that are required to recover from both starvation and heat shock. Apart from ribosomal protein mRNAs, which are probably a special case and are discussed below, several chaperone mRNAs were in this category. In contrast, ZC3H11 is not implicated in the starvation response, and its mRNA was 25% in heat shock granules but 79% in starvation granules. Other mRNAs that showed a similar pattern encoded RBP3, ZC3H30, ZFP1, RBP6 and a histone H3 variant [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. PABP1 may be important in protecting ZC3H11 target mRNAs, since it is recruited by the ZC3H11-MKT1-PBP1 complex [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The level of ZC3H11 protein is not increased after starvation, which explains why some ZC3H11 target mRNAs are incorporated into starvation granules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004982.s004">S4 Table</xref>, sheet 7).</p><p>The mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins were almost completely excluded from both heat shock granules and starvation granules [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Only two annotated "ribosomal protein" mRNAs, Tb927.10.10010 and Tb927.11.6360, did not follow this pattern, but neither is a structural component of the mature ribosome. The extraordinary behaviour is therefore a universal characteristic of mRNAs that encode components of the mature ribosome. These mRNAs are also outliers in other ways: the mRNA levels are higher that would be predicted based on their half lives and gene copy numbers [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and the average ribosome densities are relatively low (mostly less than 4 ribosomes/kb) [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] although the majority of the mRNAs are loaded onto polysomes [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Association with polysomes is also notably decreased after heat shock, without much loss of the mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>): it looks as if the mRNAs are being conserved in some way other than granule sequestration. The ribosomal protein mRNAs are co-regulated during trypanosome differentiation, being decreased in stationary phase trypanosomes and increasing only 1h after addition of the differentiation stimulator cis-aconitate [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]; this is consistent with the fact that they mostly peak in the G1 phase of the cell cycle [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We examined the untranslated regions of these mRNAs for specific enriched motifs and found none. The only notable feature is that the 5'-UTRs are very short, with a median length of 22nt, as opposed to 108 for other mRNAs (mean&#x000b1;SDs are 33&#x000b1;34 as opposed to 203&#x000b1;274).Given the lack of conserved linear motifs, it is possible that secondary structures are important; or, more unusually, ribosomal protein mRNAs might be characterised by a <italic>lack</italic> of motifs required for recruitment of SCD6 [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or other granule proteins. Alternatively they might be regulated via recognition of the nascent polypeptides.</p><p>Our investigation of polysome loading revealed interesting sets of mRNAs that were retained in polysomes and/or increased in abundance at 39&#x000b0;. Some, like ZC3H11, were rather poorly translated at the normal temperature; these migrated either near 40S, or somewhat above 40S. The reason for the difference is unknown but binding to the small subunit is unlikely [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The 7 mRNAs with patterns most similar to that of <italic>ZC3H11</italic> encoded a protein kinase, a protein phosphatase, a DNAj-like protein, and 4 other proteins of unknown function. There is no evidence of any link between these proteins and ZC3H11 function: although ZC3H11 is phosphorylated, the most likely culprit is a different kinase, casein kinase 1.2 [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting observation was that the mRNAs that showed increased translation or abundance at 39&#x000b0;C included mRNAs that are up-regulated in salivary gland trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004982.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The mammalian body environment has a temperature of 37&#x000b0;C (possibly higher in organs) and a 10&#x000b0;C temperature decrease is known to be an important factor in the switch from bloodstream to procyclic forms. However, the mRNAs that increased were <italic>not</italic> necessarily bloodstream-form specific. Indeed, the mRNAs encoding three chaperones, two cyclins, the meiotic mRNA MND1, and the RNA-binding proteins DRBD6 and RBP6, are elevated in salivary-gland parasites but not bloodstream forms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004982.t001">Table 1</xref>). Induced expression of RBP6 in procyclic trypanosome cultures (at 27&#x000b0;C) causes differentiation to epimastigotes, and then to metacyclic forms: after 24h of RBP6 expression, about 10% of cells are epimastigotes, while metacyclics begin to appear after 5&#x02013;6 days [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is therefore formally possible that all of the polysomal RNA changes that we saw upon heat shock are caused by RBP6. However, this seems unlikely since the 1-h time frame is extremely short. For example, the trypanosome alternative oxidase protein appears after 2 days of RBP6 expression, but the mRNA (Tb927.10.9760) moves towards the polysomes after only an hour at 39&#x000b0;C (to 72% from 54%).</p><p>Differentiation of bloodstream forms to procyclic forms includes an intermediate called the short stumpy form. Stumpy forms are arrested in G1, and express some proteins of procyclic form metabolism. Further differentiation to procyclic forms is induced by addition of cis-aconitate and a decrease in temperature from 37&#x000b0;C to 27&#x000b0;C. Heat shock of procyclic forms resulted in increased polysomal levels of two mRNAs implicated in this process. The first was the protein phosphatase PIP39, which is essential for differentiation of stumpy forms to procyclic forms [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and which was increased at the protein level by incubating the procyclic forms at 37&#x000b0;C. RBP7, a potential RNA-binding protein, is required for differentiation of bloodstream forms to stumpy forms [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and this mRNA moved towards polysomes after heat shock of procyclics. Importantly, we showed that PIP39 and RBP6 proteins increased in procyclics incubated at 37&#x000b0;C, which is a temperature that is quite likely to occur in the wild. It is possible that both PIP39 and RBP7 have functions&#x02013;perhaps linked to growth arrest&#x02014;in both the stumpy-&#x0003e;procyclic and in the procyclic-&#x0003e;epimastigote transitions.</p><p>There are several indications that stress responses can promote trypanosome differentiation, but it is not always clear whether differentiation is a direct or indirect effect [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. If cell cycle arrest is needed for alterations in signalling and re-programming of gene expression, and a stress causes cell cycle arrest, differentiation might be enhanced although the stress does not induce differentiation directly. For example, the differentiation of stumpy forms to procyclic forms can be enhanced or promoted by a variety of stressful treatments, including mild cold shock [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], glucose deprivation [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], mild acid [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and protease treatment [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], as well as by cis-aconitate. It is not known which of these stresses is physiologically relevant in tsetse. We know even less&#x02014;in fact, nothing&#x02014;about the stimuli within the fly digestive tract that initiate the development of procyclic forms to epimastigotes and metacyclic forms. A heat shock is definitely not required since development happens in laboratory tsetse colonies in which temperatures are controlled below 30&#x000b0;C. In Africa, however, tsetse are very likely to experience higher environmental temperatures, and the developing trypanosomes are exposed to warm blood meals every 3&#x02013;5 days [<xref rid="pntd.0004982.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It is therefore possible that in the wild, temperature fluctuations inside tsetse, or other stresses, could play a role in trypanosome life-cycle progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004982.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>RNASeq data: Effect of a 39&#x000b0;C heat shock analysed by DESeq.</title><p>For detailed legend see Sheet 1.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004982.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004982.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>RNASeq data: Effect of a 29&#x000b0;C heat shock on the polysomal distribution of mRNAs.</title><p>For detailed legend see Sheet 1.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004982.s002.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004982.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Genes with different numbers of (AU) repeats in their 3'-UTRs.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004982.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004982.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>RNASeq data: Raw results and fractions of mRNAs in heat shock granules.</title><p>For detailed legend see Sheet 1.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004982.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004982.s005"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>RNASeq data: DESeq results comparing granule mRNAs with input, and total mRNA from with and without heat shock.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004982.s005.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004982.s006"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>RNASeq data: Correlations between replicates and comparison with previous results.</title><p>(A) The fractions in total polysomes at 27&#x000b0;C and 39&#x000b0;C for individual open reading frames, for replicate 1 (R1) and replicate 2 (R2).
