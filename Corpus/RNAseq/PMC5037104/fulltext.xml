More so, the association of allelically imbalanced genes to important traits is yet to be understood. Here we assessed allelic imbalance (AI) in the heterozygote state of rice under non- and water-stress treatments and determined association of asymmetrically expressed genes with grain yield (GY) under drought stress by <italic>in-silico</italic> co-localization analysis and selective genotyping. The genotypes IR64, Apo and their F1 hybrid (IR64&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Apo) were grown under normal and water-limiting conditions. We sequenced the total RNA transcripts for all genotypes then reconstructed the two chromosomes in the heterozygote.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We are able to estimate the transcript abundance of and the differential expression (DE) between the two parent-specific alleles in the rice hybrids. The magnitude and direction of AI are classified into two categories: (1) symmetrical or biallelic and (2) asymmetrical. The latter can be further classified as either IR64- or Apo-favoring gene. Analysis showed that in the hybrids grown under non-stress conditions, 179 and 183 favor Apo- and IR64-specific alleles, respectively. Hence, the number of IR64- and Apo-favoring genes is relatively equal. Under water-stress conditions, 179 and 255 favor Apo- and IR64-specific alleles, respectively, indicating that the number of allelically imbalanced genes is skewed towards IR64. This is nearly 40&#x02013;60&#x000a0;% preference for Apo and IR64 alleles, respectively, to the hybrid transcriptome. We also observed genes which exhibit allele preference switching when exposed to water-stress conditions. Results of <italic>in-silico</italic> co-localization procedure and selective genotyping of Apo/IR64 F<sub>3:5</sub> progenies revealed significant association of several asymmetrically expressed genes with GY under drought stress conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggest that water stress skews AI on a genome-wide scale towards the IR64 allele, the cross-specific maternal allele. Several asymmetrically expressed genes are strongly associated with GY under drought stress which may shed hints that genes associated with important traits are allelically imbalanced. Our approach of integrating hybrid expression analysis and QTL mapping analysis may be an efficient strategy for shortlisting candidate genes for gene discovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12284-016-0123-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.)</kwd><kwd>Allele-specific expression (ASE)</kwd><kwd>Allelic imbalance (AI)</kwd><kwd>Drought</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>Selective genotyping</kwd><kwd>Co-localization analysis</kwd><kwd>Quantitative trait loci (QTL)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>-</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Powell</surname><given-names>Wayne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Studies reveal that heritable variations do not reside in protein-coding DNA alone but also in the regulatory sequences. It is now increasingly clear that DNA segments coding for proteins account for only one aspect of heritable variations.</p><p>Non-coding variants, gene imprinting, epigenetic factors, <italic>trans</italic>-acting elements, among others were revealed to play important roles in variations and diversity. Even an alteration in one or more nucleotides in the <italic>cis-</italic>acting regulatory elements residing in non-coding regions of the DNA contributes to phenotypic variations. It can alter the binding of a transcription factor (TF) affecting transcription initiation, rate and stability which consequently brings about asymmetric expression of alleles residing in one genome, a phenomenon called allele-specific expression (ASE) imbalance or simply allelic imbalance (AI) (Syv&#x000e4;nen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>; Heap et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>; Bell and Beck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>).</p><p>Preferential expression of one allele over another can be detected by differences in transcript number. ASE is ascribed to <italic>cis-</italic>acting polymorphism, <italic>cis-</italic>acting epigenetic effectors, or a combination of both genetic and epigenetic effectors as <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors have an equal opportunity to affect both alleles within a nucleus (Bell and Beck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>; Guo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>).</p><p>AI has been the subject of several studies in humans (some are described by Syv&#x000e4;nen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>; Tsuchiya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>; Voutsinas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2010</xref>) and mouse hybrids (Crowley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>). A review of the research in AI and its regulatory mechanism was published by Gaur et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>). It has been likewise reported to occur in several crop hybrids such as maize (Springer and Stupar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007a</xref>), barley (von Korff et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2009</xref>), and rice (Guo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>). A recent report showed that ASE exists in the natural populations of <italic>Cirsium arvense</italic>, an invasive Compositae weed (Bell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2013</xref>). In maize, a review showed the potential contributions of allelic variation to heterosis (Springer and Stupar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007b</xref>) and the prevalence of <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory variations which contribute to biased allelic expression (Springer and Stupar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007a</xref>).</p><p>Only a limited number of studies on AI in rice has been conducted and hence it is still poorly understood. He et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>) found that gene activity was correlated with DNA methylation and both active and repressive histone modifications in the transcribed region. Using SNPs as markers, they observed a high correlation of allelic bias of epigenetic modifications or gene expression in reciprocal hybrids with differences in the parental lines. The study concluded that transcriptional and epigenetic trends in reciprocal rice hybrids contribute to heterosis.</p><p>A similar study by Wang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>) indicated that drought-induced genome-wide DNA methylation changes accounted for ~12.1&#x000a0;% of the total site-specific methylation differences in the rice genome. These epigenetic changes can be considered as an important regulatory mechanism for rice plants to adapt to drought and other environmental stresses.</p><p>A recent study on epigenomic analysis using ChIP-seq on <italic>indica-indica</italic> hybrids concluded that histone modifications regulate AI (Guo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>). This study confirms the contribution of epigenetic mechanism in AI. Earlier studies in rice also suggested that <italic>trans</italic> effects mediate the majority of the transcriptional differences in hybrid offspring and to a lesser extent, intergenerational epimutations (Chodavarapu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>). These studies in rice showed the important role of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors on asymmetric expression of parent-specific alleles. However, little is known about ASE in rice under contrasting environmental conditions.</p><p>Here we identified genes exhibiting AI under two different water regimes and demonstrated their association with drought-yield QTLs. We reasoned that by exposing the hybrids to two contrasting conditions, we can identify genes that exhibit AI and condition-mediated changes in their ASE profiles. We hypothesized that such genes can be highly associated with drought-tolerance response and can be linked with previously identified drought-response QTLs in the same genetic background.</p><p>Specifically, we measured AI in the F1 hybrids and determined changes in ASE profiles of genes between non- and water-stress treatments in the <italic>indica-indica</italic> genetic background using the two varieties IR64 and Apo (IR55423-01). IR64 is a high-yielding variety but was previously shown to be moderately susceptible to drought conditions. Apo, on the other hand, is a drought-tolerant indica variety.</p><p>Our study is limited to one-way hybrid cross (IR64&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Apo) exposed to two contrasting water regimes to provide cross-specific information on the effect of stress on allelic imbalance then assess the association of asymmetrically expressed genes with previously identified QTLs known to be involved in drought response. We employed RNA-seq platform to: (1) identify genes asymmetrically expressed between the two genotype-specific alleles in the hybrid in non- and water-stress conditions, (2) assess the level of expression and parental allele preference (magnitude and direction, respectively) of AI on a genome-wide scale, (3) compare the ASE profile of genes under non- and water-stress conditions and then assess changes in expression patterns as effected by the two treatments, and (4) assess the participation of AI genes on drought response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>Using RNA-seq, AI was assessed in one-way hybrid cross in rice after exposure to non- and water-stress conditions. Water-stress treatment was initiated at the early stage of flowering after which collection of leaf samples was performed. This is the stage when rice is most sensitive to drought consequently affecting grain yield (Boonjung and Fukai, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1996</xref>). Genes identified to exhibit asymmetric expression using AI assay were further tested for their association with drought-yield QTLs by <italic>in-silico</italic> colocalization procedure and selective genotyping.</p><p>To generate the hybrids, two genotypes with contrasting response to water-limiting conditions were crossed: (i) IR64, a popular high-yielding drought-susceptible <italic>indica</italic>, and (ii) Apo (IR55423-01), an upland drought-tolerant <italic>indica</italic>. Both materials have been used in previous studies on selection for yield (Venuprasad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2007</xref>; Venuprasad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2008</xref>) and QTL mapping (Venuprasad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>) under drought stress. We sequenced the RNA of twelve samples which includes the two parental genotypes and the hybrids exposed to two contrasting treatments (3 genotypes&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 treatments&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 replicates) using Illumina platform (described in the Materials and Methods) and generated a pseudo-molecule based on the <italic>O. sativa</italic> MSU7 cDNA (Nipponbare, a <italic>japonica</italic>). A pseudo-reference sequence was created for the subsequent data analysis because of the sequence variations between <italic>japonica</italic> and <italic>indica</italic> (i.e. reference genome versus our parental <italic>indica</italic> genotypes, respectively).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Construction of a Pseudo-Reference Sequence</title><p>To create a pseudo-reference sequence, SNPs and InDels were identified between <italic>japonica</italic> and <italic>indica</italic>. After mapping the reads from the parental genotypes Apo and IR64 (4 samples each) to the MSU7 cDNA sequences, we found 106,884 sites (SNPs) which are common to both Apo and IR64 but different from those from the reference, and 8340 sites (InDels) which are common insertions or deletions in Apo and IR64 but different from the reference. These variations imply that there are about 0.92 SNPs and 0.07 InDels per kilobase. The identified SNPs and InDels in this step were used to replace the corresponding nucleotides in the reference MSU7 cDNA sequences to construct the pseudo-reference sequence. The alignment rates of the reads generated from the 12 samples which mapped against the pseudo-reference range from 67.21 to 85.31&#x000a0;% while the alignment rates range from 66.11 to 84.19&#x000a0;% if the reads were mapped against the original MSU7 cDNA sequences. These results show a 0.7&#x02013;1.6&#x000a0;% improvement rates (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of the mapping rates using the reads generated from the samples as query sequence and the original MSU7 cDNA reference and the pseudo-reference as the subject sequences</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th rowspan="2" colspan="2">Treatments</th><th colspan="3">Rep 1</th><th colspan="3">Rep 2</th></tr><tr valign="top"><th>Original MSU7 (%)</th><th>Pseudo-reference (%)</th><th>Improvement (%)</th><th>Original MSU7 (%)</th><th>Pseudo-reference (%)</th><th>Improvement (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="3">Control</td><td>Apo</td><td char="." align="char">77.42</td><td char="." align="char">78.43</td><td char="." align="char">1.01</td><td char="." align="char">84.19</td><td char="." align="char">85.31</td><td char="." align="char">1.12</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>IR64</td><td char="." align="char">77.92</td><td char="." align="char">79.03</td><td char="." align="char">1.11</td><td char="." align="char">78.07</td><td char="." align="char">79.68</td><td char="." align="char">1.61</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>F1</td><td char="." align="char">76.65</td><td char="." align="char">77.77</td><td char="." align="char">1.12</td><td char="." align="char">83.78</td><td char="." align="char">85.23</td><td char="." align="char">1.45</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="3">Stress</td><td>Apo</td><td char="." align="char">78.8</td><td char="." align="char">79.91</td><td char="." align="char">1.11</td><td char="." align="char">83.53</td><td char="." align="char">84.7</td><td char="." align="char">1.17</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>IR64</td><td char="." align="char">66.11</td><td char="." align="char">67.21</td><td char="." align="char">1.1</td><td char="." align="char">70.28</td><td char="." align="char">71.75</td><td char="." align="char">1.47</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>F1</td><td char="." align="char">78.34</td><td char="." align="char">79.11</td><td char="." align="char">0.77</td><td char="." align="char">81.01</td><td char="." align="char">82.6</td><td char="." align="char">1.59</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p>We also mapped the reads of the <italic>indica</italic> rice variety 93-11 from Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) against the original MSU7 cDNA sequences and the pseudo-reference. Their alignments yielded 70.06&#x000a0;% and 71.15&#x000a0;% mapping rates, respectively. These figures indicate an improvement of the mapping rate by 1.09&#x000a0;% which is approximately the same as that of the observed values from our 12 samples. The increase in the alignment rates shows that extra information was incorporated in the pseudo-molecule sequences by modifying the SNP and InDel sites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Identification of SNPs to Identify the IR64 and Apo Alleles</title><p>In this study, the SNPs were used as molecular markers to identify which alleles in the hybrids belong to which parental genotypes. The reads from the eight samples of Apo and IR64 were mapped against the pseudo-reference by bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>). We found 48,175 sites which showed polymorphism between Apo and IR64. This modest level of polymorphism may be possibly due to the similarity of the two genomes since both are <italic>indica</italic>. Low level polymorphism had been previously reported between parents belonging to the same ecotypes (Ali et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2000</xref>).</p><p>Using these 48,175 SNPs, we were able to identify which SNP alleles in the hybrids belong to which parental genotypes. We refer our strategy of finding parent-specific alleles in the hybrids as &#x02018;read-wise&#x02019; which is described in the Materials and Methods. Under normal conditions, 2.56&#x000a0;% and 5.41&#x000a0;% of the F1 reads from reps 1 and 2, respectively, can be identified as either IR64- or Apo-specific alleles. Under water-stress conditions, 1.52&#x000a0;% and 5.23&#x000a0;% of the F1 reads from reps 1 and 2, respectively, can be identified (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

</p><p>A modest percentage level of F1 reads containing information on their parental origins was obtained due to the low densities of parental SNPs (48175/66338&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.72 SNPs per gene on average), i.e. between Apo and IR64 transcriptomes. Most of the sequence reads do not show SNPs between the parents and therefore were discarded for further analysis on AI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Genome-Wide Analysis of ASE in the F1</title><p>The magnitude and direction of ASE of genes in the rice hybrids were estimated and classified into two categories depending on the fold change (FC) values between Apo and IR64 (Apo/IR64) the cross-specific paternal and maternal alleles, respectively. These categories include: (1) symmetrically or biallelically expressed, and (2) asymmetrically expressed or imbalanced genes. Symmetrical expression happens when genes have relatively equal expression between the two genotype-specific alleles in the hybrids at fold expression ratio lower than 1.25&#x000d7;. Because both alleles are expressed at a relatively equal magnitude, the expression is biallelic. The minimum fold value of 1.25&#x000d7; has been used previously (Bell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2013</xref>; McManus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2010</xref>) and will be widely used in this paper. Asymmetrical or imbalanced, on the other hand, happens when the allelic expression fold difference between the two alleles is equal to or more than 1.25&#x000d7;. This can be further classified into two sub-categories: IR64- and Apo-favoring genes. The former type happens when IR64-specific allele of the same locus supersedes the expression of the other by at least 1.25 fold; the latter when the reverse happens.</p><p>This classification is similar to a previous report (Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>). However, the maternal and paternal allelic contributions were effectively estimated in the present study while the former report could not distinguish the parental alleles in the hybrids mainly due to technological limitations at that time. Furthermore, monoallelic expression was not significantly observed in our study. This happens when only one of the two parent-specific alleles is expressed.</p><p>In this study, some genes have been identified to have more than one splice variant as a consequence of alternative splicing. Thus, genes will be represented in terms of gene models or transcript variants as described in MSU Rice Genome Annotation located at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/">http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/</ext-link>.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>AI at 1.25&#x000d7; Fold Expression</title><p>Using our pipeline, we found 2337 and 2092 genes with SNPs between the two genotype-specific alleles in the hybrid under non- and water-stress conditions, respectively (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). The modest number of genes is due to the limited variations between the two parental genomes in the heterozygote. Of these, only 560 genes exhibited significant DE between the two alleles under normal conditions at <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). This corresponds to 24.0&#x000a0;% of the total number of genes detected (560/2337). On the other hand, under water-stress conditions, 676 genes showed significant DE between the two genomes in the heterozygous state which corresponds to 32.2&#x000a0;% of the total number of genes (676/2092) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S4). These results indicate that a higher number of genes significantly differentially expressed between the two alleles are induced in response to water-stress conditions.</p><p>Under non-stress treatment, 179 and 183 genes favorably expressed Apo- and IR64-specific alleles, respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) using a 1.25&#x000d7; fold expression ratio as threshold. These values show that under normal conditions, the number of genes favoring each parental allele in the heterozygote was about equal. This suggests that AI is inherent to the organism, not necessarily induced by stress. There are 198 genes biallelically expressed under normal conditions. This means that both parental alleles at the same locus are expressed in a relatively equal copy number.

</p><p>On the other hand, 179 and 255 genes favored the expression of Apo- and IR64-specific alleles, respectively, under water deficit (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S1B). These figures correspond to 41&#x000a0;%-59&#x000a0;% (nearly 40-60) preferential expression for Apo and IR64 alleles (at 1.25&#x000d7; fold-expression threshold and <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), respectively, for nuclear genome. These figures do not account for the contribution of organellar genomes (i.e. mitochondria and plastids). There appears to be a bias expression of IR64- (maternal) over Apo-specific allele (paternal) for this specific hybrid cross. These data showed that water-stress conditions skewed preferential expression towards IR64-specific allele, the cross-specific maternal allele. There are 242 genes biallelically expressed under water-stress conditions. Notably, the number of genes (179) favorably expressing Apo-specific allele under non- and water-stress conditions remained unchanged; only the number of genes preferentially expressing IR64-specific allele increased from non- to water-stress conditions. Genes in the F1 hybrids exhibiting ASE under water-stress conditions are shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S1B.</p><p>In total, 362 and 434 genes showed AI under normal and stress conditions, respectively, demonstrating a higher number of genes asymmetrically expressed under water-stress conditions. However, if we compute the number of genes exhibiting AI over the total number of transcripts significantly differentially expressed, 64.6&#x000a0;% are imbalanced under normal condition (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This ratio does not significantly deviate from the ratio obtained under stress conditions (64.2&#x000a0;%). This suggests that the stress did not change the ratio of genes exhibiting asymmetric expression over the total number of genes identified to have significant DE between the two alleles. The stress only enhances gene expression and skews the number of AI genes toward the IR64 allele, the cross-specific maternal allele.</p><p>A summary of results on AI is shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Heat maps were also generated to show the allele-specific preference of each F1 gene under non- and water-stress conditions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S1A and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S1B).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>DE at 2.0&#x000d7; Fold Expression</title><p>If we are to impose a minimum FC of 2.0&#x000d7;, 77 and 80 showed preferential expression for Apo- and IR64-specific alleles, respectively, under non-stress conditions. A 2.0&#x000d7; fold minimum expression difference was used in previous studies (Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>; Paschold et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2012</xref>). These data show that 157 genes (28.0&#x000a0;%) are asymmetrically expressed under normal conditions. There are 403 and 512 biallelically expressed genes under normal and water-stress conditions, respectively. Under water-stress conditions, of the 676 genes, 69 preferentially expressed for the Apo-specific allele, two of which are monoallelically expressed, and 95 preferentially expressed the IR64-specific allele. This further affirms that water-stress skews the number of genes in favor of the IR64-specific allele, a bias expression towards the cross-specific maternal allele.</p><p>If we consider 2.0&#x000d7; fold expression ratios, these ratios (28.0&#x000a0;% and 24.3&#x000a0;%, under non- and water-stress, respectively) are lower than the values reported in the literature. However, if the cut-off is set at 1.25&#x000d7; fold, these ratios are more consistent with those reported previously. A study in barley showed that 63&#x000a0;% of genes (19/30) tested showed allelic expression imbalances (von Korff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2009</xref>). In maize, 43-53&#x000a0;% of the 316 analyzed genes (depending on the cross and tissues) showed unequal allelic expression (Springer and Stupar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007b</xref>). A similar study on genome-wide ASE analysis using massively parallel signature sequencing showed that 60&#x000a0;% of the genes in the maize hybrid meristems exhibited differential allelic expression (Guo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>). Additionally, different approaches to measure ASE may influence these variations (von Korff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2009</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the hybrid expresses higher number of genes significantly differentially expressed between the two alleles (at <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) during water-stress conditions as compared to during normal conditions indicating that water stress enhances gene expression. Our results further suggest that genes exhibiting AI is inherent to the organism regardless of the conditions and is not a consequence of stress. On a genome-wide scale, the number of genes favoring each of the parental alleles approaches a normal distribution curve (using 2.0&#x000d7; fold minimum level of expression; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). However, at water-limiting conditions, the distribution curve is skewed towards IR64-specific allele &#x02013; a global distortion of preferential expression. This indicates that more genes favor the maternal over the paternal allele under stress conditions in this particular hybrid cross. It is surprising to note that while Apo is the drought-tolerant genotype, IR64-specific allele is preferentially expressed in the hybrid. This is contrary to our initial speculation that the tolerant genotype (Apo) should exhibit preferential expression in the heterozygote.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Genome-wide analysis of ASE in F1 at (left) non- and (right) water-stress conditions (for 2&#x000d7; fold minimum expression).

</p><p>We speculate that this genome-wide change is a mechanism to respond to water-limiting conditions and that <italic>trans</italic>-sensory effectors may have contributed in the global distortion favoring IR64 allele. This was earlier reported by Tirosh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2009</xref>) in which <italic>trans</italic> effects were condition-dependent and that expression difference in <italic>trans</italic> reflected a differential response to the environment. F1 hybrids exposed under two contrasting treatments have theoretically the same structural sequences including <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements, thus these regulatory regions may not contribute to the expression differences between the samples. While <italic>trans</italic>-sensory effectors may have contributed on these changes, epigenetic factors cannot be entirely excluded as it was earlier reported (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>).</p><p>Whether the genome-wide preferential expression as effected by water-limiting conditions is maternal parent-of-origin or genotype-dependent is yet to be concluded. Further study using reciprocal hybrid cross is recommended to address this question.</p><p>Variations in the <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory sequences cause asymmetric expression of the two genotype-specific alleles in the hybrids because both alleles are exposed to the same pool of <italic>trans</italic> factors within a nuclear environment. However, changes in environmental cues may have affected <italic>trans</italic>-sensory effectors subsequently leading to changes in the genome-wide expression profile. The stress which acted as a &#x0201c;pressure&#x0201d; distorted the normal ASE profile toward IR64 allele. This supports previous studies that such regulatory, as well as epigenetic factors, may have mediated the interactions between the environment and the genome (Tirosh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2009</xref>; Herceg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016</xref>). Furthermore, it was earlier reported that changes in regulatory regions, <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>, may contribute to evolutionary changes (Wittkopp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2004</xref>). However, further studies are needed to elucidate the effect of environmental pressures to evolutionary changes vis-&#x000e0;-vis regulatory factors and the epigenetic landscape.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Relative Transcript Abundance</title><p>The relative transcript abundance of the two parent-specific alleles in the F1 can now be estimated and the relative expression ratios can be derived owing to the advent of sequencing platforms and computational methods. Our data show varying expression ratios between the two transcripts of the same locus in the F1. In some genes, two alleles of the same locus are expressed symmetrically (biallelic) in which both parent-specific transcripts contributed nearly equally to the hybrid transcriptome. For several genes (listed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S4), one of the two alleles shows higher level of expression (dominant) over the other one with lower expression level. For example, in the gene LOC_Os01g27360.1 (glutathione S-transferase), IR64- and Apo-specific alleles contributed 201.08 and 4.75 transcript copies (after normalization and read count adjustment), respectively, to the hybrid transcriptome under non-stress conditions. This is consistent with a recent finding (Gonz&#x000e0;lez-Porta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2013</xref>), in which most protein-coding genes in humans have one major transcript expressed at significantly higher level than others. This spectrum of ratios between the parent-specific transcripts indicates the varying possible interactions that exist between the two genomes in the hybrid.</p><p>Furthermore, the ability of the hybrids to &#x0201c;skew&#x0201d; towards a preferred allele during harsh conditions suggests that the presence of two genomes in the hybrids allow flexibility in response to stressful environments. The expression of two diverse genomes, which is demonstrated by biallelic genes, may subsequently result in a more diverse peptide population when translated. Previous studies in humans suggested that not all the transcripts that contribute to transcriptome diversity are equally likely to contribute to protein diversity (Gonz&#x000e0;lez-Porta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2013</xref>). Jovanovic et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2015</xref>) cited studies indicating a considerable discrepancy between RNA and protein levels. Little is known about genotype-specific alleles in hybrids of crop species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Genes with Extreme Cases of AI</title><p>An allelic expression level difference of 582.6-fold was the highest observed FC which is exhibited by LOC_Os10g24004.1 (unknown), an Apo-favoring gene (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). Consistently, this gene was observed to exhibit the highest expression fold difference of 63.1-fold during water-stress condition, also favoring the Apo-specific allele.</p><p>A gene encoding for SCP-like extracellular protein (LOC_Os01g28450.1) exhibited the second highest expression fold difference of 173.2&#x000d7; during non-stress condition. The same gene also exhibited a relatively high expression difference (47.3&#x000d7; fold) under water-stress condition favoring the Apo allele. On the other hand, genes encoding for glutathione S-transferase (LOC_Os01g27360.1), regulator of ribonuclease (LOC_Os02g52430.1), metallothionein-like protein (LOC_Os05g11320.1) and thaumatin (LOC_Os12g43450.1) showed the highest levels of FC (42.3-, 27.5-, 23.5- and 14.9-fold, respectively) which favor the IR64-specific allele under non-stress conditions. The gene thaumatin was previously shown to confer tolerance against fungal infection and abiotic stresses (Rajam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2007</xref>).</p><p>Under water-stress condition, four splice variants of the gene encoding for jacalin-like lectin proteins (LOC_Os01g24710) were expressed favoring the Apo-specific allele. Two of these variants exhibited monoallelic expression, an extreme case of AI in which the IR64-specific allele is completely silenced. Studies in wheat suggested that these proteins are component of the salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-dependent defense signaling pathways (Xiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>). The other two variants of jacalin-like proteins showed the second and third highest expression difference of 50.2- and 51.8-fold favoring the Apo-specific allele under water-stress condition.</p><p>As in the non-stress conditions, the gene encoding for regulator of ribonuclease showed the highest level of FC (67.2-fold) which favor the IR64-specific allele under water-stress condition (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S4). Additionally, another thaumatin gene was found to have high expression fold difference of 22.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;.</p><p>Notably, genes with extreme fold differences between the two alleles in the heterozygote either confer tolerance or are important components of defense systems under stress conditions. So far, we have established that the number of genes favoring Apo-specific allele is relatively equal to the number of genes preferring IR64-specific under non-stress conditions. However, in terms of the magnitude of expression, several genes strongly express the Apo-specific allele, the paternal allele for this specific hybrid cross, as shown by the high fold-differences between the two parental alleles. This difference in quantitative expression may account for the phenotypic expression of tolerance to water stress in Apo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>ASE Profiles of Genes Between the two Conditions</title><p>We performed pairwise comparison of the ASE profiles of each gene with differentially expressed alleles between the two contrasting conditions to characterize any condition-mediated expression changes.

We speculate that <italic>trans</italic>-sensory and epigenetic factors may have influenced these changes.</p><p>Of these, 18 showed IR64- to Apo-specific allele change from non- to water-stress conditions, respectively. Some of these genes encode for 6-phosphofructokinase (LOC_Os01g09570), Ser/Thr protein phosphatase family protein (LOC_Os11g05400), and ultraviolet-B-repressible protein (LOC_Os03g22370.1). These changes in expression profile are illustrated in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Figure S2C (green cells in the normal to red cells in the water-stress conditions).</p><p>On the other hand, 32 genes showed Apo- to IR64-specific allele change, from normal to stress conditions, respectively (illustrated in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Figure S2C; red cells in the normal to green in stress conditions). These genes include transmembrane amino acid transporter (LOC_Os01g41420), membrane protein (LOC_Os03g51650), and RNA recognition motif (LOC_Os03g17010.1). Another splice variant of the last-named gene (LOC_Os03g17010.2) was found to exhibit tPAV(normal). Additionally, LOC_Os12g18650 has two variants with varying ASE behaviors: versions 6 and 7 exhibit unidirectional (described below) and bidirectional, respectively. These results show that splice variants of a particular gene have varying ASE behaviors with respect to changes in environmental conditions.</p><p>The identification of genes exhibiting bidirectional expression behavior may potentially demonstrate that preferential expression (and possibly dominance) for some genes is condition-mediated as a consequence of gene-environment interactions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Unidirectional</title><p>If there are genes exhibiting bidirectional expression behavior, there are also genes that the organism consistently prefers in both conditions. We call this behavior &#x0201c;unidirectional expression.&#x0201d; The change in ASE profile is in the magnitude alone (expression level), not on the direction (allele preference) since the gene prefers a particular allele in both conditions. Unlike bidirectional, unidirectional genes are minimally influenced by changes in environmental cues. There are 350 (35.9&#x000a0;%) genes which exhibit this type of behavior. Of these, 179 consistently favored IR64-specific allele in both conditions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Figure S2D); 171 favored Apo-specific allele (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>: Figure S2E).</p><p>To summarize, the changes in ASE profiles are ascribed to the presence of two different genomes in the F1 hybrid which allows dynamic expression of either or both alleles under any given condition. Two contrasting genomes in the hybrid provide a wider dynamic response to changes in environmental cues and allow greater potential adaptive advantage. The heterozygosity between the genomes lead to structural and functional diversity of peptides (depending on the functional consequences of translation) inside the cell or tissues which may allow the organism to respond to stress in a way that may not be possible otherwise. Tolerance in this manner is attributed to the ability of the organism to respond with environmental cues vis-&#x000e0;-vis condition-mediated changes in ASE behaviors. These mechanisms provide the organism to adapt to harsh conditions. Parent-specific variations in hybrids allow dynamic interactions and changes in the genome that may endow hybrids with greater ability to adapt to environmental changes or stresses. These information may potentially contribute to the genomic and epigenetic insights explaining heterosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title><italic>In-Silico</italic> Association of AI Genes with Drought-Response QTL</title><p>To initially test the involvement with grain yield (GY), AI genes found to respond in two contrasting water regimes (listed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Tables S5) were aligned <italic>in-silico</italic> with genetic markers identified to have significant effects on GY under drought stress (Venuprasad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>).

</p><p>The marker region RM6333 in chromosome 1 showed a highly significant association with the GY under drought stress. It coincides with the AI genes encoding for DNA polymerase I and receptor-like protein kinase. The contiguous marker RM11943 likewise exhibited significant association with GY under drought stress. A cluster of AI genes was found to coincide with this marker.</p><p>The markers RM5789 and RM3688 in chromosome 2 were found to coincide with the AI genes encoding for photosystem II 5&#x000a0;kDa and protein-binding protein. On the other hand, RM3387 at chromosome 3, which was found to align with the AI gene encoding for stress responsive A/B barrel protein (LOC_Os03g02020.2) in the co-localization analysis, is further shown here to have significant association with GY under drought stress. These findings reinforce the results obtained from the co-localization procedure.</p><p>The marker RM80 on chromosome 8 exhibited significant association with GY under drought stress. This is contiguous to the marker region RM256 (Venuprasad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>) described in the co-localization procedure. AI genes coinciding with these markers are strong candidates for further drought-yield QTL analysis.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Co-Localization Procedure and Selective Genotyping</title><p>Integrating the co-localization procedure and selective genotyping, allelically imbalanced genes are distributed across seven rice chromosomes &#x02013; 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, and 12.

However, eQTL approach utilizes more advanced lines (e.g. recombinant inbred lines, F<sub>3</sub>) or double haploid whereas AI is assayed on F1 hybrids. We showed that integrating hybrid expression analysis with QTL mapping studies provides convergent evidence for potential candidate genes involved in drought response. This study opens up two avenues for further investigation: (1) test the participation of the promising candidate genes in drought response and (2) further analyze the regulatory sequences of these genes.</p><p>This paper may shed insights in assisting breeding design for hybrid crops to improve adaptation and yield to changing climate conditions. Studies using reciprocal hybrid cross is recommended for future investigation.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study reveals that AI was found inherent to rice hybrids regardless of the condition. On a genome-wide scale, water-stress conditions induce gene expression and skew the number of genes exhibiting asymmetric expression in favor of IR64-specific allele. Furthermore, changes in ASE profiles as effected by the two contrasting conditions were revealed, the most interesting of which is the bidirectional expression behavior. This happens when a gene reverses its allele preference from one condition to the other. This gives information that preferential expression (and possibly dominance) for some genes is condition-mediated as a consequence of gene-environment interactions.</p><p>The integration of two inbred genomes in the F1 may bring polymorphism in the <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements that causes AI since both alleles are exposed to the same pool of <italic>trans</italic> factors. The two inbred genomes allow the hybrid to dynamically &#x0201c;select&#x0201d; either one or both alleles, allowing more &#x0201c;options&#x0201d; to express the superior alleles which may provide the hybrids a wider expression and subsequently phenotypic advantages.</p><p>We then validated the involvement of these AI genes using <italic>in-silico</italic> co-localization analysis and selective genotyping. Our results showed a strong association of the genes asymmetrically expressed with previously published drought-QTL markers and markers selected in this study for selective genotyping. This suggests that important trait-associated genes are asymmetrically expressed in the F1 and therefore AI assayed in the hybrid may be an efficient approach to determine candidate genes associated with the phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Dry-Down Experiment</title><p>In this study, rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) F1 hybrids were obtained by crossing IR64 and Apo to study AI under normal and drought conditions. Seeds from the parents and the hybrids were grown in petri plates and were transferred to small pots after germination. Leaf samples from the seedlings were collected to test the hybrid status of the plants. Genomic DNA was extracted using the modified CTAB method as described by Murray and Thompson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1980</xref>). Hybrids were confirmed using SSR markers RM 269, RM 511, and RM 80. After hybrid confirmation, seedlings were transplanted in large pots. The parental and hybrid plants were adequately fertilized and grown under controlled conditions in the phytotron, at IRRI. For water-limiting condition, the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) dry-down approach was used as previously described (Cal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>; Serraj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2014</xref>; Sinclair and Ludlow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1986</xref>).
