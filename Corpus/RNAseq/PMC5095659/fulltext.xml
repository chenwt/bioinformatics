However, plant enzymes that modulate cGMP levels have yet to be identified, so we generated transgenic <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants expressing the rat soluble guanylate cyclase (GC) to increase genetically the level of cGMP and to study the function of cGMP in plant defence responses. Once confirmed that cGMP levels were higher in the GC transgenic lines than in wild-type controls, the GC transgenic plants were then challenged with bacterial pathogens and their defence responses were characterized. Although local resistance was similar in the GC transgenic and wild-type lines, differences in the redox state suggested potential cross-talk between cGMP and the glutathione redox system. Furthermore, large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic analysis highlighted the significant modulation of both gene expression and protein abundance at the infection site, inhibiting the establishment of systemic acquired resistance. Our data indicate that cGMP plays a key role in local responses controlling the induction of systemic acquired resistance in plants challenged with avirulent pathogens.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Plants respond to the presence of microorganisms by deploying efficient defence mechanisms leading to incompatible plant&#x02013;pathogen interactions. These mechanisms include a basal defence response following the recognition of common microbial features, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns or microbe-associated molecular patterns. If this is insufficient, plants have evolved a second layer of strong and potent defences known as the hypersensitive response (HR), which is triggered by the specific recognition of pathogen effectors (Avr) by resistance (R) proteins located on the plasma membrane or in the cytosol.</p><p>Among the first events triggered by the HR is the simultaneous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> and nitric oxide (NO)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. These act in a coordinated manner, according to the so-called &#x02018;balance model&#x02019;, to induce hypersensitive programmed cell death at the infection site to restrict pathogen growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. As well as inducing cell death, NO regulates the expression of a battery of defence genes allowing the establishment of local resistance, and also systemic acquired resistance (SAR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The latter is a broad and long-lasting systemic response that protects uninfected tissues against subsequent infections by diverse pathogens, and this requires the careful balancing of phytohormone cross-talk, which strongly influences the outcome of plant immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The induction of SAR requires the generation of a local signal in infected cells, followed by the transduction of this signal systemically through the vasculature, generally the phloem<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. During this process, NO and ROS act in parallel with salicylic acid (SA) signalling upstream of AzA/G3P and fatty acids for the induction of SAR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>NO signalling can be mediated by the direct interaction between NO and target molecules to introduce post-translational modifications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Alternatively, NO can induce second messengers such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> or cyclic guanosine 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-monophosphate (cGMP) to regulate defence gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The presence of cGMP in plants has been reported in previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, and it can induce defence gene expression in tobacco, indicating an important role in plant defence responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. More recently, cGMP has been shown to accumulate especially during incompatible interactions induced by avirulent bacterial pathogens (<italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> DC3000 carrying the <italic>AvrB</italic> gene) that typically elicit the HR in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The synthesis of cGMP may be required for NO-induced cell death, although the analogue 8-Br-cGMP alone cannot induce cell death or potentiate cell death triggered by a NO donor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Taken together, these results suggest that cGMP could play a key role in plant defences, particularly the mediation of NO-dependent responses.</p><p>Despite the pathophysiological data described above, there is no genetic evidence as yet to support the role of cGMP in plant defence responses. Indeed, despite evidence for the presence of cGMP in plants, the guanylate cyclase (GC) and phosphodiesterase (PDE), which catalyse its synthesis and degradation in other eukaryotes, have yet to be identified in plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Eukaryotic GCs are highly conserved and contain a specific consensus motif which has led to the identification of several candidate plant enzymes by homology searching, namely AtGC1, AtBRI1, AtWAKL10, AtPSKR1, AtPepR1, AtNOGC1 and more recently the plant natriuretic peptide receptor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. However, only AtNOGC1 binds NO, inducing the NO-dependent production of cGMP <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The GC activity of all these proteins is also extremely low compared to animal GCs, raising doubts concerning their physiological relevance for cGMP biosynthesis in plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. A cGMP-specific PDE activity has been detected in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> seedlings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> but the corresponding gene(s) have not been isolated.</p><p>To study the role of cGMP in NO-dependent plant defence responses in the absence of relevant endogenous enzymes, we developed an alternative strategy involving the creation of transgenic <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants expressing mammalian soluble GC (GC). We characterized the transgenic plants, which produced higher levels of cGMP than wild-type controls, to investigate their defence responses when challenged with bacterial pathogens.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Avirulent <italic>PstAvrB</italic> induces a specific NO-dependent increase in cGMP levels</title><p>To monitor the concentration of cGMP in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants we developed a new technique based on Perkin Elmer AlphaScreen technology. The method optimized in this work for plant samples was able to detect cGMP increase in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> leaves infiltrated with the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil 1&#x02009;mg/mL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, reaching around 70&#x02009;pmol/g FW 4&#x02009;hours post-infiltration (hpi) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1a</xref>). Then during the course of infection with an avirulent strain of <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> carrying the avirulent gene <italic>AvrB</italic> (<italic>PstAvrB</italic>), we found that cGMP accumulated in a biphasic manner, with an initial peak 4&#x02009; hpi followed by a decrease to basal levels and a subsequent increase at around 24&#x02009;hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The accumulation of cGMP at each time point appeared strictly related to the HR because there was no increase following infection with virulent <italic>Pst</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). It is worth mentioning that the levels of cGMP detected in this work are around 100 fold higher than the ones reported previously by Meier and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Such difference could be attributable to the methods used for monitoring cGMP in both works. However, the concentrations detected here are of the same order of magnitude than cGMP concentrations reported so far in other plant species, such as tobacco leaves (10&#x02009;pmol/g FW; ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), spruce needles (20&#x02009;pmol/g FW; ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), mung bean explants (40&#x02009;pmol/g FW, ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the increase in cGMP levels induced by <italic>PstAvrB</italic> was shown to be NO-dependent because cGMP did not accumulate in transgenic <italic>A. thaliana hmpX</italic> plants expressing the bacterial NO dioxygenase, which detoxifies NO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Similarly there was no increase following the co-infiltration of wild-type <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plant leaves with avirulent <italic>PstAvrB</italic> together with the NO scavenger cPTIO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1b</xref>). Together these data confirmed that cGMP accumulates specifically during the HR downstream of NO signal, potentially to mediate defence responses.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>High constitutive cGMP content does not affect local resistance to bacterial infection or hypersensitive cell death but compromises defence gene expression in infected leaves</title><p>Homozygous transgenic <italic>A. thaliana</italic> lines expressing the alpha and beta subunits of rat soluble GC were produced by the floral dip method, and lines 6, 26 and 27 showed the expression of both enzyme subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2a</xref>). Furthermore expression levels were strongly correlated with cGMP levels that were higher respect to wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2b</xref>), thus demonstrating enzyme functionality. However, whereas no significant variations were evident in lines GC6 and GC27 after infection with avirulent <italic>PstAvrB</italic>, a strong decrease of cGMP level was observed in line GC26 following bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). For that reason, further characterizations were carried on with lines GC6 and GC27.</p><p>Because cGMP potentially acts as a defence signalling molecule, we tested whether the higher level of cGMP in GC lines could improve basal resistance. Wild-type and GC plants were therefore infected with virulent <italic>Pst</italic> (5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup>&#x02009;cfu/mL) and resistance was assessed by measuring bacterial growth 2 and 3 days after infection. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a</xref> shows that no difference in bacterial growth was observed between wild-type and both GC lines, indicating that elevated cGMP level alone was not enough to enhance basal resistance. Wild-type, GC6 and GC27 plants were also infected with avirulent <italic>PstAvrB</italic> (5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup>&#x02009;cfu/mL) and scored for bacterial growth. Once again, no difference in bacterial counts was observed between the lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), indicating that higher cGMP level was not sufficient to enhance specific gene-for-gene resistance.</p><p>Based on the proposed role of cGMP in NO-mediated hypersensitive cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, ion leakage experiments were carried out to determine whether the higher cGMP content in lines GC6 and GC27 enhanced cell death in response to avirulent pathogens. Wild-type and GC plants were infected with <italic>PstAvrB</italic> (10<sup>7</sup>&#x02009;cfu/mL) and conductivity was measured at different time points after infection to determine the extent of cell death. No difference in ion leakage was observed between the lines, indicating that high cGMP levels do not enhance hypersensitive cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p>To understand whether GC plants were able to induce a full defence response at the molecular level, we analysed the expression of the SA-dependent defence marker gene <italic>PR-1</italic>. Wild-type and GC leaves were infected with avirulent <italic>PstAvrB</italic> and expression analysis was carried out 12&#x02009;hpi. Surprisingly, the <italic>PstAvrB</italic>-induced upregulation of <italic>PR-1</italic> was significantly muted in both GC6 and GC27 plants compared to wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Hormone-dependent signalling pathways in plants are differentially regulated in response to distinct types of pathogens, in particular biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. We therefore investigated the role of cGMP in the cross-talk between different hormonal signalling pathways by monitoring the expression of <italic>PDF1.2</italic> and <italic>ERF1</italic>, which are related to the jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent and ethylene-dependent pathways, respectively. The genes were analysed 12&#x02009;h after infection with <italic>PstAvrB</italic> (10<sup>7</sup>&#x02009;cfu/mL). Interestingly, <italic>PDF1.2</italic> was upregulated in both infected GC lines, whereas <italic>ERF1</italic> was downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d&#x02013;f</xref>). By contrast, the same expression of <italic>PR-1</italic> and <italic>PDF1.2</italic> as found in wild-type plants was observed in GC26 plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>), thus demonstrating that defence gene regulation observed in GC6 and GC27 lines was effectively due to constant high cGMP content. It is worthwhile mentioning that both lines display normal growth of both roots and leaves compared to wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). Moreover, these datasets demonstrate that transgenic lines GC6 and GC27 lines show reproducible phenotypes and therefor further molecular characterization was carried on only with the line GC6 (hereafter GC).</p><p>Together, these results suggested that cGMP modulates the cross-talk between hormone-dependent pathways, promoting JA-dependent responses at the expense of SA-dependent and possibly also ethylene-dependent pathways, downstream of SA and JA production. Indeed, the direct treatment of GC plants with both hormones led to the same altered regulation of <italic>PR-1</italic> and <italic>PDF1.2</italic> in response to salicylic acid or jasmonic acid, respectively, whereas by contrast, high cGMP level seems not to affect ethylene-induced downstream response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>High cGMP levels alter the cellular redox state in response to avirulent pathogens</title><p>NPR1 (non-expresser of PR gene 1) is a master redox sensor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Accordingly, the chemical reduction of NRP1 and thus the induction of NPR1-dependent genes such as <italic>PR-1</italic> correlates with the reductive phase of the defence response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. TGA factors have also been postulated as redox sensors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> because cysteine modification can modulate their binding to NPR1 and to DNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Based on the dysregulation of the NPR1-dependent gene <italic>PR-1</italic> in infected GC plants, we assessed the <italic>in planta</italic> redox state in wild-type and GC line following infection with the avirulent pathogen <italic>PstAvrB</italic>. We generated wild-type and GC plants expressing the genetically-encoded GRX-roGFP2 probe, which specifically reports the ratio between the reduced and oxidized forms of glutathione (GSH/GSSG)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Probe lines were infected with avirulent <italic>PstAvrB</italic> (10<sup>7</sup>&#x02009;cfu/mL) and mock infiltrations were used as a control. This analysis revealed a clear increase in the fluorescence signal (indicative of glutathione pool oxidation) in both genotypes 24&#x02009;hpi, but the increase was much more evident in the GC line, indicating a higher oxidative environment in the plants accumulating cGMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p>Glutathione and to a lesser extent ascorbate play important roles as small-molecule redox couples during stress-related redox signalling in plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. We therefore measured the total glutathione and ascorbate pools, their redox states, as well as enzyme activities related to the ascorbate&#x02013;glutathione cycle. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3b</xref> shows that the total glutathione pool was similar in the wild-type and GC plants 24&#x02009;hpi with the avirulent pathogen <italic>PstAvrB</italic> (10<sup>7</sup>&#x02009;cfu/mL). However, the total glutathione pool declined slightly in the GC line compared to wild-type controls following the mock infiltration, indicating a diminished basal protective state. The glutathione redox state was lower in GC plants than wild-type controls 24&#x02009;hpi with <italic>PstAvrB</italic>, confirming the results obtained using the GRX-roGFP2 probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Accordingly, glutathione reductase (GR) activity detected in the infected GC plants was lower than in wild-type controls following infection with avirulent <italic>PstAvrB</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>). This change in GR activity was accompanied by a decline in the activity of dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), which requires GSH as an electron donor, under the same conditions. Surprisingly, given the loss of DHAR activity in the GC plants, there was no change in the ascorbate redox state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) and no modulation of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT) or monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>). In contrast, high cGMP levels in GC plants caused the total ascorbate pool in the basal state to decline compared to the level observed in wild-type plants. This difference was highlighted by infection with <italic>PstAvrB</italic>, which shrank the total ascorbate pool by ~40% in infected GC plants compared to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>High cGMP levels affect basal and post-infection gene expression profiles</title><p>The ratio of reduced/oxidized small-molecule redox couples may play an important signalling role during stress responses, particularly the regulation of gene expression via redox-sensitive mediators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Given the altered glutathione redox state and altered expression of hormone-dependent genes in line GC compared to wild-type plants, we sought deeper insight into the molecular changes correlating with cGMP accumulation by large-scale RNA-Seq analysis.</p><p>Transcriptional changes induced by avirulent <italic>PstAvrB</italic> in GC and wild-type plants were determined by comparing inoculated samples (WTi and GCi) at 12&#x02009;hpi with uninoculated control samples (WTc and GCc). RNA-Seq analysis was performed with three biological replicates for each condition, with each sample corresponding to a pool of leaves from three different plants. This analysis revealed 7102 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in infected wild-type plants and 5685 DEGs in infected GC plants with approximately equal numbers of upregulated and downregulated genes in each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). It is worth mentioning that a modulation of <italic>PR-1</italic> and <italic>PDF1.2</italic> expression was observed between GC and WT plants following infection, thus confirming the validity of the dataset, according to previous results obtained by real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). The comparison of datasets representing GC and wild-type plants highlighted a strong similarity between the genotypes, with 4519 common DEGs compared to 2583 unique DEGs in wild-type plants and 1166 unique DEGs in GC plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Furthermore, the common DEGs were predominantly regulated in a similar manner in both lines &#x02013; only four genes were regulated in opposite directions in the wild-type and GC plants following infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>) &#x02013; and the common DEGs were mainly related to cellular (25%) or metabolic (21%) processes and stress responses (8%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8a</xref>). A similar distribution of functional categories was also observed for unique DEGs in the infected wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8b</xref>) and GC plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8c</xref>).</p><p>The comparison between uninoculated wild-type and GC samples revealed 1303 DEGs, 87% of which were downregulated by high levels of cGMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Interestingly, among cGMP-repressed genes (GCc vs WTc), 672 genes (52%) were similarly down-regulated in WT plants challenged with <italic>PstAvrB</italic> (WTi vs WTc) and 76 cGMP-upregulated genes (GCc vs WTc) were similarly induced in wild-type following infection (WTi vs WTc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), suggesting that GC plants are somehow &#x0201c;primed&#x0201d; for transcriptomic changes related to infection with an avirulent pathogen. Furthermore, GO categories enriched among the 434 genes downregulated by high cGMP level (and not modulated in infected wild-type plants) mainly reflected immune responses and cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Interestingly, ~54% of these genes were uniquely induced in the infected GC plants, and accordingly the main enriched GO category was again related to immune responses and cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). These results indicate that GC plants in the basal state share part of the transcriptome profile observed in infected wild-type plants, whereas the infection of GC plants with avirulent pathogens abolishes many of the transcriptional differences between the genotypes observed in the basal state, resulting in a gene expression profile similar to wild-type plants.</p><p>To highlight the retained transcriptome differences between the genotypes by overcoming the effect of infection, we analysed DEGs in infected GC plants compared to infected wild-type plants, which resulted in 146 DEGs (88 downregulated and 58 upregulated). Despite the global similarity between transcriptomes, the distribution of functional categories among the genes less expressed in GC plants compared to wild-type indicated the modulation of genes related to defence (18%), lipid metabolism (14%), oxidation/reduction (14%) and general metabolism (14%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). We therefore enlarged the analysis by including DEGs displaying a log2FC&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.5 or log2FC&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;&#x02212;0.5 (p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05). Interestingly, the enriched GO categories mirrored the distribution observed among DEGs with log2FC&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;&#x02212;1 with a significant enrichment of genes involved in pathways related to oxidation/reduction, secondary metabolic processes and defence, particularly SAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The schematic representation of detailed overrepresented categories in each pathway revealed the significant downregulation of fatty acid metabolism and lipid localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), and responses to hormone stimuli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Interestingly, most SAR-related genes were involved in SAR signal production, e.g. <italic>FMO1</italic>, <italic>aza1</italic> and <italic>MES9</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>High cGMP levels modulate the protein profile following infection with avirulent <italic>PstAvrB</italic></title><p>We also analysed the leaf proteome to complete the catalogue of molecular changes occurring in GC plants with high levels of cGMP.

Constitutively high levels of cGMP had a minor impact on the basal proteome, resulting in only 11 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) when the GCc and WTc groups were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). In contrast, we observed the substantial modulation of the proteome in GC plants compared to wild-type controls following infection with avirulent <italic>PstAvrB</italic>, with 64 and 381 DAPs observed in the WTi and GCi groups, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>), including 50 proteins common to both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Most of the DAPs in the GCi group were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Several unique DAPs related to defence functions accumulated only in the infected wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>), whereas the 331 unique DAPs found in infected GC plants included functional categories related to translation (15%), photosynthesis (11%), defence (8%) and transport (8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). Taking into account these substantial differences in proteome modulation following infection, we compared the DAPs in the GCi and WTi groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>) to highlight the effect of the genotype over infection, revealing that the main functional categories were related to translation (11%) and transport (9%). However, 7% of the DAPs were related to defence responses and most (95%) of the proteins within this functional category were downregulated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Whereas several of these DAPs are positively related to defence responses, such as the cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase 7 an elicitor-responsive enzyme involved in lignin biosynthesis, the two phospholipases D PLD&#x003b1;1 and PLD&#x003b4;, which play an important role in lipid-mediated defences or the GSNO reductase responsible for S-nitrosoglutathione level regulation, to name a few, it is worth noting that by contrast some downregulated proteins are involved in the negative regulation of plant defences, such as the cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPC1) and the Arabidopsis Nudix hydrolase homolog 7 (AtNUDT7), the level of which decreased by log2FC &#x02212;1,23 and &#x02212;4,94, respectively.</p><p>The analysis of GO category enrichment allowed us to focus on the main pathways affected in the infected GC plants, confirming that the high cGMP levels strongly repress pathways involved in translation, protein transport and protein localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>). Other categories overrepresented among the downregulated proteins in infected GC plants represented abiotic stress responses and metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>). These data indicate that cells with high levels of cGMP respond to infection mainly by adapting primary metabolism and protein synthesis/transport. It is worth mentioning however that proteomics studies are highly biased towards high abundant proteins (ribosomes, metabolic enzymes), thus leading to an underrepresentation of regulatory components, such as kinases or transcription factors for example, which might also explain the lack of significant changes in these categories pointing towards pathogen infection.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>SAR induced by avirulent <italic>PstAvrB</italic> is compromised by the accumulation of cGMP</title><p>Our transcriptomic data indicated that SAR-related genes are downregulated in GC plants, so we investigated whether these plants could achieve normal SAR following infiltration with avirulent <italic>PstAvrB</italic>. Three lower rosette leaves of GC and wild-type plants were infiltrated either with 10&#x02009;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (mock infiltration) or with a suspension of <italic>PstAvrB</italic> (10<sup>7</sup>&#x02009;cfu/mL) to induce SAR. Two days later, three upper (untreated) leaves were challenged with virulent <italic>Pst</italic> (2.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup>&#x02009;cfu/mL). SAR was assessed by scoring bacterial growth in the upper leaves 3 days after the second infection. Wild-type plants pre-treated with <italic>PstAvrB</italic> achieved significantly enhanced resistance against <italic>Pst</italic> infection compared to the mock-infiltrated controls, displaying lower bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). In contrast, the GC line completely failed to achieve SAR in response to a primary <italic>PstAvrB</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). We then investigated whether SAR was blocked upstream or downstream of the inducer SA by treating wild-type and GC plants with 0.5&#x02009;mM SA 2 days before infecting the upper leaves with virulent <italic>Pst</italic> (2.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup>&#x02009;cfu/mL). Three days later, SAR was again assessed by scoring bacterial growth. Once again, the SA-treated wild-type plants displayed greater resistance than control plants, but the GC plants failed to achieve SAR in response to SA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>). This confirms that SAR in the GC transgenic plants is blocked downstream of SA synthesis.</p><p>At the molecular level, defence gene expression was analysed in the upper leaves of wild-type plants following the infection of lower leaves with avirulent <italic>PstAvrB</italic>, confirming the significant induction of the expression of the SA-dependent genes <italic>PR-1</italic> and <italic>PR-5</italic> at 48 and 72&#x02009;hpi, but only weak induction of the ethylene-dependent gene <italic>ERF1</italic> and no change in the jasmonate-dependent gene <italic>PDF1.2</italic>, in each case compared to the mock infiltration controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>). In contrast, <italic>PR-1</italic> and <italic>PR-5</italic> were significantly repressed in GC plants compared to wild-type plants following infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a,b</xref>), whereas <italic>PDF1.2</italic> was strongly upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9c</xref>), suggesting the possible interruption of systemic SA&#x02013;JA cross-talk in plants accumulating high levels of cGMP. <italic>ERF1</italic> expression was also significantly reduced in the GC line compared to wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9d</xref>), indicating a possible inhibition also of ethylene-dependent pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The role of cGMP in plant defence responses is difficult to study in detail because the enzymes responsible for its synthesis and degradation are currently unknown. We therefore created transgenic <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants expressing the rat soluble guanylate cyclase (GC) to produce a line that accumulates high levels of cGMP, which can thus be used to study cGMP-dependent cellular responses. Similarly, the cardiomyocyte-specific expression of the constitutive GC domain of the NPRA receptor in mice led to an increase in cGMP levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Surprisingly, although the rat soluble GC is inducible by NO in animal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, our transgenic <italic>A. thaliana</italic> GC lines accumulated high cGMP levels without induction, indicating that the enzyme is constitutively active <italic>in planta</italic>. The haem moiety coordinated by His-105 in the beta subunit maintains the regulatory domain in a restricted basal conformation, so we propose that the recombinant enzyme and haem prosthetic group adopt a different conformation in plant cells that favours constitutive activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Furthermore, because the intracellular accumulation of cGMP reflects the balance between GC-dependent synthesis and degradation by PDEs, we also propose that the amount of cGMP produced by the GC transgenic lines is so high (50&#x02013;250-fold higher than normal) that the relatively low endogenous PDE activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> is saturated, thus shifting the GC/PDE ratio in favor of cGMP accumulation. Likewise, Sf9 cells expressing a mutant haem-deficient enzyme accumulate high levels of cGMP, which cannot be degraded efficiently by endogenous PDEs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Accordingly, cGMP accumulation in our GC lines remains unchanged following infection with pathogens (virulent and avirulent), indicating that the GC lines have lost the ability to modulate cGMP synthesis in response to pathogens and that endogenous PDE activity is insufficient to remove cGMP from the transgenic plants. Such hypothesis is further supported by the transgenic GC line 26, which displays the lowest cGMP accumulation compared to the other two transgenic lines and the cGMP level of which seems to be still controlled by endogenous metabolism, at least following pathogen infection.</p><p>Despite the significant basal downregulation of defence-related genes in the GC lines, particularly genes involved in programmed cell death, no differences in phenotype were observed in terms of local responses, <italic>i.e.</italic> resistance to virulent or avirulent pathogens and hypersensitive cell death. This may reflect the significant upregulation of some of these genes following infection, restoring the expression levels observed in infected wild-type plants. Accordingly, several defence-related DEGs that were downregulated in the GC lines under basal conditions were upregulated following infection (DEGs uniquely upregulated in the GC lines) and ultimately returned to the expression levels observed in wild-type plants. Moreover, proteomic analysis revealed the stronger downregulation of several negative defence regulators in infected GC plants compared to infected wild-type plants, which may compensate for the weaker defence response in GC plants and yield a normal resistance phenotype. For example, the amount of GAPC1 protein (At3g04120) declined sharply in GC plants following infection (compared to wild-type plants), and <italic>gapc1</italic> mutants likewise display a stronger resistance phenotype and accelerated cell death compared to wild-type plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Similarly, the NUDIX protein (AtNUDT7), a negative regulator of basal immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, accumulated to lower levels in infected GC plants compared to wild-type plants. Interestingly, <italic>nudt7</italic> mutants have a lower GSH/GSSG ratio and therefore an altered redox state following infection, which may explain the enhanced resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. A larger oxidized glutathione pool was also observed in the GC lines following infection with avirulent <italic>PstAvrB</italic>, and this could contribute to the normal resistance phenotype by compensating for the suppression of defence-related gene expression. The downregulation of AtNUDT7 may affect the phenotype of the GC lines by sensing and modulating the levels of nucleotide analogues, particularly cGMP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>.</p><p>The higher oxidative redox state observed in the GC plants compared to wild-type controls following infection correlated with a decline in the activities of relevant enzymes after infection, namely glutathione reductase (GR) and dihydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), suggesting that cGMP accumulation alters the glutathione cycle. Since no significant changes in genes or proteins regulating the production or removal of ROS or more generally controlling cellular redox state was identified in transcriptomics and proteomics experiments, we can assume that the regulation of these enzymes, and others playing a role in the regulation of redox homeostasis, occurs at post-translational level. This could be achieved by the direct binding of cGMP to target enzymes, as recently reported in Arabidopsis for enzymes involved in Calvin cycle and photorespiration, such as the glycolate oxidase 1 (GOX1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, or indirectly by the regulation of signalling components such as cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKG), as in animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Accordingly, phosphorylation was shown to control the activity of the potato NAPDH oxidase RBOHB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. The more oxidized state, particularly the reduction of GR activity and GSH, could be partially responsible for the observed downregulation of SAR-related genes, such as <italic>PR-1</italic> and <italic>PR-5</italic>. Indeed, a reducing environment (particularly reduced GSH) is required for NPR1 activation (monomer formation) and translocation to the nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Thus the more oxidative environment observed in GC plants may help to maintain NPR1 as an inactive oligomer thus blocking downstream NPR1-dependent gene expression. In agreement with this hypothesis, we observed that high cGMP levels block SAR downstream of SA, as shown by the inability of the transgenic plants to achieve SAR even when treated directly with SA. In contrast, any perturbation in the redox balance may &#x0201c;prime&#x0201d; cells to respond more aggressively to pathogen infection, as shown in the <italic>nudt7</italic> mutant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. In this scenario, the oxidative status of the GC line although slightly different from WT plants but statistically significant in both approaches, could be sufficient to explain the impairment of SAR downstream of SA while accounting for the normal resistance phenotype, as an alternative mechanism for compensating for the downregulation of immunity-related genes and proteins.</p><p>In addition to <italic>PR</italic> gene expression, other genes related to SAR were downregulated in the GC line following infection with avirulent <italic>PstAvrB</italic>. Two functional categories of genes were significantly overrepresented among the DEGs when GC and wild-type lines were compared, namely those relating to hormone regulation and lipid metabolism, both involving key regulators of SAR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. We found that SA-dependent genes were predominantly downregulated whereas most JA-dependent genes were upregulated, suggesting that high cGMP levels affect the SA/JA regulatory balance. Such regulation likely takes place downstream of hormone biosynthesis according to the fact that the expression of <italic>PR1</italic> and <italic>PDF1.2</italic>, marker genes of SA and JA respectively, is also altered in GC plants directly treated with the hormones. Some DEGs were regulated by ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), auxins, cytokinins or brassinosteroids, which also play a role in plant&#x02013;pathogen interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Interestingly, an increase in cGMP levels has been observed in response to ABA, auxins, JA and brassinosteroids, indicating a role for cGMP downstream of these hormonal signals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Together these data suggest that cGMP could exert feedback control on the responses mediated by these phytohormones. We also noticed that all ethylene-response factors were downregulated in the GC lines, indicating the negative regulation of these transcription factors in the presence of high levels of cGMP. Ethylene receptor 1 (ETR1) contains a GAF domain, which binds cGMP and mediates light regulation, but the precise function of ETR1 remains unknown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. It would be interesting to investigate whether cGMP suppresses ETR1 by binding to its GAF domain, leading to the repression of ethylene-responsive factors required to establish SAR.</p><p>In agreement with the hypothesis described above, ethylene perception may be involved in the generation and/or release of the mobile signal that induces SAR in non-infected tobacco tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Accordingly, some of the downregulated genes identified during the transcriptomic analysis of the GC plants mediate SAR signal production, particularly lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) that help to establish SAR in a SA-independent manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Interestingly, mammalian LTPs can act as lipid sensors or mediate signal transduction pathways dependent on phospholipase C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. The non-specific LTP DIR1 (Defective in induced resistance 1) is defective in the production or transmission of an essential mobile signal that probably interacts with a lipid-derived molecule to promote long-distance signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>.</p><p>Phospholipase D (PLD) and PLD-derived phosphatidic acids are another class of lipid-related molecules that have a fundamental impact on almost all hormone signalling pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. For example, PLD&#x003b1;1 must be activated downstream of SA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref> and PLD&#x003b1;1-PA regulates ABA signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. Interestingly, PLD&#x003b1;1 was downregulated at the protein level in infected GC plants compared to infected wild-type plants, creating a possible link between the modulation of PLD by cGMP and a phytohormone imbalance that blocks SAR. PLD&#x003b4; is another defence-related PLD and this was also downregulated in infected GC plants. PLD&#x003b4; interacts with two cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPC1 and GAPC2) to regulate lipid metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref> and it is worth noting that GAPC1 protein accumulation was also downregulated in infected GC plants compared to wild-type counterparts. This suggests that cGMP accumulation in the GC line affects the PLD&#x003b4;-PA-GAPC1 interaction complex, leading to the downregulation of lipid metabolism indicated by our transcriptomic data. Once again, the modulation of this pathway could help to prevent the GC plants from achieving SAR. Finally, in the SA-independent branch of SAR induction, NO and ROS act directly upstream of the dicarboxylic acid azelaic acid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>. We found that <italic>AZA1</italic> was repressed in the infected GC line compared to wild-type plants, and we confirmed that cGMP acts downstream of NO, thus placing cGMP in this pathway. Moreover, the normal NO accumulation observed in transgenic GC plants both at basal level and following infection with avirulent bacterial pathogen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>) ensures that SAR impairment in cGMP-accumulating plants is not due to a higher NO production, known to alter SAR establishment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. However, high cGMP levels also affect SA-dependent responses given that the establishment of SAR is also impaired when SA is applied directly. We therefore propose a direct role for cGMP in the control of azelaic acid-mediated SAR, and an indirect role involving the regulation of phytohormone cross-talk. Moreover, the alteration of the redox state by high cGMP content could also influence SAR by impairing the signals mediated by NO, ROS and SA. Nevertheless, we do not rule out the possibility that cGMP could also play a role at systemic level according to the accumulation of the second messenger in distal leaves following infection with <italic>PstAvrB</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S12</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the characterization of our GC line favours a negative role for cGMP downstream of NO in the regulation of plant defences, in particular SAR, which fits neither with the function of NO in plant defence signalling nor with the putative role proposed for cGMP so far (although this is a general role rather than a specific role in SAR). In particular, it was reported very recently that leaf injury induced the systemic accumulation of cGMP in pumpkin extrafascicular phloem that could function in systemic NO and redox signalling within the EFP as positive defence mechanism against herbivorous<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>. The key feature of the GC line was the constitutive high level of cGMP compared to wild-type plants. However, second messengers such as cGMP usually work by transient accumulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref> and this transient aspect is completely abolished in the GC plants. We therefore propose that the high constitutive cGMP levels in the GC lines could desensitize the plants to cGMP stimuli, i.e. the biphasic variations required for normal cGMP signal perception and responses. In agreement with this hypothesis, the comparison of DEGs in plants constitutively accumulating cGMP (this study) or in roots treated with a bolus of the analogue 8-Br-cGMP for 2 or 5&#x02009;h<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>, reveal only a slight overlap between the datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S13</xref>). Interestingly, most of the common DEGs in these datasets are diametrically regulated, indicating that the constitutive high cGMP levels in our GC lines suppress genes that are normally induced by transient cGMP spikes (8-Br-cGMP or transient increases observed during the HR). Accordingly, the rapid desensitization of GC in animal cells, in concert with variations in the rate of cGMP degradation, provides a fundamental mechanism for shaping cellular cGMP responses and this is likely to facilitate the decoding of NO signals under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>. Furthermore, silencing the rod PDE&#x003b3; in W70A mutant mice leads to cGMP accumulation, which is responsible for a loss-of-function phenotype involving a desensitized response to light<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>.</p><p>We have demonstrated the first genetic approach to study the role of cGMP in plant defence responses by expressing mammalian soluble GC in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants. The characterization of local responses of transgenic GC plants accumulating more than 50-fold more cGMP revealed normal cell death and resistance. In contrast, the modulation of gene expression and protein abundance at the local level had a negative impact on the establishment of SAR in GC plants challenged with an avirulent pathogen, with a strong effect on hormone-related responses and lipid metabolism and transport. These results represent the first evidence of the participation of cGMP in plant systemic responses induced by bacterial infection, acting in particular at local infection level by regulating SAR signal production and transport. Moreover, the use of such cGMP-accumulating transgenic plants creating a possible model of cGMP desensitization indicated that cGMP effect is likely mediated not strictly by its absolute concentration but rather its biphasic variations. The analysis of SAR in plants depleted for cGMP, e.g. plants overexpressing PDE, will help to confirm further the desensitization of GC lines to cGMP signals to confirm that cGMP-mediated responses require such precise transient biphasic variation to control the signals that induce SAR.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>The <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants used in this study were ecotype Columbia (Col-0) and a line expressing the GRX-roGFP2 probe was already available<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.
