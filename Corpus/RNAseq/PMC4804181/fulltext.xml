The BNST, sometimes referred to as the extended amygdala, is located in the basal forebrain and is a sexually dimorphic structure made up of between 12 and 18 sub-nuclei. These sub-nuclei are rich with distinct neuronal subpopulations of receptors, neurotransmitters, transporters and proteins. The BNST is important in a range of behaviors such as: the stress response, extended duration fear states and social behavior, all crucial determinants of dysfunction in human psychiatric diseases. Most research on stress and psychiatric diseases has focused on the amygdala, which regulates immediate responses to fear. However, the BNST, and not the amygdala, is the center of the psychogenic circuit from the hippocampus to the paraventricular nucleus. This circuit is important in the stimulation of the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis. Thus, the BNST has been largely overlooked with respect to its possible dysregulation in mood and anxiety disorders, social dysfunction and psychological trauma, all of which have clear gender disparities. In this review, we will look in-depth at the anatomy and projections of the BNST, and provide an overview of the current literature on the relevance of BNST dysregulation in psychiatric diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), also referred to as the BST,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> is fast becoming a relevant region of interest with regard to human stress-related psychiatric disease. This is due to its established role in sustained fear states,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> and social attachment behaviors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> which comprise aggressive behaviors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> initiation of mating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> and offspring and parental bonding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> but additionally due to its diverse anatomy, connectivity and receptor subpopulations. Human stress-related psychiatric diseases such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and social dysfunctions all display long-term changes in mood,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> arousal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> sleep,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> appetite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> and interest in social interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> The BNST processes information and readiness for response to a threat, by maintaining online information from a vast connectivity network. Mood state and arousal are processed via connections to the amygdala,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> dorsal raphe,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> ventral tegmental area (VTA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> The BNST's projections to the hypothalamus allow monitoring of feeding, drinking and fluid maintenance via brainstem connections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Connections to the lateral septum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> and medial amygdala (MeA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> allow coordination of reproductive behaviors as part of the social behavioral network. Since anatomically, the BNST is sexually dimorphic,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> it may explain the gender disparity in the prevalence and treatment of stress-related psychiatric diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> and as such should be investigated as a possible target for treatments. Indeed, drug targets already involve subpopulations of receptors abundant in the BNST such as serotonin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> While research into the BNST's role in sustained fear is well-established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> and critical in the treatment of human anxiety, the BNST has further promise in understanding other human-related psychiatric diseases. This is the first review to incorporate several roles of this region in both rodent and human data to promote a united view of the BNST. This is essential in the study of psychiatric diseases such as anxiety, which are part of a larger umbrella of long-term anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), PTSD, social anxiety and anti-social behaviors. This review outlines the complex anatomy of the BNST together with its diversity and interconnectivity. It then discusses the role of the BNST in stress-related psychiatric disease. It concludes with a discussion on the importance of gender disparities in these psychiatric disorders and the possible role of the BNST. These topics aim to help the reader gauge the profound promise of the BNST as a potential target for the treatment of stress-related psychiatric diseases.</p><sec><title>BNST's vs amygdala's role in fear and anxiety</title><p>In rodents, the BNST is a center for integration of information with negative valence or anxiety-like states due to the vastly studied role of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) containing projections to the amygdala, which releases CRF from the central amygdala (CeA) that go on to activate the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal (HPA) axis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Previous research has established the BNST's role in sustained fear (which we will term here 'anxiety') as distinct from the amygdala's role in phasic fear, (which we will refer to as 'fear').<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Studies have suggested that the amygdala is responsible for mediating specific cue-based fear responses, and thus controls the assessment of immediate or phasic fear. The basolateral amygdala receives sensory input<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> about a threat and passes the information on to the CeA, which has the capacity to modify the HPA axis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Fear conditioning studies have indicated that the BNST's action is related to the ability to differentiate between safe and non-safe contexts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> which suggests BNST activity depends on contextual cue reminders that do not predict immediate threat, but rather cause a sustained state of apprehension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Blanchard &#x00026; Blanchard's<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> earlier work on defensive and anxiety-like behaviors in rodents has suggested that fear and anxiety can be divided into an immediate threat, for example, the presence of a predator, and pre- or post-encounter threats, for example, the apprehension of encountering a predator again. The BNST is hypothesized to mediate these longer-term responses to anxiety, where a challenge or recovery from a challenge to homeostasis occurs. In contrast, the CeA is thought to mediate shorter duration phasic fear responses, which occur in response to a current challenge to homeostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup></p><p>The amygdala's response to threat is highly individual and often critical to the perception of the threat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> The role of the amygdala cannot be ignored as it can predispose an individual to an exaggerated stress response when a threat is encountered. Admon <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> showed that new army recruits (that is, yet to engage in combat) with more responsive amygdalae were more likely to have greater stress symptoms after a traumatic event. Whalen <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> demonstrated hyper-responsiveness to faces in the amygdala of PTSD patients.</p><p>In contrast, studies in both male and female patients with phobias, which cause anxiety states, show functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation of the BNST, anterior cingulate cortex and insula in anticipation to visual stimuli of phobia-inducing objects (such as spiders), with no activation in the amygdala.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Another study in which a real Tarantula spider was used during brain imaging in healthy male and female participants, found that the closer the Tarantula was placed to the foot of the participant, the greater the activity in the BNST, but also in the amygdala.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> This suggests diffuse states of threat apprehension are represented differently to the presence of an actual threat; while only the BNST is active during imagery of a future threat, both the BNST and amygdala are activated when faced with an actual threat.</p><p>Other models used in human fMRI studies include models of unpredictable shock vs predictable shock or loss of control, in which a threat is anticipated. In both female and male adults, greater BNST activation was found during periods when unpredictable shock was expected, in contrast to the amygdala, which was activated in predictable shock context.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Using a different model of unpredictability, Somerville <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> created an experiment in which participants were asked to manipulate parameters on the monitor. When the line on the screen fell below threshold the participant was shocked. However, in reality the participants' keyboard was not connected to the computer. Authors found that in both sexes BNST activation was greater when the threat of impeding shock was looming and loss of control was gauged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup></p><p>Games involving high monetary uncertainty increased activation in the BNST seen with fMRI BOLD in GAD patients compared with controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> In another study, in which the BNST was activated, there was a significant correlation with anxiety levels, while only weak amygdala activation was observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup></p><p>The BNST therefore mediates the anticipatory phase of a threat as well as the general apprehension due to threat and loss of control to prevent the threat. However, when an actual physical threat is present both the BNST and amygdala will be activated.</p></sec><sec><title>BNST's vs amygdala's role in social behavior</title><p>Social decisions requiring the initiation of positive or negative interactions are generated via interactions between the highly interconnected nodes in the social network such as the vomeronasal cavity, the MeA, VTA, several nuclei of the hypothalamus such as the preoptic area, anterior hypothalamus and the ventromedial hypothalamus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> Convergence of sensory input and limbic networks outputs about mood, homeostasis and reward occur in the BNST, as previously mentioned.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> The BNST, and in particular, its medial and posterior regions, are directly linked to the social behavioral network that regulates behaviors including aggression and defensive behaviors, social communication, mating and parental care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> In particular, social information in rodents is transferred to the BNST via inputs from the vomeronasal organ to the olfactory bulb and project bilaterally to either the lateral septum or MeA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> Partner preference and copulation behaviors are also heavily mediated by the BNST with bilateral connections to the MeA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> After the sensory information to the BNST is processed; the BNST and other nodes in the network can initiate an appropriate social behavioral response.</p><p>The MeA mediates social memory and social recognition via its direct connections with the olfactory bulb. Oxytocin in the MeA was found to be crucial and sufficient for social recognition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> Manipulations of the MeA, such as lesion or stimulation can in males, impair copulation and reduce contact with familiar females,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> and in females mediate an opposite-sex odor preference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> Lesions of the vomeronasal organ do not change c-Fos expression in the BNST,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> suggesting a dissociation between the two areas. The BNST is involved in precopulatory motivation behaviors for finding a mating partner in both males and females voles,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> and opposite-sex odor preference in female golden hamsters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> In males, this is demonstrated by increases in BNST androgen receptor expression and testosterone rises in response to receptive females precopulation, as in other nodes of the social network. However, in contrast to other nodes, there is no drop in postcopulation androgens and testosterone levels in the BNST as occurs in MeA after ejaculation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> In addition, males lose attraction to female odors following posterior medial BNST lesions, though the ability to discriminate between social and non-social odors remain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> In females, evidence shows that oxytocin receptors in the BNST are responsible for vaginal marking to solicit males and lesions abolish preference for solicitation to males over females.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup></p><p>Finally, in songbirds, BNST neurons can show differential activation to positive and negative social attraction, affiliation or competition, respectively, based on accessibility to a mate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> Vasopressin (AVP) immunoreactivity in the BNST is detected when a potential mate or existing partner is present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> Higher levels of AVP immunoreactivity are seen in social species in which partners are present in flocking vs anti-social species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> Unlike the well-investigated role of the BNST in fear and anxiety, the role of the social BNST is still emerging as distinct from the amygdala. From the above studies, we can conclude that while the two areas are highly interconnected, specific lesion studies have demonstrated that the role of the BNST involves positive valence, preference and motivation for sexual behaviors that are distinct from mere recognition of opposite-sex conspecifics in context.</p></sec><sec><title>The integrated role of the BNST: 'valence surveillance'</title><p>To properly understand the seemingly diverse properties of the BNST such as sustained fear and social behaviors, the two roles attributed to the BNST must be reconciled. The BNST has long been understood to assess contextual threat,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> fear-potentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> or unconditioned fear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> However, these studies only used single male mice in a non-social fear conditioning system or startle apparatuses, which enables monitoring safety from a physical threat from the environment. However, negative social encounters can also be considered a physical threat and predator stress or apprehension toward a negative encounter can cause anxiety,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> a socially based type. Therefore, the BNST collectively may assess sensory information from the physical/social environment. Sensory information may include conspecific or interspecies individuals in that context. In addition internally, the BNST may assess the current mood and arousal, which would determine the physical readiness. Together, this accumulation of information will be used to make decisions about the proper response to changes in the physical environment or in the social setting. For example, the return to an inhabitable shelter or the scent of an aggressive conspecific both represent a unspecified threat that can initiate the stress response in the absence of an immediate threat. Alternatively, certain contexts that do not require fight or flight, might be rewarding due to the presence of food or possible mating and BNST-mediated systems will initiate interaction. Therefore, opposing BNST circuits maintained by distinct, opposing sub-nuclei and neurotransmitter systems, as suggested in the study by Daniel <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> may regulate these shifts from homeostasis to stress and <italic>vice versa</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> depending on the conditions and BNST activation patterns.</p><p>We therefore propose a unified role for the BNST in the surveillance and assignment of valence to the information collected. The integrated information can then be used to shift from homeostasis to fight or flight with the help of the BNST's control of the activation or attenuation of the HPA axis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> In addition, autonomic control of food, fluid intake and micturition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> are adjusted for the proper response, if necessary. Alternatively, connections with the reward and pain systems may monitor positive valence and adjust information on mood via projections with serotonergic centers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> The term 'valence surveillance' unifies both the apprehension and social roles of the BNST. In fact, its role in every situation, whether social or not, is to assess the valence either negatively or positively and then, together with the mood, energy and motivation status input coming from relevant brain areas, act appropriately. While extensive anatomical research has been conducted on the BNST, the functionality of each subregion and its connectivity has yet to be dissected systematically with respect to the coordination of these behaviors.</p></sec><sec><title>BNST: anatomy in rodents</title><p>To better understand how the BNST can integrate information from multiple brain areas to perform 'valence surveillance,' the diversity of the sub-nuclei, projections and subpopulations of this medial forebrain area must be examined. This review will weave through the majority of sub-nuclei and provide an outline for firstly their projections; outputs and inputs and then their subpopulations as they relate to the overall integrative role of the BNST.</p><p>There are several nomenclatures used in the anatomy of the BNST, of which we explain the anatomy according the series of papers of Dong &#x00026; Swanson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup> in which anterograde injections were performed on male rats.

Furthermore, two studies which measured single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in blood samples of PTSD patients, showed SNPs of genes also expressed by BNST neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">106</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">107</xref></sup> Interestingly, in both studies the effects were specific to female PTSD patients.

The role of coping is actually an important component of the BNST's proposed role of 'valence surveillance' in that coping requires physiological shifts based on new sensory information collected. While CRF/CRFR1 systems are involved in initiation of the stress response, CRFR2 involves turning off stressful responses when the stressor is no longer present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">108</xref></sup> Knockdown of CRFR2, specifically in the BNST of male mice was also shown to cause changes in anxiety-like behaviors 24 or 48&#x02009;h after restraint, but not right after (Lebow <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished data). Furthermore, CRFR2KD in the BNST was demonstrated to be involved in increased arousal and vigilance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref></sup> and robust changes in CRFR2 mRNA were exhibited in the BNST of PTSD-like mice that underwent unpredictable shock.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref></sup> The effects of CRFR2 are also proven to be sex-specific, with only CRFR2 female knockout mice showing increased anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">109</xref></sup> As such, BNST CRFR2 could represent a future target for human psychopharmacology in which initiation of downstream coping genes could possibly reduce PTSD symptoms of sustained fear and shift negative valence to positive valence. Furthermore, the BNST's CRFR2s may have sex-specific effects in psychiatric disorders.</p><p>PACAP is another rodent and human target that may hold promise for the future treatment of PTSD, in a sex-specific manner, given it is heavily expressed in the BNST. PACAP is localized in the oval nucleus of the rodents BNST, where it is known to innervate CRF-expressing neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> and where it has been shown to cause increased anxiety states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref></sup> BNST PACAP also stimulates activation of the HPA axis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">110</xref></sup> Continuous blockade of PAC1 during chronic stress reverses this effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">110</xref></sup> A single human SNP in the PAC1 (<italic>ADCYAP1R1</italic>) gene, which is located in an estrogen responsive element, was recently found to be a predictor for PTSD and to be associated with severity of PTSD symptoms in a highly traumatized cohort of African-American women. Furthermore, methylation of this gene in patient blood was found to correlate with total PTSD symptom load only in women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">107</xref></sup></p><p>Human psychiatric diseases such as anxiety and PTSD are also accompanied by changes in cortisol levels. Changes in cortisol are also a function of the proposed BNST's role of 'valence surveillance,' in that information about the environment must be processed to activate the stress response or to turn it off. PTSD patients show reduced cortisol and this is mirrored in PTSD-like animal models which show reduced corticosterone levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">111</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">112</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">113</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">114</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">115</xref></sup> Accordingly lesions of the posterior medial BNST in male rats cause increases in corticosterone levels 30&#x02009;min after restraint stress, while lesions of the anterior ventral BNST attenuate corticosterone levels immediately after restraint stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">97</xref></sup> The anterior BNST serves as a relay station between the mPFC and the PVN that mediate HPA responses to stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> to activate the HPA axis and causes corticosterone release, while the posterior BNST inhibits the HPA axis and attenuates corticosterone release.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">83</xref></sup></p><p>SSRIs are considered the most accepted treatment for PTSD symptoms in patients, and other treatments all target serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and GABAergic systems though not always most effectively,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">116</xref></sup> and self-administration of alcohol is also rampant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">103</xref></sup> While the most effective treatment is yet to be discovered, current treatments are consistent with a mouse model of PTSD, in which, vast molecular changes take place in serotoergic, adrenergic and even GABAergic systems in the BNST. Downregulation of receptor mRNA is seen for adrenergic (Adra2a, Adrbk1), GABAergic (Gabra2, Gabra3) and serotonergic (Htr<sub>1A</sub>, Htr<sub>2c</sub>, Htr<sub>7</sub>) receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref></sup> In addition, a metabolite of serotonin, 5-HIAA, showed decreased levels 2 weeks after the unpredictable shock paradigm and immediately following measurement of the startle response (personal communication, Christopher Lowry, University of Colorado), indicating alteration in the BNST serotonin system in a rodent PTSD model. This might possibly explain the mechanism of SSRI treatment in PTSD patients who have increased sustained fear.</p><p>PTSD itself is a disorder that is twice as prevalent in females than males. As reviewed above, the human literature shows sex-specific changes in PTSD patients in SNPs of genes expressed in neurons in BNST subpopulations. Overall, this makes the BNST an excellent target for future research in PTSD and treatment for PTSD.</p></sec><sec><title>Aggression and anti-social behaviors</title><p>Aggression is defined as behavior intended to inflict physical damage on another individual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> In humans, aggression can be differentiated into two types; impulsive aggression in response to anger, often called reactive aggression, and goal-oriented aggression, which is referred to as controlled instrumental aggression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Reactive aggression in humans is often the result of PTSD or depression, which can be due to increased arousal combined with feelings of helplessness and loss of control. Controlled instrumental aggression in humans is found in anti-social personality types who show low arousal and often have emotionally blunted responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Pharmaceutical drugs used to treat both types of aggression in humans often involve sedatives or antipsychotics, which target the serotonin system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">117</xref></sup></p><p>Psychopathy or other anti-social behaviors characterized by low empathy and aggression are the result of low arousal and impaired fear processing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Many human studies on psychopathy focus on impaired fear processing in the amygdala and showed reduced amygdala activation in fMRI of psychopaths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> However, cold calculated long-term decision-making behavior seems to be outside the realm of the amygdala and rather a frontal cortex process.</p><p>The prefrontal cortex is thought to mediate aggression and impulse control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> SSRI treatment in borderline personality disorder patients increased activity in the prefrontal cortex, ameliorating the lack of inhibitory control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Patients with vmPFC lesions show blunted arousal to emotional stimuli and reduced BNST activity was observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">93</xref></sup> Research on anti-social behavior may benefit by the further study into the frontal cortex and ventral BNST connections, which could regulate controlled thinking in anti-social behaviors and influence low arousal states and aggressive behavior, respectively.</p><p>At least in rodents, the BNST's proposed role as 'valence surveillance' may be important for indicating the presence of an aggressor and whether to fight or flight. This is based on the relay of information from the mPFC to the BNST and from BNST to the PVN, in which the mPFC inhibits the ventral BNST to activate the medial parvocellular PVN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> The decision may also integrate BNST noradrenergic information to determine or increase readiness. The noradrenergic population of the BNST could therefore be an important target for treatment of aggression via its functional connectivity with the prefrontal cortex.</p><p>The ability to engage in aggressive behavior is also necessary in rodents to obtain resources such as food or mates. These behaviors are mediated by a vast network of sensory and limbic information. Olfactory cues transmitted via the social behavior network mediate aggressive behaviors and lesions in any of these nodes or in the frontal cortical regions can greatly reduce aggressive behavior between males.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> Other systems thought to biologically mediate aggression involve vasopressinergic,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> dopaminergic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">118</xref></sup> GABAergic,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">118</xref></sup> noradrenergic,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> and steroid hormones and receptors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">119</xref></sup> which are all abundant in the sub-nuclei of the BNST.

Impairments in these BNST-mediated mating behaviors may also play a role in human social dysfunction such as social anxiety, autism or inadequate parental care, making a person less likely to coordinate behaviors to form or maintain the social bonds necessary for reproductive behaviors. Three stages are critical to complete the social attachment bonds; inhibition of fear, social recognition and reward motivation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Social anxiety disorder occurs in 6.8&#x00025; of the population and is described by a fear of unfamiliar people who may scrutinize the sufferer in a social situation, which causes anxiety and social avoidance in the sufferer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">122</xref></sup> One of the consequences of social anxiety disorder on an individual is the lack of ability to initiate a social bond out of fear and result in insecurity and increased stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">122</xref></sup> In addition, there is a lack of sufficient motivation and increases in inhibition of initiation of these behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">122</xref></sup> While the amygdala and frontal cortex may be crucial for social recognition and inhibition of fear,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> the BNST through its connections with the VTA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">98</xref></sup> and frontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> and MPOA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> plays an important role in motivation for mating and anticipation of reward via dopamine and oxytocin circuitry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> or as hypothesized attaching positive valence to the process based on 'surveillance' information received.</p><p>Mating behavior in rodents involves a coordination of complex precopulatory behaviors such as solicitation behavior and odor discrimination to facilitate a successful outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> Complex connectivity between the brain circuits containing dopamine, oxytocin, noradrenaline, GABA and glutamate such as the VTA, BNST and MPOA may explain these behaviors.</p><p>Within the BNST itself, a dissociation exists between dopaminergic, GABAergic release in the oval nucleus vs noradrenergic and glutamatergic release in the ventral BNST based on presentation of a rewarding cue or anticipation of a rewarding cue, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">123</xref></sup> While these systems have mostly been studied in the context of drug addiction and relapse,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">124</xref></sup> motivation for mating or anticipation of a mate, may work through this same circuitry.

Decisions about threatening and rewarding situations are accessed while information on mood, homeostatic state, arousal, feeding and reproduction is kept online. Anatomically, the BNST is heterogeneous, containing many sub-nuclei and an abundant diversity of neurotransmitters and their receptors. Understanding the subpopulations and specific connectivity of this diverse area is critical for understanding its role in pathology and designing therapeutic interventions. While much research is focused on understanding human psychiatric diseases by using animal models to study the amygdala, the literature has somewhat overlooked the role of the BNST, which might explain their complexity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> illustrates the proposed roles of the human BNST and dysfunction associated with impaired BNST function. Human psychiatric diseases are not only isolated to immediate altered fear processing but may include vast changes in long-term anxiety states, arousal, social and reproductive behaviors, in addition to the often overlooked different manifestations among the sexes. Therefore, increased understanding of the BNST is sure to provide profound translational insights for treatments of human psychiatric diseases.</p><sec><title>Future directions</title><p>The purpose of this review is to raise awareness of the plethora of research that is yet to be performed and the translational relevance of studying the BNST. BNST animal research has thus far only focused on anatomical projections, the startle circuitry and on social behaviors. Often in this research, the BNST is not the main focus of the study, but rather added as an afterthought and most are performed in non-rodent and primate species. Advanced models of psychiatric disorders in rodents unfortunately focus on more well-characterized brain areas and as such the 'state of the art' genetic toolbox is reserved for better-understood areas.</p><p>For example, anatomical tracing has benefitted by advances in technology. Combining CRE and flox lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">137</xref></sup> and injections of herpes, an anterograde tracer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">138</xref></sup> or rabies, a retrograde tracer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">139</xref></sup> would give anatomical information regarding specific subpopulations projections within the known BNST circuitry. Functionally, CRE lines bred with flox lines can conditionally knockout a specific gene, from which its function can be accessed via behavioral changes in its absence. Changes in activation and subsequent changes in behavior can also be demonstrated using optogenetics in CRE lines in specific brain nuclei. The teasing out of BNST circuitry in this way has begun in several recent optogenetic BNST-focused papers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">140</xref></sup> There are many permutations for research using these techniques in that the target projections from the BNST can be illuminated and tested for changes in behavior as well as the BNST sub-nuclei that is sending the projections. At the behavioral level, more BNST-specific paradigms are needed aside from the startle test, which tests for sustained fear. Due to the social nature of the BNST, biological markers such as HPA axis or receptor changes of any of the relevant subpopulations should be measured after behaviors in a group setting of same sex or after interactions of both sexes. Manipulations introducing stressors like shock or reward would be interesting as they affect the individual responses but in a group setting would enhance the understanding of the BNST's proposed role of 'valence surveillance' in a more ethological setting.</p><p>Moreover, the latest advances in epigenetics, including methylation, acetylation, microRNAs, other small non-coding RNAs, RNA editing and other bioinformatics pathways from RNAseq often do not generate BNST-specific data. Arrays of the genome and micronome of the BNST in general may show unique patterns after acute or chronic stress or the BNST-specific paradigms to be generated, as discussed above. Individually methylated regions based on behavioral experiences may also provide information about the role of adaptivity in specific BNST sub-nuclei to environmental exposures. Again and again the challenge is specific dissection between anterior regions.</p><p>The entire field of these potential biomarkers from whole blood or plasma that correspond to changes in BNST receptor or neurotransmitter populations has yet to be established in rodents or humans. mRNA or microRNA levels in the BNST could be compared with plasma circulating levels to see if BNST levels are predictive enough for use as biomarkers in psychiatric diseases. Studies involving animal models of psychiatric disease in both females and males are also missing in most brain research, but there is greater rationale for doing so for the BNST. This has left a large gaping hole in the field of the psychiatric research in animal models.</p><p>While human research is also in its infancy, some strides have been made in deep brain stimulation specifically for the BNST.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">141</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">142</xref></sup> Other than directly stimulating the BNST, studying its behavioral-induced fMRI signal as well as the general BNST functional connectivity during different states and in different pathologies is of great interest. Post-mortem tissue studies looking at gene expression changes may bring forward candidate genes for biomarker diagnostics of psychiatric disorders. Overall, there is still a vast amount of research needed to understand the full complexity of the BNST.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by European Research Council FP7 Grant 260463, Israel Science Foundation Research Grants 803/11 and 1565/15, Roberto and Renata Ruhman, Nella and Leon Benoziyo Center for Neurological Diseases, the Henry Chanoch Krenter Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Genomics, the Perlman Family Foundation (founded by Louis L. and Anita M.
