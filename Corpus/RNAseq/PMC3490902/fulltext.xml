In Drosophila, PcG proteins are bound to DNA fragments called Polycomb group response elements (PREs). The prevalent model holds that PcG proteins bind PREs only in cells where the target gene is &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d;. Another model posits that transcription through PREs disrupts associated PcG complexes, contributing to the establishment of the &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; transcriptional state. We tested these two models at the PcG target gene <italic>engrailed</italic>. <italic>engrailed</italic> exists in a gene complex with <italic>invected</italic>, which together have 4 well-characterized PREs. Our data show that these PREs are not transcribed in embryos or larvae. We also examined whether PcG proteins are bound to an <italic>engrailed</italic> PRE in cells where <italic>engrailed</italic> is transcribed. By FLAG-tagging PcG proteins and expressing them specifically where <italic>engrailed</italic> is &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d;, we determined that components of three major PcG protein complexes are present at an <italic>engrailed</italic> PRE in both the &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; transcriptional states in larval tissues. These results show that PcG binding per se does not determine the transcriptional state of <italic>engrailed</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH/NICHD.

In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, PcG proteins are present in at least 5 distinct multiprotein complexes, Pho Repressive Complex (PhoRC), Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC2), Polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB), and d-Ring-associated factors complex (dRAF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Mller1">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Scheuermann1">[6]</xref>. These complexes repress target gene expression through post-translational covalent modification of histones and modulation of chromatin structure. PhoRC consists of dSfmbt and the DNA-binding protein Pleiohomeotic (Pho). PRC1 is composed of Posterior Sex Combs (Psc), Polyhomeotic (Ph), Polycomb (Pc), and the H2A K119 ubiquitylase dRing/Sce. dRAF consists of dRing/Sce, Psc, and dKdm2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Lagarou1">[5]</xref>. PRC2 contains Extra Sex Combs (Esc), p55, Supressor of Zeste 12 (Su(z)12), and Enhancer of Zeste (E(z)), which is responsible for placing the H3K27me3 mark thought to indicate repressive chromatin. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, PcG protein complexes are targeted to specific genomic sites by DNA regions called Polycomb group Response Elements (PREs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Mller2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Ringrose2">[8]</xref>.</p><p>The presence of PcG proteins and H3K27me3 at a target gene usually indicates a repressed transcriptional state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Shilatifard1">[9]</xref>. However, many studies suggest this is not always the case. Notably, many developmentally important genes are associated with both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 (the active chromatin mark) in embryonic stems cell, the so-called &#x0201c;bivalent state,&#x0201d; and are transcribed at a low level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Mikkelsen1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Zhao1">[11]</xref>. However, a recent study showed that the &#x0201c;bivalent state&#x0201d; for the genes tested did not exist, but was only an indication of a mixed cell population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Brookes1">[12]</xref>. In Drosophila, a few studies have shown PcG protein binding to transcribed genes. In Drosophila imaginal disk cells, Papp and M&#x000fc;ller found PcG proteins bound to <italic>Ubx</italic> PREs in both wing disks, where its transcription is off, and in the leg and haltere disks, where <italic>Ubx</italic> is transcribed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Papp1">[13]</xref>. PREs of the ubiquitously-expressed Psc gene are also bound by PcG proteins in imaginal disk cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Park1">[14]</xref>. Further, genome-wide studies comparing PcG target genes in three different tissue culture cell lines suggest the presence of at least 4 PcG states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Schwartz2">[15]</xref>, fully repressed (with just PcG proteins bound to the PRE), fully active (with just trxG proteins bound to the PRE), &#x02018;balanced&#x02019; (with PcG and trxG proteins bound to the PRE), and void (with neither PcG nor trxG proteins bound to the PRE). Of particular interest for this study, the <italic>engrailed</italic> (<italic>en</italic>) and <italic>invected</italic> (<italic>inv</italic>) genes exist in a fully repressed state in Sg4 cells (a line originally derived from late embryos), but are in a balanced state, with trxG and PcG proteins bound to the PREs, and H3K27me3 extending over the two transcription units in BG3 cells (a line derived from neuronal tissue) where they are also bound by RNA Polymerase II and are transcribed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Schwartz2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Schaaf1">[16]</xref>. These results indicate that at <italic>en</italic> and <italic>inv</italic>, at least in BG3 cells, transcription and PcG protein binding are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>It has been proposed that transcription through PREs antagonizes PcG protein complex activity and plays a key role in setting up the &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; transcriptional state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Bender1">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Schmitt2">[21]</xref>. At the Bithorax complex (BC-X), which includes the genes <italic>Ubx</italic>, <italic>Abd-A</italic>, and <italic>Abd-B</italic>, there are at least a dozen ncRNAs transcribed in embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Bae1">[22]</xref>. Numerous studies show that transcription through PREs of the BC-X can interfere with maintenance of PcG-mediated silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Bender1">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Rank1">[19]</xref>. In reporter gene experiments, transcription through a PRE was not only shown to inactivate it, but to change its activity to a transcriptional activator instead of a silencer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Schmitt1">[20]</xref>. At the <italic>en</italic> gene, it was reported that the <italic>en</italic> PRE was transcribed in embryos, but not in larvae, suggesting that <italic>en</italic> PRE activity could be regulated by different mechanisms in different developmental stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Schmitt1">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The PcG targets <italic>en</italic> and <italic>inv</italic> are adjoining, co-regulated genes, that share regulatory DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Gustavson1">[23]</xref>. There are four major <italic>en/inv</italic> PREs, two upstream of <italic>inv</italic> and two closely spaced PREs just upstream of the <italic>en</italic> transcription unit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Cunningham1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-DeVido1">[25]</xref>. The two well-characterized <italic>en</italic> PREs are within 1 kb of each other and often appear as a single binding peak for PcG proteins in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. <italic>en</italic> and <italic>inv</italic> PREs are bound by PcG proteins in tissue culture cells, embryos, larvae, and adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Kwong1">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Oktaba1">[28]</xref>. Further, <italic>inv</italic> and <italic>en</italic> comprise a H3K27me3 domain that covers a 115kb region, ending abruptly at the 3&#x02032; ends of the <italic>Enhancer of Polycomb</italic> (<italic>E(Pc)</italic>) and <italic>toutatis</italic> (<italic>tou</italic>), the transcription units that flank the region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Celniker1">[29]</xref>. We used in situ hybridization to embryos to examine how much of the <italic>en/inv</italic> domain is transcribed and in what pattern. Unlike the BX-C with its abundant ncRNA, ncRNAs are relatively rare in the <italic>en/inv</italic> domain. Further, we found no evidence for transcription of the <italic>inv</italic> or <italic>en</italic> PREs. Genome-wide PcG-binding studies in embryos, larvae, and adults show the locations of PcG binding to <italic>en</italic> in mixed cell populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Kwong1">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Oktaba1">[28]</xref>. However, it was not known whether PcG proteins are bound to the PRE in vivo in cells where <italic>en</italic> is expressed. In order to examine this, we expressed FLAG-tagged PcG proteins specifically in cells where En is &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d;, and used chromatin immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibodies to determine FLAG-PcG protein binding to the <italic>en</italic> PRE. Our results show that PcG proteins are bound to the <italic>en</italic> PRE both in cells that express <italic>en</italic> and those that don't. This shows that PcG binding per se is not sufficient to silence <italic>en/inv</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Analysis of ncRNAs in the <italic>en-inv</italic> region</title><p><italic>inv</italic> and <italic>en</italic> comprise a 115 kb domain flanked by the 3&#x02032; end of the genes <italic>E(Pc)</italic> and <italic>tou</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048765-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). We conducted <italic>in situ</italic> RNA hybridization on whole embryos, using DIG-labeled RNA probes designed to recognize RNAs transcribed in either direction throughout the entire 115 kilobase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048765-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Positive control probes were made against the <italic>en</italic> and <italic>inv</italic> transcripts, and against a nc RNA encoding a micro-RNA arising from the <italic>iab-8</italic> region in the BX-C. This probe yielded a robust signal in the A8 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048765-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Bender2">[30]</xref>.

In the <italic>inv-en</italic> intergenic region, a specific signal resembling the <italic>inv</italic> expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048765-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) was obtained using a probe just downstream of the <italic>inv</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048765-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, panel 5). We suspect that this signal could be the result of transcriptional read through. In the next fragment, a transient pair-rule expression pattern was detected using a probe from the other strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048765-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, panel 6). Moving to the region upstream of the <italic>en</italic> transcription unit, no specific signal was observed with probes designed to detect transcription from the <italic>en</italic> PRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048765-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, panels 7 and 8). This result differs from what was reported by Schmitt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Schmitt1">[20]</xref>, who detected a weak stripe signal in germ band elongated embryos with a probe to the <italic>en</italic> PRE. We were also unable to detect this weak stripe signal using the exact probes used in their experiments (data not shown). Further upstream of the <italic>en</italic> transcript, probes yielded an <italic>en</italic>-like expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048765-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, panel 9), and a pair-rule pattern (panel 10), in regions that contain previous experimental evidence of transcripts and a pair-rule enhancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Hild1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Kopczynski1">[32]</xref> (JAK unpublished data).

This signal was observed in all stages, beginning in 0&#x02013;1 hour embryos. This signal is likely an artifact however, as this 1100 bp region shows near sequence identity to 21 other regions in the genome. Taken together, these results suggest that ncRNAs are not as abundant in the <italic>en/inv</italic> region as they are in the BX-C, and that <italic>inv</italic> and <italic>en</italic> PREs are not transcribed in embryos. We also examined whether the <italic>inv</italic> and <italic>en</italic> PREs are transcribed in imaginal discs and the larval CNS and saw no evidence of transcription (data not shown).

We wished to determine whether this was also the case in vivo. We used a UAS-driven FLAG-tagged PcG crosslinked-ChIP (X-ChIP) system to examine PcG binding in cells that express <italic>en</italic> and those that do not. <italic>en</italic> is expressed in stripes in embryos and in the posterior compartments of imaginal discs. <italic>cubitus interruptus</italic> (<italic>ci</italic>), is expressed in a complementary pattern with <italic>en</italic>, with no overlap in both embryos and imaginal discs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Chanas1">[33]</xref>.

All proteins were first tagged at the C-terminus. C-terminally tagged Scm-FLAG acted in a dominant negative fashion when ubiquitously expressed in a wild-type background, as indicated by strong PcG-type transformations (data not shown). Therefore, we generated and proceeded with an N-terminally tagged FLAG-Scm protein, which did not produce a phenotype when expressed ubiquitously in a wild type background.</p><p>UAS-Pho-FLAG was crossed with <italic>en</italic>-GAL4 or <italic>ci</italic>-GAL4, and FLAG-expression was examined in whole embryos and imaginal discs from wandering 3rd instar larvae.

There were some Pc bands that did not contain Pho-FLAG. There are two reasons for this: one, the detection of the Pho-Flag is relatively weak, and two, endogenous Pho does not bind all Pc sites in polytene chromosomes. Similarly, Esc-FLAG and Sce-FLAG largely overlap with endogenous Pho bands on polytene chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048765-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> and data not shown).

FLAG-Scm rescued <italic>Scm</italic> mutant flies, with about 70% of males exhibiting extra sex combs on the 2nd and 3rd legs. It is not surprising that minor PcG phenotypes are observed in some experiments, as the timing and level of expression of FLAG-tagged proteins, under the control of the UAS/GAL4 system, are not likely to perfectly match endogenous expression. Considering this, we conclude that the FLAG-tagged PcG proteins are functional, and that ChIP experiments carried out with these proteins would faithfully reflect results obtained with endogenous proteins.</p><p>The validated FLAG-tagged proteins were used in X-ChIP experiments. FLAG-tagged PcG proteins were driven in flies with the <italic>en</italic>-GAL4 (&#x0201c;ON&#x0201d;) and <italic>ci</italic>-GAL4 drivers (&#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d;). Imaginal disc sets, along with the central nervous system, were collected from 3rd instar larvae, processed for X-ChIP, and analyzed with qPCR to determine binding signals at the <italic>en</italic> gene.

Sce-FLAG was bound to PRE2 in both the &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; transcriptional states. Pho-FLAG has a similar binding profile except that binding to the non-PRE probes in the &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; chromatin was higher than the &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; chromatin, and there was some binding to PRE1. For comparison, Pho binding was measured using the same chromatin used for the FLAG-samples. Pho ChIP measures binding in both the &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; and the &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; cells.

First we investigated whether the <italic>en</italic> and <italic>inv</italic> PREs are transcribed, and found no evidence of transcription of the PREs either by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization or by analysis of RNAseq data from the region. We conclude that transcription of <italic>inv</italic> or <italic>en</italic> PREs does not play a role in regulation of <italic>en/inv</italic> by PcG proteins. Second, using FLAG-tagged PcG proteins expressed in either <italic>en</italic> or <italic>ci</italic> cells, we found that PcG proteins are bound to the <italic>en</italic> PRE2 in both the &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; transcriptional state in imaginal disks.

However, in contrast to the robust <italic>salm</italic> and <italic>till</italic> staining, the picture of <italic>en</italic> stripes using the <italic>en</italic> PRE probe was very weak and corresponded to a stage where transient invaginations occur that could give the appearance of stripes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Schmitt1">[20]</xref>. Further, there was no hybridization of the <italic>en</italic> PRE probe to regions of the head <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Schmitt1">[20]</xref>, where <italic>en</italic> is also transcribed at this stage. Our in situ hybridization experiments with probes to detect transcription of the <italic>inv</italic> or <italic>en</italic> PREs did not yield specific staining at any embryonic stage, or in imaginal discs. This finding is confirmed by absence of polyA and non-poly RNA signals in this region at any embryonic or larval stage, upon review of RNA-seq data from ModEncode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Celniker1">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Our results show that PcG proteins bind to <italic>en</italic> PRE2 even in cells where <italic>en</italic> is actively transcribed. In fact, one member of each of the three major PcG protein complexes, Pho from PhoRC, dRing/Sce from PRC1, and Esc from PRC2, as well as Scm, are constitutively bound to <italic>en</italic> PRE2 in all cells in imaginal discs. We note that dRing/Sce is also present in the PcG complex dRAF, which also includes Psc and the demethylase dKDM2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Lagarou1">[5]</xref>. Further experiments would be necessary to see whether Sce-FLAG is bound to <italic>en</italic> DNA as part of the PRC1 complex, the dRAF complex, or both.</p><p>What are the differences between the &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; transcriptional states? Our data suggest that there may be some differences in Pho binding to non-PRE fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048765-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). However, this data has to be interpreted with caution. The <italic>en</italic>-GAL4 driver is an enhancer trap in the <italic>inv</italic> intron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Kwon1">[38]</xref> and contains an <italic>en</italic> fragment extending from &#x02212;2.4 kb through the <italic>en</italic> promoter. Thus, it is possible that the <italic>en</italic>-GAL4 driver alters Pho binding in the <italic>en/inv</italic> domain. In fact, the increased Pho-binding to non-PRE probes in the &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; versus the &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; state in the FLAG-Sce samples suggests that the presence of the <italic>en</italic>-GAL4 driver alters Pho binding slightly.</p><p>One unexpected result from these experiments was that FLAG-Sce binds to PRE2 but not to PRE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048765-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). This is an interesting result that needs to be followed up on. Recent ChIP-Seq data in our lab using imaginal disk/brain larval samples and the anti-Pho antibody show 5 additional Pho binding peaks between <italic>en</italic> and <italic>tou</italic>, which could be 5 additional PREs (S. De and JAK, unpublished data). Three of these correspond to Pho binding peaks already identified by Oktaba et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0048765-Oktaba2">[39]</xref>. ChIP-seq experiments with the FLAG-tagged proteins expressed in the &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; transcriptional states would be necessary to ask whether the distribution of PcG-proteins is altered at any of the PREs or any other region of the <italic>en/inv</italic> domain.</p><p>In conclusion, our data allows us to rule out two simple models of PcG-regulation of the <italic>en/inv</italic> genes. First, the <italic>en/inv</italic> PREs are not transcribed, so this cannot determine their activity state. Second, PcG proteins bind to at least one of the PREs of the <italic>en/inv</italic> locus in the &#x0201c;ON&#x0201d; state, therefore a simple model of PcG-binding determining the activity state of <italic>en/inv</italic> is not correct. Perhaps the proteins that activate <italic>en</italic> expression modify the PcG-proteins or the 3D structure of the locus and interfere with PcG-silencing. While FLAG-tagged PcG proteins offer a good tool to study PcG-binding particularly in the &#x0201c;OFF&#x0201d; state, cell-sorting of <italic>en</italic> positive and negative cells will be necessary to study the 3D structure and chromatin modification of the <italic>en/inv</italic> locus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>RNA data analysis</title><p>The following ModEncode mRNA and ncRNA reads in <italic>inv-en</italic> genomic regions were examined: Small ncRNA read samples: GSM286604, GSM364902, GSM286613, GSE24540, GSM286605, GSM286606, GSM286607, GSM286611, E12_V082, E02_V081, YAF01_V084, YAM01_V083, GSM360256, GSM360257, GSM322208, GSM322245, GSM360260, GSM360262, GSM322219, GSM322338, YA_GSM280086, O_V063.
