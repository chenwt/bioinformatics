The composition of the microbiome changes during the transition from health to disease; however, these changes are often not conserved among patients. Since microbiome-associated diseases like periodontitis cause similar patient symptoms despite interpatient variability in microbial community composition, we hypothesized that human-associated microbial communities undergo conserved changes in metabolism during disease. Here, we used patient-matched healthy and diseased samples to compare gene expression of 160,000 genes in healthy and diseased periodontal communities. We show that health- and disease-associated communities exhibit defined differences in metabolism that are conserved between patients. In contrast, the metabolic gene expression of individual species was highly variable between patients. These results demonstrate that despite high interpatient variability in microbial composition, disease-associated communities display conserved metabolic profiles that are generally accomplished by a patient-specific cohort of microbes. </p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>IMPORTANCE</title><p>The human microbiome project has shown that shifts in our microbiota are associated with many diseases, including obesity, Crohn&#x02019;s disease, diabetes, and periodontitis.

Collectively, these microbial species constitute the human microbiota. Nearly 500&#x000a0;years ago, Leeuwenhoek observed these tiny &#x0201c;animalcules&#x0201d; under his microscope and recorded the great diversity in cell size and shape in human dental plaque. In recent years, researchers have begun using marker gene surveys to catalog the species that colonize different regions of our bodies, including the oral cavity (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). These studies have primarily used high-throughput sequencing of the highly conserved rRNA gene to identify and quantify the numerous species constituting the microbiota (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Among the best-characterized human-associated microbial communities are the extremely diverse gut and oral microbiota. It is now appreciated that our indigenous microbiota are tightly linked to health. Studies using germfree mice have shown that key members of the microbiota promote normal immune system development (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, several human diseases, including diabetes, Crohn&#x02019;s disease, and periodontitis, are linked to disruptions in the gut and oral microbial populations (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In light of these results, microbiota-associated diseases such as periodontitis are increasingly examined through an ecological lens.</p><p>Microbiota-associated diseases are characterized by changes in the relative abundances of different species during disease. Periodontal disease is one such &#x0201c;microbial shift&#x0201d; disease associated with massive reorganization of the microbiota residing in the subgingival crevice, the region between the tooth surface and the gingival epithelium (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). While marked changes in microbial population structure are observed during periodontitis, the actual community members can differ greatly from person to person (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In fact, both healthy and disease-associated oral microbial communities vary significantly among people, among locations in the mouth, and even on a daily basis at the same site within the mouth (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>One possible explanation for the variability observed in marker gene surveys is that a variety of organisms are capable of occupying the multitude of niches present in health- and disease-associated communities. Thus, the question arises to what extent changes in the ecosystem are attributable to alterations in the abundance of certain community members or changes in the activities of existing organisms. Furthermore, while the species that make up health- and disease-associated communities may change, are there conserved metabolic changes in the microbiota associated with the transition to disease? Transcriptional profiling provides an avenue to explore bacterial behavior and metabolism in complex communities (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In this study, we used massively parallel RNA sequencing to profile changes in both the composition and gene expression of the human oral microbiota in health and in periodontitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="h1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="h1.1"><title>Disease-associated periodontal microbiota are more similar than are health-associated communities.</title><p>Patient-matched healthy and diseased periodontal samples were collected from 10 patients with aggressive periodontitis (AgP) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Each healthy and diseased periodontal plaque sample was a pool of populations from three healthy or diseased teeth from each patient. Thus, our study encompassed 30 total health-associated and 30 total disease-associated microbial periodontal populations. This collection technique was important for two main reasons. First, microbial periodontal plaque populations are very small, especially those populating healthy teeth; therefore, our pooled collection methods allowed us to obtain enough microbial cells to isolate RNA for population-wide diversity and gene expression analyses. Second, periodontal microbial populations have been shown to differ widely from one tooth to another, and our approach allowed us to capture the mean microbial population composition for healthy and disease-associated plaque for each patient.</p><table-wrap id="tab1" position="float"><label>TABLE&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>Aggressive periodontitis patient data</p></caption><table

sequencing of rRNA genes and of rRNA has been used to identify and quantify species in microbial communities (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In this study, we elected to use rRNA sequencing, because rRNA reflects organisms&#x02019; capacities to produce proteins and alter community activity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Using rRNA sequencing (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>&#x000a0;in the supplemental material), we found that many bacteria are present in both health- and disease-associated communities; however, many of the most ribosome-rich microbes in disease samples were those previously associated with infection, including <italic>Tannerella</italic> sp., <italic>Prevotella</italic>&#x000a0;sp., <italic>Treponema</italic> sp., and <italic>Porphyromonas</italic> sp. (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1A</xref>). Alpha diversity analyses of rRNA content in health- and disease-associated populations showed that disease-associated communities were significantly less diverse than health-associated populations: they contained fewer overall species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>) and were less species rich (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1B</xref>). Comparing rRNA gene abundance to rRNA abundance for a subset of our samples revealed a stronger correlation between these two measures for disease-associated populations than for health-associated populations, suggesting that a larger fraction of the disease-associated population is ribosome rich and thus can contribute to overall community activity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS2">Table&#x000a0;S2</xref>). In contrast, rRNA gene abundance correlated less well with rRNA abundance in healthy communities, indicating that many members of this community have low ribosome content. Beta diversity analysis comparing the relatedness of disease- and health-associated populations from multiple individuals showed that disease- and health-associated populations segregated into distinct groups (PERMANOVA, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01), and diseased populations were less dispersed than healthy populations (PERMDISP, <italic>P</italic> = 0.008) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1C</xref>). Additionally, disease-associated populations were more related to the average disease state than to paired health-associated populations from the same individual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1D</xref>). These data show that health-associated periodontal populations are highly diverse and patient specific, while a few commonly found, ribosome-rich organisms overwhelm health-associated microbiota during aggressive periodontitis. Previous studies have shown that the oral microbiota can vary from site to site within individuals (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), yet our data suggest that common features are seen in microbial communities associated with aggressive periodontitis.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>Ribosome quantification reveals that disease-associated periodontal microbiota are less diverse and contain fewer low-abundance species than do health-associated populations.

Despite these findings, it is unclear how specific activities of different members of the community impact disease. To address this question, we used high-resolution community transcriptional profiling. We were able to obtain sufficient quantities of total RNA from three patient-matched healthy and diseased samples representing 9 health- and 9 disease-associated periodontal plaque populations, which, following depletion of highly abundant human and bacterial rRNA, were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq system. In total, 1.5 billion RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reads were obtained (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS3">Table&#x000a0;S3</xref>&#x000a0;in the supplemental material). Prior to microbial gene expression analyses, we aligned the reads to the Human Oral Microbiome Database consisting of complete and draft genomes (HOMD; 4.4 billion&#x000a0;bp), the RefSeq human RNA database (huRNA; 135 million&#x000a0;bp), and the RefSeq viral genome database (virusDB; 121 million&#x000a0;bp). For each sample, between 55 and 65% of the total reads aligned to these reference databases, and the majority (&#x0003e;99%) of these reads were prokaryotic (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS4">Table&#x000a0;S4</xref>).</p><p>To quantify gene expression, reads were aligned to a 60-organism &#x0201c;metagenome&#x0201d; comprised of completed and draft genomes representing microbes comprising 60 to 90% of total healthy or diseased rRNA (see Supplementary File&#x000a0;1 at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://web.biosci.utexas.edu/whiteley_lab/pages/resources.html">http://web.biosci.utexas.edu/whiteley_lab/pages/resources.html</uri>). Since we characterized both health- and disease-associated communities with RNA-seq, we could analyze differential expression of the &#x0003e;160,000 bacterial genes represented in our metagenome simultaneously between healthy and diseased sites in the same individual. For each sample, 28 to 85 million RNA-seq reads mapped to the 60-organism metagenome, including 17.3 &#x000b1; 2.05 million mRNA reads per sample. This sequencing depth provided sufficient data for differential expression analysis at the community and organismal levels (for raw read counts per gene, see Supplementary File&#x000a0;2 at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://web.biosci.utexas.edu/whiteley_lab/pages/resources.html">http://web.biosci.utexas.edu/whiteley_lab/pages/resources.html</uri>; median, 12 to 21 reads per mRNA; mean, 75 to 156 reads per mRNA). In total, 66 to 91% of reads that mapped to the HOMD, huRNA, and virusDB databases mapped to the 60-species metagenome, suggesting that our reference metagenome sufficiently represents the oral microbiome as determined by shotgun metagenomic sequencing data.</p></sec><sec id="h1.3"><title>Disease-associated communities change metabolic gene expression.</title><p>Previous studies have used genomic information to predict disease-associated shifts in metabolism; however, these models are based on the genetic capacity of the population rather than microbial community metabolic gene expression (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Our RNA-seq approach allows modeling of the metabolism of the microbiota during health and disease based solely on gene expression. In this approach, we used Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers to assign biochemical function to the &#x0003e;160,000 genes present in the 60-organism metagenome. EC numbers classify enzymes based on the reaction that they catalyze (i.e., enzymes catalyzing the same reaction will have the same EC number). This allowed us to calculate changes in expression of metabolic enzymes for the entire community during health and disease, resulting in a quantitative, high-resolution view of metabolism. Among ~1,100 unique enzyme-encoding gene families in the oral metagenome, ~18% were differentially expressed (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) at the microbiome level during disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>; see also Supplementary File&#x000a0;3 at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://web.biosci.utexas.edu/whiteley_lab/pages/resources.html">http://web.biosci.utexas.edu/whiteley_lab/pages/resources.html</uri>). Using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) metabolic pathway database, we were able to reveal enzymatic steps whose genes were upregulated, downregulated, or unchanged in the microbiome during disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). These results revealed that within each individual, disease-associated populations showed defined changes in expression of metabolic genes, suggesting that specific metabolic shifts are occurring in disease-associated communities. Specific pathways that showed enhanced gene expression in all diseased sites included lysine fermentation to butyrate, histidine catabolism, nucleotide biosynthesis, and pyruvate fermentation. The observation that these pathways were observed in all three patients strongly suggests that they are important for stability of disease-associated populations and likely contribute to the disease process.

For example, while several oral microbes have the capacity to produce butyrate, the Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> is the sole bacterium responsible for community lysine degradation to butyrate in all patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4A</xref>). In contrast, several bacteria were responsible for enhanced expression of genes involved in histidine degradation and pyruvate fermentation during disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B and C</xref>), and the bacteria differed between patients. Collectively, these data provide two novel insights into this microbiota-mediated disease. (i) We propose that&#x000a0;<italic>F.&#x000a0;nucleatum</italic> is a keystone species during periodontitis, functioning in all patients by shifting its gene expression to produce a metabolite (butyrate) that establishes a hospitable growth environment for the disease-associated community. Notably, the rRNA of <italic>F.&#x000a0;nucleatum</italic> in health- and disease-associated communities is proportionally identical (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</xref> in the supplemental material), indicating that the changes in gene expression observed are not due to an increase in abundance in disease-associated populations. While <italic>F.&#x000a0;nucleatum</italic> and other bacteria have been proposed as keystone species in the past, even the most convincing data supporting these theories have arisen from defined model communities containing few species grown in animal models (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Because the ability to serve as a keystone species is dependent on the constituents of the community (which vary between patients), our data provide the first evidence for the role of this bacterium as a keystone species in a naturally occurring microbial community during human infection. We also pinpoint lysine fermentation as the key metabolic pathway contributing to its keystone role, which was previously unappreciated. (ii) We also show that, while metabolism is conserved at the community level, for pathways like histidine degradation and pyruvate fermentation multiple microbes contribute to gene expression changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4B and C</xref>). The interchangeability of community members in each patient provides insight into why metagenomic analyses of the oral microbiome have displayed little conservation. Remarkably, we observed that the bacteria contributing to expression of known extracellular virulence factors vary between patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4D</xref>), suggesting that in addition to metabolism, distinct microbes produce conserved virulence determinants in each individual.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>Metabolic niche dynamics in diseased populations.

If this were true, we hypothesized that variance of gene expression at the individual gene level (i.e., a gene within a single species) would be high, while variance at the EC-binned level (orthologous genes from all species in the community) would be low. In support of this hypothesis, variance estimations show that as expression increases, dispersion increases at the individual gene level while it decreases at the community EC expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5A and B</xref>). Since the decreased variance observed at the EC-binned level could potentially be due to a condensation of the data to fewer total data points, we randomly binned genes into 1,137 groups (equal to the number of ECs) and performed the variance analyses on this artificial data set. As expression increases in the randomly grouped gene set, variance increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5C</xref>), demonstrating that the decreased variance observed in EC-binned genes is indeed biological and not due to compression of the data. These data indicate that an individual gene (e.g., pyruvate formate lyase in a single microbe) displays high variability in expression between communities (i.e., patients); however expression of orthologous genes (e.g., pyruvate formate lyase from all microbes) is highly conserved.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>EC expression is less variable than individual gene expression.

Thus, in studies focusing on the microbiota, it is important to ensure that sufficient samples are examined to capture the breadth of this variability. Previous metatranscriptomics studies examining the human microbiota associated with bacterial vaginosis, in feces treated with different drugs, and in feces from people with various diets have successfully revealed conserved community gene expression responses with as few as two biological replicates per condition (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Here, we provided a complete transcriptome-based reconstruction of microbial metabolism in nine patient-matched health- and disease-associated periodontal plaque populations from three patients. Importantly, the results of this reconstruction recapitulated a key phenomenon consistently found during the transition to periodontal disease: the increased production of short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). This indicates that we were able to identify conserved changes in microbial community metabolism in the face of high interpatient variability in microbiota composition.</p><p>Our study represents an important advance in several ways. First, we captured gene expression at an extremely high resolution, examining expression of 160,000 genes simultaneously. To comprehensively analyze expression of such a large gene set, it was important to achieve sufficient sequencing depth to accurately determine differences among plaque communities. Therefore, we focused our study on a relatively small patient group and were able to compare gene expression of numerous high- and low-abundance organisms in these communities. Also, our EC-based computational approach allowed us to take a more global view of microbial metabolism than previously appreciated. Other studies have used KEGG orthologs to study metabolism (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). While this approach is similar to ours, it is complicated by the fact that many KEGG orthologs can encode proteins with the same catalytic activity, whereas each enzyme is assigned only one&#x000a0;EC number for its specific catalytic activity. Therefore, our approach truly distilled genes into functional rather than orthologous groups, allowing us to accurately look at whole-community metabolism in an ancestry-independent manner.</p><p>While population composition varied among plaque populations, we found that enzyme expression was well conserved. This suggests that multiple organisms that vary among populations are capable of filling conserved metabolic niches. This study is an important step toward characterizing the influence of human microbiota on health and disease. While mRNA is not an exact prediction of metabolic activity, it is a closer approximation of metabolism than 16S rRNA or genome-based predictions that have been reported previously. RNA-seq is especially well suited for studying human microbiota because it is highly sensitive, and therefore, experiments can be performed with small amounts of starting material, like dental plaque. Other approaches, including proteomics or metabolomics, may aid in the understanding of human-associated microbial metabolism but are technically challenging due to the sample sizes required for these techniques.</p><p>A major question that remains with all microbial shift diseases is whether changes in microbiota composition and behavior cause disease or are a consequence of disease. Here, we found that differential expression of metabolic genes in certain pathways was associated with the periodontal disease state. For instance, expression of butyrate production genes by <italic>F.&#x000a0;nucleatum</italic> increased during disease. Increased butyrate levels have been measured in diseased periodontal pockets, and studies in cell culture have shown that these butyrate concentrations can arrest human cell growth, potentially delaying the healing process (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In combination with the findings presented here, this suggests that <italic>F.&#x000a0;nucleatum</italic> butyrate production likely promotes disease. However, carefully designed future studies will be necessary to better support this hypothesis.</p><p>Several different metatranscriptomic approaches will help elucidate the answer to the &#x0201c;chicken or egg&#x0201d; question in microbial shift disease research. One potential approach is to carefully examine composition and behavior of the microbiota throughout disease progression. In this approach, one could simultaneously analyze the host symptoms and microbiota to determine whether changes occur first at the host level or at the microbial level at disease onset. An alternate approach would be to examine a large number of healthy and disease-associated microbial communities. This would allow the characterization of common features of health and disease, and one would expect to find intermediate compositional and expression states that might get to the root of the question. In addition, results from metatranscriptomics studies will help guide more directed studies to utilize mRNAs as markers for disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="h3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="h3.1"><title>Study population.</title><p>A total of 10 individuals seeking dental treatment in the School of Dentistry, Ege University, Izmir, Turkey, were involved in the present study.

Reference sequences were indexed with Bowtie 2.0 (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Since the HOMD sequences exceeded the size limit for Bowtie 2.0 (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), the sequences were split into two files with the custom Perl script FastaSplit.pl (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://github.com/khturner/metarna-seq">http://github.com/khturner/metaRNA-seq</uri>), and then each file was indexed. Trimmed fastq sequencing reads were split into chunks of 10 million reads using the UNIX split command. Each read chunk was mapped separately to the four indexed reference sequences using Bowtie 2.0 (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), keeping only 1 match for each fastq read for each reference. Unmapped reads were discarded, and mapped reads were labeled to indicate whether they mapped to either of the 2 human oral microbiome indexed databases (HOMD1 and HOMD2), the indexed human RNA database, or the indexed viral RNA database. The resulting labeled mapped reads in sam file format for each read chunk in each sample were concatenated and sorted by read name using the UNIX cat and sort commands. Since initially we were interested in whether a read was of bacterial origin, human origin, or viral origin, if a single fastq read mapped to both HOMD1 and HOMD2, the read mapped to HOMD2 was discarded; however, if a read mapped to multiple references (e.g., HOMD and human), it was labeled in the file using the custom Perl script MatchMarker.pl (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://github.com/khturner/metarna-seq">http://github.com/khturner/metaRNA-seq</uri>). The numbers of uniquely mapping reads and reads mapping to multiple reference databases for each sample were determined using the UNIX uniq and pattern-matching grep commands.</p></sec><sec id="h3.12"><title>Generating a reference metagenome for differential gene expression analysis.</title><p>Genomes for differential gene expression analyses were selected using 16S rRNA sequencing for patients 1, 2, and 3.
