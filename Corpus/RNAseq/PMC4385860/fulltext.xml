Here, we have generated everolimus resistance in ER+ breast cancer cells and in long-term estrogen deprived (LTED) models that mimic progression on anti-estrogens. This allowed us to uncover MYC as a driver of mTOR inhibitor resistance. We demonstrate that both everolimus resistance and acute treatment of everolimus can lead to the upregulation of MYC mRNA, protein expression and, consequently, the enrichment of MYC signatures as revealed by RNA sequencing data. Depletion of <italic>MYC</italic> resulted in resensitization to everolimus, confirming its functional importance in this setting. Furthermore, ChIP assays demonstrate that <italic>MYC</italic> upregulation in the everolimus resistant lines is mediated by increased association of the BRD4 transcription factor with the <italic>MYC</italic> gene. Finally, JQ1, a BRD4 inhibitor combined with everolimus exhibited increased tumor growth inhibition in 3D Matrigel models and an in vivo xenograft model. These data suggest that MYC plays an important role in mediating resistance to everolimus in ER+ and ER+/LTED models. Furthermore, given the regulation of<italic>MYC</italic>by BRD4 in this setting, these data have implications for increased therapeutic potential of combining epigenetic agents with mTOR inhibitors to effectively downregulate otherwise difficult to target transcription factors such as MYC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>everolimus</kwd><kwd>resistance</kwd><kwd>mTOR</kwd><kwd>MYC</kwd><kwd>BRD4</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer diagnosed and is responsible for the second most fatalities in women. An extremely heterogeneous disease, breast cancer is comprised of patients that fall into different disease segments based on their tumor's histotype; namely, hormone (estrogen and progesterone receptors) and Her2 status. The largest disease segment within breast cancer is hormone receptor positive disease, with approximately 75% of patients falling into this category [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumors typically rely on circulating estrogen for their growth. Given this dependence, treatment options for ER+ breast cancer patients have relied heavily on anti-hormonal strategies with varying anti-estrogen modalities. These include such agents as tamoxifen (competes with estrogen for binding to ER) [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], aromatase inhibitors (prevents biosynthesis of estrogen) [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and fulvestrant (downregulates ER) [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], all of which have shown success in the clinic. More specifically, third generation aromatase inhibitors (letrozole, anastrazole and exemestane) have shown improved overall survival and have become the standard of care for postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. While most patients respond to endocrine agents, eventually a majority will display resistance to such agents [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive this resistance is crucial to overcoming these clinical hurdles. It is necessary, therefore, to have appropriate biological models in place to help determine molecular drivers of resistance and to test pre-clinical hypotheses.</p><p>The long-term estrogen deprived (LTED) model originally developed by the Arteaga group involves growing ER+ breast cancer lines in the absence of estrogen [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These LTED cell lines eventually lose their dependence on estrogen and mimic clinical tumors progressing on tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Their predictive nature is underscored by the similarities between LTED gene signatures and the gene signatures of patients treated with hormonal agents. These LTED models provide very useful tools in understanding primary and secondary mechanisms of resistance in ER+ breast cancer patients. Indeed, the LTED model has implicated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway's involvement in mediating resistance to anti-estrogens [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These and other studies have resulted in many initiatives to understand and target members of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR family.</p><p>Everolimus (Rad001), is an allosteric inhibitor of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), demonstrating efficacy in many different cancer types, including renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and advanced kidney tumors, all of which everolimus is FDA-approved for [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Most recently, FDA approval was achieved based on data from the BOLERO-2 trial, demonstrating that everolimus in conjunction with exemestane, an aromatase inhibitor, improves progression-free survival compared to exemestane alone in post-menopausal women with advanced ER+, Her2-negative breast cancer [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Very importantly, while progression-free survival was significantly improved, recent data has been released suggesting no improved overall survival in this disease segment [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These recent data suggest that the combination of exemestane and everolimus does not give a durable clinical response, indicating a need for alternative combinations and therapeutic strategies.</p><p>To understand and overcome this potential onset of drug resistance, here we describe the generation of everolimus-resistant cell lines both in parental and long-term estrogen-deprived (LTED) backgrounds of ER+ breast cancer cell lines. We demonstrate that cells resistant to everolimus have an activated MYC signature due to upregulation of MYC expression at the transcript and protein levels. We further show that this upregulation of MYC is mediated by BRD4 regulation of the <italic>MYC</italic> gene and that combining a BRD4 inhibitor with everolimus leads to enhanced tumor growth inhibition <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>The generation and validation of everolimus resistance in parental and LTED ER+ breast cancer cell lines</title><p>We chose four ER+ breast cancer cell lines to study mechanisms of everolimus resistance; MCF7, ZR75-1 (ZR75), SUM52 and CAMA-1 (CAMA). To generate resistant models (eveR), cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of everolimus until growth inhibition in the presence of compound was no greater than 50% (and the GI50 was significantly different than parental counterparts) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Importantly, parental lines were maintained in culture for similar lengths of time as the everolimus-resistant versions, to control for long-term culture effects.</p><p>We next assessed biochemical changes in the eveR lines. Acute inhibition of mTOR by everolimus should result in lack of kinase activity and consequently, decreased phospho-targets specific to mTOR (e.g. S6 at Serine 240/244 (pS6) and 4EBP1 at Serine 65 (p4EBP1). To determine whether alterations in the mTOR pathway were responsible for the onset of resistance, pS6 and p4EBP1 expression was examined. Importantly, pS6, an mTOR-p70S6K target, was relatively undetectable levels in all eveR lines after extended exposure to everolimus, suggesting this portion of mTORC1 signaling remains targetable in this context and is likely not contributing to the resistant phenotype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In contrast, we observed a variable response in p4EBP1. Phosphorylation of 4EBP1 was decreased in MCF7-eveR cells as well as in ZR75-eveR, albeit to a lesser extent. In contrast, p4EBP1 was slightly upregulated in SUM52 cells, and was relatively unchanged in CAMA-eveR cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In addition, western blot analyses of ER expression was assessed in the eveR derivatives. While eveR in MCF7 resulted in decreased ER expression, the opposite result was seen in CAMA and ZR75 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). Although pS6 is consistently downregulated in eveR lines, the variability in 4EBP1 phosphorylation and ER expression levels suggests context-dependent responses to long-term everolimus treatment.</p><p>Given clinical treatment regimens, we hypothesized that generating everolimus resistance in cell lines that model aromatase inhibitor treatment would parallel that of treatment orders seen in patients. Indeed, patients previously treated with endocrine agents were the focus of the BOLERO-2 trial, and for which everolimus treatment has been approved despite lack of change in overall survival in the clinical study [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For this reason, in addition to generating resistance to everolimus in the four ER+ parental breast cancer cell lines, we also generated resistance in MCF7 and ZR75 LTED counterparts. This resulted in four derivatives of MCF7 and ZR75 cells: long-term culture (Parental, Par, P), everolimus-resistant (eveR, eR), long-term estrogen deprived (LTED, L) and everolimus-resistant LTED (LTED-eveR, LeR) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In a short-term cell proliferation assay, MCF7-LTED and ZR75-LTED were much less sensitive to everolimus than their parental counterparts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Despite this, long-term exposure to everolimus resulted in complete resistance to the drug in the MCF7 setting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). While ZR75-LTED exhibited relative resistance to everolimus compared to the parental cells, ZR75-LTED-eveR exhibited significantly increased resistance to the drug (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Downstream targets of mTOR signaling were assessed in LTED derivatives as well. pS6 was undetectable in both LTED-eveR lines similar to eveR lines. p4EBP1 was decreased in both LTED-eveR, however only to a modest extent in the MCF7-LTED-eveR setting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Furthermore, LTED derivatives of MCF7 and ZR75 both resulted in significant loss of ER expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). The ER downregulation in the LTED lines is not surprising, as it has been previously shown that anti-estrogens can have varying effects on ER levels in patients [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>To rule out differences in growth rates between derivatives, cells were also plated in a long-term colony formation assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). The ability of MCF7 parental cells to form colonies in the presence of everolimus was severely impaired. In contrast, MCF7-eveR cells were not only able to form colonies in the presence of everolimus, they did so to a greater extent than in the absence of drug. As expected, the MCF7-LTED line maintained sensitivity to everolimus in the colony-formation assay, and the MCF7-LTED-eveR derivative was able to grow in the presence and absence of drug (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). In fact, the MCF7-LTED-eveR cells formed colonies better than the MCF7-LTED regardless of everolimus treatment. These data suggest that lack of sensitivity to everolimus in the eveR and LTED-eveR lines was not due to any differences in growth rates between derivatives. In addition, washout studies demonstrated that eveR and LTED-eveR lines maintained their resistance to everolimus up to at least seven days after washing the cells out of drug (data not shown). To determine whether anchorage-independence and/or contact with extracellular matrix proteins could alter the resistant derivatives' sensitivity to everolimus, growth was assessed in a three-dimensional Matrigel assay [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The eveR and LTED-eveR cells remained resistant to everolimus in 3D Matrigel cultures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>), suggesting the cells attachment to basement membrane did not alter sensitivity. Interestingly, ZR75-LTED appeared to be more sensitive to everolimus in 3D relative to the 2D assay. In either case, ZR75-LTED-eveR was significantly resistant to everolimus compared to ZR75-LTED cells regardless of assay type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>).</p><p>These data demonstrate the generation of cell lines that are resistant to everolimus treatment in a variety of proliferation and growth assays and were considered relevant model systems for further molecular characterization to determine drivers of resistance. Potent inhibition of pS6 in all eveR lines suggests that feedback loops are not playing a role in reactivating pS6, and thus this portion of mTOR signaling is likely not driving resistance. Furthermore, the variable responses to another mTOR target, p4EBP1 prompted us to investigate whether additional players outside of direct mTOR signaling could play a more dependable role in all of the eveR lines.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Resistance to everolimus in ER+ cell lines</title><p>A.

One of the most robust changes observed was an increase in MYC mRNA expression in the MCF7-eveR line compared to the MCF7 parental line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Using quantitative real-time PCR analyses, we validated the RNA sequencing result demonstrating that <italic>MYC</italic> mRNA is increased in all of the eveR lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, top). Furthermore, increased protein expression of MYC was also seen in all eveR lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, bottom). Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) was used to identify gene signatures associated with resistance and in concordance with increased MYC expression, multiple MYC signatures were enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>), including those previously identified in LTED experiments [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, we show breast cancer specific MYC genes that are statistically differentially expressed between MCF7-eveR and MCF7-parental, suggesting the increased MYC is functional in this setting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Similar to the parental and eveR lines, we saw an increase in MYC mRNA by RNA sequencing in the MCF7-LTED-eveR line compared to the MCF7-LTED line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). These results were validated by qPCR and western blot analyses in both the MCF7 and ZR75 context (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Furthermore, the LTED-eveR also showed activation of MYC signatures, including breast-specific MYC target genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). These data suggest a common mechanism of MYC upregulation and activation in response to everolimus among ER+ breast cancer lines and their LTED counterparts.</p><p>Finally, to rule out the upregulation of MYC being due to clonal selection or long-term drug treatment effects, we also examined the expression of MYC in response to acute treatments of everolimus. Similar to the resistant setting, acute treatment of everolimus resulted in an upregulation of MYC protein in both parental and LTED derivatives of MCF7 and ZR75 cells within 72 hours post-treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). This suggests that a mechanism to upregulate MYC expression exists in response to treatment of everolimus and targeting MYC and mTOR together might be an effective therapeutic strategy in preventing the onset of everolimus resistance.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Enrichment of MYC signatures in eveR and LTED-eveR lines</title><p>A.

To address this, two sequence-specific siRNAs to MYC were employed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Importantly, knockdown of MYC resulted in partial resensitization of MCF7-eveR lines to everolimus in a short term proliferation assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Sensitivity to everolimus was also restored in MCF7-LTED-eveR lines transfected with either <italic>MYC</italic> siRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Furthermore, colony formation assays revealed a reduced ability of both eveR derivatives to form colonies when expressing either <italic>MYC</italic> siRNA in the presence of everolimus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Intriguingly, the MCF7-LTED line showed increased growth inhibition when everolimus was combined with either <italic>MYC</italic> siRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This suggests that the expression of MYC (whether pre-existing or in response to everolimus treatment) can play a role in determining sensitivity of LTED derivatives to everolimus.</p><p>To determine whether MYC was sufficient to cause resistance to everolimus we employed a tet-inducible vector to overexpress MYC in MCF7 parental lines. In the presence of doxycycline, MYC expression was upregulated in MCF7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). We then exposed the cells to increasing concentrations of everolimus in the presence or absence of MYC expression (+/&#x02212; doxycycline). Interestingly, MYC expression resulted in significant recovery of proliferation even at the highest concentrations of everolimus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). This was in comparison to cells expressing tet-inducible RFP, which were sensitive to everolimus regardless of exposure to doxycycline and the expression of RFP. These results suggest that MYC expression alone can confer resistance to everolimus in MCF7 cells. These data underscore the importance of the MYC upregulation observed in the eveR derivatives and demonstrate a direct connection between MYC expression and everolimus sensitivity.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>MYC is necessary and sufficient to confer resistance to everolimus</title><p>A.

While MYC regulation by BRD4 has been extensively studied in hematological malignancies, relatively little is known about this mechanism in solid tumors, particularly in breast cancer. A recent publication outlined a role for BRD-mediated transcription of MYC in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancers [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As mentioned above, the LTED setting mimics patient response to aromatase inhibition and tamoxifen treatment [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Our observations of <italic>MYC</italic> upregulation in the eveR setting and this novel connection between BRD regulation and tamoxifen resistance prompted us to investigate BRD4 as a potential regulator of MYC in the eveR lines. In order to determine whether MYC upregulation is mediated by enhanced BRD4 association with the <italic>MYC</italic> gene we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses. We observed that eveR lines showed increase binding of BRD4 to the <italic>MYC</italic> gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, left). We also performed ChIP using antibodies specific to acetylated H3K27, a mark of active transcription. We observed an acetylated H3K27 mark on the <italic>MYC</italic> gene in the MCF7-eveR line relative to MCF7 parental (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, right). These data are consistent with the observation that <italic>MYC</italic> is upregulated at the transcript level in the eveR setting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Recently, the small molecule JQ1 was shown to inhibit BRD4-dependent transcription by preventing the binding of the BRD4 bromodomain to acetylated lysine residues [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To further test the specific regulation of <italic>MYC</italic> by BRD4 in the eveR setting we used JQ1 in our ChIP analyses. Treatment with JQ1 resulted in abrogation of BRD4-occupancy at the <italic>MYC</italic> gene in eveR lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). This experiment was repeated with a second BRD4-specific antibody and obtained similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). In concordance with this, JQ1 treatment resulted in downregulation of MYC mRNA expression in the eveR lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). In fact, JQ1 treatment abolished MYC upregulation in all eveR and LTED-eveR cell lines, suggesting that BRD4 is responsible for the increased MYC expression in these settings (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). Interestingly, fractionation of MCF7 derivatives revealed that global association of BRD4 with chromatin does not change in the eveR lines (data not shown).

The 3D Matrigel assay allows us to examine changes in growth while taking into consideration ECM and basement membrane interactions that more closely mimic growth <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, this assay was used to examine responses to combinations of everolimus and JQ1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). MCF7 and ZR75 derivatives were plated in Matrigel and their sensitivity to everolimus, JQ1 and the combination were examined. ZR75 Parental cells were relatively sensitive to everolimus alone at both concentrations and as previously shown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). However, the treatment with everolimus did not result in cell death. Rather, single cells remained intact and relatively viable in culture. Treatment with JQ1 in combination, however, resulted in an even further decrease in cell number (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, right). This was consistent with the increased disintegration of cells depicted in the everolimus + JQ1 treatment group, suggesting the addition of JQ1 caused cell death. As expected, everolimus treatment of the ZR75-eveR line resulted in minimal sensitivity to the high concentration of everolimus, however when combined with JQ1, the lines were resensitized to everolimus and the combination resulted in greater attenuation of proliferation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). In fact, JQ1 resensitized the eveR lines to everolimus to a level comparable to that of the parental cells treated with everolimus alone. The ZR75-LTED lines exhibited less sensitivity to everolimus alone than the parental lines as seen previously (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Combinations of everolimus and JQ1 in the LTED cells significantly decreased growth compared with either agent alone. Similar to parental cells, the combination also resulted in increased cell disintegration, indicative of cell death (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Interestingly, the ZR75-LTED-eveR line was very sensitive to JQ1, even in the absence of everolimus. The combination of both drugs significantly reduced proliferation and greatly induced cell disintegration in the ZR75-LTED-eveR line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Similar results were seen with MCF7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p><p>In SUM52 and CAMA cell lines, we performed a short term proliferation assay with everolimus, JQ1 and the combination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 4A</xref>). In both lines, addition of JQ1 to everolimus-treated cells resulted in increased growth inhibition compared with everolimus treatment alone. Furthermore, a comprehensive 6&#x000d7;6 combination grid of ZR75 derivatives in 2D treated with both compounds showed an increased growth inhibitory effect when JQ1 was combined with everolimus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, ZR75-LTED-eveR were resensitized to everolimus to greater extent in the presence of JQ1 than the ZR75-eveR cell line. These results suggest that a BRD4-mediated mechanism of driving resistance can be targeted in the everolimus-resistant setting, as well as in combination with acute treatments of everolimus to increase efficacy.</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Combination effect observed with JQ1 and everolimus treatment</title><p>A and B.

We tested the combination in an MCF7 <italic>in vivo</italic> xenograft model. After the tumors reached ~150mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were treated with vehicle control, everolimus, JQ1 or the combination. Treatment with JQ1 showed no efficacy compared to the vehicle control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Everolimus treatment alone resulted in only 50% tumor growth inhibition (TGI). While the tumor growth inhibition in response to everolimus was significantly different than the vehicle (<italic>p</italic>=0.005), we believe the partial sensitivity would not translate into a durable clinical response. Strikingly, while JQ1 has no effect alone, the addition of JQ1 to everolimus resulted in a statistically significant tumor growth inhibition compared to either agent alone (<italic>p</italic>=0.008 compared to everolimus alone and <italic>p</italic>=0.0017 compared to JQ1 alone, TGI= 75% relative to vehicle control). This suggests a combination benefit for these two agents in producing a near complete response in this <italic>in vivo</italic> model (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Furthermore, this suggests the need for additional therapies to treat the residual and potentially resistant population. Importantly, body weight loss did not exceed 20% in any of the treatment groups, suggesting the agents were well-tolerated (data not shown). To determine whether the addition of JQ1 to everolimus would alter regrowth capabilities post-treatment, we measured animals after treatment had ended in the everolimus alone and in the combination group. The combination-treated animals had severely impaired regrowth post-treatment compared to animals that had received everolimus alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). In fact, the average change in tumor volume was statistically significant between groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, right).

We have generated everolimus-resistant derivatives of several ER+ breast cancer lines. Through transcriptional profiling, we identified a MYC signature that is upregulated in eveR cells. This corresponds to transcriptional upregulation of MYC itself. Through overexpression and knockdown experiments, we have found that MYC is both necessary and sufficient for resistance to everolimus. Indeed, previous literature has linked MYC to the mTOR pathway. In a MYC-driven model of lymphoma, 4EBP1 is hyperphosphorylated in an mTOR-dependent manner [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, MYC can cause resistance to rapamycin in prostate epithelial cells through a mechanism which paradoxically involves upregulation of 4EBP1 [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, our data are not consistent with either of these mechanisms, as neither expression nor phosphorylation of 4EBP1 increases with MYC upregulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and data not shown). Interestingly, MYC is also known to regulate ribosomal biogenesis through transcription of ribosomal RNAs [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Additionally, MYC has been shown to control autophagy, another process regulated by mTOR [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These functions may explain the ability of MYC to bypass the requirement for mTORC1 activity in this context.</p><p>Recently, publications have outlined MYC as a target for regulation by bromodomain protein, BRD4 [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Specifically, BRD4 has been shown to associate with the <italic>MYC</italic> gene in hematological malignancies and drive MYC expression [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Given the ability of BRD4 to regulate transcription factors that are difficult to target, such as MYC, BRD4 has become an attractive therapeutic target. Published studies have shown that in MYC-dependent tumors, JQ1 treatment causes reduced proliferation and increased differentiation as a consequence of MYC downregulation [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, another BRD4 inhibitor similar in structure to JQ1, OTX015, is currently being used in phase I clinical trials for hematological malignancies [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These recent developments underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting bromodomain proteins. Interestingly, we demonstrate MYC upregulation as a consequence of mTOR inhibition which requires BRD4, a known regulator of MYC. The BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 completely blocks MYC upregulation after everolimus treatment. With the recent emergence of BRD4 as a pharmacological target, this finding raises the intriguing possibility of using BRD4 inhibitors in the clinic to overcome everolimus resistance. We tested this possibility and observed that JQ1 is highly effective in killing eveR cells and enhances the antitumor effects of everolimus <italic>in vivo</italic>. In further support of this hypothesis, BRD4 was recently identified as a potential target in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but has not yet been linked to mTOR inhibitors. It remains an open question how mTOR inhibition leads to BRD4 activation on the MYC gene. We do not see any change in the levels of BRD4 mRNA or its global association with chromatin after mTOR inhibition. Additionally, we did not observe any change in the expression of MCL1 (data not shown), another validated BRD4 target in hematological malignancies [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This not only demonstrates the tissue specificity of BRD4 function, it indicates the feasibility of using BRD4 inhibitors and the ability of BRD4 to regulate target genes such as <italic>MYC</italic> will have to be evaluated in each tumor type.</p><p>The differential sensitivity to everolimus depending on the cell line and background (LTED versus parental) suggests molecular players might be different between the parental and LTED background. Previous reports have demonstrated an activation of MYC in the LTED setting and MYC as a prognostic indicator of anti-estrogen treatment [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Indeed, we have observed an increase in MYC expression in LTED lines compared to parental lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref> and data not shown). It is possible that this increased level of MYC has primed the cells for resistance to everolimus. Our data demonstrating lower sensitivity to everolimus in the LTED setting versus the parental setting parallels this argument (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a more robust response to the combination of everolimus and JQ1 in the ZR75-LTED-eveR lines compared to the ZR75-eveR cell line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). Given that MYC levels can determine sensitivity to anti-estrogens [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and, as shown here, everolimus-resistance, it is plausible that the LTED-eveR lines rely on MYC to a greater extent. Therefore, abolishing MYC levels in this setting is more detrimental to the cells. These data emphasize the importance of generating resistance in the order seen in the clinic, as it may have an impact on downstream signaling cascades and potentially, therapeutic response to future compounds.</p><p>While there are caveats to generating resistance in cell lines, as different contexts can rely on a variety of mechanisms for growth and response to treatment, we are encouraged by the fact that all four cell lines and their LTED derivatives display a unified upregulation of MYC, as compared to other relevant proteins (4EBP1 and ER levels). Moreover, we believe these cell lines' varied molecular contexts mimic patient heterogeneity, highlighting further the importance of MYC upregulation as a consistent phenotype. Furthermore, we are confident in the potential combinatorial strategy demonstrated by our data in 3D Matrigel and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies; growth conditions that better recapitulate the patient setting [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It will be important to see if similar mechanisms emerge from the BOLERO-2 trial samples and/or other clinical data involving mTOR inhibitors.</p><p>In summary, we present evidence for a novel mechanism that places BRD4 and MYC in a pathway which can promote resistance to mTORC1 inhibition. Combined inhibition of mTOR and BRD4 overcomes resistance and may represent a clinically relevant opportunity to enhance the therapeutic benefit of mTOR inhibitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>MCF7, ZR75, CAMA-1 (ATCC) and SUM52 (Asterand) and non-LTED eveR derivatives were cultured in RPMI (Gibco) with 10% FBS (Sigma), 1% L-glutamine and antibiotics.
