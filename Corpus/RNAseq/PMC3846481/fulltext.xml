Accordingly, transcriptome sequencing offers a powerful approach to address questions concerning the influence of natural habitat on the physiology of an organism. We used RNA sequencing of <italic>Eutrema salsugineum,</italic> an extremophile relative of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, to investigate the extent to which genetic variation and controlled versus natural environments contribute to differences between transcript profiles<italic>.</italic></p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using 10 million cDNA reads, we compared transcriptomes from two natural <italic>Eutrema</italic> accessions (originating from Yukon Territory, Canada and Shandong Province, China) grown under controlled conditions in cabinets and those from Yukon plants collected at a Yukon field site. We assessed the genetic heterogeneity between individuals using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the expression patterns of 27,016 genes. Over 39,000 SNPs distinguish the Yukon from the Shandong accessions but only 4,475 SNPs differentiated transcriptomes of Yukon field plants from an inbred Yukon line. We found 2,989 genes that were differentially expressed between the three sample groups and multivariate statistical analyses showed that transcriptomes of individual plants from a Yukon field site were as reproducible as those from inbred plants grown under controlled conditions. Predicted functions based upon gene ontology classifications show that the transcriptomes of field plants were enriched by the differential expression of light- and stress-related genes, an observation consistent with the habitat where the plants were found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our expectation that comparative RNA-Seq analysis of transcriptomes from plants originating in natural habitats would be confounded by uncontrolled genetic and environmental factors was not borne out. Moreover, the transcriptome data shows little genetic variation between laboratory Yukon <italic>Eutrema</italic> plants and those found at a field site. Transcriptomes were reproducible and biological associations meaningful whether plants were grown in cabinets or found in the field. Thus RNA-Seq is a valuable approach to study native plants in natural environments and this technology can be exploited to discover new gene targets for improved crop performance under adverse conditions.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Eutrema salsugineum</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Thellungiella salsuginea</italic></kwd><kwd>Transcriptome profiling</kwd><kwd>RNA-Seq</kwd><kwd>Salt tolerance</kwd><kwd>Natural plant populations</kwd><kwd>Single nucleotide polymorphisms</kwd><kwd>Phenotypic plasticity</kwd><kwd>Ecological genomics</kwd><kwd>Natural field conditions</kwd><kwd>Halophyte</kwd><kwd>Extremophile</kwd><kwd>Plant stress tolerance traits</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Determining how wild plants have adapted to extreme environments can provide useful insight into how all plants respond to stress. In particular, researchers measure genetic differences among populations found in different environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A classic approach is to compare trait differences among populations when they are grown in the same environment as in a common garden. Comparative genomics studies using natural accessions can also provide insights into traits associated with the adaptation of an organism to a given habitat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The genetic basis underlying traits of interest can be studied using the natural genetic variation between accessions combined with standard genetic approaches such as marker based mapping strategies to identify trait-associated allele(s). However, traits expressed in an environment are the consequence of both genetic and environmental influences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], so that an adaptation displayed under natural conditions may not be detectable in a controlled environment chamber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p><italic>Eutrema salsugineum</italic> (Pall.) Al-Shehbaz &#x00026; Warwick (also known as <italic>Thellungiella salsuginea</italic> (Pall.) O.E. Schulz) offers an ideal system to explore hypotheses about plant adaptations to extreme environments. This native crucifer is closely related to the genetic model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> but displays a far greater capacity to withstand freezing temperatures, water deficits, and saline soils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Two naturally occurring accessions have been the subject of several studies with one accession originating from the Yukon Territory, Canada and the second from Shandong Province, China. These accessions have evolved under contrasting natural habitats with the one in Canada growing under a semi-arid, subarctic climate and the accession in China under a temperate climate subject to more frequent precipitation.</p><p>Yukon <italic>Eutrema</italic> plants show plasticity to field versus controlled environment chambers with respect to morphology, stress-responsive genes and metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Plants in the field show prominent cauline leaves and, for the most part, lack rosette leaves while plants in cabinets have many rosette but few cauline leaves. At the level of the metabolome, salt-stressed plants in growth chambers accumulate proline in a osmo-responsive manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], but plants in a saline field site had a much lower proline content that was comparable to chamber-grown plants that had not been salt stressed. Manipulation of salt and nitrogen treatments under controlled growth conditions demonstrated that proline accumulated with high nitrogen content in saline culture media. Plants exposed to salt when on low nitrogen accumulated carbohydrates as did plants found under natural conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Thus comparisons involving field and chamber-grown plants can provide novel and valuable insights into the breadth of traits subject to phenotypic plasticity and how they may contribute towards the adaptation of plants to their natural environment.</p><p>A limited set of comparisons among transcript profiles of field and chamber-grown Yukon <italic>Eutrema</italic> plants was reported by Guevara et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] using a microarray chip representing 3,628 unigenes. They found statistically significant, biologically meaningful gene expression patterns in comparisons between plants stressed under controlled conditions in cabinets and field plants. However, the information that microarray data can provide is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. One issue is poor genome coverage; the chip used surveys a comparatively small sampling of the predicted coding capacity for the full <italic>Eutrema</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Another problem is that microarray data are relative and require incorporation of a control comparison, which may not exist for a field sample. Microarrays are also relatively insensitive to distinguishing between genes with multiple family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and this could be further complicated by an indeterminate level of genetic and environmental variation among plants from a natural population in their native habitat. In this investigation we assessed the suitability of an alternative approach to comparative transcriptome profiling based upon next generation sequencing (NGS). We used high throughput mRNA sequencing technology (RNA-Seq) that exploits the sensitivity and genome-wide resolving power of NGS platforms. This approach offers a fully quantitative measure of mRNA abundance that is particularly suitable for studying organisms where little is known about their transcriptome and a full genome chip is not commercially available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Ultimately, the challenge of applying RNA-Seq technology to plants found in the field is its sensitivity. RNA-Seq generates large datasets and interpretable patterns from field plants may be difficult to discern given that direct comparisons with plants grown under controlled environment conditions cannot be made. In this study we included natural accessions of <italic>Eutrema</italic> from Shandong and the Yukon and we compared inbred cabinet-grown Yukon and Shandong plants and Yukon plants sampled in the field. We hypothesized that 1) sequences would differ more between the two accessions, while Yukon individuals sampled in the field or raised in cabinets would show far fewer differences. This hypothesis was confirmed by an analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using transcriptomes of the Yukon plants (field and cabinet-grown) and Shandong plants (cabinet-grown). We hypothesized that 2) the gene expression results would differ between Yukon plants from the field site and growth cabinets, which represent radically different environments. While this prediction held true, the transcriptomes from Yukon and Shandong plants grown at the same time in the same growth cabinet were also very different emphasizing the important interaction between genotype and environment. We hypothesized that 3) transcriptomes from individual plants selected at random at a Yukon field site would be more variable compared to those of individuals selected from the same single-seed descent line and grown together under controlled conditions in growth cabinets. However, this expectation was not borne out. The pattern of gene expression for individual plants of a common genotype that originated from the same environment were similar regardless of where the plants had grown together, showing transcriptomes to be consistent between individual plants of a sample group. While one might anticipate the high sensitivity afforded by NGS to yield transcriptome data that is more difficult to interpret when genetic and environmental variation are uncontrolled variables, our study does not support this hypothesis. Instead, we found RNA-Seq to be a viable approach to compare gene expression patterns of <italic>Eutrema</italic> growing either in controlled environment chambers or <italic>in situ</italic> in the complex and changeable environment of the Yukon.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Plant selection and experimental design</title><p>Nine plants consisting of three individuals from each of three experimental groups were profiled by RNA-Seq. Transcriptomes derived from these plants were expected to display heterogeneity arising from differences between environmental exposure and genotype.</p><p>One group consisted of three plants selected in late June of 2005 from a field site approximately 40&#x000a0;km NW of Whitehorse in the Yukon Territory of Canada. Details concerning the soil composition, meteorological conditions and morphology of plants growing at this field site were reported by Guevara et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. <italic>Eutrema</italic> plants at this field site have an upright habit with rosette leaves being either very small or absent. For analysis, cauline leaves from randomly selected, individual plants of undetermined age were harvested from the field for transcriptome profiling and these samples are referred to as YF (Yukon Field) 1, YF2, and YF3.</p><p>A second group of three plants of the Yukon accession were grown in a controlled environment chamber under daylength conditions set to resemble a Yukon summer day (see Methods). <italic>Eutrema</italic> grown under these laboratory conditions have a prominent rosette [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Rosette leaves of three four week-old plants produced in growth cabinets were selected for transcriptome profiling and these samples are referred to as YC (Yukon Cabinet) 1, YC2, and YC3. Seeds from plants growing at the same Yukon field site were pooled and maintained as a bulked collection from which some seeds were used to establish inbred lines. Two of the plants in this group, YC1 and YC2, were products of single-seed descent from the same parent for five generations while the third, YC3, was grown from a randomly selected seed from the bulked pool.</p><p>The third group profiled was composed of three <italic>Eutrema</italic> plants of the Shandong accession. Plants were subjected to single-seed descent for four generations to increase their genetic homogeneity. Sibling Shandong <italic>Eutrema</italic> plants from a single-seed descent line were grown in the same cabinet and hence under identical conditions as the YC1 and YC2 samples. Rosette leaves of three four week-old Shandong chamber-grown plants were harvested for transcriptome profiling and these samples are referred to as SC (Shandong Cabinet) 1, SC2, and SC3.</p><p>The field plants (YF) and YC3 are not products of single-seed descent lines and hence were expected to show greater genetic heterogeneity than the inbred YC1 and YC2 plants. In terms of comparative genetic variability we expected that the greatest heterogeneity would be found between Shandong and Yukon plants. Thus use of the Shandong genotype provided a source of genetic variation and had the additional benefit in facilitating transcriptome assembly through access to its fully sequenced genome as a reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>RNA-Seq of <italic>Eutrema</italic> samples</title><p>Massively parallel sequencing of nine cDNA libraries generated from <italic>Eutrema</italic> leaf samples of individual plants was conducted on the Roche 454 GS FLX platform. When we began our transcriptome sequencing, a genome assembly for <italic>E. salsugineum</italic> was not available making the longer read lengths afforded by 454 technology advantageous for <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The draft genome releases of the Shandong accession of <italic>Eutrema</italic> have since aided our transcriptome assembly, allowing unambiguous association of individual sequence reads with <italic>Eutrema</italic> gene loci. Our RNA-Seq methodology therefore exemplifies a &#x0201c;mapping-first&#x0201d; or genome-guided transcriptomics approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The draft genome of the Shandong accession of <italic>Eutrema</italic> released by the Joint Genome Institute (JGI - <italic>Thellungiella halophila</italic> Genome Project 2011: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net/thellungiella.php">http://www.phytozome.net/thellungiella.php</ext-link>), shows the genome to be 243.1&#x000a0;Mb in size, distributed among 639 scaffolds with preliminary annotation available for 26,351 protein-coding loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) has also released a genome assembly of Shandong <italic>E. salsugineum,</italic> which is 234&#x000a0;Mb in size, distributed among 2,682 scaffolds. The predicted number of protein-coding genes in this assembly is 28,457 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this report the comparisons or citations to gene annotations, relative positions, and sequences are made with reference to the JGI draft genome release given its earlier availability as a public resource. We have since compared our mapped reads to both genome sequences and found negligible differences in the alignments produced. For example, of the total number of reads obtained from nine cDNA libraries, only 0.3% were aligned to the BGI genome release and not the JGI release.</p><p>Information concerning cDNA library sequencing and read alignments to the JGI draft genome is presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

The last column indicates the proportion of trimmed reads derived from the expression of rRNA genes in each library.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Trimmed reads derived from each library were aligned against the genome release using open-source GMAP software. GMAP is a splice-aware aligner that allows mapping of cDNA sequences against a reference containing introns and gaps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Alignments were categorized into three groups consisting of uniquely mapped reads, non-uniquely mapped reads, and unmapped reads that could not be aligned to any locus in the reference and, in view of this difficulty, were not considered further in our analyses (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The vast majority of cDNA sequences in each library (92.3 - 97.4%) aligned to a single location in the reference but a small number (1.7 - 3.6%) mapped to multiple locations. We predicted that many of the non-uniquely aligned cDNA reads were expression products of genes with members sharing extensive sequence identity. Interestingly, a large fraction of these reads (109,624/263,015 reads or 42% across all libraries) mapped to a single region on scaffold 14 of the JGI release. A custom annotation for this region (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1) shows that it includes a tandem array of five duplicated ribosomal RNA gene clusters with 5.8S, 18S, and 25S rRNA genes present in each cluster. The array of rRNA genes is a conserved genomic feature that is also present in a similar arrangement on chromosome 2 of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This array of rRNA was useful in estimating the level of rRNA transcripts contributing to our cDNA libraries prepared from polyadenylated mRNAs. On average, only 1.27% of the reads in each library were derived from rRNA (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), indicating that a vast majority of sequences were derived from mRNAs.</p><p>Genomic studies of geographically disparate accessions of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> have identified thousands of small genome-wide differences as well as more major genome rearrangements (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.1001genomes.org">http://www.1001genomes.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. For example, a fraction of the Col-0 reference genome is absent in the genomes of other accessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In our study, cDNA sequences were aligned to the draft genome assembly of the Shandong accession. Alignments of the Shandong-derived sequence reads (from SC1, SC2, and SC3) were well matched to the reference genome and only a small fraction (0.8-3.4%) of the total reads remained unmatched following alignment (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). We expected that reads derived from the Yukon accession would find less frequent agreement with the draft genome due to polymorphisms between the accessions. However, using this genome-guided RNA-Seq approach, the libraries derived from cabinet-grown and the naturally occurring Yukon <italic>Eutrema</italic> performed as well as the Shandong libraries with, on average, only 2.4% of the total reads from these sources remaining unmatched (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This outcome is consistent with a high degree of similarity with respect to gene composition and sequence identity between the genomes of the two accessions.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of previously unannotated genes supported by Yukon <italic>Eutrema</italic> transcripts</title><p>A total of 26,351 <italic>E. salsugineum</italic> protein-coding loci were annotated by JGI using transcript evidence from 1.6 million 454 cDNA reads (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net/thellungiella.php">http://www.phytozome.net/thellungiella.php</ext-link>). We reasoned that our <italic>Eutrema</italic> libraries comprising over 10 million reads would contain transcripts derived from non-abundantly expressed genes or environment-specific genes that have not yet been annotated. We used Cufflinks software in a reference-based transcript assembly approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and found read support that enriched the existing complement of annotated genes by 665 loci. Between JGI and this study, there is transcript support for 27,016 loci, a number that compares well with 28,457 predicted genes in the BGI Shandong <italic>E. salsugineum</italic> genome release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and 28,901 protein-coding genes for the closely related <italic>Eutrema parvulum</italic> (also known as <italic>T. parvula</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A summary of these newly annotated genes is presented in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>. A BLAST analysis of the 665 genes indicated that 344 (52%) have a match to an <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> gene and using Plant RefSeq and the <italic>E. parvulum</italic> databases we matched 34 more genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/plant">http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/plant</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This analysis left 287 (43%) genes of the 665 genes as unidentified based upon available information. Of the 665 newly annotated genes, expression associated with 101 was only detected in the Yukon-genotype transcriptomes of which 15 genes were only expressed in plants growing at the Yukon field site. Thus our RNA-Seq analysis of the Yukon accession that included plants found in the natural environment provided evidence for the expression of a number of genes in regions of the <italic>E. salsugineum</italic> genome for which transcript support was previously unavailable.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence polymorphisms in <italic>Eutrema</italic> accessions</title><p>We evaluated the extent of genetic diversity between the two accessions of <italic>Eutrema</italic> and among the Yukon laboratory and field plants. For this analysis we used a bioinformatics approach to identify SNPs and small insertions/deletions (InDels) in the RNA-Seq datafiles of our plant samples compared to the JGI reference genome sequence.</p><p>The mpileup function of SAMtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] was used to detect sequence differences within reads that aligned to a unique location in the JGI reference. At each candidate position, GATK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] software identified SNPs and InDels for each library. This initial set of 92,814 SNPs and 15,060 InDels was then subjected to filters to eliminate the number of differences that might be attributed to sequencing errors. Custom Perl scripts eliminated SNPs supported by fewer than five sequence reads across nine libraries and InDels with an mpileup quality score less than 999. Polymorphisms detected at a frequency supported by less than 1% of informative reads were also excluded from further analysis. The resulting set of high quality polymorphisms comprises 74,550 two-allele SNPs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>) and 1,429 two-allele InDels (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). We anticipate that future <italic>E. salsugineum</italic> genome releases will position the current suite of genes onto improved physical maps. With this prospect in mind, we have provided 100&#x000a0;bp of genomic sequence flanking each polymorphism listed so that they can be more easily located within the present as well as future <italic>E. salsugineum</italic> genome releases (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). While these polymorphisms were supported by the sequences of multiple reads, to ensure their accuracy we also subjected a group to testing by q-PCR and high resolution melting (HRM) analysis (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Of 40 loci containing accession-specific polymorphisms (33 SNPs and 7 InDels), HRM only failed to detect one polymorphism in an amplicon associated with a Class IV SNP (T&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;A, see Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Efforts to sequence this locus using traditional Sanger sequencing also failed so the status of this single SNP was unresolved for technical reasons. Thus our computational strategy identified SNP and InDel polymorphisms accurately enabling us to use the 74,550 SNPs to evaluate both the distribution of polymorphisms among genes and the genetic diversity between the <italic>Eutrema</italic> plants used in this study.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p><bold>A subset of </bold><bold><italic>Eutrema

A total of 16,454 were accession-specific SNPs in that they are associated with only one allele in all four Shandong plants (JGI reference, SC1, SC2, SC3) and only one alternative allele in all six Yukon plants profiled (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). There were also 240 InDels that delineated the Shandong accession from the Yukon accession (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). In a related context, Gan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] calculated the number of SNPs supported by RNA-Seq reads that differed between the TAIR 10 Col-0 reference and their genome assemblies for 18 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions as ranging from 57,604 SNPs in Can-0 to 118,965 SNPs in Po-0. Thus the number of SNPs we identified as differing between the two <italic>Eutrema</italic> accessions in this RNA-Seq study falls within the number of SNPs identified as distinguishing various <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions from Col-0.</p><p>Transcriptome profiling of multiple individuals by a reference-guided RNA-Seq approach provides adequate sequencing depth within coding regions to identify potential errors within the reference genome. The 101 Shandong-specific polymorphisms mentioned above could be genuine differences between closely related lines but they are also candidate loci that may represent errors in the JGI reference. We made use of the BGI Shandong <italic>E. salsugineum</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] reference genome and determined that, for 45% of the SNPs differing between the JGI genome release and the SC transcriptomes, the BGI reference sequence was identical to that of our SC transcriptomes. The remaining 55% of SNP-associated loci located in the BGI genome were in agreement with the JGI genome release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Given that these SNP-associated loci were supported by multiple sequence reads in each of three Shandong plants profiled, these Shandong-specific SNPs merit closer scrutiny as possible errors within the current genome releases.</p><p>The Shandong plants and two of the cabinet-grown Yukon plants (YC1 and YC2) were products of lines subject to a single-seed descent procedure to increase their genetic similarity. The number of SNPs (2,839) distinguishing the SC plants from the JGI reference is consistent with an expectation of high genome sequence similarity (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). In contrast, the plants at the Yukon field site were not subjected to deliberate homogenization strategies so we were surprised to find only 4,475 SNPs differing between the transcriptome sequences of cabinet-grown <italic>Eutrema</italic> (YC) and YF plants found growing in a natural Yukon habitat (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). We have no reason to believe that three randomly selected plants from the field site in 2005 and plants we self-pollinated to create inbred lines in the laboratory beginning in 2002 share the same pedigree. However, factors conducive for the development of a reproductively isolated and genetically homogenous natural population include the self-fertile nature of this plant and the patchy distribution of salt flats in the Yukon.</p><p>We used the frequency of SNP heterozygosity within individual plants as a means to quantify the extent of genetic variation between the three groups of natural and cabinet-grown <italic>Eutrema</italic> plants. By this criterion, SNP heterozygosity ranged from 1.5% to 2.6% within plants in the SC group, 5.4% to 7.5% in the YC group and 5.6% to 7.0% in the YF group (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). We believe that these are overestimates of heterozygosity because this metric assumes that each SNP is inherited independently. Nonetheless these results are similar to estimates of heterozygosity in populations of self-fertile <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> that average approximately 3% but can range from 1% to as high as 5% in some stands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Of particular note, the heterozygosity of the YC3 individual that was deliberately not subjected to single-seed descent was 7.3% and thus comparable to estimates for the Yukon single-seed descent line (YC1, YC2) and the natural field plants (YF) (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). The higher homozygosity within the Shandong plants (SC) may reflect a lower rate of outcrossing in the Shandong accession in comparison to the Yukon. However, the more likely explanation is that the Shandong <italic>Eutrema</italic> seeds we received were already inbred and we subjected them to multiple generations of single seed descent.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Heterozygosity of individual plants</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Plant</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Heterozygosity (%)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SC1<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">2.6<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SC2<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1.5<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SC3<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">2.5<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">YC1<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">7.5<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">YC2<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5.4<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">YC3<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">7.3<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">YF1<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">7.0<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">YF2<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">8.1<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">YF3</td><td align="center">5.6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>For each plant, the percentage of SNPs present as heterozygous alleles compared to the total number of SNPs was calculated. YF1, YF2, and YF3 plants were randomly selected from the field site; YC3 was derived from a bulked pool of seeds collected at the field site; SC1, SC2, SC3, YC1, and YC2 were derived from single seed descent procedures.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The results shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> provide an estimate of polymorphic differences between groups and support the conclusion that within-accession genetic variation is low. However, these comparisons reflect the pooled contributions of SNPs found in three individuals, making it possible that a single plant made a disproportionate contribution towards the estimated genetic heterogeneity. For example, while only 4,475 SNPs were identified between YC and YF transcriptomes, it is possible that the majority of those SNPs were due to differences in a single YF plant and this consideration would lead to a different conclusion about the genetic uniformity of the field plants. To assess the genetic diversity among the individuals within the three groups, we used a subset of SNP-associated loci from the 74,550 SNPs for which sequence coverage exceeded five reads in each of the three individual plants within a group. In this analysis we determined whether a given SNP-associated allele was shared (or not) by other plants within the group. The results of this analysis are shown in the Venn diagrams of Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The region of overlap in each of the Venn diagrams shows that the vast majority of SNPs were shared by all three plants within a given group (97.9% in YF, 98.9% in YC, and 99.6% in SC), indicating that the genetic diversity between individuals of a given group is very low. Within each group, Shandong plants had the fewest alleles associated with unshared SNPs (66 to 158) while field-grown Yukon plants had the most (328 to 678). We found no evidence that a single plant, whether in the field or the cabinet sample groups, had a disproportionate contribution of distinct SNP-associated alleles that were not shared by other plants in their respective group.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Genetic diversity within </bold><bold><italic>Eutrema </italic></bold><bold>accessions.</bold> Two-allele SNPs identified in this study were discriminated at a resolution of individual plants.

The first PC corresponds to the axis of greatest variation and all PCs, including PC1, describe sources of variation that are uncorrelated to each other.

Genes represented by grey points were expressed in multiple plant groups.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-14-578-3"/></fig><p>To interpret the biological significance of the PCs we examined the scores (red points), which are the values of each of the nine plant cDNA libraries (observations) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B,C). These biplots contain both the scores for the observations and loadings for the variables (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B,C). This approach allows us to identify genes having expression levels (greyscale points) that are highly positively or negatively correlated with a given PC. The extent of correlation between the expression level of a gene and a PC is indicated by the magnitude of their loadings as shown by the values on the PC axes. PC1 explains the majority of variance in the dataset (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). However, the scores for the nine plants for PC1 are similar. Expressed genes with high loadings for PC1 include Thhalv10019202m.g, the <italic>Eutrema</italic> orthologue of At5g38430, the locus encoding the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit. Not surprisingly, <italic>RBCS</italic> was the most abundantly expressed gene in every library at an average expression level of 12,425 reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM). In contrast, genes with low loadings for PC1 are those showing no or low expression in all plants. Taken together, these loading and score patterns suggest that PC1 describes transcript abundance irrespective of the plant source. To explore this interpretation, the median expression level across all transcriptome libraries was determined for each of the 27,016 genes (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>) and then the expression levels were divided into four equal bins based upon their magnitude relative to the median. Genes located in each bin were assigned a different gray-scale shade, producing a discrete gray-scale distribution pattern along the PC1 axis. Genes whose expression was not detected in this study are variables with the lowest loadings for PC1 while genes showing increasingly higher expression levels have progressively higher loadings for PC1 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B,C).</p><p>The score and loadings biplot of PC2 vs PC3 is shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D. The scores for the plants within each group cluster together but each group has distinct associations with PC2 and PC3. Scores for YF plants are positive for both PC2 and PC3. SC plants score negatively on PC2 and positively on PC3. YC plants cluster around zero on PC2 and score negatively on PC3. Thus together, PC2 and PC3 may explain a relatively small fraction of the total variance in the genome-wide expression data (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A) but they capture the majority of variance that distinguishes the plant groups from each other. Moreover, the clustering of the three individual plants within each group relative to the PC2 and PC3 axes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D) is significant in that it highlights the similarity in overall gene expression shown by individual plants comprising each group. While we expected that intentionally inbred, cabinet-grown plants would show highly correlated patterns of gene expression, we did not anticipate that plants randomly chosen from a field population in the Yukon (YF1, YF2, YF3) would be so similar with respect to this property (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D). The leaf transcriptomes obtained from individual plants in a wild population of <italic>Eutrema</italic> were as comparable to each other as those obtained from plants grown under protocols designed to control genetic and environmental variability and optimize reproducibility.</p><p>In contrast to PC1, the biological interpretation of the PC2 and PC3 axes is more complex given the large number of genes expressed, the low factor loadings associated with the majority of these genes and the fact that relatively few genes are strongly associated with PC2 and/or PC3. To address this challenge we used a variety of approaches to infer the biological meaning of PC2 and PC3. Thus we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and used this information to group SC, YC, and YF plants on the basis of similar and contrasting patterns of gene expression. We also plotted the PC scores as norms of reaction plots and the DEGs as heat maps to facilitate comparisons between the transcriptomes and help identify and interpret patterns associated with the PCs and expressed genes. Finally, we categorized DEGs using GO slim terms in order to associate the gene products with putative biological functions.</p></sec><sec><title>Accession- and location-associated patterns of gene expression in <italic>Eutrema</italic></title><p>Our biological interpretation of the significance of PC2 and PC3 comes, in part, from examining the class of genes that were only found to be expressed in a single group of plants (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D). Loadings for these genes are highly correlated with the scores for each of the YF, YC, and SC plant groups.

The second most frequent scenario was genes whose differential regulation proved significant in two pair-wise comparisons (1,287 genes; Categories 7 to 12 on Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). A third, smaller set of genes (33), had transcript expression levels for each of the plant groups that were significantly different from each other (Categories 13 to 17 on Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>).</p><p>Our PCA analysis shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D indicated that PC2 and PC3 best described the sources of variance between the three plant groups. In Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B-D the PC2 versus PC3 biplots are redrawn with genes highlighted using colored symbols representing their DEG categories (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). The DEGs shown on the biplots are not randomly distributed in that symbols relating to the different categories are grouped in discrete zones around the origin. This organization is best exemplified by the zonation seen in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C, showing the DEGs of Categories 7 through 12. The up-regulated genes of YF relative to both SC and YC (Category 7 <inline-graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-14-578-i1.gif"/>) have positive loadings on both PC2 and PC3 axes. In contrast, the down-regulated genes of YF relative to the other samples (Category 8 <inline-graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-14-578-i2.gif"/>) have negative loadings for both PC2 and PC3. This arrangement of DEGs around the origin is recapitulated for the remaining Categories (9 <inline-graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-14-578-i3.gif"/> and 10 &#x025ef;, 11<inline-graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-14-578-i4.gif"/> and 12<inline-graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-14-578-i5.gif"/>). Categories 11 and 12 describe genes that are differentially regulated in YC plants relative to both SC and YF plants and their loadings are associated primarily with PC3 and negligibly with PC2. Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D reiterates the association between YC and PC3 in that genes expressed only in YC plants and genes more highly expressed in YC1, YC2, and YC3 plants are all strongly associated with PC3.</p><p>Analogous observations provide insight into the variance associated with PC2. In Categories 1 <inline-graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-14-578-i6.gif"/> and 2<inline-graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-14-578-i7.gif"/> (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B), DEGs are defined by significant expression differences between YF and SC plants. In Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D (Categories 13 <inline-graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-14-578-i8.gif"/> and 15 <inline-graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-14-578-i9.gif"/>), YF and SC transcript expression is significantly different whereas the expression level for genes in YC plants is intermediate between YF and SC plants. In both of the above instances PC2 explains a source of variance in gene expression between the SC (more negative PC2) and YF (more positive PC2) transcriptomes that is not influenced by YC transcriptomes. Conversely, PC3 explains a source of variation uncorrelated to PC2 that describes differences in gene expression in YC plants. Both the zonation of DEGs around the origin of PC2 and PC3 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B-D) and the distribution of the scores, including their correlation within plant groups, emphasizes that PC2 and PC3 capture the main sources of variance between the plant groups despite their minor contribution (5.9%) to the total amount of variance in the dataset.</p><p>The associations between PC scores and transcriptome source can also be displayed as norm of reaction plots (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), with measures for the Yukon plants in growth cabinet and Yukon field, and measures for Shandong plants in growth cabinet. The plot of PC1 scores (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A) shows no variability among the nine genome-wide transcription profiles tested. This demonstrates the lack of genetic variability between accessions or in response to the environment between transcriptomes with respect to PC1. In contrast, plots of PC2 and PC3 scores show differences in transcriptome patterns between the plants within the cabinet indicating genetic differentiation, between accessions and between the Yukon plants grown in the field and Yukon plants grown in the cabinet, indicating phenotypic plasticity. For PC2, SC and YF scores were the most different with YC scores intermediate of SC and YF. PC2 scores from transcriptome profiles of SC and YC plants grown under common cabinet conditions are significantly different, indicating the two accessions differ genetically in the gene expression patterns contributing to PC2. However, PC2 scores also differ in global transcription patterns between YC and YF samples indicating that Yukon plants show plasticity in gene expression associated with PC2 in response to the environment. Interestingly, for PC3 the SC and YF scores are the same but YC and YF scores are significantly different, as are those for SC and YC. Thus PC3, like PC2, shows genetics as a source of variation between SC and YC transcriptomes, but many expressed genes with high loadings on PC3 do not differ between SC and YF samples. Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref> is a list of the 50 expressed genes with the greatest loadings contributing to the negative position of YC scores relative to YF and SC scores for PC3. A common attribute of genes on this list is that they show comparatively higher average transcript levels for YC samples relative to the low (or no) detected expression for the same genes in YF and SC samples.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Norm of reaction plots of PC scores.

This morphological difference between field and cabinet phenotypes precludes selective sampling of either cauline or rosette leaves from both sources. Thus the differences seen between YC and YF gene expression shown by PC3 could arise from developmental differences between cauline leaves of field plants and rosette leaves of cabinet-grown plants. To address this possibility, we prepared a transcriptome from cauline leaves of flowering bolts removed from cabinet grown Yukon plants. This sample was equivalent to the cabinet cauline leaf cDNA used as a control in comparisons with field samples for the microarray study reported by Guevara et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref> includes a column with transcript levels found for YC cauline leaves for comparison to the YC and YF expression values. For 38 of the 50 genes on this list, the transcript data shows that YC rosette and cauline leaves from cabinets share the same pattern of higher gene expression relative to YF and SC samples. This observation supports the proposal that PC3 describes variation in gene expression of Yukon leaves of cabinet-grown plants (cauline or rosette) and that these genes are not co-expressed to nearly the same extent in leaves of SC plants in the same cabinet or Yukon plants in the field. The biological significance of the genes comprising this list is difficult to determine as many have either a poorly defined role in plants or no known biological function.</p><p>PCA of the entire expression dataset, comprised of 27,016 genes in all nine samples, demonstrated that transcriptome profiles of the naturally occurring Yukon plants were as similar to each other and as reproducible as the profiles of the chamber-grown plants (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B-D). Using the smaller subset of transcriptionally variable genes we assessed the extent of variability in DEG expression among plants within and between sample groups. We anticipated that more irregularities in the expression of DEGs might be observed in the field-grown plants compared to the plants grown in controlled conditions. Expression estimates for each of the 2,989 DEGs within the nine libraries were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) to visualize their expression patterns within and between groups.</p><p>The dendrogram at the top of the heat map shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> groups together the datasets obtained from replicate plants with the expression profiles from cabinet-grown plants (YC and SC) sharing the same node. The HCA shows that the sample group clustering separately from the SC and YC plants is the YF group, indicating that there are fewer correlations between the transcript abundance of DEGs in cabinet and field-grown plants than between the cabinet-grown plants of the two accessions (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This interpretation is also supported by our observation that a greater number of genes were identified as differentially expressed when YC and YF transcriptomes were compared (1,138) versus the SC and YC transcriptome comparison (508) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Hierarchical clustering of genes differentially expressed in </bold><bold><italic>Eutrema</italic></bold><bold>.</bold> Heat map of 2,989 differentially expressed genes generated using complete-linkage clustering of Euclidean distances between log-normalized expression values.

The traces show discernible differences in gene expression between the three groups of plants but they produce a nearly identical pattern within each of the groups. The heat map provides a visual means to demonstrate that expression of DEGs was very consistent within each group of three plants. Thus while the plants at the field site may show a pattern of gene expression that distinguishes them in a cluster apart from the cabinet-grown plants, the traces associated with DEGs from the YF sample group show an internally consistent pattern of expression despite having been selected randomly from a single natural site in their native Yukon habitat. As discussed earlier, the Yukon field and cabinet plants show plasticity with respect to predominance of cauline and rosette leaves, respectively, so the array of differentially expressed genes between field and cabinet Yukon plants could represent differences between leaf type. Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S2 is a version of the HCA shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> that has been modified to include the cabinet-derived Yukon cauline leaf expression data corresponding to the 2,989 DEGs distinguishing the SC, YC, and YF transcriptomes from each other. The gene expression data associated with the cauline leaves from Yukon cabinet-grown plants are grouped in the same clade with the YC rosette leaves and apart from the cauline leaves of YF plants or rosette leaves of SC samples. This outcome is consistent with the results of Ma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] who used microarrays to compare expressed genes representing various organs of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. They show that cauline and rosette leaves collected from plants of varying age but grown under identical conditions of temperature, light intensity and duration have similar expression profiles with their corresponding datasets sharing the same clade as determined by average-linkage clustering with correlation distance analysis of relatedness. Thus we conclude that the pattern of DEGs given in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> represent differences attributable to variable genotype and/or environment and not different leaf types from plants of the same accession grown under comparable environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Biological significance of differentially expressed genes in <italic>Eutrema</italic></title><p>Using the extensive similarity between <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Eutrema</italic> genes we examined the predicted biological functions represented by the 2,989 genes identified as differentially expressed in comparisons between SC, YC, and YF sample groups using a GO analysis. In the first approach we identified a number of GO slim categories that were significantly over- or under- represented in comparisons made between the sample groups (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). For reference we also determined the predicted frequency of gene products in a given GO category using the entire <italic>Eutrema</italic> genome (27,016 genes).

Given this almost six-fold difference in irradiance, it is not surprising that &#x0201c;Photosynthesis&#x0201d; was the most over-represented GO term in the comparison between field-grown and cabinet-grown Yukon plants, and the most statistically significant category in the entire GO dataset.</p><p>Of 200 <italic>Eutrema</italic> genes that were found to be associated with the GO term &#x0201c;Photosynthesis&#x0201d; (GO:0015979), 71 show significant differences following pair-wise comparisons between SC, YC, and YF plants (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). If we confine our discussion to differences involving the YC and YF plants, there are only 52 genes relevant to this comparison. Interestingly, in every case the transcript abundance associated with YF plants exceeds that of YC plants (YF&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;YC) with the greatest fold change (ca 13-fold) found for a gene identified as ferric reduction oxidase 7 (orthologous to At5g49740); a representative from the small number of DEGs comprising the YF&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;SC&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;YC Category of Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>. Predictably, genes whose products have a longstanding association to photosynthesis are on this supplementary list (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>) including the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (At5g38410), the delta subunit (At4g09650) and gamma subunit (At4g04640) of the chloroplast ATP synthase and various light harvesting pigment proteins (Psb29, LIL3.2, PsbP to name a few). Interestingly, the genes whose transcripts consistently show an approximately three-fold or higher level of expression in the field relative to the cabinet encode many products associated with the chloroplast NAD(P)H complex (NDH), involved in photosystem 1 (PSI) photosynthetic cyclic electron transport and chlororespiration (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]). These products include NDH subunits NDF2/NDH45 (At1g64770), NDF4 (At3g16250), NDF6 (At1g18730), PPL2 (At2g39470; PsbP-like2, implicated in the repair of the NDH complex), chlororespiratory reduction 1 (CCR1; At5g52100), CRR3 (At2g01590) and CRR23 (At1g70760). The NDH associates with PSI in an interaction that is believed to involve LHCl (light harvesting chlorophyll) subunits Lhca5 and Lhca6, encoded by orthologues of At1g45474 and At1g19150, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The genes associated with these minor components of PSI both show statistically significantly higher transcript levels in field plants relative to chamber grown plants (YC or SC). PsbQ and PsbP proteins are also regarded as integral to NDH complex accumulation and transcripts associated with these products are also up-regulated in the field. A hypothesis consistent with these observed differences in transcript abundance is that the field plants have a heightened capacity for PSI cyclic electron transport that uses a chloroplast NDH-dependent route. The NDH complex represents one route for cyclic electron transfer around PSI in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. There is evidence that the NDH complex exerts its main effects under stress where it is believed to prevent the over-reduction of PSI electron acceptors, reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species and, in general, provide protection from photoinhibition (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]). Statistically significant associations between stress and DEGs were reiterated in comparisons between YF and YC transcriptomes in the &#x0201c;Response to stress&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Response to abiotic stimulus&#x0201d; categories (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). The stress-responsive differences supported through GO analyses are all the more convincing given the changeable and stressful conditions at the field site compared to the growth chambers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Light intensity at the field site can be variable but a far more consistent natural feature of the Yukon habitat where <italic>Eutrema</italic> grows is the presence of a highly saline soil. We previously reported that both the soil and <italic>Eutrema</italic> leaf tissue obtained from the field site contain high levels of Na<sup>+</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and the turgid leaves exhibited low solute potentials consistent with plants having undergone osmotic adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We therefore expected that GO terms concerned with responses to salt exposure would also emerge as statistically significant when characterizing the transcriptional difference between the field-grown plants and unsalinized cabinet-grown plants. In support of this expectation, we identified 490 <italic>Eutrema</italic> gene orthologues participating in the &#x0201c;Response to salt stress&#x0201d; (GO:009651) category (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>). However, this category was not identified as a statistically significant difference in any of the comparisons between plant groups. Of the 490 genes with some salt association, only 35 (7%) were differentially regulated in the comparison between YF and YC transcriptomes (19 genes up-regulated and 16 genes down-regulated in YF relative to YC). Thus only a small number of genes classically categorized as salt responsive were differentially regulated in Yukon plants exposed to a saline environment in the field. While this outcome may be surprising, it is entirely consistent with microarray experiments showing a smaller transcriptional change in <italic>Eutrema</italic> plants exposed to salt compared to other stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. It is possible that the actions of a few genes may orchestrate a large effect but, equally, it has been proposed that <italic>Eutrema</italic> genes required for salinity tolerance are constitutively expressed in this plant which is adapted to saline soil conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and therefore salt-responsive genes are not detected as DEGs. Regardless of the explanation, in contrast to the salt-inducible nature of many genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the response of <italic>Eutrema</italic> to salt is associated with the altered expression of relatively few genes as determined by both microarray and RNA-Seq approaches.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Due to its natural adaptations to harsh environments, <italic>Eutrema salsugineum</italic> has emerged as an important model for deciphering mechanisms of abiotic stress tolerance in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. One methodology employed by our group as well as others has been phenotypic, physiological and gene expression profiling of <italic>Eutrema</italic> in response to simulated stress treatments in growth cabinets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Experiments of this type offer certain advantages, including the ability to select or manipulate the genotype of the plants studied, apply stress treatments in a prescribed manner and replicate experiments under tightly controlled environment conditions. However, recent reviews have highlighted weaknesses in this approach, namely that growth chambers do not reproduce the complexity and dynamic nature of a natural environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Nonetheless, natural environments are precisely the conditions in which traits conferring stress tolerance must manifest themselves. The unexpectedly low content of the osmoprotectant proline in leaves of field plants was discussed earlier as one such anomalous response between field plants on saline soil and cabinet plants irrigated with salt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. With these considerations in mind, perhaps it is not surprising that few genes identified as key candidates for abiotic stress improvements as a result of growth cabinet studies have been used successfully to improve stress tolerance under actual field conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>In this study we sought to determine whether the sensitivity and capacity for genome-wide resolution in gene expression offered by RNA-Seq approaches could be satisfactorily deployed in the investigation of a native plant exposed to stressful conditions in its natural environment. For this approach we had to consider the possible influence of natural genetic and environmental variation on gene expression that could interfere with, or even prevent, the detection of traits of interest. This concern has received little attention in the literature. Existing gene expression profiling of plants growing in field plots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] or in a natural habitat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] has reflected the pooled contribution of multiple individuals, thereby masking the extent of natural variation that is actually present. Our results show little evidence for genetic diversity among the natural plants sampled in the Yukon, thereby ruling out genetic variation as a major source of transcriptional variation in these plants. Furthermore, RNA-Seq transcriptomes obtained from three, individual plants randomly selected at the field site were as similar to each other as those obtained from intentionally inbred chamber-grown plants, demonstrating that natural environmental variation did not impede the identification of genes showing similar patterns of expression. This agreement is particularly striking given the extent of phenotypic plasticity displayed by this species but perhaps not surprising in light of recent evidence that <italic>Eutrema</italic> has a core set of platform independent traits in addition to those showing plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Moreover we show, using a Yukon population of <italic>Eutrema</italic>, that a physiologically relevant record of exposure to a natural habitat can be captured and retrieved from the transcriptomes of relatively few individual plants. This RNA-Seq data is publicly available and can be queried using the BAR eFP browser, which will facilitate the study of environment- or accession-associated differences in gene expression. Gene expression profiles from an extremophile plant in its natural habitat provide an invaluable platform from which sophisticated data mining followed by physiological and genetic approaches can be used to identify and test the adaptive significance of plant stress responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plants and growth conditions</title><p>Cauline leaf tissue was harvested from mature, flowering Yukon <italic>Eutrema</italic> at a field site near Whitehorse, Yukon in 2005 as described in Guevara et al.
