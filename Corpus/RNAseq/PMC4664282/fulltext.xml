Such variation can result from several phenomena, including variable metabolic detoxification of the xenobiotic, and differential sensitivity of the molecular target of the toxin. Our goal is to genetically dissect variation in the response to xenobiotics, and characterize naturally-segregating polymorphisms that modulate toxicity. Here, we use the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR), a multiparent advanced intercross panel of recombinant inbred lines, to identify QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) underlying xenobiotic resistance, and employ caffeine as a model toxic compound. Phenotyping over 1,700 genotypes led to the identification of ten QTL, each explaining 4.5&#x02013;14.4% of the broad-sense heritability for caffeine resistance. Four QTL harbor members of the cytochrome P450 family of detoxification enzymes, which represent strong <italic>a priori</italic> candidate genes. The case is especially strong for <italic>Cyp12d1</italic>, with multiple lines of evidence indicating the gene causally impacts caffeine resistance. <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> is implicated by QTL mapped in both panels of DSPR RILs, is significantly upregulated in the presence of caffeine, and RNAi knockdown robustly decreases caffeine tolerance. Furthermore, copy number variation at <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> is strongly associated with phenotype in the DSPR, with a trend in the same direction observed in the DGRP (<italic>Drosophila</italic> Genetic Reference Panel). No additional plausible causative polymorphisms were observed in a full genomewide association study in the DGRP, or in analyses restricted to QTL regions mapped in the DSPR. Just as in human populations, replicating modest-effect, naturally-segregating causative variants in an association study framework in flies will likely require very large sample sizes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>A striking feature of biology is that within populations there is substantial interindividual phenotypic variation for traits of biomedical significance. Some fraction of this variation is due to environmental factors, but for many traits segregating genetic differences contribute significantly to phenotypic variation. Elucidating those causative sequence changes that result in complex trait variation is of central importance to biology, and requires the coordinated use of multiple approaches. Here we employ a multi-level strategy to dissect genetic variation in caffeine resistance in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, leveraging powerful genetic screening in a multiparental mapping panel, a genomewide association study, high-throughput RNA sequencing, and gene knockdowns using RNA interference. We identify several short genomic regions that collectively explain a substantial portion of the heritable variation for caffeine resistance, and find that several of these regions harbor members of known detoxification enzyme families. One such gene&#x02014;<italic>Cyp12d1</italic>&#x02014;shows increased expression on exposure to caffeine, and experimentally reducing gene expression leads to a reduction in caffeine resistance. We additionally show that variation in the number of copies of <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> is positively associated with resistance. These compelling lines of evidence imply that structural variation at this gene causally contributes to xenobiotic resistance in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant R01 OD010974 to SJM and ADL.

Animals are frequently exposed to toxins produced by potential prey and/or plant hosts as chemical defenses [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and are increasingly subject to pressures from human activity, such as pollution and the application of pesticides. Humans themselves are additionally exposed to an array of xenobiotics throughout their lives in the form of pharmaceuticals [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Given the evolutionary, agricultural, and medical relevance of the response and resistance to toxins, dissecting the genetic factors responsible for xenobiotic metabolism is essential.</p><p>Some of the best understood cases of xenobiotic response mechanisms come from insect populations or species that are able to withstand pesticides or toxic host chemical defense compounds. In some cases, certain individuals are simply insensitive to the xenobiotic due to a change in the structure, and therefore function, of the target of the toxin. For example, the Monarch butterfly (<italic>Danaus plexippus</italic>) is resistant to cardenolides, a class of secondary metabolites toxic to most animals, produced by their milkweed host plant. This resistance is due to at least one amino acid change in the Monarch Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase gene that prevents dietary cardenolides binding to the protein, making the protein insensitive to cardenolide inhibition [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In many other cases, prior to reaching its target, the toxin is metabolized into less harmful substances by the action of a sophisticated three step detoxification system [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the first step, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) act on the toxic compounds to decrease their toxicity. The products of these reactions subsequently become substrates for phase two enzymes, such as glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), which add large, charged side groups onto substrate molecules making them easier to excrete. Finally, membrane-bound ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters remove conjugated products from the cell. The Tobacco hornworm (<italic>Manduca sexta</italic>) is a facultative tobacco specialist, and detoxifies ingested nicotine by inducing P450 enzymes [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, as a result of a series of naturally-occurring gene duplication events and transposable element (TE) insertions, overexpression of the P450 <italic>Cyp6g1</italic> is primarily responsible for resistance to the insecticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>There are tens to hundreds of P450s, GSTs, UGTs, and ABC-transporters in eukaryotic genomes, and for most xenobiotics the precise series of enzymes responsible for their <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolism is unknown. We know there is substantial interindividual variation in the response to toxic compounds in animals such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> (e.g., [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]) and in the response to drugs in humans (e.g., [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]), but we rarely know which genes in the detoxification cascade segregate for functional variation, or understand the mechanisms by which genetic variation at these loci influences phenotype.</p><p>Here we characterize naturally-occurring alleles that contribute to resistance to caffeine in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Caffeine is one of the most widely used psychoactive drugs in humans, acting as a stimulant, and has been employed as a convenient model xenobiotic in <italic>Drosophila</italic> research, where it is known to induce the expression of a number of P450 and GST genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, larvae and adults [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, simply because a gene responds to caffeine challenge by increasing its expression does not necessarily imply the gene segregates for alleles that give rise to variable drug response.</p><p>A powerful method to identify natural alleles that contribute to variable xenobiotic response is to employ a large, stable set of highly-recombinant genotypes derived from a multiparental mapping population [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]) consists of a set of &#x0003e;1,700 genotyped RILs (Recombinant Inbred Lines) derived from a pair of highly-recombinant synthetic populations each founded by eight strains. Our previous work has demonstrated the high statistical power and excellent mapping resolution of this community resource [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and we have succeeded in resolving strong candidate genes contributing to nicotine resistance [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and the response to chemotherapeutic drugs [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>In this study we identify several QTL contributing to variation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult female lifespan during continuous exposure to 1% caffeine, a measure of caffeine resistance. Of the ten mapped QTL, five harbor strong <italic>a priori</italic> candidate detoxification genes (e.g., P450s). One of these genes&#x02014;<italic>Cyp12d1</italic>&#x02014;is implicated by our largest-effect QTL, and segregates for copy number variation (CNV) that strongly correlates with phenotype in the DSPR. Statistically accounting for the effect of this variant in a genomewide scan eliminates the QTL harboring the locus. In addition, <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> shows expression induction in response to caffeine, and RNAi knockdown of the gene significantly reduces resistance. A follow-up association scan using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]) reveals no significant associations after genomewide or QTL-specific multiple testing correction. Although not significant, the intermediate-frequency CNV at <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> shows a trend in the expected direction in the DGRP; lines harboring the duplication have marginally higher resistance on average (<italic>p</italic> = 0.065). If the effect of the CNV is modest, and particularly if additional functional alleles contribute to the QTL implicating <italic>Cyp12d1</italic>, the functional loci may be difficult to individually identify by association in a small sample of natural chromosomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Phenotypic Variation and Heritability</title><p>We measured the lifespan of female flies on 1% caffeine-supplemented media for 1,714 RILs from the DSPR, and 165 inbred lines from the DGRP, testing 16.5 females per genotype on average. There is substantial variation in phenotype in both mapping populations (<xref rid="pgen.1005663.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005663.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Figs). The average RIL mean phenotype in the pA DSPR panel is 37.3 hours (SD = 17.82), and in the pB panel is 35.5 hours (SD = 16.87). The average line mean phenotype in the DGRP is higher at 59.8 hours (SD = 20.80), although the range of the genotype means in the two mapping populations is similar (DSPR range = 6.8&#x02013;119.9 hours, DGRP range = 10.9&#x02013;112.7 hours). The broad-sense heritability of our measure of caffeine resistance is just over 50% in all populations (DSPR pA and pB = 0.53, DGRP = 0.51). Because we employed line means for mapping, thus reducing environmental variance, the broad-sense heritability of the mean measure of caffeine resistance is around 94% (DSPR pA and pB = 0.95, DGRP = 0.94).</p><p>We note that the contribution of variation in lifespan under control, drug-free conditions likely plays a minimal role in our measure of caffeine resistance. Ivanov <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] measured the lifespan of virgin females from the DGRP, and for the 155 lines common to both studies there is no statistically-significant correlation between lifespan and caffeine resistance line means (Pearson's <italic>r</italic> = 0.09, <italic>p</italic> = 0.27).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Mapping Caffeine Resistance QTL in the DSPR</title><p>Using the same approach we have used previously [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], we mapped QTL for caffeine resistance separately in both pA and pB DSPR mapping populations, identifying ten QTL contributing to resistance (<xref rid="pgen.1005663.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> and Tables <xref rid="pgen.1005663.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005663.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Three QTL are common to both populations (i.e., the 2-LOD support intervals overlap), one is unique to pA, and six are unique to pB. Given that the seven unique QTL generally explain smaller fractions of the heritability than the three common QTL (<xref rid="pgen.1005663.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), it is possible we simply had insufficient power to detect them in the other panel of RILs. However, we cannot discount the possibility that alleles underlying these panel-specific QTL are private to a given panel. Under the assumption the QTL mapped are independent, and act additively, the total variance explained by all mapped QTL is simply the sum of the individual estimated heritability values. On this basis, in the pA population the four mapped QTL explain 31.9% of the broad-sense heritability for the trait, while in pB the nine mapped QTL explain 50.2% of the heritability.</p><fig id="pgen.1005663.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005663.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Genome scan for caffeine resistance QTL.</title><p>Scans for population pA and pB are shown in blue and red curves, respectively, and the horizontal dotted lines represent population-specific genomewide 5% permutation thresholds (pA, LOD = 8.1; pB, LOD = 7.4).

None contain GSTs or UGTs.</p><p>If the locus responsible for each of the three shared QTL (Q1, Q2, and Q3) is the same in both panels, the causative gene should be present at a position implicated by <italic>both</italic> the pA and pB QTL LOD support intervals. For Q1 the area implicated by both mapped intervals is 500 kb, about half the width of the panel-specific intervals (<xref rid="pgen.1005663.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and harbors just 48 protein-coding genes.

In many cases it is difficult to clearly discriminate a pattern indicating that just two functional alleles, i.e., "high" and "low" resistance alleles, segregate at mapped loci.

Using PCR assays we found that DSPR founders A7, B1, B5, and B7 also possess these two gene copies, while the other 11 founders are single copy.

Considering individual RIL phenotypes, in both populations RILs with two copies of <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> survive significantly longer on caffeine than RILs with only one copy of this gene (Welch's <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 in each population; <xref rid="pgen.1005663.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>).

We took pA RILs with either very high or very low caffeine resistance, generated adult females heterozygous between lines of similar phenotype, and exposed groups of these flies both caffeine-supplemented and control media for short periods. Using heterozygous animals minimizes inbreeding effects that may contribute to gene expression, but does make the assumption that heterozygous progeny are phenotypically similar to their parents. Following RNA extraction we pooled samples within phenotypic class (high or low resistance) and treatment, and carried out RNAseq, generating genomewide expression measures for four conditions, and leading to four contrasts of interest (Low-control <italic>versus</italic> High-control, Low-caffeine <italic>versus</italic> High-caffeine, Low-control <italic>versus</italic> Low-caffeine, High-control <italic>versus</italic> High-caffeine). A total of 242 genes were differentially-expressed, i.e., survived a genomewide per-contrast FDR threshold of 5% in at least one contrast (<xref rid="pgen.1005663.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). At least 10% of these genes are named members of recognized detoxification families, including P450s (16 genes), GSTs (5 genes), UGT genes (3 genes), and ABC transporters (5 genes).</p><p>The first two contrasts allow identification of genes having expression differences between genotypes with different phenotypes; 34 and 37 genes significantly change in expression between Low and High resistance genotypes on control food and caffeine-supplemented food, respectively. Eleven of these genes are shared between contrasts, and for all eleven the direction of the expression change is preserved over contrasts. The second two contrasts allow us to identify genes that change in expression on exposure to caffeine; in the Low (High) resistance genotype 178 (125) genes are differentially-expressed between control and caffeine food. One-hundred and one of these genes are shared between contrasts, and again the direction of the expression changes are consistent between genotypes; caffeine either induces expression in both genotypes or represses expression in both. Willoughby <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] previously used a detoxification gene-specific microarray to identify 16 genes (11 P450 genes, 5 GSTs) upregulated in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> third-instar larvae on exposure to caffeine. Ten of these 16 are induced in response to caffeine in both High and Low DSPR resistance genotypes, validating our RNAseq, and suggesting adults and larvae may respond to caffeine challenge via similar mechanisms.</p><p>Since our RNAseq study employed pA-derived genotypes, expression changes at genes within QTL intervals mapped in the pA population (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q9) are of particular interest. Collectively, seven genes under these QTL show a change in expression that survives a genomewide multiple-testing threshold (5% FDR) in at least one experimental contrast (<xref rid="pgen.1005663.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Four of these genes are annotated, but un-named genes with limited functional information in FlyBase [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. One additional gene, <italic>Cpr49Ae</italic>, under Q3 produces a constituent of chitin, and is expressed at higher levels in genotypes that are more resistant to caffeine (<xref rid="pgen.1005663.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). As a class, cuticle genes were found to be enriched among the set of genes overexpressed in a <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> strain resistant to &#x003b1;-amanitin, a toxin produced by a number of species of mushroom [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Higher expression of <italic>Cpr48Ae</italic> in caffeine resistant genotypes could plausibly be responsible for providing additional surface protection against xenobiotic exposure. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that <italic>Cpr48Ae</italic> is implicated only by Q3 mapped in pA, and is not present within the interval mapped in pB.</p><table-wrap id="pgen.1005663.t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005663.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Differential expression of genes beneath QTL mapped in pA.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pgen.1005663.t002g" xlink:href="pgen.1005663.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">FPKM <xref rid="t002fn001" ref-type="table-fn">

Heritability of resistance to caffeine is around 50% in all mapping panels queried in this study, and we succeeded in mapping a number of QTL that collectively explain between a third and half of the broad-sense heritability. Aside from those QTL mapping to centromeric regions, we map QTL to genomic intervals containing fairly modest numbers of protein-coding genes (26&#x02013;122), and in those cases where a QTL is mapped to the same location in the pA and pB RIL panels, we can further refine the list of the most likely candidates to those genes implicated by both intervals (i.e., 48, 36 and 10 genes for Q1, Q2, and Q3, respectively). Dissection with this level of resolution is difficult with standard, 2-parental QTL mapping using a single generation of meiotic recombination (i.e., using an F<sub>2</sub> or backcross mapping design), and can only reasonably be achieved for linkage mapping designs employing populations subjected to multiple rounds of meiotic recombination (e.g., [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]).</p><p>Short QTL mapping windows facilitate the identification of true causative gene(s), and in this study our ability to suggest plausible functional loci was additionally enhanced by the nature of our target phenotype. Genes involved in metabolic detoxification pathways represent strong <italic>a priori</italic> candidates to harbor segregating variation contributing to caffeine resistance. Indeed, four caffeine resistance QTL harbor P450 genes (Q1&#x02014;<italic>Cyp310a1</italic>, Q2&#x02014;<italic>Cyp12d1</italic>, Q3&#x02014;<italic>Cyp301a1</italic>, Q9&#x02014;<italic>Cyp6d5</italic> and <italic>Cyp313a1</italic>), many of which appear to be involved in detoxification [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and these present excellent targets for future research to identify the precise sequence variants impacting resistance to caffeine. Our mapping results, in combination with RNAseq and RNAi data, imply that a significant fraction of natural variation in resistance to caffeine is due to metabolic detoxification driven by changes in P450 genes (see also [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]).</p><p>The strongest candidates from our study are <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> and <italic>Cyp6d5</italic>. These loci are present within QTL intervals (<italic>Cyp12d1</italic> is additionally present within QTL mapped in both pA and pB mapping panels), show expression induction in the presence of caffeine (<xref rid="pgen.1005663.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and a reduction in resistance on RNAi gene expression knockdown (<xref rid="pgen.1005663.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). In addition, a number of previous studies have shown effects of these loci consistent with a role in xenobiotic metabolism: Both genes are expressed in the larval midgut [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], a likely site of xenobiotic metabolism, both have been shown to be induced by caffeine and phenobarbital [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and silencing both genes alters downstream metabolism of caffeine [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>We also show that the copy number variation segregating at <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] associates with our caffeine resistance phenotype in the DSPR RILs. Gene duplications are known to be important contributors to complex variation (e.g., [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]), and evidence from other studies demonstrates that structural variation at P450 genes can be associated with toxin resistance. For instance, an allelic series of CNV events and TE insertions at <italic>Cyp6g1</italic> impacts DDT resistance in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], although in this same study no association was seen between <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> copy number and DDT resistance. In the DGRP, the <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> CNV shows an effect on caffeine resistance in the same direction as in the DSPR, though this trend is not significant at the 5% level (<italic>p</italic> = 0.065). Heterogeneity in the genetic architecture of caffeine resistance across mapping panels could explain the disconnect among studies, with copy number at <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> positively, and causally, associating with resistance in the DSPR but not in the DGRP. Alternatively, the CNV could be in strong LD with the true causative variant in the DSPR, whereas these events may not be in LD in the DGRP. Notably however we did not identify any other associations around <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> in the DGRP that could represent this indirect association. Given the multiple lines of evidence supporting an effect of the <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> locus, it remains highly likely that this gene is involved in caffeine resistance. Future targeted fine-mapping and/or functional genomics work will be required to localize the causative variant(s) in the <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> region that lead to natural variation in caffeine resistance.</p><p>Other P450s implicated (<italic>Cyp301a1</italic>, <italic>Cyp310a1</italic>, and <italic>Cyp313a1</italic>) in our mapping did not show changes in expression, either between susceptible or resistant genotypes, or between control and caffeine-supplemented media (<xref rid="pgen.1005663.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Dataset</xref>). This may imply that the effect of these genes on variable caffeine resistance is not regulatory in origin, and thus cannot be captured by RNAseq. Alternatively, overall expression levels may be too low&#x02014;which is likely true for <italic>Cyp301a1</italic> (FPKM = 1.88&#x02013;2.24) and <italic>Cyp310a1</italic> (FPKM = 0.52&#x02013;0.67)&#x02014;and any expression differences may be subtle, precluding the identification of significant expression changes without high levels of biological replication, or by carrying out RNAseq on the likely tissues in which the detoxification process takes place (e.g., [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]). However, without further validation it is not possible to exclude the possibility that these P450 genes are not the causative loci, and instead are merely closely linked to the true caffeine resistance genes.</p><p>For the six QTL not containing P450s, all of which have modest effects and were mapped only in the pB panel of DSPR RILs, it is difficult to suggest likely causative genes solely from the lists of implicated loci. QTL Q8 does harbor a carboxylesterase, <italic>Est-Q</italic>, that is known to show expression in the larval midgut, a site of xenobiotic metabolism [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, while this is a plausible candidate gene, because Q8 implicates a total of 398 genes, other evidence for a role in caffeine resistance would be desirable prior to any attempt to functionally validate this gene. Similarly, the <italic>Smc5</italic> gene, shown to be required for resistance to caffeine exposure during development [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] is also present within Q8, and remains a plausible candidate. The genes <italic>cnc</italic>, <italic>Hr96</italic>, and <italic>Keap1</italic> are known to regulate the transcriptional response to xenobiotic challenge in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and <italic>ERR</italic> is associated with the regulation of a number of P450 genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. However, none of these genes are located under the caffeine resistance QTL we map here, suggesting that natural variation in the regulation of the overall transcriptional response to xenobiotics is not strongly involved in caffeine resistance, at least in our assay. Gustatory receptors have been shown to be involved in the avoidance of noxious substances, and <italic>Gr66a</italic> and <italic>Gr93a</italic> are required to avoid caffeine ingestion [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Neither of these genes are implicated by our mapped QTL, although other members of the family are present in mapped intervals (<italic>Gr47b</italic> is present within the Q2 interval mapped in pB, and <italic>Gr77a</italic> is present under Q8).</p><p>The absence of clear candidate genes underlying mapped QTL is emblematic of the challenge facing most linkage mapping studies. Here, we used a combination of RNAseq and RNAi to validate the effects of certain P450 genes on caffeine resistance, and to refine our list of potential genes for those QTL without obvious a <italic>priori</italic> candidates. Moving from causative genomic regions to the true causative sites is an ongoing challenge for mapping studies. Combining multiple sources of data to provide several lines of evidence supporting candidate loci may prove generally valuable to resolve functional loci within mapped genomic windows, and data on the positions of QTL from this study represent the starting point for such exploration (Tables <xref rid="pgen.1005663.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and S2).</p><p>A goal of our research is not only to identify the causative genes, but also to identify the causative sequence variants, and we employed the DGRP association mapping panel to this end [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Using a similar phenotyping strategy to that employed in the DSPR, and a straightforward GWAS analysis [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], we found no genomewide significant associations after controlling for multiple tests. This result is likely explained by the low power of the DGRP on a genomewide scale: With 158 lines and a genomewide significance threshold of <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>, the power to find an intermediate-frequency causative polymorphism (minor allele frequency, MAF = 0.4) that explains 10% of the broad-sense heritability is just 3% (see [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] for description of power calculation).</p><p>Due to the lack of power for <italic>de novo</italic> identification of associations in a small GWAS panel, we instead attempted to validate associations within intervals implicated by DSPR QTL, and find associations directly at the six P450 genes suggested by our study.

Thus, power deficits in the DGRP may not entirely explain the lack of overlap between findings in the DSPR and DGRP.</p><p>A lack of overlap between the DSPR and DGRP might be expected under a situation in which we have overestimated the heritability explained by QTL mapped in the DSPR. If true QTL effects are much smaller than we estimate (<xref rid="pgen.1005663.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), power to validate such effects is in turn reduced in the DGRP. Beavis [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] showed that the effects of mapped QTL tended to be overestimated, with the greatest overestimation associated with experiments employing small numbers of samples. Given that the sample size for each DSPR panel was &#x0003e;800 genotypes, and our power to map QTL contributing 5% to variation is over 80% [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], we anticipate that Beavis effects will not be large (see [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and Figure 15.8 in [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]). Nonetheless, work on the Beavis effect [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] has focused on two-way crosses involving a single-generation of meiotic recombination, and there has been no exploration of the expected magnitude of the Beavis effect in highly-recombinant, multiparental mapping populations.</p><p>One possible reason for the failure to find associations in the DGRP within mapped QTL intervals could be that causative variants present in the DSPR are absent in the DGRP. Variants at intermediate frequency will typically be shared by both panels, and given sufficient power, should replicate. Rare variants will be shared less often, and will only replicate some of the time. Those SNPs present in two or more DSPR founders are found in the DGRP &#x0003e;91% of the time, while those SNPs private to a single DSPR founder are seen in the DGRP ~70% of the time (see DSPR founder SNP data from FlyRILs.org and DGRP variant data from dgrp2.gnets.ncsu.edu). In addition, founder means at QTL do not show a pattern consistent with a single founder having a private allele (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005663.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005663.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Thus, there is limited evidence that the variants responsible for our QTL are unique to the DSPR.</p><p>A related possibility is that causative variants have very different frequencies in the DSPR and DGRP. Population-based association mapping approaches struggle to identify low frequency causative variants [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Whereas provided the minor allele is captured among one of the founders, a multiparental mapping population has good power to find a low frequency causative variant [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus, DSPR QTL generated by rare causative loci may not replicate in the DGRP. One piece of evidence against this possibility is the observation that Q1, Q2, and Q3 were all mapped in both DSPR panels. This implies these QTL are not due to rare causative variants present solely in one panel of the DSPR, and suggests the causative variants underlying these QTL are likely present at intermediate-frequency in the DGRP. For instance, the frequency of the duplication allele at the plausible causative CNV at the <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> gene within Q2 is 12.5% among DSPR pA founders, 37.5% among pB founders, and 21.2% among the DGRP lines. Since we do not implicate a causative polymorphism for all other QTL we map in the DSPR it is not possible to determine whether the (unknown) polymorphisms responsible have similar frequencies in the DGRP.</p><p>A final possibility for our failure to replicate our QTL mapping results in the DGRP is suggested by the observation from a number of different multiparental mapping studies that QTL frequently segregate for multiple alleles [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Similarly, the strain effects for some of the QTL we map here do not show a clear pattern indicative of biallelic QTL simply segregating for a single "high" and "low" allele (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005663.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005663.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). A multiparental panel tests the effect of a local haplotype on phenotype, integrating over any causative variants in a short genomic window. So if QTL mapped in the DSPR are routinely generated by the combined action of multiple variants, each with very small effects, the power to identify any of these individually in the DGRP will be extremely limited. Detection of very subtle effect, intermediate-frequency causative variants, contributing &#x0003c;5% to the natural variation will require massive sample sizes as is common in the human genetics community (e.g., [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]). If instead the multiple causative variants present at genes contributing to polygenic trait variation are all rare, as is the case for genes leading to single-gene, Mendelian disorders, typical GWAS analytical approaches are very poorly powered to detect such genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we have used the DSPR to map QTL that collectively explain a large fraction of the natural variation for caffeine resistance in flies. Four of these QTL map to genomic regions containing members of the large family of cytochrome P450 detoxification enzymes. These loci present excellent candidates to harbor variant(s) contributing to phenotypic variation, and for three of these loci&#x02014;<italic>Cyp6d5</italic>, <italic>Cyp12d1</italic>, and <italic>Cyp301a1</italic>&#x02014;we validate their effects on caffeine resistance via RNAseq and/or RNAi, suggesting an important role for variation in metabolic detoxification in the control of caffeine resistance. In addition, our data suggests that the number of copies of <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> is a strong determinant of caffeine resistance. We were unable to resolve any additional candidate causative sequence changes by association in a small panel of natural chromosomes, likely due in part to concerns related to power, and potentially as a result of our QTL being generated by the combined action of multiple, small-effect causative alleles. Nonetheless, within each interval implicated by a QTL, tens to hundreds of variants show associations at nominally-significant levels (e.g., <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). If some of these modest-effect associations could be validated in an independent, large association mapping panel this would provide strong evidence for their causative role in affecting phenotypic variation. Ultimately, for strong candidate regions, in the future it will be possible to employ CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to directly compare alleles at candidate loci in an otherwise identical genetic background to localize regions, and ultimately nucleotide variants directly contributing to phenotypic variance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Mapping Populations</title><p>To map QTL for caffeine resistance we used RILs from the DSPR (FlyRILs.org). Full details of the mapping panel, its development, the analytical methods employed to map QTL, and simulations supporting the power and resolution of the approach have been described previously [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Briefly, the DSPR consists of two panels of &#x0003e;800 RILs (pA and pB). Each set is descended from an advanced generation intercross among eight highly-inbred founder lines, seven of which are specific to a single panel (A1-A7 or B1-B7), with one is common to both panels (AB8). Each intercross population was maintained as a pair of independent replicate subpopulations (pA1, pA2, pB1, pB2) at large population size for 50 generations, after which RILs were generated via 25 generations of full sibling mating. The 15 founder lines have been resequenced, and the RILs genotyped via Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD) tags. These data, along with a hidden Markov model (HMM), allowed the underlying mosaic haplotype structure of each RIL to be determined at a fine scale.</p><p>To carry out the GWAS we used strains from the DGRP, a set of inbred lines descended from gravid females caught at a single collection location (Raleigh, NC, USA), and inbred via 20 generations of full sibling mating. DGRP lines were purchased from the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (flystocks.bio.indiana.edu/). The lines have been fully resequenced, and molecular variation in the panel has been described [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], along with the computational pipeline used to make variant calls [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Caffeine Resistance Assay</title><p>Flies from each genotype were allowed to lay eggs for up to 48 hours on standard cornmeal-yeast-molasses food in regular narrow, polystyrene fly vials, and adults were cleared to maintain a roughly equal density of eggs across experimental vials. Eight days after the start of egg laying, any newly emerged adults were cleared from the experimental vials, and two days later 20&#x02013;25, likely mated female flies were harvested from each vial under CO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia. These flies were kept as groups on standard media and allowed to recover for 24 hours prior to caffeine challenge.</p><p>Our measure of caffeine resistance for a genotype is taken as mean lifespan on media supplemented with 1% caffeine (C0750, Sigma), the same concentration as employed in a previous study of caffeine resistance variation in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To increase throughput, and provide for relatively automated data collection, we made use of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Activity Monitoring System (DAM2, TriKinetics, Inc.). Twenty-four hours before the start of the assay we made cornmeal-yeast-dextrose media, adding caffeine at ~50&#x000b0;C to minimize any heat-induced degradation. We replaced the molasses from our typical culture medium with dextrose to achieve better batch-to-batch reproducibility since small volumes of molasses proved difficult to dispense accurately. The molten media was poured into 100mm diameter petri dishes and allowed to set for 2&#x02013;3 hours. We pushed the ends of large bundles of polycarbonate activity monitor tubes (5mm diameter &#x000d7; 65mm length) into the media, filling each tube to a height of ~10mm, cleaned the tubes to remove excess media, and sealed the food plug in each tube with molten paraffin wax. On the day of the assay we aspirated individual, 1&#x02013;3 day old experimental females into monitor tubes without anesthesia, capped the tubes with small foam plugs cut from Droso-Plugs (Genesee Scientific Corporation), and inserted tubes into monitors. All experimental individuals were reared and assayed at 25&#x000b0;C and 50% relative humidity on a 12 hour light/12 hour dark cycle.</p><p>The time when experimental flies were introduced to caffeine food in monitor tubes was recorded using a custom Excel macro (Microsoft Corporation), facilitated by arbitrary barcodes on experimental vials and monitors. Activity data was recorded every minute for six days for each experimental block using the DAMSystem3 data collection software (TriKinetics, Inc.), and any permanent cessation of activity was interpreted to be a result of fly death. The data were filtered to remove animals with very low activity levels from the start of the assay, presumably due to damage during aspiration into monitor tubes, and the time until death on caffeine food for each fly was extracted using a series of custom scripts written in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org">www.R-project.org</ext-link>).</p><p>The above assay was carried out on 1,714 DSPR RILs (853 pA and 861 pB lines) and 165 DGRP lines across 37 experimental blocks. For 1,623 DSPR and 159 DGRP lines we generated a single experimental vial of flies, and tested 16 females from that vial in a single experimental assay block. For a small minority of lines we independently tested 16 flies in each of two blocks, and the correlation between means calculated for each block is high (Pearson's <italic>r</italic> = 0.89, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup>), giving us confidence in our phenotypic measurements.

In essence, for each region in each RIL an HMM is used to assign a probability that the genotype is one of 36 possible homo- or heterozygous founder genotype combinations. Subsequently we assume that the very small number of heterozygous states we find are intermediate between the respective pair of homozygous states, generating eight additive probabilities per position. We then regress the mean line phenotype on these eight probabilities, analyzing the pA and pB panels separately. We did not include a subpopulation covariate since there was no significant difference between the two pA or pB subpopulations in mean RIL caffeine resistance (pA, Welch's <italic>t</italic> = 1.8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.06; pB, Welch's <italic>t</italic> = 1.9, <italic>p</italic> = 0.06). Following Churchill and Doerge [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] we use 1,000 permutations of the data to find appropriate genomewide significance thresholds for QTL identification. We used 2-LOD support intervals to estimate the true positions of causative loci, which simulations suggest correspond to 93&#x02013;94% confidence intervals for our experimental design, sample size, and mapped QTL effect sizes [<xref rid="pgen.1005663.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>We note that there is a clear visual, positive correlation between line mean phenotypes and within-line variance (<xref rid="pgen.1005663.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).

However, such a transformation does not change the genomewide likelihood profiles, or alter the QTL we map, and we only report analysis based on the raw, untransformed dataset here.</p><p>To account for any effect of the CNV at <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> we performed a similar genomewide scan for QTL as described above, but additionally included a covariate describing the CNV status of each RIL. For this analysis we only used those RILs for which we could be confident of the CNV status, i.e., where the founder allele at the gene was estimated with at least 95% certainty. This resulted in a reduction in the sample size for mapping from 853 to 803 RILs in pA, and from 861 to 812 RILs in pB.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Genomewide Association Mapping in the DGRP</title><p>Phenotype means for 158 DGRP strains assayed were provided to the Mackay lab's web-based analytical engine (dgrp2.gnets.ncsu.edu) to carry out a GWAS using nearly 2 million common (minor allele frequency &#x0003e; 0.05) SNP and non-SNP variants identified in the panel.

From each cross, we collected 2&#x02013;3 day old adult female <italic>trans</italic>-heterozygous progeny under CO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia, allowed the flies to recover for 24 hours, then exposed flies from each genotype either to control food or to 1% caffeine food for 4 hours. No flies died during this short exposure. Flies from each genotype and treatment were then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was isolated from each sample using TRIzol reagent (15596&#x02013;018, Life Technologies). Equal amounts of RNA from each sample were then pooled within each phenotype/treatment combination: susceptible genotypes/control food, susceptible genotypes/caffeine food, resistant genotypes/control food, and resistant genotypes/caffeine food. Ultimately, each of these four pooled samples contained RNA from ~100 experimental females, and haplotypes from 18 pA RILs. The four pooled samples were cleaned through RNeasy Mini columns (74104, Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocols, used to generate Illumina TruSeq RNAseq libraries, and sequenced over four lanes of an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument to generate single-end 50bp reads (Genome Sequencing Facility, KU Medical Center).

Q2&#x02014;the QTL that harbors <italic>Cyp12d1</italic>&#x02014;disappears in both panels, suggesting much of the effect of that QTL is due to the CNV and/or factors in LD with this variant. Q3 is now only identified in pB, and is absent in pA. The peak at Q4 is also absent. Finally, a peak towards the end of 3R in pA (3R:21960000..22250000), that was just below the significance threshold in our original analysis, is now significant.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1005663.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1005663.s006"><label>S6 Fig</label><caption><title>Effect of CNV on <italic>Cyp12d1</italic> expression in female heads.</title><p>King et al.
