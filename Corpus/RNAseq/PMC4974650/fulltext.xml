Most of these hyperproliferative skin changes improve when a MEK inhibitor is co-administered, as it blocks paradoxical MAPK activation. Here we show how the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib accelerates skin wound healing by inducing the proliferation and migration of human keratinocytes through extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and cell cycle progression. Topical treatment with vemurafenib in two wound-healing mice models accelerates cutaneous wound healing through paradoxical MAPK activation; addition of a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor reverses the benefit of vemurafenib-accelerated wound healing. The same dosing regimen of topical BRAF inhibitor does not increase the incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in mice. Therefore, topical BRAF inhibitors may have clinical applications in accelerating the healing of skin wounds.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

Replicate cultures with or without vemurafenib were placed in an incubator with an automated microscope analyzer to record the number of nucleated cells populating the original scratch region over time. Vemurafenib enhanced the covering of the scratch at 6, 8 and 12&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movies 1 and 2</xref>). Vemurafenib induced both proliferative and migratory effects on HEKa cells <italic>in vitro</italic> as combination cultures containing mitomycin C, a mitosis inhibitor, or NSC 295642, an inhibitor of cell motility, abolished both effects of vemurafenib using an assay in which migration and growth were initiated by removal of a central space sealant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). The enhanced proliferation and migration was inhibited by adding trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, to the vemurafenib-treated cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p>Three-dimensional soft agar assays showed proliferation of HEKa colonies upon exposure to vemurafenib, while the <italic>BRAF</italic><sup><italic>V600E</italic></sup> mutant melanoma line M249 had the expected opposite effect of decrease in colonies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>).

Furthermore, in the presence of vemurafenib, the proliferative marker Ki67 decreased in M249 melanoma cells while it increased in HEKa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Vemurafenib enhances and trametinib inhibits wound healing</title><p>We used two cutaneous wound-healing murine models to test the effects of vemurafenib to improve the healing of skin wounds. In an incisional wound-healing mice model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), vemurafenib or vehicle control was applied topically every other day for seven doses in eight mice per group. On day 14, the gain in wound tensile strength (WTS, in gram force per 2&#x02009;mm (gf per 2&#x02009;mm)) was analysed using a tensiometer. In three independent replicate experiments (eight mice per group in each experiment; seven strips per wound), vemurafenib-treated mice significantly improved WTS compared with vehicle-treated controls (52&#x00025;, 33&#x00025; and 42&#x00025;, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001 by <italic>t</italic>-test for all three experiments; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The administration of trametinib in addition to vemurafenib reduced the WTS by 51&#x00025; compared with when using vemurafenib alone (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001 by <italic>t</italic>-test). Trametinib on its own inhibited wound healing to a point where the skin wound closure was too compromised and the WTS could not be assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,d</xref>). The area of the wounds and their surroundings were analysed histologically by two pathologists blinded to the study groups (RRH and AJC). Vemurafenib-treated wounds displayed an accelerated proliferative stage of wound healing as evidenced by quantitating the extent of epidermal hyperplasia on both sides of the healing wounds. No re-epithelialization was observed in the trametinib alone and vemurafenib plus trametinib groups at this time point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Vemurafenib enhances re-epithelialization</title><p>In an excisional wound-splinting model in Balb/c mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, we induced 6-mm round wounds on the back of mice; splinting rings were tightly adhered and sutured to the skin around the wounds, preventing wound closure caused by skin contraction (representative images in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Vemurafenib (2&#x02009;mg) or DMSO was applied on the wounds on days 0, 2 and 4, and per cent wound closure was sequentially measured. The wounds treated with vemurafenib showed a significantly higher percentage of wound closure compared with the ones treated with vehicle on days 2, 6 and 14 (<italic>P</italic>=0.004, <italic>n</italic>=6; <italic>P</italic>=0.02, <italic>n</italic>=4; <italic>P</italic>=0.0002, <italic>n</italic>=6, respectively, by <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>).

Compared with controls, the healing process in the presence of vemurafenib was accelerated showing re-epithelialization by day 6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). The skin surface integrity was re-established by day 14 in the vemurafenib-treated wounds, whereas remodelling and dermal reparative fibrosis was delayed in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The number of pERK&#x0002b; and Ki67&#x0002b; cells in the wounds treated with vemurafenib was statistically significantly higher by day 14 compared with the control group (<italic>P</italic>=0.02 by <italic>t</italic>-test; <italic>n</italic>=4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>), demonstrating paradoxical MAPK leading to enhanced epithelial cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Vemurafenib upregulates MAPK and wound-healing-related signatures</title><p>To further characterize epithelial skin repair, the skin samples obtained from the incisional wound-healing model were analysed by RNASeq. The list of differentially expressed genes on day 2, 6 and 14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>) was compared with published data for the transcripts that were differentially modulated by blocking oncogenic MAPK signalling downstream of mutated BRAF<sup><italic>V600E</italic></sup> using BRAF inhibitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, and to genes within the gene ontology term &#x02018;wound healing' (GO:0042060)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.

A more pronounced decrease of both the BRAF<sup><italic>V600E</italic></sup> and wound-healing signatures was observed in the vemurafenib-treated wounds by day 14, consistent with a more rapid healing. Additionally, our gene output was compared with an early stage wound-healing signature, with mostly pro-inflammatory genes involved in the first stages of wound healing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> and a post-operatory wound-healing signature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. These two wound-healing signatures were also enriched by day 6 in the vemurafenib-treated groups as opposed to the control group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>).

We confirmed the increase in macrophages with topical vemurafenib by IHC analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). As expected, the increase in macrophages was abolished with the co-administration of trametinib. To elaborate on the activated pathways associated with the increased presence of wound-healing cell subsets at this time point, we analysed for enriched gene ontology (GO) biological processes on the genes up-expressed in the vemurafenib-treated wounds (&#x02a7e;2-fold increase) using ClueGo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. We found clear enrichment of pathways involved in lymphocyte activation, vascular development and response to wounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Integration of the enrichments of cell subset signatures, gene and pathway upregulation showed enhanced recruitment of wound-healing-specific cell subsets which results in stronger activation of the inflammatory and angiogenic wound-healing processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). To confirm these findings, the levels of COX-2&#x0002b; and IL-6&#x0002b; cells were quantified by immunohistochemistry. The wounds treated with vemurafenib had higher IL-6&#x0002b; and COX-2&#x0002b; cells at the proliferation stage, on day 6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>), which is consistent with our integrated RNAseq data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>. As a further verification of our RNAseq data, RT-PCR for Egr-1, TNFAIP3 and F7, for total skin wounds, was performed. These three genes are upregulated in our gene signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>) and our results on the RT-PCR verified this increase in vemurafenib-treated wounds by day 6 post treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Enhanced angiogenesis with vemurafenib</title><p>To confirm the beneficial effects of vemurafenib treatment on angiogenesis, we quantified PECAM-1&#x0002b; cells in the excisional and incisional wound areas.

These benefits were offset by adding a MEK inhibitor that is known to inhibit paradoxical MAPK activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, while this topical therapy did not result in tumour promotion. Therefore, topical BRAF Inhibitors could be used to accelerate the healing of acute skin wounds, such as abrasions and surgical incisions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data reporting</title><p>No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.
