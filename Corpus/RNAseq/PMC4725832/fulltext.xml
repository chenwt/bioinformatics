However, the role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in this context remains unknown. LncRNA regulate gene expression by acting e.g. as transcriptional coactivators, RNA decoys or microRNA sponges. They control development, differentiation and cellular processes such as autophagy in disease conditions. Here, we provide an insight into the role of lncRNA in mycobacterial infections. Human macrophages were infected with <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG and lncRNA expression was studied early post infection. For this purpose, lncRNA with known immune related functions were preselected and a lncRNA specific RT-qPCR protocol was established. In addition to expression-based prediction of lncRNA function, we assessed strategies for thorough normalisation of lncRNA. Arrayed quantification showed infection-dependent repression of several lncRNA including MEG3. Pathway analysis linked MEG3 to mTOR and PI3K-AKT signalling pointing to regulation of autophagy. Accordingly, IFN-&#x003b3; induced autophagy in infected macrophages resulted in sustained MEG3 down regulation and lack of IFN-&#x003b3; allowed for counter regulation of MEG3 by viable <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG. Knockdown of MEG3 in macrophages resulted in induction of autophagy and enhanced eradication of intracellular <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Mycobacterial species rank among the most potent bacterial pathogens threatening the health of both humans and animals. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is the etiological agent of human tuberculosis and is the leading cause of death from a single infectious bacterial pathogen in humans. One-third of the world&#x02019;s population is estimated to have latent tuberculosis while multidrug resistance is occurring worldwide (WHO Fact sheet N&#x000b0;104). The vaccination based on using the attenuated strain <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG (BCG) does not provide enough immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> and treatment of latent as well as active tuberculosis implies prolonged medication using a combination of therapeutics. Tremendous efforts have been made to investigate the molecular details of host cell response to mycobacterial infections. However, there is still a need for understanding regulatory networks in infection that may lead to new approaches in translational medicine.</p><p>Cellular response to bacterial infections relies on well-defined networks of molecular interactions based on regulation of gene expression and protein function. Interestingly, recent RNAseq studies have shown that most of human genome is transcribed but very little of it has the ability to encode proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Members of the non-coding genome include microRNA (miRNA) that are a major class of well characterised, conserved and endogenous small interfering RNA that regulate gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Several recent studies pointed out their involvement in mycobacterial infections<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>Another class of regulating non-coding RNA is distinguished from the others primarily based on their size of larger than 200 nt. This class is referred to as lncRNA. Their numbers are estimated to match those of known protein coding genes but they are generally shorter, have fewer exons and possess low evolutionary conservation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Furthermore, they have lower level of cellular concentration than protein coding transcripts but have higher degree of tissue specificity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Global expression of lncRNA can be studied e.g. by whole-transcriptome sequencing. Different studies have used RNAseq to study lncRNA expression in different contexts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Mentioned tissue specificity, low level of cellular concentrations and lack of understanding on mode of action in most cases raise the question whether a targeted approach based on e.g. RT-qPCR arrays shall be an alternate strategy to study lncRNA in a defined biological context.</p><p>LncRNA frequently localise in the nucleus functioning both in <italic>cis</italic> (at the site of their transcription) as well as in <italic>trans</italic> (at the sites on other chromosomes), which points to potential functions as interfaces with the epigenetic machinery, chromatin organisation and regulation of gene expression. They function e.g. as protein scaffolds, activators or inhibitors of transcription, antisense RNA or miRNA sponges, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. The latter has been reported recently as a novel mode of action of lncRNA, where they act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). This suggests the existence of a network of lncRNA and mRNA, which crosstalk based on mutual miRNA response elements (MRE)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In this context, susceptibility to ceRNA competition has been shown to differ depending on endogenous miRNA:target pool ratios<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated innate immune related expression of lncRNA following activation of monocytes, dendritic cells or macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Interestingly, a few studies have pointed out the role of lncRNA in regulating autophagy in cancer. For example, it has been shown that decreased expression of the lncRNA MEG3 results in activation of autophagy in bladder cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. However, the molecular details of mode of action are not understood. Rapamycin and other inhibitors of the Ser/Thr protein kinase &#x02018;mammalian target of rapamycin&#x02019; (mTOR) are potent inducers of autophagy and inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) such as 3-methyladenine (3-MA) are well-known inhibitors of autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Autophagy is known to be an important antimicrobial process for eradication of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in infected macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. However, induction of autophagy during macrophage infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> or BCG depends on IFN-&#x003b3; and is enhanced by the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. This process depends on Beclin1 and Atg5 and therefore constitutes the canonical form<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Beclin1 functions as a scaffold for assembly of the PI3KC3 complex to initiate autophagosome formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Beclin1 was shown to have a role in the convergence between autophagy and apoptosis and to be a substrate of CASP3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Autophagy and apoptosis are two interconnected cellular processes that are both modulated by pathogenic mycobacteria. In this context, we have reported earlier that in <italic>M. avium</italic> infection of human macrophages inhibition of apoptosis is grounded in let-7e and miR-29a mediated regulation of CASP3 and 7<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>This study focuses mainly on two aspects, first the establishment of a RT-qPCR based approach to predict lncRNA function. Secondly, proof of principle by mechanistic studies. We hypothesise that the innate immune response of human macrophages to mycobacterial infections is controlled by lncRNA. Furthermore, we speculate that mycobacterial infection and IFN-&#x003b3; stimulation of human macrophages leads to lncRNA-mediated induction of autophagy to combat intracellular bacteria. To address this, we preselected a list of lncRNA with known immune related functions and established a customised protocol for arrayed quantification of lncRNA expression based on RT-qPCR.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>A targeted approach for expression based prediction of lncRNA function</title><p>In this study, we aimed at designing a targeted approach based on selecting lncRNA, which are known to have immune related functions and have not been reported in context of mycobacterial infections. Therefore, an RT-qPCR based protocol for individual as well as arrayed quantification of lncRNA was established considering novel aspects for accurate normalisation of lncRNA expression. A list of 21 human lncRNA with immune related functions was compiled using the database lncRNAdb<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Initial testing resulted in selection of 17 lncRNA exhibiting harmonised annealing temperatures at 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, dynamic ranges of higher than 8 logs of magnitude and mean efficiency of 96.62%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.42% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Epithelial as well as immune cell lines provide widely recognised <italic>in vitro</italic> models for addressing different aspects of interactions between bacterial agents and host cells and help to reduce animal experiments. We applied a set of human monocytic (THP-1 and U937) as well as epithelial cell lines (A549.1, HeLa, HT-29 and HT-29/B6), which serve as common <italic>in vitro</italic> infection models and evaluated the performance of the presented approach. Furthermore, we aimed at developing a strategy for functional prediction and pathway annotation of selected lncRNA. Cell line specific expression was examined and lncRNA-clusters were deduced from determined expression patterns that were subjected to functional predictions. For this purpose, lncRNA expression in investigated cell lines (fold changes of a given sample vs. a common reference) was hierarchically clustered. Distinct groups of lncRNA such as H19, PTENP1 and GAS5 or MEG3 and NEAT1 were defined, which showed matched expression among cell lines and exhibited small distances in hierarchy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Identified clusters were chosen for prediction and annotation of molecular pathways. We took advantage of the evolving concept that lncRNA, mRNA and pseudogenes talk to each other based on mutual MRE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Consequently, CLIP-Seq based interactions of lncRNA and miRNA were obtained from starBase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> to determine miRNA that target lncRNA of an identified cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary information</xref>). The resulting list of miRNA was subjected to target analysis and a network of mRNAs was generated that were inferred to cross talk to the lncRNA via mutual MRE. For this purpose, we employed Cytoscape<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> together with its app CyTargetLinker<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and predicted miRNA-mRNA networks by considering regulatory interaction networks of target scan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The resulting target networks (mRNA sharing MREs with lncRNA) of an identified lncRNA cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary information</xref>) were intersected and subjected to ClueGo analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> for determining significant KEGG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> pathway enrichment (detailed information on the approach is provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary information</xref>). For example, the cluster consisting of H19, PTENP1 and GAS5 was mainly assigned to gene ontologies &#x02018;specific DNA binding&#x02019; and &#x02018;protein kinase activity&#x02019; and genes were enriched in signalling pathways such as FoxO, HIF-1 or Estrogen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary information</xref>). Our analysis pointed out a particular cluster with small distance among the members NEAT1 and MEG3. The introduced prediction strategy assigned this cluster inter alia to mTOR (13 genes; 22% genes/term; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) and PI3K-AKT (30 genes; 9% gene/term; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) signalling pathways, which are involved in regulation of autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary information</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>lncRNA are distinctly down regulated in early BCG infection of macrophages</title><p>In an earlier study, we have shown that macrophage apoptosis in <italic>M. avium</italic> infection of human macrophages is regulated by miRNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Based on pathway predictions presented above (mTOR and PI3K-AKT) and considering the idea of a miRNA based common language<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, we hypothesised that lncRNA play a substantial role in mycobacterial infections. For approaching this issue, we adjusted the established lncRNA RT-qPCR to a protocol that allowed for arrayed and customised quantification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. This layout enabled the detection of 17 individual lncRNA (preselected from initial individual infection experiments) within a single RT-qPCR. 5 additional references (SNORD47, B2M, ACTB, GAPDH and 18S rRNA) were considered for normalisation of lncRNA expression. For this purpose, THP-1 derived macrophages were infected with viable BCG as well as BCG heat killed (hk) and non infected cells served as negative controls.</p><p>TLR4 activation of macrophages has been shown to cause early, intermediate and late waves of transcription and the early response has been proposed to be important for the regulation of later events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Moreover, modulation of host macrophage defence mechanisms takes place as early as 10&#x02009;min after infection. For example, Rab5 is recruited to the BCG containing phagosome at 10&#x02009;min post infection (p.i.)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and secreted mycobacterial proteins accumulate as early as 30&#x02009;min after infection in cellular compartments of host macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Several mycobacterial components such as lipoarabinomannan (LAM) are known to interfere with and manipulate the regulation of early host cell response. Therefore, we selected the time points 30&#x02009;min and 4&#x02009;h for monitoring lncRNA regulation of early events.</p><p>Several lncRNA turned out to be significantly down regulated in early stages of infection (30&#x02009;min) compared with BCG hk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). This observation was made only in infections with viable BCG in contrast to BCG hk treated cells as well as non infected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, a total of 11 lncRNA showed significant and higher than twofold decreased expression after infection with viable BCG compared with BCG hk (log2 ratio <sub>BCG:BCG hk</sub> &#x0003c;&#x02212;1). To name a few, NTT exhibited 7-fold, PRINS 9-fold and TMEVPG1 4-fold significantly decreased expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Among all down regulated lncRNA at 30&#x02009;min, MEG3 showed most pronounced and significantly decreased expression having more than 10-fold lower values compared with BCG hk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, unpaired t test, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01).</p><p>At 4&#x02009;h p.i., a similar trend of lncRNA dysregulation was observed in infection experiments comparing viable BCG with BCG hk. However, only AS UCHL1 showed significant and more than twofold down regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Assessment of strategies for normalisation of lncRNA expression</title><p>lncRNA are known to exhibit lower cellular expression levels compared with protein coding genes. So we raised the question whether normalisation of lncRNA expression by means of conventional reference genes (mRNA) is advisable. To approach this, we tested the application of two sets of references: One set consisted of 3 stably expressed conventional reference genes and another set included stably expressed ncRNA. Except for the studied 17 lncRNA, we considered one small nuclear RNA (SNORD47) as well as 3 conventional reference mRNA (B2M, ACTB and GAPDH) together with 18&#x02009;S rRNA for evaluating normalisation strategies of lncRNA expression. Two successive rounds of geNorm analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> were performed (considering the total number of 22 targets) to identify the most stable genes among both the conventional references and the entire list of ncRNA. At 30&#x02009;min p.i., B2M, GAPDH and ACTB turned out to be stably expressed as represented by low geNorm M values (M<sub>B2M</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.503, M<sub>ACTB</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.557, M<sub>GAPDH</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.521). Furthermore, geNorm analysis confirmed a group of three ncRNA including ZEB2NAT, SNORD47 and PTENP1 to be stably expressed (M<sub>ZEB2NAT</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.487, M<sub>SNORD47</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.565, M<sub>PTENP1</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.581), which were chosen as ncRNA references. To evaluate differences in cellular abundance of studied RNA classes, raw Cq values of lncRNA were compared with identified ncRNA references as well as conventional references. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, the mean raw Cq value of conventional reference genes was significantly lower compared with the selected ncRNA reference genes and remaining lncRNA (Mean Cq <sub>conv. ref genes</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11.2, Mean Cq <sub>ncRNA ref genes</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;19.5, Mean Cq <sub>lncRNAs</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;22.9, unpaired t test P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). Consequently, the geometric mean of either reference ncRNA or conventional reference genes was used to normalise lncRNA expression. Obtained sets of data were plotted to determine the correlation. Strong linearity was observed between both sets of data as shown by the calculated values: slope&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.062&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.016, R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.9908 and Y-intercept&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.02921&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01515 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Although both sets of references were examined to be stable and suitable for normalisation of lncRNA expression, the distinct differences in cellular abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>) call the use of conventional reference genes into question.</p><p>At 4&#x02009;h p.i., geNorm analysis resulted in lower M values for the reference ncRNA (M<sub>ZEB2NAT</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.536, M<sub>WT1-AS</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.541, M<sub>SNORD47</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.579) compared with the conventional references (M<sub>18</sub>&#x02009;<sub>S rRNA</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.561, M<sub>GAPDH</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.617, M<sub>B2M</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.0). The raw Cq values were again significantly lower in the conventional reference genes compared with the other two groups (reference ncRNA and lncRNA) supporting the observations that were made above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>: Mean Cq <sub>conv. ref genes</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11.1, Mean Cq <sub>ncRNA ref genes</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;21.9, Mean Cq <sub>lncRNAs</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;23.4, unpaired t test P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>, the linear relationship between two data sets was not as pronounced as calculated above (slope&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.895&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.078, R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7605 and Y-intercept&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05127&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0769).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Induction of autophagy by IFN-&#x003b3; in BCG infected macrophages accounts for sustained MEG3 down regulation</title><p>Autophagy is a cellular process for degradation and recycling of considerable cytoplasmic particles. Along these lines, recent studies have elucidated autophagy as a cell-autonomous defence mechanism for eradication of intracellular bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>Listeria</italic>, <italic>Shigella</italic> and pathogenic <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. It has been shown recently that MEG3 knock down in bladder cancer cells resulted in induction of autophagy, increased cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. For studying the effects of autophagy on MEG3 levels in the context of BCG infection, we inhibited or activated autophagy in macrophages by addition of 3-MA or IFN-&#x003b3;, respectively. IFN-&#x003b3; has been shown to be a potent inducer of autophagy in BCG infected macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Autophagy was examined by detecting the autophagosomal marker LC3A/B. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>, IFN-&#x003b3; treatment along with BCG infection resulted in an increase of LC3A/B punctae and 3-MA compensated for it. The quantification of LC3A/B punctae proved IFN-&#x003b3; as potent inducer of autophagy in macrophages both in infected and non infected samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, unpaired t test P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). However, BCG without IFN-&#x003b3; treatment was not sufficient to increase the number of punctae to the same extent. Interestingly, IFN-&#x003b3; treatment resulted in efficient eradication of BCG as proven by significant decrease (unpaired t test, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) of green fluorescence signals, while in other treatments sustained green fluorescence was detected over the course of experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Induction of autophagy was proved by LC3A/B conversion and p62 degradation in infected and IFN-&#x003b3; treated macrophages compared with the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). To determine effects of treatments on mTOR activation, p70-S6K phosphorylation was studied. Infection alone or along with 3-MA treatment caused mTOR activation shown by phosphorylation of p70-S6K (Thr389). However, treatment with IFN-&#x003b3; along with infection distinctly decreased phosphorylation of Thr389 proving mTOR inactivation. Also phosphorylation of the residue Ser371 declined after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). In the same set of experiments RNA was isolated to determine MEG3 and Beclin1 expression. Beclin1 is a key regulator of autophagy and has been described recently as an interface between apoptosis and autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Induction of autophagy by IFN-&#x003b3; in infected macrophages was accompanied by sustained and significant (unpaired t test P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) MEG3 down regulation (over 24&#x02009;h), while 3-MA administration partly restored MEG3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Combinations of both resulted also in partially restored MEG3 expression accompanied by inhibition of autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>).

The application of siRNA potently decreased (unpaired t test, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) cellular levels of MEG3 in THP-1 derived macrophages and clearly increased LC3A/B punctae as represented by immunofluorescence detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>, MEG3 knockdown increased LC3A/B conversion compared with nonsense transfected controls as shown by enhanced intensity of LC3A/B-II in western blots. Addition of Bafilomycin A1 accumulated LC3A/B levels without clear differences between samples and controls. However, there was no obvious degradation of p62 after siRNA treatment in non infected cells. The levels of p62 slightly increased in MEG3 siRNA treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). To determine whether MEG3 knockdown has effects on mTOR activation, we detected p70-S6K phosphorylation. MEG3 knockdown resulted in increased total cellular levels of p70-S6K in both Bafilomycin A1 treated and untreated cells compared with nonsense controls. P70-S6K (Thr389) phosphorylation was slightly decreased after MEG3 knockdown indicating mTOR inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Knockdown had no effect on phosphorylation of the residue Ser371 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Moreover, MEG3 knockdown along with BCG infection resulted in clearly increased cellular LC3A/B-II levels compared with controls and p62 levels were slightly increased in MEG3 siRNA and infected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). RNAi resulted in accumulation of LC3A/B signals that were co-localised with BCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>), which went along with enhanced eradication of intracellular BCG as examined by two independent methods (detection of fluorescently labelled BCG as well as CFU).

Although dysregulation of lncRNA has been reported recently in different aspects of innate immune response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, the function of majority of these transcripts is yet to be determined. The mentioned tissue specific expression of lncRNA suggests the application of well-established cell lines as suitable models for studying molecular functions of lncRNA in a particular biological process. For this and other purposes, we developed a targeted approach for RT-qPCR based expression analysis of lncRNA. The employed layout based on 96 well plates is extendable to include a total number of 26 lncRNA together with 5 reference RNAs each measured in triplicates. To our knowledge, this is the first non-commercial approach for arrayed RT-qPCR based quantification of lncRNA, which is fully scalable and automatable. We evaluated the application of both conventional and ncRNA reference genes for normalisation of lncRNA expression. A set of three ncRNA was considered for normalisation of lncRNA expression because they exhibited enhanced stability of expression compared with the conventional reference genes. More to the point, there were distinct and significant differences in cellular abundance of conventional references and ncRNA. Diverging cellular abundance of a reference gene and the gene of interest may bias the analysis based on differences in e.g. cellular turn over, RNA integrity or efficiencies of the enzymatic reaction as it has been discussed in the case of 18&#x02009;S rRNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. We conclude that the application of a stability-tested set of ncRNA is indicated for thorough normalisation of lncRNA expression.</p><p>LncRNA constitute a heterogeneous class with low degree of evolutionary conservation and diverse modes of action<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. This fact aggravates functional predictions and pathway involvement as it has been developed for miRNA and mRNA, respectively. However, in recent years the concept of a common RNA language has been developed, where shared MRE are suggested to serve as letters between different classes of RNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. It has been shown that miRNA-ceRNA interaction depends on cellular ratios of both RNA classes, which aggravates a generalised model for miRNA sponges<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. However, lncRNA have been reported to have several other modes of action. Our interpretation of the mentioned model considers lncRNA not just as miRNA decoys. LncRNA are known to function as protein scaffolds and are supposed to bind and control transcriptional coactivator or corepressor complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Hence, we speculate that miRNA are able to indirectly influence cellular availability of mRNA by targeting e.g. lncRNA that are capable of stimulating or inhibiting transcription. The rationale of the study was to provide an expression-based approach that functionally assigns lncRNA clusters to molecular pathways and enables prediction of lncRNA function by considering lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA crosstalk. As we were analysing lncRNA clusters that were deduced from cell line specific expressions, we came across a particular cluster with small distance between NEAT1 and MEG3. Interestingly, <italic>in silico</italic> analysis linked them to mTOR and PI3K-AKT signalling pathways that are important for regulation of autophagy. For reducing the complexity of the study, we decided to focus only on mechanistic studies of MEG3. This does not necessarily rule out the fact that other investigated lncRNA may have different or cooperative functions. The data presented here provides a basis for our future research.</p><p>Infection of THP-1 derived macrophages with viable BCG caused remarkable dysregulation of several lncRNA. For example, NTT, PRINS, TMEVPG1 and MEG3 were significantly down regulated at 30&#x02009;min p.i. compared with BCG hk stimulated cells but not at 4&#x02009;h p.i. We conclude that the pronounced down regulation at 30&#x02009;min p.i. points to specific functions in responding to physiologically active BCG rather than effects being relevant to mechanisms of uptake. None of the above mentioned lncRNA has been reported in the context of mycobacterial infection. However, recent studies have shown that herein investigated and dysregulated lncRNA are associated with IFN-&#x003b3; signalling, NF-&#x003ba;B, apoptosis and autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. NTT was 7-fold down regulated after infection. NTT is a single-copy gene residing in chromosome 6q23-q24, close to the IFN-&#x003b3; receptor gene and its transcripts were found in activated, but not resting T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. NTT has been suggested to act as a regulatory RNA by activating PKR, which induces the degradation of I-&#x003ba;B&#x003b2; with subsequent NF-&#x003ba;B activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. PRINS showed 9-fold decreased expression in BCG infected macrophages. PRINS has been reported to regulate the antiapoptotic effects of the interferon-inducible gene IFI6 in psoriasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. TMEVPG1 was 4-fold down regulated and is located in a cluster of cytokine genes including IFN-&#x003b3;. TMEVPG1 transcription is dependent upon NF-&#x003ba;B while it contributes to IFN-&#x003b3; expression as part of the Th1 differentiation program<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. AS UCHL1 (antisense UCHL1) showed consistent down regulation at 30&#x02009;min as well as at 4&#x02009;h p.i. UCHL1 will be a hot candidate for our future research, since it is the antisense product of the gene UCHL1 and its dysregulation has been related to defects in autophagy in diabetes mellitus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.</p><p>BCG infection caused effective down regulation of MEG3, which is a tumour suppressor gene located in chromosome 14q32 that has been associated with carcinogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. MEG3 is down regulated in case of human tumours including hepatocellular cancers, meningiomas, bladder cancer and gastric cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. The reason behind loss of MEG3 expression in tumours has been linked to hyper methylation of the promoter or differentially methylated regions upstream of the MEG3 gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. There are no reports about involvement of MEG3 in any case of infection. However, decreased expression of MEG3 has been reported to activate autophagy in bladder cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. It is noteworthy to mention that several <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> products, such as PI3P phosphatase SapM, glycosylated phosphatidylinositol-mimic LAM and phosphatidylinositol mannoside (PIM) have been reported to be able to suppress PI3K signalling and to counteract autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. In line with this, BCG has been shown to oppose and inhibit induction of autophagy in macrophages while <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> was devoid of this characteristic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. It will be interesting to examine whether mycobacterial products are capable of directly manipulating cellular MEG3 levels. Induction of autophagy by rapamycin mediated inhibition of mTOR signalling has been shown to unblock phagosomal maturation in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and BCG infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. More recent studies have reported IFN-&#x003b3; and vitamin D to be needed <italic>in vivo</italic> for Beclin 1 dependent autophagy and antimycobacterial activity of macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Beclin1 is a key regulator of autophagy and an interface between apoptosis and autophagy. CASP3 mediates the cleavage of Beclin1 and produced fragments are devoid of autophagy inducing capacities. However, the C-terminal cleavage product seems to be capable of triggering the release of proapoptotic factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Consequently, we tested for activation of executioner CASP3 to ensure apoptosis was not triggered. On one hand, IFN-&#x003b3; induced autophagy in infected macrophages was associated with sustained down regulation of MEG3 over 24&#x02009;h, while 3-MA partly compensated for the dysregulation. The absence of IFN-&#x003b3; involved early decreased MEG3 expression, which was restored back to normal over 24&#x02009;h pointing to a potential counter regulation by BCG. On the other hand, IFN-&#x003b3; treatment along with BCG infection efficiently compromised p70-S6K (Thr389) phosphorylation indicating mTOR inactivation.</p><p>Specific knockdown of MEG3 had no effect on LC3B transcription. Therefore, increasing number of LC3A/B punctae per cell is unlikely to depend on MEG3 mediated expressional changes of LC3A/B. In line with this, increased LC3A/B conversion was observed after MEG3 knockdown in both infected and non infected macrophages. However, RNAi caused no obvious degradation of p62 in macrophages. In MEG3 knockdown cells the ratio of LC3A/B-II to LC3A/B-I increases. This can occur because of increased formation of autophagosomes, or decreased degradation of autophagosomal material in lysosomes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>, the levels of p62, the autophagy substrate and adaptor for intracellular bacteria, seem to increase in MEG3 siRNA treated cells. This would be consistent with a block in lysosomal degradation and not an increase in autophagosome formation. Phosphorylation of p70-S6K (Thr389) was subtly different in non infected cells. It has been reported that p62 associates with Rags in lysosomes and is required both for the interaction of mTOR with Rag and for translocation of the mTORC1 complex to the lysosome, which is important for mTOR activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Inhibition of mTOR on the other hand induces autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Taken together, we conclude that MEG3 seems to block lysosomal degradation and has limited effects on mTOR activation. Our results show that IFN-&#x003b3; mediated induction of autophagy in BCG infection happens in a MEG3 dependent manner. However, other lncRNA may have cooperative effects on autophagy and mTOR activation and will be a focus of our future research. Furthermore, repression of the lncRNA MEG3 results in enhanced eradication of intracellular mycobacteria. We speculate that in absence of IFN-&#x003b3;, intracellular BCG are able to counter regulate early MEG3 dysregulation resulting in inhibition of autophagy. Presence of IFN-&#x003b3;, on the other hand, allows for induction of autophagy by sustained MEG3 down regulation reinforcing the eradication of mycobacteria in infected macrophages.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Bacterial cultivation, cell culture and RNA isolation</title><p><italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG (DSMZ No. DSM 43990) was grown as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>.

Experiments were repeated at least three times.</p><p>For counting LC3 punctae, at least 3 randomly selected microscopic photographs of each biological replicate were analysed using ImageJ 1.48v<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>. Threshold value was adjusted carefully for strong autophagy signal and a particle size of 10&#x02013;60 pixel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> for 1392&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1040 resolution photograph was taken into consideration. Data is represented as average LC3 punctae per cell. An average of 12 cells per section were counted. For quantification of cellular bacterial loads after MEG3 knockdown, THP-1 cells were transfected as described above. After 24&#x02009;h of incubation, they were infected with fluorescently labelled BCG at MOI of 10&#x02009;as described above. After fixation, microphotographs were taken and the number of BCG per cell was counted manually. Triplicate experiments were performed. To prove the fluorescence based generation of bacterial counts, infected macrophages (three biological replicates) were lysed and CFU/ml were determined as described earlier<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Statistical and <italic>in silico</italic> analysis</title><p>Unpaired t tests were conducted applying GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</ext-link>.
