One of the strategies is to incorporate restriction enzyme sites into oligonucleotide primers to create sticky ends by digesting the PCR products. However, the digestion efficiency is low for many restriction endonucleases when their recognition sequences are located within a few base pairs of the end of the PCR products <xref rid="pone.0107328-Kaufman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The second strategy is to clone PCR products as blunt-ended fragments. The strategy requires an enzymatic processing to remove a 3&#x02032; overhang adenosine which was generated by PCR Taq polymerase due to its template-independent terminal transferase activity <xref rid="pone.0107328-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The third strategy is to directly clone PCR products into a T-vector with 3&#x02032;-T overhang. The strategy is applicable to clone PCR products with 3&#x02032;-T overhang generated by some of thermostable DNA polymerases.</p><p>A T-vector can be constructed by two ways. One way is to artificially add T-overhang to blunt-ended plasmid DNA by terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase (TdT) or Taq polymerase in the presence of dideoxythymidine triphosphate (ddTTP) and dTTP, respectively <xref rid="pone.0107328-Holton1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107328-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. By this way, the prerequisite is that one should first construct a plasmid DNA with blunt-ended restriction enzyme sites. Another way is to directly generate a 3&#x02032; overhang linear vector by certain restriction enzymes. Several restriction enzymes could be used for that purpose and the examples include <italic>Bci</italic>VI, <italic>Bfi</italic>I, <italic>Hph</italic>I, <italic>Mnl</italic>I, <italic>Taa</italic>I, <italic>Xcm</italic>I and <italic>Ahd</italic>I (<italic>Eam</italic>1105I) <xref rid="pone.0107328-Borovkov1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107328-Dimov1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The widely employed enzyme is <italic>Xcm</italic>I. The enzyme has a flexible recognition sites &#x0201c;<named-content content-type="gene">CCANNNNN</named-content>/<named-content content-type="gene">NNNNTGG</named-content>&#x0201d; (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;A/C/T/G). Thus, a plasmid DNA with the sequence &#x0201c;<named-content content-type="gene">CCANNNNTNNNNTGG</named-content>&#x0201d; can be recognized by <italic>Xcm</italic>I and be digested to generate a 3&#x02032; overhang linear vector. Currently, considerable reports have been published to introduce the application of this enzyme in the generation of 3&#x02032; overhang vectors for cloning PCR products <xref rid="pone.0107328-Gu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107328-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107328-Janner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Besides <italic>Xcm</italic>I, little is known about the application of the other enzymes on generating the 3&#x02032; overhang vector. In addition, most of commercially available T-vectors are not binary vectors and cannot be directly used for <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated genetic transformation. In this study, we have constructed a novel binary T-vector by inserting a 1,317-bp DNA sequence with two <italic>Ahd</italic>I restriction sites. The T-vector contains a <italic>GFP</italic> reporter gene and thus, can be used to analyze promoter functions by the <italic>GFP</italic> gene.</p><p>Identification and characterization of various promoters not only benefit the functional annotation of their genes but also provide alternative candidates to be used to drive interesting genes for genetic improvement of targeted organisms by transgenesis. Among different types of promoters, we are interested in pollen-specific promoters. These promoters can be used to drive expression of some genes to disturb pollen development by genetic transformation and as a result, to develop male sterile lines. Genetically stable male sterile lines are the prerequisite to commercially utilize crop heterosis to improve crop production. Thus, pollen-specific promoters are potentially useful in crop genetic improvement by developing hybrid crop cultivars <xref rid="pone.0107328-daCostaNunes1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107328-Oo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Some of pollen-specific genes and their promoters were isolated and characterized more than twenty years ago from plants <xref rid="pone.0107328-Stinson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107328-Hanson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

It has been regarded as an ideal model to study various biological processes such as sexual reproduction, cell fate determination, signal transduction, membrane transport, and polar growth. Pollen-specific promoters may be utilized as tools in annotating biological functions of these genes involved in pollen development and regulation. Thus, it is necessary to identify and characterize various pollen-specific promoters whose activities could be detected at only certain stage of pollen development. There are lots of publicly available rice expression databases such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets <xref rid="pone.0107328-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, ArrayExpress <xref rid="pone.0107328-Petryszak1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and PLEXdb <xref rid="pone.0107328-Dash1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. However, limited data are available for focusing on pollen-related expression. Besides the Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) rice database <xref rid="pone.0107328-Nobuta1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, two of microarray datasets are available where pollens and other tissues were taken for expression analysis. One of the datasets contained the expression data from 8 different samples including leaves, callus cells, roots, uninucleate microspores, bicellular pollens, tricellular pollens, mature pollen grains and germinated pollen grains <xref rid="pone.0107328-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Another dataset contained only 3 samples including seedlings, pollen at anthesis and sperm at anthesis <xref rid="pone.0107328-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. All these data provide the basis for genome-wide identification of pollen-specific genes. In this study, a novel binary T-vector has been developed to facilitate the rapid clone of targeted promoters into the upstream of reporter <italic>GFP</italic> gene. Considerable numbers of pollen-specific rice genes were also verified in their expression. Additionally, one pollen-specific gene and its promoter were molecularly characterized by using our newly developed T-vector. The data showed that a promoter::<italic>GFP</italic> construct could be prepared rapidly by using the novel T-vector and the developed construct could be directly used for <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated genetic transformation to generate transgenic plants for detecting the promoter activities through the <italic>GFP</italic> reporter gene. Our data also showed that the 1,492 bp promoter from the rice gene <italic>LOC_Os10g35930</italic> was active only at the mature stage of pollens and no GFP activity was observed after pollen germination.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Construction of the novel binary T-vector</title><p>The restriction enzyme <italic>Ahd</italic>I has the recognition site <named-content content-type="gene">GACNNN</named-content>/<named-content content-type="gene">NNGTC</named-content> (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;A/C/T/G).

To introduce this sequence into the binary vector pCAMBIA 1300 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cambia.org">http://www.cambia.org</ext-link>), two bridge fragments were amplified by PCR with the rice genomic DNA as a template using two primer sets as listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107328.s001">Table S1</xref> (See Methods in details). The Fragment 1 contains two recognition sites including <italic>Hin</italic>dIII and <italic>Ahd</italic>I and the Fragment 2 has two recognition sites including <italic>Ahd</italic>I and <italic>Nco</italic>I. These two fragments were then ligated together by the enzyme <italic>Spe</italic>I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107328-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

If a PCR is carried out using other DNA polymerases, for example, Pfu DNA polymerase, the PCR products are required to be treated by Taq DNA polymerase to add A-overhang in both blunt ends for cloning. As only one overhang nucleotide at the ends of both PCR products and the T-vector, the DNA ligation and subsequent transformation should be carried out in more stringent conditions. Firstly, T-vector fragment should be properly purified. As the fragment is around 10 Kb in size, traditional methods used for gel purification of normal PCR products may not be suitable for the purification of the novel T-vector from agarose gel. Generally, acceptable cloning efficiency could be achieved when commercial columns suitable for large fragment DNA recovery were employed for T-vector purification from agarose gel. Secondly, low cloning efficiency may be observed when a fragment with larger than 2.5 Kb is used for cloning. Based on our experiment, relatively high efficiency could be achieved when PCR fragments ranging from 0.5&#x02013;1.5 Kb were used for ligation. Since most of promoter sequences were less than 2 Kb, the novel T-vector should be applicable for cloning of most of promoters for the <italic>GFP</italic> reporter gene analysis. On the other hand, most of commercially available T-vectors are not binary vectors and they are not suitable for direct plant transformation. In addition, most of commercial T-vectors are only to provide multiple cloning sites flanking the insert for subcloning and no <italic>GFP</italic> gene is present in the T-vectors. Thus, our novel T-vector provides an alternative candidate for facilitating rapid construction of the promoter::<italic>GFP</italic> cassette for the reporter gene analysis.</p><p>Although many pollen-specific genes and their promoters have been identified and characterized as mentioned in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref> section, limited data are available on the genome-wide identification of pollen-specific genes. By using Affymetrix microarray rice chips, Wei <italic>et al</italic> (2010) revealed 25,062 pollen-preferential transcripts by investigating the expression profiles in three vegetative tissues and 5 pollen-related samples <xref rid="pone.0107328-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Genome-wide expression patterns among seedling, pollens and sperms at anthesis revealed 3,043 pollen-/sperm-specific genes <xref rid="pone.0107328-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In both cases, only one or three no-pollen tissues were selected for comparative expression analysis. Thus, some pollen-specific genes might be wrongly identified when these genes would be expressed in other vegetative tissues which were not be surveyed. Therefore, pollen-specific genes should be identified by using more vegetative tissues as references for more accurate evaluation. In this study, a total of 1,013 pollen-specific genes were identified by using the MPSS database. These genes were further verified in their expression microarray and RNA_Seq datasets and 67 highly expressed pollen-specific genes were selected for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107328-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107328-g004">4</xref>). As these pollen-specific genes were initially identified by using the MPSS database, where only the expression data from mature pollens are available, young pollen-specific genes were not included. Thus, more pollen-specific genes with high expression level should be identified if expression data from young pollens are available in the MPSS database.</p><p>A stage-specific/enriched gene is expressed only in a specific stage or shows significant higher abundance in the stage, for example, in the unicellular stage, of pollen development. The identification of the stage-specific/enriched genes should benefit to better understand the regulatory mechanism of pollen development. Wei <italic>et al</italic> (2010) identified 2,203 stage-enriched transcripts <xref rid="pone.0107328-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Another report showed that three transcriptomes of egg cells, sperm cells and pollen vegetative cells are highly divergent and about &#x000be; of those genes were differentially expressed in these cell types <xref rid="pone.0107328-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Russell <italic>et al</italic> (2012) also identified 1,668 sperm cell specific genes <xref rid="pone.0107328-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In this study, among 67 pollen-specific genes, most of them showed expression in the whole pollen development stages with the highest abundance in mature or germinated pollen grains and the expression level in sperms was obviously reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107328-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Our data suggested that most of mature pollen specific genes might play roles not only in mature pollens but also in their tube germination.</p><p>Previous studies revealed several pollen-specific promoter motifs <xref rid="pone.0107328-Twell3" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. We have selected 5 motifs for our further discussion. A total of 2,000 bp of promoter region in each promoter was selected to detect the presence of these motifs in the 67 putative pollen-specific promoters. Three of the five motifs, including &#x0201c;AGAAA&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0107328-Filichkin1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, &#x0201c;GTGA&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0107328-Twell2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and &#x0201c;AAATGA&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0107328-Weterings1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> could be detected in all the 67 promoter sequences. For the remaining two motifs &#x0201c;AGGTCA&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0107328-Hamilton2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and &#x0201c;TGTGGTT&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0107328-Twell4" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, 34% and 36% of the promoter sequences contained these two motifs, respectively. Most of these motifs were presented within 1.5 Kb upstream of the start codon of a gene. The data suggested that most of <italic>cis</italic>-elements to regulate pollen-specific expression should be located 1.5 Kb upstream region of a protein coding gene. Thus, in most of cases, 1.5 Kb of promoter region should be enough to drive pollen-specific expression.</p><p>Based on the expression patterns of the gene <italic>LOC_Os10g35930</italic> shown by microarray data, the inconsistence in expression patterns among different microarray datasets was observed.

However, only a very weak signal was observed in sperm cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107328-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).
