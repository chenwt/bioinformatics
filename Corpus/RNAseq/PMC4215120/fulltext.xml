Tics are often accompanied by comorbidities such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive&#x02013;compulsive disorder (OCD). The prevalence of TS is uncertain, but ranges from 1 to 30 per 1000 populations <xref rid="b0005 b0010 b0015" ref-type="bibr">[1&#x02013;3]</xref>.</p><p>The exact cause of TS is still unknown but both genetic and environmental factors seem to contribute to its development <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Neuroimaging studies have identified specific brain regions, i.e. prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulated cortex, somatosensory cortex, striatum and thalamus, being involved in the pathophysiology of TS <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Several twin and family studies have indicated that TS is highly heritable and very likely to be genetically related <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Recent genome wide complex trait analysis has confirmed this by identification of genetic risk factors for TS <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Similarly, a TS genome wide association study has identified TS susceptibility variants <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Among the genes associated with TS are <italic>SLITRK1</italic>, <italic>CNTNAP2</italic> and <italic>HDC</italic>
<xref rid="b0045 b0050 b0055 b0060 b0065" ref-type="bibr">[9&#x02013;13]</xref>.</p><p>Two <italic>SLITRK1</italic> gene sequence variants have been implicated in TS: a rare frameshift mutation giving rise to a truncated form of the SLITRK1 protein and two independent occurrences of the identical variant in the binding site for microRNA189, found in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region of the <italic>SLITRK1</italic> gene, were associated with TS <xref rid="b0050 b0070" ref-type="bibr">[10,14]</xref>. Among those is the non-coding variant (var321) within a conserved binding site for microRNA189. The single nucleotide variation within the 3&#x02032;UTR, appears to strengthen the binding of a miR-189 with consequent downregulation of <italic>SLITRK1</italic> expression <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, subsequent sequence analyses of Tourette patients did not detect any of these binding site variants <xref rid="b0075 b0080 b0085 b0090" ref-type="bibr">[15&#x02013;18]</xref>. Furthermore, a single study identified the same 3&#x02032;UTR variants in unaffected individuals <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> indicating that <italic>SLITRK1</italic> may be of limited effect in TS. A fourth variation was found in one patient with familial TS, a heterozygous for a novel 708C&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;T polymorphism resulting in a silent mutation Ile236Ile <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In conclusion, it might be difficult to precisely establish a clear association with TS and rare variants in <italic>SLITRK1</italic>. The <italic>SLITRK1</italic> gene is an intronless gene located on human chromosome 13q31.1 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The gene encodes an integral membrane protein, SLITRK1, which is a member of the SLITRK (SLIT and NTRK-like family) protein family. Members of this family are characterized by the presence of two N-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRR) in the extracellular domain, similarly to those found in the Slit family, and a C-terminal region that shares homology with trk neurotrophin (tyrosine kinase) receptors (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The SLITRK1 protein differs from other members lacking the region of homology to neurotrophin receptors. SLITRK1 is expressed predominantly in the brain, more specifically in the cortex, thalamus and the basal ganglia <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. SLITRK1 is involved in neurite outgrowth and branching <xref rid="b0110 b0115" ref-type="bibr">[22,23]</xref>. The aim of this study was to clone and characterize the porcine <italic>SLITRK1</italic> gene, compare its sequence with known SLITRK1 from other vertebrates and investigate its spatial expression. Our data show that the porcine homologue of SLITRK1 is conserved during evolution and the expression profile is similar to that in human. Interestingly, two transcript variants of <italic>SLITRK1</italic> were identified of which one represent a full-length transcript and another encodes a truncated SLITRK1 protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Animals and tissue collection</title><p>Pigs were housed and used in compliance with European Community animal care guidelines.

The porcine <italic>SLITRK1</italic> gene cloned (<xref rid="s0095" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>) consists of 2094&#x000a0;bp with the translation start found at nucleotide 1 and the TAA stop codon located at nucleotide 2086. The ORF of porcine <italic>SLITRK1</italic> shows a G&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;C content of 51.2% and encodes a protein of 695 amino acids.

Multiple alignment of pig SLITRK1 with SLITRK1 sequences from other species also demonstrated significant amino acid identities e.g. mouse (97%) and rat (97%).</p><p>The deduced porcine SLITRK1 amino acid sequence contains several primary structural characteristics; two leucine-rich repeats (LRR) at amino acids 29&#x02013;322 and 344&#x02013;578, respectively (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The LRR domains, consisting of approx. 230 amino acids, are flanked by cysteine-rich regions. Both LRR domains are composed of three to four characteristic motifs LxxLxLxxN/GxL, where x is any amino acid <xref rid="b0145 b0150" ref-type="bibr">[29,30]</xref>. The amino acid sequences of pig, human and mouse SLITRK1 are extremely conserved with the LRR domains (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The two LRR domains in SLITRK1 are connected by an 81 amino acid intervening sequence. Within this sequence the non-conserved amino acid residues are found. Of notice is that an amino acid residue is missing in the pig SLITRK1 sequence compared with the human and mouse counterparts. The amino acid homology is also highly conserved in the transmembrane region (amino acids 614&#x02013;641), the sequence being 100% identical between the three compared species (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Also, the carboxy-terminal end of SLITRK1 is highly homologous.

One transcript, designated SsSLITRK1-wt in <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, displayed 100% nucleotide identity with the <italic>SLITRK1</italic> gene. The SsSLITRK1-wt clone consisted of a coding region of 2088 nucleotides and six nucleotides of 3&#x02032;UTR sequence. In addition to the full-length <italic>SLITRK1</italic> cDNA a variant encoding a truncated SLITRK1 polypeptide was found, SsSLITRK1-tv1 (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The first 44 amino acids of SsSLITRK1-tv1 are completely identical with the wt amino acids sequence. Deletion of an adenosine at position 133 in the genomic SLITRLK1 sequence (GenBank ID: KJ210858), i.e. at the triplet encoding Lys45, results in a change in reading frame creating a truncated protein. The predicted amino acid sequence of the mutated SLITRK1 shows 61 nonsynonymous substitutions followed by a premature stop codon (TGA). The truncated porcine SLITRK1 protein lacks a substantial portion of the full-length protein, 651 out of 695 amino acids, including the two LRR repeats, LRRCT, LRRNT and the transmembrane region (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The truncated SLITRK1 protein has an estimated molecular mass of 12.1&#x000a0;kDa and a pI of 5.2. The carboxy terminal end of the truncated SLITRK1 protein of 107 amino acids shows a very low homology (around 40%) to cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit from horse.

<italic>scrofa</italic> genomic DNA yielded a dataset of 1926 and 1302 million reads, equal to 194.5 and 131.5 Gbp of paired-end sequence data for liver and brain, respectively. Prior to mapping, reads with an average base quality of less than 20 (Phred score) were discarded from the dataset. To ensure accuracy only CpGs covered by at least three reads were used for further analysis and determination of methylation levels and status. For our analysis the methylation level of a particular CpG could range continuously from 0 to 100 percent, hence methylation level of CpGs or average of genomic features could assign as frequency (&#x003b2;). The <italic>SLITRK1</italic> gene and its promoter include 132 and 32 CpG sites, respectively. Our methylation dataset covers 131-128-130-131 CpGs of SLITRK1 gene and 23-22-23-21 CpGs of SLITRK1 promoter in two liver and two brain tissues, respectively, with 128 common CpGs (97%) in the gene and 21 common CpGs (66%) in the promoter were selected for further analysis. Every CpG covers by some reads which show that this CpG is methylated or unmethylated. For example one CpG covers by 10 reads that eight of them show that this CpG is unmethylated and two of them show methylated, so the methylation percentage of this CpG is 20%. For the entire gene this also is the same. Approximately 3.6&#x000a0;kb of the <italic>SLITRK1</italic> gene body, including the coding sequence and the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; untranslated regions, was investigated for two different porcine tissues: occipital cortex and liver. In occipital cortex 219 methylated CpG reads were detected out of a total of 7059 reads yielding a methylation degree of 3.1% (<xref rid="s0095" ref-type="sec">Table S2</xref>). Similarly, in liver tissue 282 methylated reads were seen in a total of 7183 reads, i.e. a methylation degree of 3.9%. In conclusion, the methylation degree is not significantly different in liver and in brain tissue. A 849&#x000a0;bp DNA stretch in the <italic>SLITRK1</italic> promoter was also examined for methylation. In brain tissue 44 reads out of 641 were found to be methylated yielding a methylation degree of 6.9%, i.e. higher than in the gene body.

Finally, the methylation status for the <italic>SLITRK1</italic> gene, including a putative promoter region, was examined.
