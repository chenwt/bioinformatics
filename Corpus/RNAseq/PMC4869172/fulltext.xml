Mature miRNAs are produced by two sequential endonucleolytic cleavages facilitated by Drosha in the nucleus and Dicer in the cytoplasm. A subclass of miRNAs, termed mirtrons, derives from short introns and enters the miRNA biogenesis pathway as Dicer substrates. Here we uncover a third biogenesis strategy that, similar to mirtron biogenesis, initiates from short introns but bypasses Dicer cleavage. These short introns (80&#x02013;100 nucleotides), coined agotrons, are associated with and stabilized by Argonaute (Ago) proteins in the cytoplasm. Some agotrons are completely conserved in mammalian species, suggesting that they are functionally important. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the agotrons are capable of repressing mRNAs with seed-matching target sequences in the 3&#x02032;-UTR. These data provide evidence for a novel RNA regulator of gene expression, which bypasses the canonical miRNA biogenesis machinery.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms11538-i1.jpg"/>MicroRNAs are important small regulatory RNAs produced by sequential Drosha and Dicer cleavage.

After biogenesis, the miRNA is then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and directs the binding to specific regions in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;-UTR) of mRNAs by Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairing between the miRNA seed (position 2&#x02013;8) and the target<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. This promotes translational repression and ensuing mRNA destabilization by deadenylation and decapping of the targeted transcript<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. A subset of miRNAs, so-called mirtrons, bypass the initial Drosha cleavage and instead depend on splicing and debranching to produce the pre-miRNA Dicer substrate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. On Dicer cleavage the mirtrons enter the canonical miRNA pathway and are therefore functionally identical to the Drosha-dependent miRNA species. To date, one miRNA, miR-451, has been shown to be generated in a Dicer-independent manner. The endonucleolytic slicer activity of Ago2 cleaves the pre-miR-451 hairpin into a &#x0223c;30&#x02009;nt RNA, which is trimmed into a conventional &#x0223c;22&#x02009;nt miRNA-like species by 3&#x02032;-exonucleolytic activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>Here we describe a novel class of non-coding RNA species derived from introns, which we coin &#x02018;agotrons'. Unlike mirtrons, agotrons are not cleaved by Dicer and the mature form resembles the pre-miRNA. Agotrons are highly conserved in mammals and are widely associated and stabilized by Argonaute (Ago) proteins. Functionally, agotrons induce target repression in an miRNA-like manner and we identify endogenous targets for the highly conserved agotron in the last intron of the <italic>Pkd1</italic> gene.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ago2 HITS-CLIP</title><p>While analysing the Ago2-CLIP data set from mouse forebrain neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, we noticed a high density of long reads exceeding 30 nucleotides (nt) in length across short introns in <italic>Pkd1</italic>, <italic>Acadvl</italic> and <italic>Kifc2</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a&#x02013;c</xref>). This is in contrast to conventional mirtrons and miRNAs where long reads were completely absent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>) and where median read length for all expressed miRNA and mirtrons as expected were &#x0223c;22&#x02009;nt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). The accumulation of reads was highly intron specific, as neighbouring introns in the respective genes were devoid of reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d&#x02013;f</xref>). High-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) was performed with anti-FLAG antibody from the forebrain of mice with a neuron-specific FLAG-Ago2 expression or their wild-type (WT) littermate controls. When comparing reads from FLAG-Ago2 and WT data sets, it is evident that the observed introns were indeed FLAG-Ago2 specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). We analysed all the reads mapping onto annotated murine introns between 40 and 150 nucleotides to potentially recapitulate this phenomenon genome wide. We found 216 introns with at least 20 reads out of which 79 had a long median read length. Interestingly, the introns with long median read length were significantly enriched in Ago2-FLAG compared with the remaining introns with shorter reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). Apart from long read length, the Ago2-associated intronic reads aligned predominantly to the 5&#x02032;-end of the intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>), allowing a single-nucleotide offset in line with the decapitation recently observed in mirtrons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In fact, long read length and high 5&#x02032;-end homogeneity seem to be significantly coupled features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j</xref>), suggesting that these introns represent non-random biological RNA species. Hence, we propose that a subclass of Ago2-associated introns, coined &#x02018;agotrons', can be defined by long and 5&#x02032;-end aligned reads in Ago2 HITS-CLIP data sets. Similar to miRNAs, these distinct features are highly enriched in FLAG-Ago2 reads compared with other introns and small nucleolar RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1k</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1h,i</xref>). Moreover, only 3 of the 32 agotron-like species are annotated in mirbase as mirtrons and agotrons in general exhibited a higher Ago2-FLAG enrichment compared with other introns with 5&#x02032;-end aligned short reads annotated mostly as mirtrons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>). Collectively, abundant agotrons are distinguishable from other intronic regions by exhibiting long read length and a high fraction of 5&#x02032;-end aligned reads in the Ago2 HITS-CLIP data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j</xref>). Using these characteristics, we scrutinized other HITS-CLIP data sets, to validate these Ago2-associated introns. Based on HITS-CLIP data from Darnell's lab<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, which is performed using an Ago2 antibody against the endogenous Ago2 protein from total embryonic mouse brain, we again observed the presence of agotron-like short introns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). In fact, a noteworthy overlap between the highly abundant introns with 5&#x02032;-aligned long reads was observed between the two data set (for example, <italic>Acadvl</italic>, <italic>Grin1</italic> and <italic>Mast1</italic>). In the HITS-CLIP procedure, the Ago2&#x02013;RNA complex weighs 110 or 130&#x02009;kDa depending on the length of the Ago2-associated RNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The agotrons were highly enriched in the 130-kDa fraction compared with miRNAs that predominantly accumulate in the 110-kDa fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b&#x02013;d</xref>), emphasizing that these species are indeed longer than conventional miRNAs. Similar analyses on other murine Ago2 HITS-CLIP experiments using endogenous Ago2 immunoprecipitation (IP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> also revealed the presence of agotron-like species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>), demonstrating that these are not artefacts of FLAG-Ago2 expression. Two recurring agotrons, <italic>Pkd1</italic> and <italic>Mast1</italic>, showed a remarkable cross-species conservation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>) and a peculiar secondary structure predicted by LocARNA-P<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c,d</xref>). In fact, the last intron of the <italic>Pkd1</italic> gene, which is the agotron-producing intron, has been characterized as more conserved than the protein-coding region of the host gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Therefore, we turned to human Ago HITS-CLIP data sets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> based on either pan-Ago IP or Ago2-specific IP, to disclose agotron-like species further (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Here, <italic>PKD1</italic> and <italic>MAST1</italic> were once again classified as agotrons in most data sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c&#x02013;g</xref>). In case of data sets lacking <italic>PKD1</italic> or <italic>MAST1</italic> validation, this was due to lack of expression and not lack of agotron features. In addition, other reoccurring human-specific and non-conserved agotrons, for example, <italic>IVD</italic> and <italic>SLC4A2</italic> emerged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c&#x02013;g</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Agotrons are stabilized by Ago proteins</title><p>To validate the HITS-CLIP data, we selected three murine agotrons: <italic>Pkd1</italic>, <italic>Acadvl</italic> and <italic>Kifc2</italic>. We constructed minigene vectors comprising the agotron-containing intron and the immediate flanking exons (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). The constructed minigenes were then transfected with or without Ago2 co-transfection into HEK293 cells. All three agotrons produced a distinct product migrating according to linear, full-length intron sizes (94, 85 and 73&#x02009;nt, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>); however, the agotrons were almost solely detectable on Ago2 co-expression, suggesting that without Ago2, the agotrons are either inefficiently spliced or inherently unstable. To test the former hypothesis, we assayed the relative levels of spliced minigene in the presence or absence of Ago2 co-expression by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT&#x02013;PCR) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). Here, the ratio between spliced and unspliced were unchanged irrespective of Ago2 expression, suggesting that Ago2 has a stabilizing effect on the agotrons, which also is in agreement with the high Ago2&#x02013;agotron association seen in various HITS-CLIP data. For all of the agotrons analysed, we failed to detect RNA fragments in the mature miRNA size range. In subsequent analyses, we focused on <italic>Pkd1</italic> as a highly abundant and conserved representative of agotrons. First, we performed Ago2 IP to validate the interaction between Ago2 and <italic>Pkd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Here, the <italic>Pkd1</italic>-derived agotron was efficiently immunoprecipitated similar to the endogenously expressed miR-15b, whereas U6 was not enriched in Ago2 IP fractions. Furthermore, Ago2 only associates with the excised intron and not the unspliced transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>), suggesting that Ago2 prefers an accessible 5&#x02032;-end in agreement with Ago crystal structures showing a binding pocket for 5&#x02032;-ends at the interface between the PIWI and MID domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. To determine whether the observed interaction was Ago2 specific, we co-transfected the <italic>Pkd1</italic> agotron with Ago1 expression plasmid. Here, similar to Ago2, stabilization of <italic>Pkd1</italic> agotron is observed, suggesting that at least this agotron has no Ago1/2 preference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). Based on combined fluorescence <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridization/immunofluorescence using five tiled cy5-labelled probes for the <italic>Pkd1</italic>-derived agotron and antibodies against the processing body marker hDcp1a<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, we observed a clear cytoplasmic co-localization between the agotron and processing bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), which is unusual for intronic RNAs, but known to be enriched in Ago-loaded complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Without Ago2 or <italic>Pkd1</italic> overexpression, no agotron signal was observed. Cellular fractionation also revealed an enrichment of <italic>Pkd1</italic> agotron in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). However, surprisingly, the agotron was also clearly detectable in the nuclear fraction, but only on Ago2 co-expression, suggesting either that the Ago2&#x02013;agotron complex is imported after association, or that Ago2 interacts and stabilizes the agotron already in the nucleus. Finally, the stabilizing effect of Ago2 was abolished in a concentration-dependent manner on co-transfection with small interfering RNA and, to a lesser extent, with single-stranded RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>), indicating, as expected, that agotrons and small interfering RNA compete for the same binding domain on Ago2.</p><p>To elucidate the sequence requirement for the Ago2 interaction, we constructed a series of <italic>Pkd1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>). As it has been proposed that Ago2 has a preference for G-rich regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, we mutated a stretch of G's (Mt1) to determine whether this was important for Ago2 association. Here, no agotron production was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>); however, the introduced mutation disrupted splicing and the Ago2 association was therefore unresolved. Another mutation (Mt2) disrupts the distal stem without changing the nucleotide composition. Here, the mutation had no noticeable effect on splicing, but no agotron production was observed, suggesting that distal stem is required for agotrons to become associated with and stabilized by Ago2. However, a more subtle mutation in the distal stem (Mt3) exhibited agotron production similar to WT <italic>Pkd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5f</xref>). Finally, when mutating the splice donor (GU-&#x0003e;CU), splicing is unproductive and consequently no agotron is observed as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Collectively, for agotrons to be associated with and stabilized by Ago2, specific structural requirements seem important that are yet to be thoroughly and systematically disclosed.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Agotrons repress target genes in a miRNA-like manner</title><p>To assess whether agotrons are capable of target gene suppression in a miRNA-like manner, we constructed luciferase reporter constructs (psiCheck vectors) harbouring in the 3&#x02032;-UTR a stretch of perfect complementary nucleotides towards either the 5&#x02032;-part (1&#x02013;47) or the 3&#x02032;-part (48&#x02013;94) of the <italic>Pkd1</italic> agotron. Here, co-expressing the psiCheck vectors with Ago2 and <italic>Pkd1</italic> showed a potent suppression of the 5&#x02032;-part complementary reporter, but not the 3&#x02032;-part reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Dissecting the target preference further revealed that only reporters containing the complementary sequence of the first 20&#x02009;nt (1&#x02013;20) of the 94&#x02009;nt agotron were susceptible for suppression, whereas the expression of constructs containing the downstream 20 nt (21&#x02013;40) was not affected by <italic>Pkd1</italic> agotron expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This was also observed for the <italic>Acadvl</italic> agotron (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). In fact, the <italic>Pkd1</italic> agotron was able to suppress a reporter harbouring three consecutive miRNA-like 8mer seed matches (3 &#x000d7; (2&#x02013;8), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This suggests that agotrons discriminate targets from non-targets similar to conventional miRNAs, governed predominantly by seed matches. To construct a <italic>Pkd1</italic> mutant with a modified seed, we introduced a TA&#x0003e;AT mutation into the region encoding the non-basepaired loop of the 5&#x02032;-part of <italic>Pkd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>) and designed a corresponding luciferase seed reporter. Unfortunately, this Pkd1 mutant was not expressed, potentially due to interference with splicing or Ago2 binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>); however, expression of WT <italic>Pkd1</italic> was unable to confer repression of the luciferase seed reporter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6d</xref>).</p><p>To identify potential endogenous targets, we expressed Ago2 with or without co-expression of the <italic>Pkd1</italic> agotron in HEK293 cells and performed RNAseq on total RNA. Here, a significant decrease of genes harbouring a putative 8mer or 7mers (7mer-m8 or 7mer-1A) in the 3&#x02032;-UTR was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The most effectively suppressed class of genes was the conserved subset of 7mers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, green), corroborating the high cross-species conservation of <italic>Pkd1</italic>. We also sequenced the Ago2 IP fractions with or without <italic>Pkd1</italic> co-expression, to determine whether putative targets are enriched. Importantly, the RNAs harbouring conserved <italic>Pkd1</italic> target sites displayed a clear enrichment, while a general selective enrichment of all putative target genes was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Based on &#x02018;sliding seed' windows, the <italic>Pkd1</italic> agotron has a clear effect on targets harbouring 7-nt matches with flanking A towards the 5&#x02032;-end region of the agotron (Seeds: 2-8A, 3-9A and 4-10A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a,b</xref>). The strong deregulation and Ago2 association of 3-9A seed targets possibly reflect that the flanking A opposes the U in position 2 of the agotrons. Therefore, we also performed 8-nt complementary matches but with no constrain on the flanking nucleotide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7c,d</xref>). This showed a clear preference for two to nine seed matches and suggests that an extended seed, at least for <italic>Pkd1</italic>, is favoured.</p><p>One selected target gene candidate with a conserved 8mer site in the 3&#x02032;-UTR, <italic>TAL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), was selectively downregulated in total RNA and co-immunoprecipitated in <italic>Pkd1</italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Testing the putative 8mer in a luciferase reporter assay revealed a modest but significant repression of relative luminescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Collectively, this suggests that agotrons are a new class of functional Ago-associated non-coding RNAs with miRNA-like capabilities.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Agotrons are Dicer independent</title><p>Based on HITS-CLIP and northern blot analyses, agotrons exist predominantly as full-length introns. However, if processed into small RNA by Dicer, this would indiscriminate agotrons from conventional mirtrons and the observed suppressive effect on target genes could be facilitated by an inefficiently produced and undetectable fraction of miRNA-sized agotrons. To test whether Dicer is required for the observed agotron-mediated knockdown effect, we initially turned to the Ago2 HITS-CLIP data set from WT and Dicer knockout (KO) murine embryonic stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Only three introns were here classified as agotrons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>), but in all three cases the Ago2 association was enriched in Dicer KO cells, whereas miRNA reads in general are depleted in Dicer KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Furthermore, small RNA sequencing of WT murine embryonic stem cell showed practically no agotron-derived reads compared with HITS-CLIP, whereas miRNA counts in WT HITS-CLIP and small RNA sequencing were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p><p>To further disclose the role of Dicer in agotron biogenesis and function, we turned to Dicer-null HEK293T cells (HEK293T NoDice 2-20 and HEK293 NoDice 4-25) that have been previously established<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Here, the expression of <italic>Pkd1</italic> agotron was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>), whereas the biogenesis of a transiently expressed miR-151 was completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Measuring the knockdown potential of agotrons in the Dicer-null background, the agotron remained functional on a 5&#x02032;-complementary target site and incapable of targeting 3&#x02032;-complementary sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>) similar to effects observed in the parental HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In fact, the suppressive effect of the <italic>Pkd1</italic> agotron increased slightly in the Dicer-null background, probably due to reduced competition for Ago2 binding.</p><p>This strongly suggests that Dicer is not involved in agotron-mediated repression, which consolidates agotrons as a new Dicer-independent class of short regulatory RNAs. This also explains why the vast majority of agotrons (that is, introns with 5&#x02032;-end aligned long HITS-CLIP reads) are not found in small RNA sequencing libraries and therefore are excluded from the miRBase. miR-151a has an almost unbiased strand selection between the 5<italic>p</italic> and 3<italic>p</italic> arm. Accordingly, in WT HEK293T cells, both the 5<italic>p</italic> and 3<italic>p</italic> reporters are efficiently repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). In Dicer-null cells (Dicer 2-20), the 3<italic>p</italic> reporter is practically unaffected by miR-151a co-expression, whereas the 5<italic>p</italic> reporter remains suppressed albeit at lower efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). This suggests that the &#x02018;undiced' pre-miR-151a still has the capacity to function as an agotron-like species, but the target reservoir is restricted to the 5<italic>p</italic> arm. Therefore, the miRNA maturation by Dicer cleavage could in part be required for the liberation and activation of the 3<italic>p</italic> arm, which in the pre-miRNA (non-diced) context is completely inert.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Characterization of agotrons</title><p>Defining agotrons as short introns &#x0003c;150&#x02009;nts with long (&#x02265;30&#x02009;nt), 5&#x02032;-end aligned (&#x02265;70&#x00025;) Ago2 HITS-CLIP reads we combined all the data sets analysed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>), to compile a more comprehensive list of putative agotrons. For both human and mouse, we selected all the introns that were expressed (&#x02265;20 reads) in at least two data sets. These introns were classified as agotrons if at least half and a minimum of two HITS-CLIP data sets adhered to the above definition. This resulted in 87 and 18 agotrons in human and mouse, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). As a class, agotrons exhibit a more restricted length distribution compared with all short introns and other expressed non-agotron introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Moreover, for both human and mouse, the putative agotrons are significantly more structured measured by predicted free energy and also significantly more GC-rich, compared with other introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>). Finally, based on the human set, agotrons are significantly more conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Even though the abundance of agotrons is generally low compared with highly expressed miRNAs, the expression levels of agotrons are very similar to mirtrons based on HITS-CLIP read per million (RPM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a,b</xref>), which probably reflect the shared biogenesis pathway. Collectively, this indicates that agotrons represent a defined family of introns that, as a class, is preserved in evolution and therefore constitutes a hitherto overlooked family of short non-coding RNA with regulatory potential.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have characterized a novel class of short regulatory RNA, the agotrons. Unlike known Ago-associated RNA species, agotrons escape the conventional biogenesis pathway entirely and associates with Ago proteins as an unprocessed, full-length intron. We believe that agotrons are debranched introns based on the following features: (1) no branch-point traversing reads in the HITS-CLIP are detected. (2) Ago2 has been shown to associate with free 5&#x02032;-ends<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and (3) the northern blotting analyses of agotrons adhere with full-length linear and not lariat RNA migration. The discrepancy between the observed median read length in HITS-CLIP data and northern blot migration of agotrons is probably due to the sequence length of the libraries and the RNAse digestion used in HITS-CLIP to accurately footprint the Ago-associated region.</p><p>Agotron targeting is governed by seed interactions similar to miRNAs; however, the potency is somewhat limited. The modest repression of seed-mediated targeting could be explained by the very stable secondary structure of the <italic>Pkd1</italic> agotron hairpin that must dissociate to allow the agotron-target interaction. This probably provides agotrons with a much more limited target repertoire compared with miRNAs and are possibly less prone to unwanted off-targeting, which potentially could be exploited in agotron-inspired RNA interference. The optimal sequence- and structural requirements for agotron behaviour is currently unknown and remains to be further explored. We observe that the <italic>Pkd1</italic> agotron acts independently of Dicer. In fact, in Dicer-null cells the agotron functions more effectively and without the co-expression of Ago2. This indicates that the elimination of Dicer-dependent Ago2 substrates results in an increased pool of free Ago2 and thus a more efficient Ago2 association and elevated effect on Dicer-independent substrates, such as agotrons.</p><p>Even though agotron-mediated target gene repression can be demonstrated in cell lines, the biological relevance of agotrons could also be a surveillance mechanism to avoid unwanted RNA associating with the free Ago proteins. This would increase the specificity and fidelity of Ago-loading to <italic>bona fide</italic> substrates and explain why agotrons are hardly detectable without an excess of Ago proteins.</p><p>In humans, the conserved <italic>PKD1</italic> agotron is annotated as a mirtron, miR-1225, which has previously been suggested to be splicing independent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In that study, expression analysis of miR-1225 is based on RT&#x02013;PCR and not northern blotting, which disables efficient demarcation between long and short RNA templates. We believe that the <italic>Pkd1</italic> agotron exists as a full-length intron consistent with all HITS-CLIP data analysed and with our functional results.</p><p>Conclusively, we provide evidence for the existence of a new class of short (&#x0223c;80&#x02013;100&#x02009;nt) intronic RNA that has the potential to regulate gene expression in a miRNA-like manner. These species escape conventional small RNA profiling and therefore constitute overlooked biological molecules that, similar to miRNAs, could play key roles in differentiation and disease.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>CLIP analysis</title><p>Sequence reads from published HITS-CLIP experiments (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>) were initially adaptor trimmed and reads below 18 nts in length were discarded. Subsequently, reads were aligned while allowing for one mismatch to annotated murine (UCSC gene annotation, mm10) or human (UCSC gene annotation, hg19) introns between 40 and 150 nucleotides in length, annotated pre-miRNAs (mirbase v. 21) or small nucleolar RNAs extracted from Ensembl BioMart. Mirtrons were defined as short introns (between 40 and 150&#x02009;nts) annotated in mirbase. The number of aligned reads, the median read length and, for introns, the fraction of reads aligning within one nucleotide of the 5&#x02032;-end was determined. RPM was calculated for individual samples and the average RPM for each data set was used as measurement of expression. Only regions with at least 20 reads in total were included in the analysis.
