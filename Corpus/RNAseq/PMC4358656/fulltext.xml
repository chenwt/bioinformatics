B-lymphocyte population dynamics, which are predictive of immune response and vaccine effectiveness, are determined by individual cells undergoing division or death seemingly stochastically. Based on tracking single-cell time-lapse trajectories of hundreds of B cells, single-cell transcriptome, and immunofluorescence analyses, we constructed an agent-based multi-modular computational model to simulate lymphocyte population dynamics in terms of the molecular networks that control NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Combining modeling and experimentation, we found that NF-&#x003ba;B&#x000a0;cRel enforces the execution of a cellular decision between mutually exclusive fates by promoting survival in growing cells. But as cRel deficiency causes growing B cells to die at similar rates to non-growing cells, our analysis reveals that the phenomenological decision model of wild-type cells is rooted in a biased race of cell fates. We show that a multi-scale modeling approach allows for the prediction of dynamic organ-level physiology in terms of intra-cellular molecular networks.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>B-lymphocyte</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>cell fate decision</kwd><kwd>NF-&#x003ba;B cRel</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>B-lymphocytes are central to immune responses as producers of antibodies and mediators of immunological memory. Upon recognition of specific antigens or pathogen-derived &#x02018;danger&#x02019; signals, B cells may enter a proliferative program (Murphy <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). This physiological process can be recapitulated <italic>ex vivo</italic> using agonists of the B-cell receptor or Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize specific pathogen-derived substances. Such agonists elicit a dynamic population response in which individual cells may undergo several rounds of cell division, exit the cell cycle and/or die by programmed cell death (Rawlings <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Indeed, while the population response is generally robustly reproducible and predictable, the behavior of individual cells is seemingly stochastic. In each generation, only a fraction of cells divide, while others die, and the timing of division and death is highly variable, typically well-modeled by long-tailed log-normal distributions and resulting in a spectrum of many generations at any given time point after stimulation (Hawkins <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2007b</xref>, <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>Given the physiological and pathological importance of the B-cell response, the underlying biochemical processes involved in transducing receptor signals, cell growth, cell cycling, and programmed cell death by apoptosis have been well studied (recently reviewed in Browne, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Gerondakis &#x00026; Siebenlist, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Link &#x00026; Hurlin, <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Renault &#x00026; Chipuk, <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Their involvement in B-cell expansion has been characterized by measuring population cell numbers or apoptotic cells, bulk replicative activity (by measuring DNA synthesis), or distributions of generational cell counts at given time points (by dye dilution studies coupled to FACS). For example, deficiency in the NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factor cRel was reported to result in a substantially reduced B-population response, due to deficiencies in cell-cycle entry and cell survival (Gerondakis <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Grumont <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Further, potential cRel-dependent mediators of these processes have been identified, such as the genes coding for CyclinD (Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Guttridge <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Huang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), Myc (Duyao <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>), and Bcl<sub>XL</sub> (Chen <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Yet, how these functions coordinately produce the dynamics of the population response, the generation-specific distributions, or fate control at the individual cell level remains poorly understood.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the time to the first division is substantially longer than that of subsequent divisions, and the timing of cell death is also generation dependent (Hawkins <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Yet there are competing theories for how fate (i.e., whether the cell divides or dies) is determined. Some studies invoke a molecular race hypothesis, which posits that processes leading to cell division and apoptosis are proceeding concurrently within cells, with the faster of the two determining the outcomes (Hawkins <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2007b</xref>; Duffy <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>); however, other observations support the notion that cells decide their fate prior to it being manifest (Hawkins <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Shokhirev &#x00026; Hoffmann, <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In particular, the cyton (Hawkins <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2007b</xref>) and fcyton (Shokhirev &#x00026; Hoffmann, <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) age- and generation-structured models describe lymphocyte population dynamics assuming a molecular race or decision between division and death, respectively. Further, it is unclear what the determinants are for the variability in timing which in the former but not the latter model underlies the variability of cell fate determination. Previous studies offer evidence that the inherent variability in timing of receptor-induced apoptosis of transformed liver cells is caused primarily by cell-to-cell variability in the steady state (Gaudet <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Recent advances in single-cell analysis and modeling render answers to these questions within reach. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy, which provide snapshots of a few attributes of the cells within a population, may be complemented with single-cell mRNA sequencing, which provides transcriptome-wide measurements, and live cell microscopy, which provides longitudinal information at single-cell resolution; however, challenges in data analysis and integration persist. Interestingly, kinetic models that capture the dynamic control of molecular networks can function as platforms for data integration and provide a predictive understanding; for example, iterative experimental and modeling studies have delineated numerous negative and positive feedback loops that control the dynamics of NF-&#x003ba;B (Basak <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), or identified determinants of cell-cycle progression (Conradie <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and cell death/survival fate decisions (Loriaux <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Here, we aimed to construct a multi-modular mathematical model that accounts for B-cell population dynamics in terms of intra-cellular molecular network dynamics. Starting at the B-cell population scale, we employed carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) flow cytometry and live time-lapse microscopy tracking of cell lineages to characterize the model topology and parameters at the cell biological scale. Starting at the molecular network scale, we used single-cell RNAseq and quantitative immunofluorescence to characterize the connections between several regulatory molecular network modules (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Developing a multi-scale understanding of the B-cell immune response</title><p>We employed a multi-scale approach to studying the B-cell response.

Single-cell molecular assays provided insights into the upregulation of key molecular players upon activation within individual cells. The number of cells in each generation was measured by the division tracking dye CFSE and deconvoluted into maximum-likelihood cellular parameters using the FlowMax computational tool. We used our observations to parameterize a multi-scale agent-based mathematical model consisting of established modules for signaling, apoptosis, and the cell cycle which allowed us to mechanistically study molecular perturbations on population dynamics.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="msb0011-0783-f1"/></fig><sec><title>Time-lapse microscopy reveals generation-specific single-cell behavior</title><p>In order to obtain cell lineage information that accounts for the population response, we tracked 1,295 live primary B cells using a time-lapse microscopy pipeline (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2A</xref>). We developed a semi-automated image analysis method, combining the advantages of computational automation and human input to minimize errors (see Materials and Methods). Analysis of wild-type B cells responding to high CpG stimulation confirmed the expected population expansion followed by a contraction period (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2B</xref>). After cells that died from mechanical death in the initial phase (Hawkins <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2007a</xref>) were filtered out (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Supplementary Fig S1A and B</xref>), we found that approximately 38% of the starting, &#x02018;generation 0&#x02019;, cells divided; then, 85% of generation 1 cells divided with subsequent generations, showing a steady decrease in this fraction such that only 9% of cells divided in generation 6 (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2C</xref>). To quantify the cellular response, we classified cell size trajectories into two categories: (i) cells that grew by at least 350&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup> (representing at least two standard deviations on average, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Supplementary Fig S1C</xref>) or reached a final size of at least 800&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup> (based on the bimodal size distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Supplementary Fig S1D</xref>) and to ensure that large generation 1+ cells are included), dubbed &#x02018;growers&#x02019; and (ii) cells that did not meet these criteria, dubbed &#x02018;non-growers&#x02019; (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2D</xref>). To test the sensitivity of the growth threshold, we repeated the quantification with a 25% lower and higher growth threshold, revealing that few cells exhibited ambiguous growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Supplementary Fig S1E</xref>). Averaging the growth trajectories of &#x02018;growers&#x02019; (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2E</xref>) and &#x02018;non-growers&#x02019; (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2F</xref>) in each generation normalized by percent cell lifespan revealed that progenitors (generation 0) that grew exhibited a growth delay followed by rapid growth to approximately fivefold their starting size, while generation 1+ growers did not exhibit the delay phase, and started growing immediately after mitosis. Furthermore, &#x02018;grower&#x02019; cells generally grew to the same size on average in all generations except prior to their final division. While &#x02018;non-growers&#x02019; by definition did not exhibit significant growth (as defined above), they nevertheless typically exhibited some growth.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Time-lapse microscopy reveals two distinct generation-dependent growth patterns for B cells</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>A Overview of the time-lapse microscopy experimental and analysis pipeline.

For each generation, we counted the fraction of &#x02018;growers&#x02019; that divided and died within a 24-h period: 12&#x02013;36&#x000a0;h in generation 0 or 0&#x02013;24&#x000a0;h in generations 1+ (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3C</xref>), as well as the fraction of &#x02018;non-growers&#x02019; that divided and died within the same periods for each generation (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3D</xref>). Our results indicate that virtually all &#x02018;growers&#x02019; in the first four generations divided, supporting the notion of an early decision that predisposes B cells to a particular fate (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3B</xref>). Interestingly, following the first generation, there was a significant fraction of cells that divided that had been classified as &#x02018;non-growers&#x02019;; however, such poor growth almost always occurred in the last division (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd2">Supplementary Fig S2</xref>). To further test this important distinction, we noted the time point at which growth starts (Tgro), the time to division (Tdiv), and time to death (Tdie) of progenitor cells and calculated the expected lower-bound probability that a dying cell would have grown, provided a &#x02018;molecular race&#x02019; or &#x02018;decision&#x02019; model (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3E</xref> and F). Our analysis revealed that even under relatively relaxed assumptions, the data are inconsistent with both processes occurring simultaneously in cells (i.e., race). A decision model, which commits cells to either fate, is more consistent with the observed behavior. In other words, because time to death is typically earlier than time to division (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3E</xref>), and because time to start growing, Tgro, is typically much earlier than Tdiv or Tdie, our analysis predicts most cells would grow prior to death if the two processes were indeed running in parallel as implied by the &#x02018;race&#x02019; model.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>B cells decide to divide or die and are protected from the alternate fate</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>

CFSE-stained B cells were stimulated with CpG, and fluorescence histograms indicative of each generation were analyzed by the software tool FlowMax (Shokhirev &#x00026; Hoffmann, <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) to identify maximum-likelihood cellular parameters. Employing either the cyton model (which assumes that responding cells may die, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd3">Supplementary Fig S3B</xref>) or the fcyton model (which assumes that they do not, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd3">Supplementary Fig S3C</xref>), we asked which derived cellular parameters best agreed with those observed by time-lapse microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd3">Supplementary Fig S3D</xref>). While both models accurately fit the CFSE time course (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd3">Supplementary Fig S3E</xref>), the race (cyton) model requires a much longer distribution for Tdie<sub>0</sub> than the decision (fcyton) model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd3">Supplementary Fig S3F</xref>); shorter Tdie<sub>0</sub> parameters are more consistent with the experimental microscopy dataset.</p><p>While our results suggest that cell fate is determined early, it is unclear what contributes to the cell-to-cell variability. Recent studies have shown that extrinsic variability in cell states rather than intrinsic signaling noise can account for variability in cell fate decision in mammalian cells (Spencer <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Lee <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). As recently divided sibling cells have more similar cell states, we determined whether fate and timing are more correlated between related cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd4">Supplementary Fig S4</xref>). Indeed, sister cells were observed to undergo the same fate approximately 90% of the time, while cousin cells were more likely to experience different fates in all generations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd4">Supplementary Fig S4A</xref>). Further, the timing of the decision process, interdivision time, and to a smaller extent lifespan were significantly correlated between sister cells: Pr(&#x00394;Tgro&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;h)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.90, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.74, and <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.39, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd4">Supplementary Fig S4B&#x02013;D</xref>).

NF-&#x003ba;B cRel abundances of purified na&#x000ef;ve B cells stimulated with 250 nM CpG for 24&#x000a0;h were obtained by quantifying average fluorescence in fixed B cells stained with anti-cRel antibody conjugated to fluorophore, or anti-Bcl<sub>XL</sub> antibody bound to a fluorescent secondary antibody (A bottom). The 0-h average fluorescence was used to determine significant upregulation of NF-&#x003ba;B cRel (F), growth regulator Myc (H), and anti-apoptotic regulator Bcl<sub>XL</sub> (J) at 24&#x000a0;h (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05).

We found that compared to a 0&#x000a0;h control, B cells were larger (63% of cells) and had higher cRel abundance (63% of cells) after 24&#x000a0;h of stimulation. Furthermore, 68% of large cells had upregulated cRel at 24&#x000a0;h. To confirm the specificity of our analysis, we showed that cRel-deficient B cells had no detectable cRel fluorescence at 24&#x000a0;h (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4G</xref>). Similarly to NF-&#x003ba;B cRel, approximately 50% of cells showed significantly increased levels of NF-&#x003ba;B RelA after 24&#x000a0;h, with approximately 56% of large cells showing increased NF-&#x003ba;B RelA abundance after 24&#x000a0;h of stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd5">Supplementary Fig S5A</xref>). Staining for Myc, a master transcriptional regulator of cell growth and known NF-&#x003ba;B target gene, we revealed that 57% of cells had upregulated Myc levels at 24&#x000a0;h compared to 0&#x000a0;h, and 62% of large cells had elevated Myc levels (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4H</xref>). Upon NF-&#x003ba;B cRel deletion, only 35% of cells had elevated Myc levels (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4I</xref>). Similarly, BcL<sub>XL</sub>, a known NF-&#x003ba;B cRel target gene and anti-apoptotic regulator, was found to be elevated primarily in large cells (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4J</xref>). Whereas BcL<sub>XL</sub> was upregulated in 85% of large cells, only 8% of all large cells upregulated BcL<sub>XL</sub> in the absence of cRel (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4K</xref>). Quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR confirmed that BcL<sub>XL</sub> was upregulated at the mRNA level and that NF-&#x003ba;B cRel contributes about two-third of the BcL<sub>XL</sub> expression at 20&#x000a0;h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd5">Supplementary Fig S5B</xref>).</p><p>Repeating the immunofluorescence analysis in the presence of 1&#x000a0;ng/ml rapamycin, a known mTORc1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd5">Supplementary Fig S5C</xref>), we found the same fraction of cells had upregulated cRel abundance after 24&#x000a0;h of stimulation, though the fraction of large cells was reduced, suggesting that cRel upregulation is independent of mTORc1. Conversely, we tested the role of NF-&#x003ba;B cRel in regulating mTORc1 and found that the abundance of p-S6, an indicator of mTORc1 activity, by immunoblot was reduced by approximately a factor of 2 in NF-&#x003ba;B cRel-deficient B cells (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4K</xref>), though cell growth itself was not substantially diminished presumably due to compensatory mechanisms including NF-&#x003ba;B family members RelA and RelB. Our analysis supports a model in which NF-&#x003ba;B is a regulator of both cell survival and cell growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Constructing a multi-scale model to predict B-cell population dynamics</title><p>The described analyses of CFSE time courses, time-lapse microscopy, and molecular studies led us to test whether B-cell population dynamics may be accounted for with a mathematical model of intra-cellular molecular networks that exist in cell-specific steady states due to biochemical variability. We implemented established ordinary differential equation (ODE) kinetic models of the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling system (Alves <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), apoptotic control network (Loriaux <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and the cell cycle (Conradie <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd6">Supplementary Fig S6A</xref>). Introducing sources of extrinsic variability, we found that variability in protein levels alone was sufficient to produce cell-to-cell variability in nuclear NF-&#x003ba;B concentration, cell-cycle duration, and lifetime typically observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd6">Supplementary Fig S6B</xref>). Importantly, the cell-cycle model with added sources of extrinsic noise produced relatively short cell-cycle durations of &#x0223d;10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;h, similar to generation 1+ cells, but did not readily account for the generation 0 delay (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>). Further, we found that introducing extrinsic protein variability resulted in substantial cell growth variability.</p><p>Based on our molecular analysis, we constructed an integrated ODE model (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd10">Supplementary Methods</xref>) with NF-&#x003ba;B-controlled synthesis of BcL<sub>XL</sub>, a key regulator in the apoptosis module, as well as NF-&#x003ba;B-controlled synthesis of CycD, a key regulator in the cell-cycle module. Furthermore, in the cell-cycle module, growth is controlled by general machinery (GM), which represents the ribosomes and other cellular components that promote the accumulation of cell mass. Mass in turn promotes the growth of general machinery, creating a positive feedback loop that results in exponential growth and cellular progression through the cell cycle. However, since we observed B cells to delay growth prior to the first division (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>), we needed to model the control of general machinery (GM) in more detail. Hence, we incorporated NF-&#x003ba;B-controlled synthesis of Myc, a transcription factor that promotes cell growth, which is typically low in quiescent cells but a known NF-&#x003ba;B target gene. To obtain population dynamics, the integrated ODE model was incorporated into cellular agents (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5B</xref>), which kept track of their generation, age, and independent set of starting synthesis/degradation or total protein concentrations, which were drawn from normal or log-normal distributions, respectively. The models were solved until the agent died [defined as (cPARP)&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;25,000&#x000a0;molecules/cell] or completed mitosis [(cdh1)&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.2], at which point it was removed or replaced by two new daughter agents, respectively. We subjected daughter agents to extrinsic re-mixing noise to account for loss of correlation with successive generations. When training the model on our results from the wild-type condition, we retained the value of all published NF-&#x003ba;B, cell-cycle, and apoptosis parameters, leaving a set of free parameters specifying Bcl<sub>XL</sub>, CycD, and Myc transcript synthesis and degradation, as well as parameters controlling the growth and survival of cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd10">Supplementary Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd9">Supplementary Table S9</xref>).

In particular, we examined the population behavior in B cells exposed to reduced stimulus concentrations in the absence of NF-&#x003ba;B cRel, or when treated with the cell growth inhibitor rapamycin (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6A</xref>). Model predictions were compared to time-lapse microscopy experiments in which the same conditions were applied. First, we simulated the low dose stimulation condition by allowing for a faster decay of the active IKK species (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd9">Supplementary Table S9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd10">Supplementary Methods</xref>). The model predicted a dramatic decrease in the total B-cell population (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">B</xref>), resulting from a decrease in the fraction of cells that divide in generations 3+ (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6C</xref>); however, cell size trajectories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd7">Supplementary Fig S7B and C</xref>) and fate timing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd7">Supplementary Fig S7D&#x02013;F</xref>) were unaffected. An equivalent analysis of subsequent time-lapse experiments confirmed these predictions (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">B</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd7">Supplementary Fig S7</xref>), although the model predicted a later peak in total cell counts (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd9">Supplementary Table S11</xref>). Next, we simulated cRel deficiency by setting the translation rate of the cRel protein to zero. The multi-scale model recapitulated a decreased population response (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">E</xref>) previously observed, but now showed that this is caused primarily by a reduction in the number of divisions (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6F</xref>). Model simulations suggest that cell growth is not cRel dependent since cRel-deficient cells had highly correlated growth trajectories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd7">Supplementary Fig S7B and C</xref>). Furthermore, the model predicted that NF-&#x003ba;B cRel deficiency would not affect timing of the decision, division, or death processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd7">Supplementary Fig S7D&#x02013;F</xref>), but that a higher percentage of growing cells would die (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">G</xref>). A side-by-side comparison with the results from experimental cell tracking of cRel-deficient cells confirmed these predictions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd9">Supplementary Table S11</xref>). Finally, treatment with rapamycin, the inhibitor of mTOR, which results in defective cell growth and ribosome biosynthesis, as well as a decrease in cells that divide more than once (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">I</xref>), was recapitulated well by simply decreasing the global protein translation rate by 30% (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6A</xref>, H&#x02013;J).

In this analysis, we distinguished between negative regulators of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling (the I&#x003ba;Bs), the positive regulators (IKK and the NF-&#x003ba;B monomers RelA, p50, and cRel), or both, as well as apoptosis and cell-cycle regulators, or all proteins (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8A</xref>). Increased average abundance (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8B</xref>) was achieved by increasing the translation rate or the total protein abundance (if constant) by 10 or 50%, respectively, while increased protein variability (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8C</xref>) was achieved by doubling the coefficient of variation (CV) of the translation rate or total protein abundance (if constant). As expected, moderately increasing the average protein abundance resulted in dramatic changes to the population dynamics (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8D</xref>), as long as the positive regulators were among those affected (blue, purple, and gray conditions). Our analysis indicates that this is primarily caused by an increase in the number of division rounds that progenitors underwent (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8E</xref>), as well as due to typically shorter interdivision times (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8F</xref>).

As such, ABMs have been successfully utilized to provide insights into the dynamics of the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling system (Pogson <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), wound healing (Walker <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), the multi-scale effects of acute inflammation (An, <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), the implications of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (Jiao <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and the evolution of aging (Shokhirev &#x00026; Johnson, <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of an established framework for multi-scale B-cell modeling, we took a parsimonious approach toward model construction. Since the number of parameters typically scales nonlinearly with the size of the model, our strategy was to use previously established models and manually parameterize the connections between them based on experimental studies following genetic or pharmacological perturbations. While numerous regulators of B-cell signaling and proliferation have been identified, we focused here (for the purposes of this first version of a B-cell ABM) on the stimulus-responsive NF-&#x003ba;B signaling system as a key determinant of B-cell population dynamics (Pohl <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Several important regulators are known NF-&#x003ba;B target genes (Duyao <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Chen <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Guttridge <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Huang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>); however, how they function together to produce the observed population dynamics remained poorly understood. We took both an unbiased approach by sequencing the transcriptomes of small cells and growing cells, and a targeted approach via single-cell measurements of key proteins by immunofluorescence. While there was significant cell-to-cell transcriptome variability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd9">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), there was a clear NF-&#x003ba;B signaling signature in large but not small cells (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>), indicating that the fate variability may originate upstream of the NF-&#x003ba;B system. Indeed, NF-&#x003ba;B cRel and RelA are upregulated after 24&#x000a0;h of stimulation in large but not small cells (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd5">Supplementary Fig S5A</xref>), causing the upregulation of the growth regulator Myc (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4H</xref> and I) and the anti-apoptotic regulator Bcl<sub>XL</sub> (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4J</xref> and K) and the activity of the metabolic regulator mTORc1 (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4L</xref>). These studies quantified the connectivity of NF-&#x003ba;B with downstream effector functions, enabling us to parameterize the relative contributions of NF-&#x003ba;B cRel, RelA, and non-NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional regulators toward the activation of these downstream effectors. This placed NF-&#x003ba;B in a position of biasing the fate of growing cells toward division over death.</p><p>In addition, we were also able to confirm that fate decisions and division and death times are correlated between sibling cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd4">Supplementary Fig S4</xref>), which is consistent with apparent cell-to-cell variability being due to differences in protein turnover processes (Gaudet <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Flusberg <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) resulting in distributions of single-cell proteomes within a population. Such variability constitutes noise that is extrinsic to the molecular processes explicitly represented in the model, thus justifying an ordinary differential equation formulation with distributed initial states to model a population of B cells, akin to previous studies (Spencer &#x00026; Sorger, <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Loriaux &#x00026; Hoffmann, <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>The resulting simulations recapitulated major features of the cellular and population responses with an accuracy that was surprising given that the three models were connected with a minimum number of reactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd10">Supplementary Methods</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd9">Supplementary Table S9</xref>). In particular, the maximum relative cell count (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">C</xref>), the characteristic total population expansion and contraction curve (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5C</xref>), the number of divisions observed (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5C</xref> and D), the fraction of cells responding in each generation (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5D</xref>), and the average growth trajectories of growing (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5E</xref>) and non-growing (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5F</xref>) cells were captured by the model, among others (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd9">Supplementary Tables S9</xref> and S10).

A decision model is consistent with the observation that a subset of generation 0 cells prepare for several rounds of rapid divisions by simultaneously deactivating quiescence (Yusuf &#x00026; Fruman, <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Hawkins <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and activating growth pathways such as Myc and mTOR (Grumont <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In contrast, cell death is a default pathway as unstimulated B cells will undergo apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd8">Supplementary Fig S8</xref>), though cell lifetime may be extended by expressing anti-apoptotic regulators as a consequence of signaling (recently reviewed in Renault &#x00026; Chipuk, <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>To probe whether the division or death fate was a result of a fate race or a decision, we tracked B cells in long time course microscopy studies to characterize several key properties of the response. There is a pronounced but variable delay in growth initiation prior to the first division, while generation 1+ cells start growing immediately (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">D</xref>). Tracking cell size trajectories and their eventual fate allowed us to show that B cells that had entered the growth phase were protected from death (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>). Further, a mathematical model which assumed a race between division and death (Hawkins <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2007b</xref>), applied to flow cytometry data, could not account for the death time distribution observed in microscopy experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd3">Supplementary Fig S3</xref>), even when early death (within the first 12&#x000a0;h), potentially caused by mechanical manipulation of cells, is filtered out (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Supplementary Fig S1</xref>).</p><p>Using the multi-scale model, we explored NF-&#x003ba;B's role in determining B-cell population dynamics. As expected, <italic>in silico</italic> knockout of NF-&#x003ba;B cRel substantially reduced the population response (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">E</xref>), allowing for fewer divisions (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6F</xref>). This was due to a greater fraction of growing cells dying (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6G</xref>), but fate timing and growth trajectories were predicted to and remained largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd7">Supplementary Fig S7</xref>). Importantly, time-lapse microscopy experiments confirmed these model predictions (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">E&#x02013;G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd7">Supplementary Fig S7</xref>). Further, model simulations predicted and experimental studies confirmed that in the absence of cRel, cells that have entered the growth phase may not be committed to divide, but instead are prone to death (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7D</xref>). Thus, cRel's function may be described as enforcing a decision to divide, with the population response of cRel-deficient cells resembling that of a molecular race more closely than that of wild-type cells. Indeed, our work with cRel-deficient models and cells suggests that the fate decision at the cell biological scale may be described as a fate race that is highly biased against death by NF-&#x003ba;B cRel. Other NF-&#x003ba;B members such as RelA and RelB may contribute as well, and their combined function is likely critical for promoting entry into the growth phase also.</p></sec><sec><title>The population response is sensitive to extrinsic noise in the signaling module</title><p>The present model version could be used to explore how molecular-level perturbations affect cell population dynamics (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8</xref>). It may not be surprising that increasing the abundance of negative regulators of NF-&#x003ba;B diminished the population response; however, the sensitivity to small increases in the positive regulators was striking (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8D</xref>), affirming the strategy for searching for cancer-causing mutations that alter NF-&#x003ba;B control (Staudt, <xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). We also found an increased population response (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8H</xref>) due to enhanced survival (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8K</xref>) if instead the variability but not the average of protein abundances was increased in the model. Our data suggest that deregulation (i.e., increased variability) of negative regulators was particularly important (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8H</xref>&#x02013;K). Increased cell-to-cell variability of cell-cycle and apoptosis proteins resulted in accumulation of long-lived cells, decreasing the fraction of dividing cells in each generation (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8I</xref>) and increasing the length of the cell cycle (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8J</xref>). Our analysis points to the importance of quantitative data at the single-cell level (e.g., the distributions of protein abundances, even when average measurements remain unaltered) in the diagnosis and prognosis of disease using single-cell technologies (Chattopadhyay <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Macaulay &#x00026; Voet, <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>In sum, the multi-scale model we present here is a first attempt at connecting molecular networks to B-cell population dynamics and demonstrates that much of the population behavior, including the observed biasing of cell fate, emerges when NF-&#x003ba;B is allowed to affect mammalian models for cell cycling and apoptosis.

Next, approximate linear paths were manually drawn for each cell until the cell was observed to divide, die, or leave the field of view (also manually annotated to ensure accuracy). Cells entering the field of view after 24&#x000a0;h of stimulation (i.e., potentially after the first division) and debris were tracked but removed from the subsequent analysis. After all paths were drawn, all cell boundaries were optimized simultaneously from frame to frame. During automatic optimization, cells were modeled as deformable two-dimensional polygons with forces acting upon each vertex that ensured the polygons did not grow/shrink too quickly, did not overlap other polygons, were attracted to edges in the image, and were attracted to their respective manually curated path. The relative magnitudes of the forces were manually calibrated to ensure appropriate behavior.

Quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR was performed with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix reagent (Stratagene) and Eppendorf Mastercycler realplex system using the &#x00394;(&#x00394;<italic>C</italic><sub>t</sub>) method with &#x003b2;-actin as normalization control.</p></sec><sec><title>Multi-scale agent-based modeling</title><p>Ordinary differential equation models of the cell-cycle (Conradie <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), apoptosis (Loriaux &#x00026; Hoffmann, <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling (Alves <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) were implemented in Matlab (Mathworks), using the ode15s solver for stiff problems. Please refer to the Supplementary Methods for the list of model reactants, reactions, constants, and free parameters, as well as the fitting methodology and parameter sensitivities. The modules were connected by imposing cooperative Hill activation of the CyclinD, Myc, and Bcl<sub>XL</sub> promoters. For simplicity, we also assumed that the growth of general cellular machinery, the model species representing catabolism and protein synthesis in the cell, was dependent on the current mass, and the concentration of Myc. The integrated model consisting of the three modules constituted one cellular agent and was solved independently in a generation-by-generation fashion until the simulation time limit was reached, the cell divided ([cdh20]&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.2), or the cell died ([cPARP]&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;25,000&#x000a0;molecules/cell). Upon division, two new copies of the model were generated with half the mass and general machinery (we assumed that the concentration of all other species was unchanged). We assumed a normally distributed variability in the partitioning of the mass (the mass and general machinery were multiplied by a constant <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> or <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> such that <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>&#x000a0;&#x0223d;&#x000a0;<italic>N</italic>(1.0, CV<sub>partition</sub>), and <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;<italic>r</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>, where CV<sub>partition</sub> is a the coefficient of variability of daughters measured from wild-type microscopy experiments. In addition, to mimic protein concentration remixing which leads to the loss of correlation with subsequent divisions, we generated independent log-normally distributed (if not modeling synthesis and degradation) or normally distributed protein synthesis and degradation reaction rates as well as log-normally distributed total IKK concentrations and set the daughter values to the average of the newly generated value and the value inherited from the mother. This ensured that the daughter cells had correlated protein dynamics, but that the correlation decreased with each generation (Hawkins <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). At the time of division, species in the nucleus (i.e., NF-&#x003ba;Bs/I&#x003ba;Bs) were redistributed evenly among the nucleus and cytoplasm to mimic nuclear envelope breakdown and reformation. Models that ended in death were removed from the pool of running models. Multi-scale models, which consisted of many such cellular agents, were initialized at generation 0 to contain <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;250 independent integrated models. To model cell-to-cell protein abundance variability, we initialized each model with initial protein concentrations sampled from lognormal distributions if the total protein concentration was fixed, or with normally distributed protein synthesis and degradation rates if the protein had explicit synthesis and degradation reactions defined. In addition, the total amount of IKK, the upstream signal responsible for NF-&#x003ba;B activation, was also assumed to be log-normally distributed. Finally, the initial mass and general machinery of cells was normally distributed as determined by microscopy. After an initial equilibration phase (at least 24&#x000a0;h) with only basal IKK signaling to NF-&#x003ba;B and no death signaling, a quiescent steady state was achieved as defined by lack of cell-cycle progression and model species stabilization. After equilibration, all models were solved independently for each generation until the simulation time was elapsed (144&#x000a0;h). The full set of model constants, reactions, fluxes, species, parameterizations, parameter sensitivity, fitting procedure, and model construction methods are described in the supplementary tables, and the model construction details and fitting routines are described in Supplementary Methods.

To do this, we grouped proteins in the model into functionally distinct sets: the negative regulators of activation (I&#x003ba;Bs), the positive regulators of activation (IKK and the NF-&#x003ba;B monomers), and all other proteins (cell-cycle and apoptosis). Then, we tested the effect of increasing the average abundance of the proteins in these functional sets by increasing the translation rate of the proteins (I&#x003ba;Bs, NF-&#x003ba;Bs, cell-cycle/apoptosis proteins) by 10%, or increasing the total concentration by 50% (for proteins which are assumed to be constant in the model such as IKK and some cell-cycle proteins). We also tested the effect of increasing the extrinsic noise of these protein sets by increasing the CV associated with the cell-to-cell protein variability in the synthesis/degradation rates (assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution with mean centered on the initial parameter value) or the total protein abundance (assumed to be log-normally distributed with mean equal to the initial starting concentration). We then quantified the mean relative population count throughout the simulation, the expected number of divisions that progenitors underwent, a summary statistic for the fractions of cells dividing in each generation (fs), the average interdivision time for generation 1+ cells (a measure of cell-cycle speed), and the relative number of cells remaining at the end of the simulation (accumulation of surviving non-dividing cells).</p></sec><sec><title>Data availability</title><p>Supplementary files, parameter tables, movies of tracked cells, code, raw images from time-lapse microscopy, and CFSE flow cytometry datasets (FCS3.0 files) are available for download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.signalingsystems.ucla.edu/max/">http://www.signalingsystems.ucla.edu/max/</ext-link>.
