The success of such screens and the interpretation of the data depend on the stringent design of RNAi libraries. We describe and validate NEXT-RNAi, a software for the automated design and evaluation of RNAi sequences on a genome-wide scale. NEXT-RNAi is implemented as open-source software and is accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nextrnai.org/.">http://www.nextrnai.org/.</ext-link></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Rationale</title><p>RNA interference (RNAi) screens have become an important tool for the identification and characterization of gene function on a large-scale and complement classic mutagenesis screens by providing a means to target almost every transcript in a sequenced and annotated genome. RNAi is a post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism conserved from plants to humans and relies on the delivery of exogenous short double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that trigger the degradation of homologous mRNAs in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. As an experimental tool, RNAi is now widely used to silence the expression of genes in a broad spectrum of organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The availability of genome-wide RNAi libraries for cell-based assays and whole organisms has opened new avenues to query genomes for a broad spectrum of loss-of-function phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The number of sequenced genomes is steadily rising, enabling reverse genetic approaches using RNAi in many novel model systems, including, for example, the medically relevant vector <italic>Anopheles gambiae </italic>and species used to study evolutionary aspects of development, such as <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum </italic>and <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic>. RNAi libraries will facilitate the functional characterization of genes in these species, either through studying smaller subsets of candidates or on a genomic scale.</p><p>The design of RNAi reagents is key to obtaining reliable phenotypic data in large-scale RNAi experiments. Several recent studies demonstrated that the degradation of non-intended transcripts (so-called 'off-target effects') and knock-down efficiency depend on the sequence of the RNAi reagent and have to be carefully monitored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Based on experimental studies, rules for the design of RNAi reagents have been devised to improve knock-down efficiency and simultaneously minimize unspecific effects.</p><p>In invertebrates such as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, RNAi can be triggered by long dsRNAs that are intracellularly broken down into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The design of a long dsRNA therefore needs to take into account both the properties of the target sequence, for example, its sequence complexity, as well as the properties of all siRNAs contained within the long dsRNA, such as their predicted target specificity and efficiency. Because long dsRNAs are often generated by <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription, the design of suitable primer pairs to amplify <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription templates through PCR from genomic DNA or cDNAs must be implemented.</p><p>In contrast, RNAi-mediated silencing in mammalian cells is achieved through siRNAs of 21 to 23 nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] to circumvent the activation of an interferon response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Such short dsRNAs can be generated by different methods. For mammalian cells, vectors transcribing short-hairpin RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] or synthetic siRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] are commonly used. Several recent studies have highlighted favorable sequence characteristics and suitable chemical modifications for these reagents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The design of long <italic>in vitro </italic>endoribonuclease-prepared siRNA reagents (esiRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] resembles that of long dsRNAs for model organisms. We list several factors that are important for the design of RNAi reagents in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Quality control parameters for RNAi reagents at different stages of the design pipeline. (a) </bold>Long dsRNAs that have regions of low complexity, for example, CA[ATCG] repeats or simple nucleotide repeats, can exert unspecific and cytotoxic effects. The quality of the primer designs used to synthesize amplicons from DNA sources is crucial, in particular when the synthesis is performed in 96- or 384-well formats where primers should have similar melting temperatures. <bold>(b) </bold>Dicer-mediated cleavage of long dsRNAs leads to the generation of siRNAs of lengths between 19 and 23 nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The quality of siRNAs depends on their ability to efficiently enter the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and to access the target mRNA. This is influenced by thermodynamic properties, base preferences and chemical modifications. The specificity of siRNAs is influenced by sequence-independent and sequence-dependent features. siRNAs can trigger interferon responses or show concentration-dependent cytotoxic effects, independent of their sequence. Silencing of unintended target transcripts can occur through perfect and imperfect sequence homologies to the siRNA and through 'seed matches' to the transcript 3' UTRs. See text for details.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2010-11-6-r61-1"/></fig><p>For large-scale functional screens, the design of RNAi reagents is particularly important because the specificity and efficiency of individual RNAi reagents can rarely be validated on a genome-wide scale. The systematic application of design criteria, often on poorly defined gene models, has a direct impact on the expected false positive and false negative rates of phenotypic screens. Previous computational tools are available to design short and long dsRNAs for individual genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, the systematic and reproducible design of RNAi reagents for large sets of genes or even whole genomes using an expanded set of parameters, such as target analysis for all splice isoforms, overlap analysis with SNPs and calculation of seed match frequency, has remained an unresolved issue.</p><p>Here we present NEXT-RNAi, a software tool for the design and evaluation of RNAi libraries that can be used for projects with targets ranging from a limited gene set to a whole-genome scale. NEXT-RNAi can process annotations from various sources and thereby provides a powerful RNAi design pipeline for virtually any genome that is available in public databases. NEXT-RNAi can also be used to design independent RNAi reagents to complement existing libraries. To demonstrate its flexibility, we have designed multiple genome-wide RNAi libraries for different organisms, including <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Anopheles</italic>, <italic>Tribolium </italic>and humans. NEXT-RNAi also offers the opportunity to automatically evaluate and re-annotate existing RNAi libraries by generating user-friendly reports to reflect the regular update of genome annotations.</p><p>To validate knock-down efficiency of NEXT-RNAi's reagent designs, we generated two independent sets of long dsRNAs targeting protein and lipid phosphatases expressed in <italic>Drosophila </italic>D.Mel-2 cells and verified transcript knock-down by quantitative real-time RT-PCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Design of RNAi libraries for genome-scale experiments</title><p>RNAi screens rely on the design of large-scale libraries comprehensively covering annotated transcriptomes. The design of RNAi libraries requires the identification of suitable target regions that minimize the potential for off-target effects, increase the silencing capacity and allow an efficient synthesis of the reagents. Often, multiple independent designs that meet these requirements are used to confirm RNAi-induced phenotypes.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> illustrates the workflow of NEXT-RNAi for the automated design and evaluation of RNAi reagents (see also Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> exemplifies the steps typically performed for the design of a long dsRNA. The input target sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>) are first analyzed for regions of low complexity that have been shown to exert promiscuous off-target effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. NEXT-RNAi identifies tandem trinucleotide repeats of the type CA[ACGT] (CAN) and can also use the mdust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] filter program (with default parameters) to find, for example, simple nucleotide repeats or poly-triplet sequences other than CAN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). The function of the intracellular Dicer protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] is then simulated by computationally 'dicing' the input target sequences into all possible siRNAs with a (default) length of 19 nucleotides. siRNAs may cause unspecific gene silencing via short stretches of homology with unintended mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] or by a route similar to miRNA-mediated silencing through sequence similarity in positions 2 to 7 or 2 to 8 of the siRNA guide strand to the 3' UTR of unintended transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. NEXT-RNAi assesses the specificity of siRNAs by mapping them to the transcriptome. An siRNA is considered 'specific' if only isoforms of the same gene are targeted (with perfect homology; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). The number of siRNA seed matches (seed complement frequency) is determined by mapping all the unique seeds to a user-defined database containing, for example, 3' UTR sequences. Several criteria can be taken into account to determine the predicted efficiency of an siRNA, including asymmetric thermodynamic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], G/C content, structural properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and base preferences at several positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. NEXT-RNAi implements two scoring methods to assess the predicted siRNA efficiency, here referred to as the 'rational' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and 'weighted' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] methods. Scores range between 0 and 100 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). A previous analysis by Reynolds <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] reported that siRNAs with efficiency scores &#x02265;66.7 (on our normalized scale) were efficient silencers in human cells; and Shah <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] found that designs with scores &#x02265;63 were efficient. Analysis of 2,431 knock-down validated siRNAs (from Huesken <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]) for their predicted efficiency (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) shows a good correlation between the normalized inhibitory activity of the siRNAs and the predicted efficiency score (correlation of 0.52 and 0.51 for the 'rational' and 'weighted' methods respectively; <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;2.2e-16).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Overview of the NEXT-RNAi workflow</bold>. NEXT-RNAi requires a defined set of input files in FASTA or tab-delimited formats. First, the program filters the input target sequences for six (default) or more contiguous CAN repeats and for other regions of low complexity (for example, simple nucleotide repeats) using mdust. Sequences are then 'diced' to generate all possible siRNA sequences with a default length of 19 nucleotides (nt) and an offset of 1 nucleotide. Subsequently, each siRNA is mapped to a user-defined off-target database (for example, the whole transcriptome) with Bowtie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] to determine its specificity. The specificity is set to one if the siRNA targets a single gene or to zero otherwise. In the next step, the predicted efficiency of each 19-nucleotide siRNA is computed. Two methods can be selected, the 'rational' method according to Reynolds <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and the 'weighted' method according to Shah <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], assigning each siRNA an efficiency score between 0 and 100. Optionally, the seed complement frequency for each siRNA can be computed for any FASTA file provided (for example, a file containing 3' UTR sequences). siRNAs that did not pass the low-complexity filters, show perfect homology to multiple target genes or do not meet the user-defined cutoffs for efficiency or seed complement frequency are excluded from the queried target sequences. Remaining sequences are used as templates for primer design (with Primer3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]) for long dsRNAs or are directly subjected to the final ranking for the design of siRNAs. Designs are ranked by (i) their predicted specificity and (ii) their predicted efficiency and, in the case of siRNA designs, (iii) their calculated seed complement frequency. Sequences can also be evaluated for additional features, such as homology to unintended transcripts, or SNP and UTR contents. Final designs can be visualized using GBrowse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].

Otherwise, a redesign method is used that connects closest 'optimal' neighbors until a region suitable for primer designs is identified (right panel). Potential dsRNAs are finally ranked by their specificity and efficiency.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2010-11-6-r61-3"/></fig><p>All quality parameters measured prior to this step, including the prediction of specificity, efficiency and low complexity, are applied as filters on the input sequences to identify optimal RNAi target sites. The set of filters can be further expanded by also including cut-offs on the seed complement frequency and sequence filters on conserved miRNAs seeds (for each siRNA). For the design of long dsRNAs, Primer3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] is then used with user-defined settings to design primer pairs required for the PCR during dsRNA synthesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). In case the optimal target sites identified are too short for designing primers (colored grey in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>), NEXT-RNAi implements a redesign routine that can be enabled by the user. This routine identifies those optimal target sites that are closest to each other and combines them by including the 'suboptimal' region in between. This step is carried out iteratively until the region is long enough for designing primers (for example, see right panel in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>).</p><p>Long dsRNA or siRNA designs are finally ranked by predicted specificity and predicted efficiency. For the ranking of siRNAs, designs with low seed complement frequency are prioritized. Since long dsRNAs contain many different siRNAs, two efficiency scores are reported: the average efficiency score of all contained siRNAs and the absolute number of efficient siRNAs (efficiency above a user-defined cutoff). The user-defined number of top-ranked designs for each target can be evaluated further by mapping them to the genome (with Bowtie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] or Blat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]), by determining the overall homology to other transcripts (with Blast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]) or by calculating the overlap with other sequence features such as SNPs or UTRs.</p><p>NEXT-RNAi outputs design information in a tab-delimited text file and generates a comprehensive HTML report including a graphical display of designs in GBrowse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).

To further increase the number of potential target sites, we split common regions longer than 700 nucleotides into two sequences of equal length.

The <italic>Drosophila </italic>transcriptome was used as a database to evaluate the siRNA specificities ('off-target' database).

With the exception of the HD2 and DRSC v2.0 libraries, all libraries covered less than 90% of the genome. This might result in part from the fact that they were designed for previous genome releases (release 3 or earlier). A comparison between the libraries showed how the design strategies evolved over time. While the designs of the HD2 and DRSC v2.0 libraries avoided both 19-nucleotide off-target effects (26.6% and 31.1% of all dsRNAs in HD2 and DRSC v2.0, respectively) and CAN repeats (0.5% and 1.8% of all dsRNA in HD2 and DRSC v2.0, respectively), older libraries, including DRSC v1.0 and MRC, contain a significantly higher percentage of dsRNAs with predicted 19-nucleotide off-targets (37.1% and 51.5%, respectively) and CAN repeats (5.3% and 5.4%, respectively). NEXT-RNAi also allows for the assessment of further parameters of the reagents. In this analysis, we computed the number of siRNAs with known miRNA seeds (from miRBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]) contained within each long dsRNA. With an average of 1.9, the Ambion library contains the fewest miRNA seeds per dsRNA, potentially because Ambion dsRNAs are rather short (255 nucleotides). Analyzing long dsRNAs for overlaps with UTRs reveals that designs in the DRSC v1.0, MRC, NIG-Fly and VDRC libraries were aimed at targeting open reading frames only (in all of these libraries, less than 8% of the reagent targets predicted UTRs).</p><p>An important experimental step during the confirmation of candidate genes from RNAi screens is the validation of phenotypes with independent designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. We used NEXT-RNAi results to identify the number of genes that could be targeted with independent designs through pairwise combinations of all <italic>Drosophila </italic>RNAi libraries (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>; complete reports are available for download). Pairwise combinations of the Ambion, DRSC v2.0 and HD2 libraries provide the highest number of independent reagents (for example, 6,623 genes covered by HD2 are covered by at least one independent design in DRSC v2.0). Some libraries overlap to a large extent and would be less advisable to use for confirmation screening. For example, combining the DRSC v1.0 and MRC libraries covers only 2,593 genes by independent designs. The analysis done provides also a helpful resource to identify <italic>in vivo </italic>RNAi lines of VDRC and NIG-Fly libraries that can be used for confirmation experiments with a second, non-overlapping dsRNA.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Pairwise comparison of <italic>Drosophila </italic>RNAi libraries</bold>. Eight <italic>Drosophila </italic>RNAi libraries are compared to identify the number of genes that are targeted by multiple libraries (outer ring, light grey) and the number of genes that are targeted by independent designs (inner ring, dark grey).

Of all siRNAs in the Ambion and Qiagen libraries, 3.4% and 10.1%, respectively, lacked any annotated target gene in NCBI RefSeq release 40; 84.2% and 92.4% show perfect homology to a single target gene; and 5.7% and 4.1% perfectly match multiple targets. The libraries cover 75% and 65.3% of all currently annotated NCBI and Entrez genes, respectively. About 9% of siRNAs in both libraries contain annotated SNPs (from dbSNP). More than one-third of the siRNAs in the Qiagen library overlap with annotated UTRs in their target transcripts (by at least one base), but only about one-tenth of the siRNAs in the Ambion library do so. Libraries also differ in the mean of predicted siRNA efficiency scores (using the 'weighted' method), with 74.65 for the Ambion and 57.58 for the Qiagen library. Of the Ambion and Qiagen siRNAs, 9.8% and 5.3%, respectively, have low seed complement frequencies (less than 1,000 seed matches in RefSeq annotated 3' UTRs).</p></sec><sec><title>Knock-down validation of NEXT-RNAi designs for <italic>Drosophila </italic>phosphatases</title><p>To validate the knock-down efficiency of reagents designed by NEXT-RNAi, we designed two independent long dsRNAs (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref> and companion website for details on the design) for all <italic>Drosophila </italic>protein- and lipid-phosphatases expressed in D.Mel-2 cells (Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession [GEO:GSE21283]). We found 49 phosphatases expressed at five or more RPKM (reads per kilobase gene per million reads; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>).

Out of 98 dsRNAs, 87 (88.8%) caused a decrease in mRNA levels of more than 60%; half of the dsRNAs achieved a knock-down exceeding 80% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>). Eleven mRNAs showed little or no knock-down, six of which could not be detected reproducibly in this assay. For 37 of the 49 genes, we found that both independent designs decreased mRNA levels by at least two-thirds. For eight genes, only one design and for four genes, no designs could be validated with this knock-down strategy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Knock-down validation of <italic>Drosophila </italic>phosphatases.

Furthermore, the independent designs led to highly reproducible knock-downs (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85), indicating that the observed depletion efficiency depended on the targeted mRNA rather than differences in the NEXT-RNAi designs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In large-scale RNAi experiments, the design of genome-wide silencing libraries has remained an important problem due to the flux of gene annotation and novel insights into the mechanisms that influence RNAi efficiency and off-target effects. We present an approach for the rapid design of whole-genome RNAi libraries and the re-annotation of already existing reagent collections. The method is flexible, identifies multiple independent reagents per gene model and has been implemented in an organism-independent manner. The design process is fully automated and can use annotations from various sequence- or model-organism databases as input, thereby enabling the design of RNAi reagents for any sequenced (and annotated) organism.</p><p>We have designed several independent RNAi libraries for a diverse group of organisms. The automated pipeline yielded designs for more than 95% of all predicted genes in the first round of prediction. All library designs are available as a resource for download from our webpage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. We validated the knock-down of 98 long dsRNAs directed against 49 <italic>Drosophila </italic>phosphatases expressed in our tissue culture model and found that approximately 89% of the reagents caused at least 60% mRNA knock-down. The application of a standardized design pipeline for independent designs leads to reproducible knock-downs in our experiments (correlation of 0.85 between the independent designs).</p><p>RNAi screens have become a key tool for functional genomic analyses. The interpretation of the increasing number of published data sets obtained through RNAi screens relies heavily on correctly annotated reagents. Phenotypes derived from large-scale screens should be linked to the sequence of the RNAi reagent rather than the gene model because off-target or splice-variant-specific silencing can rarely be excluded. For the correct interpretation of RNAi screens, and also the comparison between different libraries, reagent-to-gene-model linkages must be re-mapped in regular intervals because most genome annotations are still in flux. NEXT-RNAi can be used to rapidly evaluate and re-annotate existing genome-wide libraries. For example, we have applied the algorithm to re-annotate RNAi libraries for <italic>Drosophila </italic>and human cells. Our analysis of eight genome-wide RNAi libraries for <italic>Drosophila </italic>revealed differences in genome coverage and predicted quality (for example, specificity), most likely depending on two factors: the quality of the underlying genome release and the factors known to influence reagent quality at the time of the library design. Further, reagents in these libraries often share target sites, thus preventing an independent confirmation of phenotypes on a genomic scale. The re-annotation of commercially available human libraries revealed that a substantial part of the siRNAs (Ambion library, 15.8%; Qiagen library, 7.5%) either do not target the intended gene or are predicted to silence additional loci, demonstrating that quality control at the level of sequence mapping is crucial for the interpretation of large-scale screens.</p><p>Several tools for the design of RNAi reagents exist (including, for example, E-RNAi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], DEQOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], SnapDragon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], and siR[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and commercial design tools such as siDESIGN Center (Dharmacon, ThermoScientific), BioPredsi (Qiagen) and siRNA Target Finder (Ambion)). However, these tools can only be used for designing long dsRNAs or siRNAs on a gene-by-gene basis. In contrast to available tools, our method allows for rapid batch design and evaluation of RNAi libraries for complete genomes or for any defined set of genes. In addition, our approach uses multiple parameters to calculate or evaluate designs, including sequence complexity, efficiency and specificity indicators, and allows for further refinement by scoring overlap with SNPs or UTRs. The software pipeline can also be used to obtain multiple independent RNAi designs per gene for independent validation of RNAi phenotypes. Additional strengths of NEXT-RNAi are its speed in designing comprehensive libraries and the generation of HTML reports including a variety of output options.</p><p>RNAi screening is being used increasingly in diverse organisms that only recently became amenable to genomic approaches. NEXT-RNAi can be deployed to design RNAi reagents for any sequenced genome to facilitate a better understanding of gene function through improved RNAi tools. This can be of particular utility for emerging model organisms that are suitable for large-scale RNAi studies but lack RNAi libraries. Further, in contrast to various microarray platforms, little attention has been paid to the re-annotation of existing RNAi screening data. We provide a fast and flexible software that accelerates the construction of consistent phenotypic data sets from RNAi screening experiments and helps to functionally annotate genome sequences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Sequences and databases</title><p>NEXT-RNAi requires a defined set of files and parameters as inputs.
