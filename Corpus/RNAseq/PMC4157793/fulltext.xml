This failure is attributable to our inability to identify clinically-relevant subtypes of this disease. Thus, a more systematic approach to drug discovery for SCLC is needed. In this regard, two comprehensive studies recently published in <italic>Nature,</italic> the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and the Cancer Genome Project, provide a wealth of data regarding the drug sensitivity and genomic profiles of many different types of cancer cells. In the present study we have mined these two studies for new therapeutic agents for SCLC and identified heat shock proteins, cyclin-dependent kinases and polo-like kinases (PLK) as attractive molecular targets with little current clinical trial activity in SCLC. Remarkably, our analyses demonstrated that most SCLC cell lines clustered into a single, predominant subgroup by either gene expression or CNV analyses, leading us to take a pharmacogenomic approach to identify subgroups of drug-sensitive SCLC cells. Using PLK inhibitors as an example, we identified and validated a gene signature for drug sensitivity in SCLC cell lines. This gene signature could distinguish subpopulations among human SCLC tumors, suggesting its potential clinical utility. Finally, circos plots were constructed to yield a comprehensive view of how transcriptional, copy number and mutational elements affect PLK sensitivity in SCLC cell lines. Taken together, this study outlines an approach to predict drug sensitivity in SCLC to novel targeted therapeutics.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Supported by grants from the University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center and National Cancer Institute U01 CA062502 (GW, AD), the Translational Research Core Facility (IL, JP) and the Biostatistics &#x00026; Bioinformatics Core Facility (YC, JSB-S) of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (National Cancer Institute P30 CA043703), and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (LS).

There are currently no molecular targeted approaches to treat SCLC similar to those used successfully against non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), such as erlotinib targeting of mutant EGFR or crizotinib targeting of EML4-ALK fusion proteins <xref rid="pone.0106784-Janku1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106784-Pao1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Surgery is rarely performed in this disease (only 1% of cases), limiting the availability of tumor tissue for comprehensive genomic analyses. Furthermore, the two seminal genomics studies recently published on SCLC have yielded little therapeutic insight into this disease and have mainly analyzed the rare form of SCLC amenable to surgery, which does not represent the classic, widely metastatic SCLC seen in everyday clinical practice <xref rid="pone.0106784-Rudin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106784-Peifer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>A different approach to drug discovery for SCLC is needed and may lie in mining available databases on the drug sensitivities of SCLC cell lines. That is, as most SCLC cells are derived from metastatic sites or pleural effusions, they may be representative of extensive disease SCLC and its associated drug vulnerabilities. In this regard, two comprehensive drug-screening studies recently published in <italic>Nature,</italic> the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) <xref rid="pone.0106784-Barretina1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and the Cancer Genome Project (CGP) <xref rid="pone.0106784-Garnett1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, examined the drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, including lung, and attempted to link these to genomic profiles. The genomic profiles included DNA mutational status, gene expression and copy number variation (CNV) data.</p><p>In the present study we have specifically extracted the data on SCLC cell lines from these two studies and outline a bioinformatic approach to identify new therapeutics for SCLC using polo-like kinase (PLK) inhibitors as an example.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Initially we sought a global view of SCLC drug sensitivity in the CCLE <xref rid="pone.0106784-Barretina1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and CGP <xref rid="pone.0106784-Garnett1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> studies. There were 53 and 31 SCLC cell lines tested for growth inhibition by 24 and 92 drugs in these studies, respectively. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106784-g001">Figures 1</xref> (CGP) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106784.s001">S1</xref> (CCLE) as boxplots.

This graphical analysis allowed us to identify drugs that were broadly effective against most SCLC cells. We defined &#x02018;effective&#x02019; drugs as those that induce growth inhibition in most cells at low doses (median IC<sub>50</sub>&#x02264;1 &#x000b5;M), represented by paclitaxel. &#x02018;Ineffective&#x02019; drugs, represented by erlotinib and sunitinib, produced no growth inhibition in most SCLC cells (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x02265;8 &#x000b5;M), although &#x02018;outliers&#x02019; may be present. &#x02018;Selective&#x02019; drugs, represented by rapamycin, demonstrated a long boxplot and can be considered effective for only a subset of SCLC cell lines.</p><fig id="pone-0106784-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0106784.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Boxplot of drug sensitivity in SCLC cells using the CGP dataset.</title><p>There are 31 cell lines for small cell lung cancer.

&#x02018;signatures&#x02019; that may be either prognostic or predictive of tumor behavior. Therefore, we examined if gene expression clustering could be used to identify subgroups of drug-sensitive SCLC cell lines, particularly for drugs that demonstrated a broad efficacy range against SCLC cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106784-g001">Figure 1</xref>. We used data from the CGP study because it contained the largest amount of drug sensitivity data. Unsupervised consensus clustering of gene expression data demonstrated that three clusters of SCLC cells were optimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106784-g002">Figure 2</xref>). There were 1006 significant genes that defined the gene expression subtypes (Kruskal-Wallis test p-value &#x0003c;0.05, listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106784.s007">Table S3</xref>. We then visualized the effect of gene expression clustering on drug efficacy using a mosaic plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106784-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In this plot we used a color scale that divided drug sensitivity into six groups. Drugs, listed on the y-axis, were grouped together according to target molecules. Cells, listed on the x-axis, were grouped using the same order as that obtained by unsupervised clustering of their gene expression. There did not appear to be any correlation of drug sensitivity to gene expression clustering, however, as drug sensitivity appeared to be randomly distributed across all cell lines for any given drug. This graphical analysis did highlight several targeted agents with exceptional broad-based efficacy against SCLC cell lines. These drugs included bortezomib, BI-2536 and GW-843682X, as well as the HSP inhibitor elesclomol and the CDK inhibitor CGP-60474, albeit with lower efficacy.

First we sought to validate the efficacy of PLK inhibitors in SCLC. In these validation experiments we used SCLC cell lines, as well as inhibitors, that were different from those used in the original studies to highlight the efficacy of these new therapeutic agents. The SCLC cell lines used were H1048, H1688, SW1271 and DMS454. PLK inhibitors included BI-6727 (volasertib) and ON-01910 (rigosertib).

We compared the gene expression data for the five most sensitive SCLC cells (H82, H446, H526, COR L88, IST SL1) with that for the five least sensitive SCLC cell lines (DMS114, H64, DMS79, H2171, IST SL2); as defined in the CGP by their BI-2536 IC<sub>50</sub> values. We identified a list of 185 genes that were significantly differentially expressed between these two groups (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106784.s008">Table S4</xref>). These 185 genes were used to perform unsupervised clustering of all the SCLC cell lines, resulting in the heatmap shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106784-g006">Figure 6</xref>. Notably, the five least (green top box) and most (red top box) sensitive cell lines clustered at opposite ends of the heatmap while all the other cells (yellow boxes indicating intermediate sensitivity and grey boxes indicating unknown sensitivity) clustered in the middle. We next performed leave-one-out analysis of the PLK gene signature with the 26 available cell lines. From this analysis we generated 26 heatmaps, where in each heatmap the sensitive and resistant cells remained clustered together except in three heatmaps; in which one or two sensitive cell lines were misclassified. Resistant cells always clustered together. Hence, we believe that this PLK gene signature is robust in categorizing sensitive and resistant SCLC cell lines.</p><fig id="pone-0106784-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0106784.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Unsupervised clustering of SCLC cells using the PLK gene signature.</title><p>The five SCLC cell lines demonstrating the most (H2171, H64, IST-SL2, DMS-114, DMS-79) and least (IST-SL1, COR-L88, H526, H446, H82) resistance to the PLK inhibitor BI-2536 in the CGP study were used as standards to identify a gene signature for PLK sensitivity.

The largest study of SCLC tumor gene expression is that of Rudin et al. <xref rid="pone.0106784-Rudin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, who analyzed 30 primary tumors by RNAseq. We therefore extracted the count data for the 185 probes present in our PLK signature (representing 173 genes; only 169 genes were found and used from the Rudin dataset) and standard normalized to create surrogate PLK gene expression arrays for these tumors.

Remarkably, the circos plots demonstrate that all resistant cells possessed nonsense or frameshift mutations in either <italic>TP53</italic> or <italic>RB1</italic>, and sometimes both genes, whereas all sensitive cells displayed mutations of unknown protein significance (intronic and missense), typically in only one of these genes. All but one of the gene mutations was homozygous, indicating that resistant cells likely have no functional RB1 or TP53 protein. All sensitive cells display <italic>MYC</italic> (H82, H446), <italic>MYCN</italic> (H526, IST SL1) or <italic>MYCL</italic> (CORL88) amplification, whereas only one resistant cell line displays <italic>MYC</italic> amplification (H2171). There also seems to be little or no CNV on the X chromosome in sensitive cells relative to resistant cells, which typically display some CNV loss. Genes on chromosome 13 are generally upregulated in PLK sensitive cells and downregulated in PLK resistant cells, whereas genes located on chromosome 19 are generally downregulated in PLK sensitive cells and upregulated in PLK resistant cells.

Unfortunately, the limited availability of tumor tissue hinders the acquisition of complete genomic analyses required for the identification and validation of new drugable targets in this cancer. Thus, alternative drug discovery strategies need to be developed until our understanding of the genomics driving SCLC can begin to approximate that of NSCLC, which benefits from comprehensive analyses of large cohorts of patient tumors, such as the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).</p><p>In this report we have taken a bioinformatic approach to drug discovery for SCLC by data mining two large drug screening studies in cultured cell lines, the CCLE <xref rid="pone.0106784-Barretina1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and CGP <xref rid="pone.0106784-Garnett1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. As a model system, SCLC cell lines retain gene mutation profiles (COSMIC) and copy number changes <xref rid="pone.0106784-Voortman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106784-Iwakawa1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> similar to human SCLC. Therefore, we have extracted and analyzed datasets for SCLC cell lines in order to identify drug sensitivities specific to this disease, as this was not the intention of the original studies, which was to pool data across a multitude of cell lines in order to identify genomic determinants of drug sensitivity. We identified polo-like kinases as attractive molecular targets with little current clinical trial experience in SCLC. Growth inhibition by PLK inhibitors was validated in our study, addressing concerns raised in a recent report about inconsistency in drug response data in large drug screening studies <xref rid="pone.0106784-HaibeKains1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The translational potential of PLK inhibitors in treating SCLC is supported by our demonstration that the drug sensitivity profile of the SCLC cell lines reflects what is observed clinically for metastatic SCLC tumors <xref rid="pone.0106784-William2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. That is, most cells were extremely sensitive to topoisomerase and microtubule inhibitors, chemotherapeutic agents that have activity against chemo-na&#x000ef;ve SCLC; by contrast, many tyrosine kinase inhibitors were ineffective.</p><p>The CGP study also identified drug sensitivities that tended to cluster across all cell lines (see Supplement <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0106784-t001">Table 1</xref> in reference 11) and the drug sensitivity profile for SCLC cells, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0106784-t001">Table 1</xref>, is very similar to cluster 4 of the CGP study [cluster 4 &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; GW-843682X (PLK1), BI-2536 (PLK1/2/3), A-443654 (AKT1/2/3), Epothilone B (microtubules), CGP-60474 (CDK1/2/5/7/9), Paclitaxel (microtubules) and MS-275 (HDAC)]. While it is currently unclear if these drug clusters indicate a common targeted pathway(s) leading to growth inhibition, these clusters may provide a practical starting point to test combinatorial drug therapies for synergistic activity in SCLC. Indeed, our own preliminary data shows synergism between PLK and CDK inhibitors.</p><p>We have developed a highly integrated analysis of PLK sensitivity in SCLC cell lines, graphically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106784-g009">Figure 9</xref> as circos plots, that incorporates gene expression, CNV and gene mutation data. An analysis of this depth has never been previously applied to SCLC, and demonstrates what can be achieved interrogating a single cell lineage and drug class in the CCLE and CGP datasets. Furthermore, our finding that the PLK gene signature for SCLC cell lines was dispersed among SCLC tumor specimen expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106784-g008">Figure 8</xref>) clearly demonstrates that these cells retain tumor phenotypes. Features in the circos plots such as the double mutation of both <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic> in PLK resistant cells, as well as the reciprocal expression of PLK signature genes on chromosomes 13 and 19, are readily apparent and must be examined in larger cohorts to determine their individual contribution to overall PLK inhibitor sensitivity. Taken together, this type of analysis may help to identify upstream genomic events that correlate with downstream phenotypes such as PLK sensitivity.</p><p>It was recently reported that mutations in the <italic>PLK1</italic> gene itself were primarily responsible for acquired resistance to BI2536 in a cultured human colon cancer cell line <xref rid="pone.0106784-Wacker1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This is unlikely to be a resistance mechanism in SCLC cell lines because the CCLE lists only four cell lines with a single <italic>PLK</italic> mutation among all four PLK family members (PLK1-4) and 53 SCLC cell lines examined. None of these PLK mutated cell lines were included in our study. Our PLK gene signature does, however, include genes on chromosomes typically deleted (4q, 13q) and amplified (19p) in SCLC <xref rid="pone.0106784-Peifer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106784-Voortman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106784-Iwakawa1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, although our circos plots reveal no obvious correlation between the two. Interestingly, chromosome Xq, which is not typically viewed as an important region of CNV in SCLC, was home to several of the most significant differentially-expressed genes that comprise the PLK gene signature- all were members of the MAGE-A, or melanoma-associated antigen-A, subfamily. This subfamily of genes is located on chromosome Xq28 and is only expressed in testis germ cells and tumor cells <xref rid="pone.0106784-Bredenbeck1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Although their biologic function is unclear, they represent a class of tumor antigens that are being actively investigated as a target for immunotherapy <xref rid="pone.0106784-UlloaMontoya1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106784-Karimi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The MAGE-A genes were upregulated in PLK-sensitive cell lines relative to PLK-insensitive cell lines. Furthermore, these expression patterns may correlate with CNV, as sensitive cells demonstrated little CNV on chromosome X, whereas most resistant cells demonstrated some CNV loss. We are currently testing the importance of this gene family as a biomarker of PLK sensitivity.</p><p>During our study a report by Sos et al. <xref rid="pone.0106784-Sos1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> was published in PNAS that specifically surveyed only SCLC cell lines (44 total) for drug sensitivity. Of the 267 compounds tested in this study, only 13 were also examined in the CCLE and/or CGP studies. Interestingly, when Sos et al. looked for drug sensitivity specifically in <italic>MYC</italic>-amplified cell lines, they also found the PLK inhibitor BI-2536 to be active, similar to our results, but did not pursue it further. They also showed that the majority of cells sensitive to the Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 demonstrated <italic>MYC</italic>-amplification. Interestingly, the CGP also included two Aurora kinase inhibitors (VX-680 and ZM-447439) in their study; however, it did not find any significant clustering of PLK with Aurora kinase inhibitors, indicating no link between these two classes of inhibitors when analyzed in the general population of cancer cell lines.</p><p>In the present study we consistently identified three subtypes of SCLC cell lines using unsupervised clustering of either gene expression or CNV datasets from the CGP or CCLE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106784.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106784.s007">Table S3</xref>) studies. Remarkably, there was little concordance between these two analyses except that a great majority of cells clustered into one predominant subtype, while the remaining cells divided unequally between two minor subtypes. Gene expression and CNV subtypes also did not align with drug sensitivity in general (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0106784-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106784.s002">S2</xref>) or PLK sensitivity in particular. This suggests that a comprehensive genomics approach, such as circos plot analysis, is required to identify critical determinants of drug sensitivity and other phenotypes in SCLC. This integrated approach may help to select SCLC patients that would benefit most from single agent use of drugs such as HDAC <xref rid="pone.0106784-deMarinis1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and PLK <xref rid="pone.0106784-Gandi1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> inhibitors that are broadly effective across SCLC cell lines but demonstrate limited activity in clinical trials.</p><p>Other unique approaches have been taken to identify new and effective therapies for SCLC. Jahchan et al. identified a surprising sensitivity of SCLC cells to tricyclic antidepressants in a drug repositioning study, which used bioinformatics to find drugs that induced changes in gene expression opposite to the gene expression profile of SCLC cells <xref rid="pone.0106784-Jachan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA) were used to identify PARP1 and EZH2 as potential therapeutic targets in SCLC <xref rid="pone.0106784-Beyers1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.
