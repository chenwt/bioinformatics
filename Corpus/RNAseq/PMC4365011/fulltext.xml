They usually are not translated and most arise from the intergenic regions of the genome where they are transcribed from their own promoters. These often are induced by specific stress conditions or environmental and morphological changes, which leads to a very efficient and defined regulation of sRNA expression [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Most sRNAs act by binding directly to or nearby the translation initiation region of their target mRNAs thereby influencing the initial steps of translation [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Using different experimental approaches, sRNAs have been found in a vast number of bacteria and archaea [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Most knowledge about sRNAs, their targets as well as their regulatory interactions that is available today, however, has been gathered from Gram-negative bacteria such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Streptomycetes are Gram-positive, GC-rich, soil dwelling bacteria, with some existent marine isolates. The members of this large class of bacteria usually undergo extensive morphological changes throughout their development, starting from a single spore to filamentous mycelia and finally aerial hyphae. <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> is the model organism for this group of bacteria. It has a 8.7 Mb linear genome with approximately 8000 annotated genes and about 100 predicted or verified sRNA genes (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]).</p><p>The <underline><italic>S</italic></underline><italic>treptomyces</italic><underline><italic>c</italic></underline><italic>oelicolor</italic> s<underline>R</underline>NA upstream of SCO<underline>5239</underline>: scr5239 was identified in a deep sequencing approach in 2011 [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is one of only two noncoding RNAs in the genus <italic>Streptomyces</italic> where a target has been identified [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The sRNA is conserved in nearly two-thirds of the currently available <italic>Streptomyces</italic> genomes. Its secondary structure is that of five consecutive stem-loops, with the sequence of stem P4 being involved in the interaction with its first known target mRNA <italic>dagA</italic>. DagA is an extracellular agarase responsible for the first step of agar degradation, the cleavage of agar into the disaccharide neoagarobiose. However, while scr5239 is quite well conserved in Streptomycetes, <italic>dagA</italic> is not. This prompted us to screen for further targets of scr5239.</p><p>The small RNA scr5239 is constitutively expressed at a basal level throughout the developmental cycle. In this study we show, however, that its expression level does change depending on the availability of different amino acids like glutamine, glutamate and methionine. Methionine is an essential amino acid in all organisms. As a proteinogenic amino acid it is best known for its important role during the initiation of translation but it is also the key component of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), the cells main donor of methyl groups [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Like most bacterial species, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>coelicolor</italic> possesses a biosynthetic pathway for methionine production. In general methionine is synthesized from aspartate via homoserine, serine, cysteine and homocysteine. A comprehensive review of methionine biosynthesis in bacteria was published recently [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The final step of methionine synthesis is the S-methylation of homocysteine. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>coelicolor</italic> two independent non-homologous enzymes can carry out this reaction: The cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase MetH (SCO1657) and the cobalamin-independent MetE (SCO0985). In the MetH catalysed reaction cobalamin serves as a methyl acceptor and donor giving MetH a roughly 50-fold higher turnover rate then its functional sibling MetE [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The decision as to which enzyme is used depends on the availability of adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl or coenzyme B12). The <italic>metE</italic> gene carries a B12-sensing riboswitch in its 5&#x02019;UTR. Binding of coenzyme B12 to the riboswitch leads to the formation of a transcriptional terminator and repression of <italic>metE</italic> expression. In the absence of coenzyme B12 the <italic>metE</italic> mRNA is synthesized. It is unknown if and how <italic>metH</italic> expression is repressed in that case.</p><p>The second necessary input signal for <italic>metE</italic> expression is the feedback regulation by the methionine level in the cell that determines if there is a need for methionine synthesis. The exact nature and the members of this regulatory process, however, are not known [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this work we show that, in the case of <italic>metE</italic>, methionine dependent repression of the synthase is achieved by binding of a small noncoding RNA to the <italic>metE</italic> mRNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cultivation of <italic>Streptomycetes</italic></title><p>108 spores of S. coelicolor M145 per 50 ml media were pre-germinated as described by Kieser et al.

First, we analysed the expression of scr5239 in the presence of the key components of nitrogen storage, glutamine and glutamate. <xref rid="pone.0120147.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> shows a northern blot of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>coelicolor</italic> wild type cells grown in minimal medium supplemented with glutamine or glutamate.

The other isoenzyme, MetH, is vitamin B12-dependent; it requires methylcobalamin (derived from B12) as a cofactor to catalyse the <italic>de novo</italic> formation of methionine. In bacteria that carry functionally equivalent B12-dependent and B12-independent enzymes, the activity of the B12-independent one often is regulated by a B12 riboswitch in the 5&#x02019;UTR of the respective mRNA [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. By comparing a large variety of bacterial genomes Vitreschak <italic>et al</italic>.

The standard method to analyse sRNA-target interactions <italic>in vivo</italic> was developed for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> by Urban <italic>et al</italic>. in 2007 [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. There, the sRNA of interest is expressed from a high-copy plasmid while a target-mRNA-GFP fusion is expressed from a low-copy plasmid to enhance the regulatory effect and the sensitivity of the system. Mutations in the sRNA and/or the mRNA fragment serve to validate the interaction. Since its publication, this system has been adapted for a wide range of organisms like <italic>Sinorhizobium</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] or <italic>Vibrio</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

Further, we used the integrating plasmid pGusA to gain a reliable and stable copy-number of the reporter fusion. In addition, we decided to create a scr5239 deletion strain (&#x00394;scr5239), where the sRNA was replaced by a kanamycin resistance cassette (<xref rid="pone.0120147.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5a and S5b Fig</xref>.). We chose to delete scr5239 because the previously used antisense-mediated knockdown strain [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] showed considerable variation in knockdown efficiency depending on the medium conditions used (data not shown).</p><p>We used the same RNA sequence as for the mobility shift experiments for the <italic>in vivo</italic> measurement of the scr5239&#x02014;<italic>metE</italic> interaction (construct M1).

This finding fits to the current understanding of sRNA function in bacteria: that sRNAs, like the eukaryotic microRNAs, usually do not regulate just one target but act as posttranscriptional control instances for whole networks of target genes [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. One example for this is the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>typhimurium</italic> sRNA GcvB that is a major regulator of amino acid metabolism in this organism [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>The binding site of scr5239 to its second target again is located within the ORF of the mRNA. In the best-studied examples, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>typhimurium</italic>, it is known but rather unusual for an sRNA to bind its target in its ORF. The majority of sRNAs in these organisms regulate the expression of their targets by blocking access to the ribosomal binding site and/or start codon thereby hindering translation initiation. However, recent studies have shown that binding of an sRNA up to 5 codons downstream of the start codon still is sufficiently close to the translation initiation region to interfere with 30S subunit binding [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The binding site of scr5239 on the <italic>metE</italic> mRNA fits this rule as it covers the codons 3&#x02013;10 (<xref rid="pone.0120147.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Interestingly, the binding site of scr5239 on <italic>dagA</italic> covers the codons 11&#x02013;18 on the mRNA [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This supports our current proposal, that the regulation of <italic>dagA</italic>&#x02014;a rather recent acquisition to the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>coelicolor</italic> genome&#x02014;by scr5239 is still in the progress of being established.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>dagA</italic>, the <italic>metE</italic> gene including its binding site to scr5239 is highly conserved throughout the streptomycetes indicating that this regulatory interaction is much more widespread (<xref rid="pone.0120147.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0120147.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref> Figs). On the side of scr5239 a seven nucleotide core binding motif (GCUGCGG) is highly conserved in all homologs we identified so far. In about half the homologs this motif occurs&#x02014;with one G to C variation&#x02014;in tandem (GCU<underline>C</underline>CGG-GCU<underline>G</underline>CGG, see <xref rid="pone.0120147.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8a Fig</xref> top five sequences). Being in the coding region of the <italic>metE</italic> gene, the binding site on the mRNA is even more highly conserved (<xref rid="pone.0120147.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8b Fig</xref>). But a few variations occur: the core motif complementary to scr5239s is CCGCAGC. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>hygroscopicus</italic> there is a silent A to G mutation that increases the possible binding site by three nucleotides (<xref rid="pone.0120147.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>). An additional CGC insertion in the ORF three nucleotides downstream of the conserved motif also got integrated into the binding site on the sRNAs side.</p><p>Little is known about the regulation of amino acid metabolism in <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. To date, three conserved transcription factors involved in amino acid biosynthesis have been characterized: GlnR (glutamine, glutamate), ArgR (arginine) and NdgR (leucine, cysteine and methionine) [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. NdgR has recently been shown to act as a transcriptional activator on at least two genes of the methionine synthesis system: <italic>metH</italic> and the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase <italic>metF</italic> that catalyzes the second to last step of methionine synthesis. In this study, Kim <italic>et al</italic>. used the DNA sequences of the presumed promoter regions of the respective genes as bait and screened for NdgR binding. The <italic>metE</italic> probe, however, failed to capture any NdgR even though they used the whole intergenic region upstream of <italic>metE</italic> as bait. Kim <italic>et al</italic>. identified two possible binding motifs for NdgR within the probes that were captured by the protein. However, both of them are absent in the intergenic region upstream of the <italic>metE</italic> gene. This implies, that the two enzymes MetE and MetH are regulated by different means although they perform the same reaction: MetH expression is dependent on the presence of the transcriptional activator NdgR. The expression of MetE, on the other hand, depends both, on the absence of coenzyme B12 and of the sRNA scr5239.</p><p><xref rid="pone.0120147.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> shows a model of our current understanding of the role scr5239 plays in the regulation of <italic>metE</italic>.

High methionine concentration results in feed back regulation of both MetH and MetE. MetH is controlled by the transcriptional regulator NdgR [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

While there are several alternative ways leading to homocysteine, this last step is highly conserved. The two methionine synthases MetH and MetE can be found in parallel in a large number of bacteria, although there are species that carry one but not the other [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The transcription of <italic>metE</italic> is regulated by a B12 riboswitch in its 5&#x02019;UTR in most bacteria. This allows the cell to make the decision if coenzyme B12 is available and if therefore the expression of a cobalamin-independent methionine synthase is necessary. Some bacteria, like <italic>Bacillus clausii</italic>, additionally have a SAM riboswitch in tandem to the B12 riboswitch in their <italic>metE</italic> 5&#x02019;UTR. Also the expression of <italic>metH</italic> and <italic>metK</italic> is controlled by a SAM riboswitch in this organism. This setup generates a feedback inhibition where high SAM levels directly repress the expression of these three enzymes [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Streptomycetes lack a SAM riboswitch in <italic>metE</italic> (also in <italic>metH</italic> and <italic>metK</italic>), therefore we propose that here the conserved sRNA scr5239 takes over its regulatory function: to give a feedback about the cells methionine (and SAM) supply.</p><p>Nature has come up with diverse solutions to tackle the problem of multiple signal input. In <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>, the <italic>glmS</italic> riboswitch probably represents the simplest solution. The ligand binding pocket of the aptamer domain not only binds intracellular Glucosamine-6-phosphate as an activating agent. It also binds Glucose-6-phosphate, which acts as an inhibitor of ribozyme activity. The riboswitch, thus, integrates metabolite information to sense the overall metabolic state of the cell [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A second solitary element that senses and integrates two different input signals is the adenine riboswitch encoded by the <italic>add</italic> gene from <italic>Vibrio vulnificus</italic>. This translational regulatory element senses temperature and ligand concentration to confer efficient regulation over the range of physiologically relevant temperatures, allowing gene expression control to adapt to the differing temperatures experienced in the free-living and in the infectious environments [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As already discussed above, in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>clausii</italic>, two different riboswitches respond independently to SAM and vitamin B12, respectively. This system&#x02019;s output fits a Boolean NOR gate, because transcription is terminated in the presence of only one or both ligands [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the work presented here, not two riboswitches but a riboswitch combined with a regulatory small RNA mediate the input of the two signals. A combination of sRNAs and riboswitches regulation was also reported for SroA and SroG, two sRNA processed out of a riboswitch [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] or, even more intriguingly, two riboswitches which respond to SAM in <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> which control the expression of the virulence regulator PrfA act as sRNA themselves [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. On the contrary, a recent report describes a B12 riboswitch that is part of the sRNA EutX controlling ethanolamin utilization in <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>. This riboswitch can lead to premature termination of the sRNA-target interaction therefore regulating the sRNA function. Obviously there are plenty of possibilities to perform multiple input integration, however to our knowledge; <italic>metE</italic> is the first example of an sRNA regulating gene expression in combination with a riboswitch.</p><p>What is the connection of the regulation of methionine synthesis to the glutamine/glutamate complex? Glutamine acts as nitrogen storage in the cell. Feeding the cells with glutamine shifts the balance towards nitrogen surplus and leads to repression of scr5239 expression (<xref rid="pone.0120147.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). It is not clear, why methionine production would have to be upregulated under these conditions. Generally, nitrogen limitation is regarded as the &#x02018;normal&#x02019; state for bacteria growing in soil [<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120147.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This would be represented by a high glutamate over glutamine ratio leading to an induction of scr5239 and thereby a repression of methionine synthesis. A good nitrogen supply, however, can induce a period of fast growth where protein synthesis and thereby the demand for amino acids increases. Therefore scr5239 regulation possibly connects the nitrogen supply status of the cell to amino acid synthesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0120147.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Quantification of the northern blot shown in <xref rid="pone.0120147.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>.</title><p>Scr5239 signal was normalized to the 5S rRNA loading control.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0120147.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0120147.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>RNAseq data of the <italic>metE</italic> mRNA.</title><p>RNA was prepared at five different time points from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>coelicolor</italic> M145 grown on solid medium throughout one developmental cycle.
