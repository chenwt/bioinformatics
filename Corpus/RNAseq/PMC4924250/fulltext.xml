Plant pathogens may gain access to a plant via a wound or natural opening such as stomata, or they may directly penetrate the plant surface. In response, plants have evolved sophisticated strategies to combat the invasion of different types of pathogens. Plants may use pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to elicit PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) to combat pathogen infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Induction of PTI is always accompanied by the induction of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and of calcium signaling, transcription of pathogen-responsive genes, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and deposition of callose to reinforce the cell wall at sites of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For the pathogens escaped from PTI, effectors are employed to interfere with plant defenses. In turn, plants have evolved resistance (<italic>R</italic>) genes to recognize specific pathogen effectors, resulting in effector-triggered immunity (ETI) and a hypersensitive response (HR) at the infection site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>After a plant perceives a pathogen, conversion of the early pathogen-induced signals into defense responses depends largely on phytohormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Species of phytohormones induced in this process depends greatly on the lifestyle and infection strategy of the invader. The roles of salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene (ET) in the regulation of plant immune responses have been established in many studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. JA/ET primarily participates in deterrence of herbivores and resistance to necrotrophic pathogens, whereas the SA is primarily involved in resistance to biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The roles of auxins in plant-pathogen interactions have also been described in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Auxins can positively or negatively impact plant defense responses depending on the lifestyles of pathogens. Repression of the auxin response pathway in <italic>axr2-1</italic> and <italic>axr1-1</italic> mutants increases <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> susceptibility to the necrotrophic fungi <italic>Plectosphaerella cucumerina</italic> and <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Nevertheless, disruption of auxin signaling in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants <italic>axr1</italic>, <italic>axr2</italic>, and <italic>axr3</italic> leads to enhanced resistance to the hemibiotrophic pathogen <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Auxin is synthesized in meristematic tissues like shoots, root tips, and lateral root initials, and transported within the plant either through phloem (known as non-polar auxin transport) or polar auxin transport (PAT). The inhibition of PAT with 2, 3, 5-triio-dobenzoic acid and 1-naphthylphthalamic acid increases resistance to <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Flavonoids are endogenous inhibitors of PAT, and a <italic>tt4</italic> mutant with a mutation in the <italic>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</italic> (<italic>CHS</italic>) increases the rate of auxin transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and is more susceptible to <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. All these results suggest an important role for auxin signaling and PAT in plant defense.</p><p>Stalk rot is one of the most destructive soil-borne diseases of maize, and it causes substantial losses in yield and quality. Previous studies have clarified the genetic basis of stalk rot resistance, and several resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and genes have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A transcriptome analysis conducted in a pair of resistant and susceptible near-isogenic lines (NILs) revealed that secondary metabolic pathways (e.g., biosynthesis of alkaloids and phenylpropanoids) and plant hormones may play important roles in maze resistance to <italic>F. graminearum</italic>-induced stalk rot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> (teleomorph <italic>Gibberella zeae</italic>), the causal agent of <italic>Gibberella</italic> stalk rot, also causes Ear Rot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and Crown Rot in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and <italic>Fusarium</italic> Head Blight (FHB) in wheat and barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, known as a hemibiotrophic pathogen, always uses cell-wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) and trichothecenes to facilitate invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Deoxynivalenol (DON), a type of trichothecene secreted by <italic>Fusarium</italic> species, usually serves as a virulence factor during the infection of host and is harmful to animal and human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It can cause the HR and programmed cell death (PCD) during infection of host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although the virulence role of DON on plant cell is unknown, it can act as an eukaryotic protein synthesis inhibitor in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Hence, <italic>Fusarium</italic> species may utilize DON to suppress or delay the plant defense response against fungal attack by inhibiting the synthesis of resistance-related proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, transcriptome analysis has been used to study plant-pathogen interactions. Defense responses towards <italic>Fusarium</italic> species and its secreted trichothecenes have been intensely investigated in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Defense responses in different hosts are similar to a certain degree, e.g., the activation of the JA/ET or SA signaling pathway, induction of the genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins and proteins involved in mycotoxin transportation and degradation, increased expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in the phenylpropanoid-related pathway, and the expression of oxidative stress response genes.</p><p>Although much progress has been made in charactering the defense mechanisms against <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, the molecular mechanism of resistance to maize stalk rot still remains obscure. Therefore, understanding the responses of maize to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> infection is important for disease control and resistance breeding. In our previous studies, two QTLs, namely <italic>qRfg1</italic> and <italic>qRfg2</italic>, increasing the resistance percentage of maize plants to <italic>Gibberella</italic> stalk rot by 32&#x02013;43&#x000a0;% and ~12&#x000a0;%, were finally refined to an interval of ~500 and ~300&#x000a0;kb on chromosomes 10 and 1, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In our present study, three NILs differing at <italic>qRfg1</italic> and <italic>qRfg2</italic> were used to study the defense mechanisms involved in stalk rot using RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Three different time points were included to gain comprehensive insight into the molecular mechanisms in the response of maize to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Phenotypic evaluation of three NILs</title><p>Two resistance QTLs, <italic>qRfg1</italic> and <italic>qRfg2,</italic> were separately introducing from the donor resistant line 1145 into the susceptible line Y331 via marker-assisted backcrossing procedure. In the advanced backcross generation, two individuals with the shortest donor fragments harboring either <italic>qRfg1</italic> or <italic>qRfg2</italic> were chosen. These two individuals were intercrossed, followed by two-rounds of self-pollination, to generate three NILs harboring either <italic>qRfg1</italic> (NIL1) or <italic>qRfg2</italic> (NIL2), or neither (NIL3). The genetic background of each of three NILs was evaluated using a GoldenGate 3KSNP (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), and each NIL shared &#x0003e;99.9&#x000a0;% identical genetic background with the recurrent parent Y331. We assessed disease severity in the three NILs after inoculation with <italic>F. graminearum</italic> at the mature stage as described by Yang et al.

Transcriptome sequence data for all samples can be found in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession number PRJNA308408. After filtering and quality control of the raw reads, a total of 536,184,652 clean reads were yielded, and the average number of reads per sample ranged from 24,083,640 to 34,407,089 (average&#x02009;=&#x02009;29,788,036; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

In the young panicles of OX-Ghd7<sup>HJ19</sup> transgenic rice, fewer genes were upregulated and more genes were downregulated compared with wild type, which indicates an inhibitory role for <italic>Ghd7</italic> in transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In our study, the basal difference was obtained by comparing NIL1 with NIL3 at 0 hpi; more genes (1615) were highly expressed in NIL3 compared with NIL1 (884), which corresponded well with the role of <italic>Ghd7</italic> in the inhibition of gene expression.</p><p>Plant responses to pathogen infection may be quite diverse. Some plants may resist pathogen infection by inducing defense-related genes and pathways, while other plants may be well prepared for oncoming stress via the constitutive high expression of resistance genes specific for a biotic or abiotic stress, i.e., the plants create a resistance barrier before the full force of the stress occurs. In this study, lots of defense-related biological processes were enriched in the relevant genes more abundantly expressed in NIL1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). All these results suggest that <italic>qRfg1</italic> can counterattack the infection of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> via constitutive resistance. A previous study showed that OX-Ghd7<sup>HJ19</sup> transgenic rice had altered expression of genes involved in hormone signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In our study, genes more abundant in NIL1 were significantly enriched in biological processes, such as response to JA stimulus and SA-mediated signaling, suggesting the role of <italic>qRfg1</italic> in the constitutive resistance to infection via the orchestration of phytohormones. Of the genes more abundant in NIL1, in addition to GO terms related to defense responses, biological processes related to growth/development, and cell division/organization were also significantly represented (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These results are consistent with the documented phenotype of NIL1 and suggest that in addition to the defense resistance, <italic>qRfg1</italic> also participates in the regulation of growth/development.</p><p>After inoculation with <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, biological processes related to plant growth/development, plant photosynthesis/biogenesis, and defense-related responses were significantly represented in the exclusively upregulated genes in NIL1 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S2). All these results demonstrated that <italic>qRfg1</italic> provides maize resistance to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> through two approaches: the constitutive high expression of genes related to the resistance and induced defense responses after <italic>F. graminearum</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title><italic>qRfg2</italic> increase the resistance to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> via the relatively repression of auxin signaling</title><p>The <italic>qRfg2</italic> can significantly increase the maize resistance to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> at both mature and seedling stages (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). The candidate gene for <italic>qRfg2</italic> was predicated to encode an auxin-regulated protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It has been reported that auxin signaling contributes to the plant resistance. Repression of auxin signaling either through mutation of auxin signaling components or inhibition of auxin transport compromises <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> resistance to the necrotrophic fungi <italic>P. cucumerina</italic> and <italic>B. cinerea</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, auxin signaling is required for susceptibility of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. <italic>AXR2</italic> and <italic>AXR3</italic> encode the IAA/AUX proteins IAA7 and IAA17, respectively, which repress the expression of auxin-inducible genes. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants <italic>axr2</italic> and <italic>axr3</italic> increased <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> resistance by delaying symptom development relative to wild-type plants, whereas no significant difference in disease resistance between <italic>tir1</italic> and wild-type plants is evident [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These results suggest that auxin signaling downstream of the auxin receptor contribute to the susceptibility of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. In our study, many genes involved in auxin signaling were upregulated in NIL2 and NIL3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). All these results indicate that auxin signaling is required for susceptibility of both NIL2 and NIL3 to <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>, several genes encoding proteins involved in auxin signaling were induced more in NIL3 than NIL2, including auxin-inducible proteins, putative auxin induced protein, GH3 family proteins, and SAUR family protein, suggesting that <italic>qRfg2</italic> may increase the resistance to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> as a consequence of the relatively repression of auxin signaling genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>PAT is required for the susceptibility of maize to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> infection</title><p>Auxin is synthesized in meristematic tissues like shoots, root tips, and lateral root initials, and it is transported within the plant either through phloem or PAT. Compared with auxin synthesized in roots, a relatively large proportion of auxin is transported to roots from aerial parts. Therefore, pathogens may target PAT components as a more effective way of modulating auxin levels to cause disease. It has been reported that inhibition of PAT through chemical or genetic means results in increased susceptibility to foliar fungal pathogens of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> treated with 2, 3, 5-triiodobenzoic acid, a chemical inhibitor of PAT, reduces disease development after <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> infection, but this inhibitor can also inhibit spore germination in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. <italic>BIG</italic>, also called <italic>LPR1</italic>, is required for PAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. <italic>BIG</italic> responds to <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and a resistance phenotype was observed in the <italic>big</italic> mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In our study, <italic>LPR1</italic> was induced in both NIL2 and NIL3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). PAT is controlled by the location of auxin influx and efflux carriers to the plasma membrane. Auxin efflux is regulated by PIN proteins together with the multidrug resistance/phosphoglycoprotein (MDR/PGP) ATP binding cassette transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In our study, <italic>PIN8</italic>, <italic>PIN9</italic>, <italic>PIN10a</italic>, and <italic>ATP binding cassette subfamily B4</italic> (<italic>ABCB4</italic>) genes were induced in NIL2 and NIL3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). It has been reported that <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> inoculation increases the expression of genes involved in flavonoids. Flavonoids are the endogenous inhibitors of PAT, and a <italic>tt4</italic> mutant with a mutation in the <italic>CHS</italic> is more susceptible to <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. <italic>HCT</italic> silencing lines has a severe growth inhibition owing to the inhibition of auxin transport and increased flavonoid accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In our study, several genes involved in flavonoid synthesis were differentially expressed between NIL2 and NIL3. One <italic>LAR</italic>, homolog of <italic>BAN</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which encoding a NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold superfamily protein negatively regulates flavonoid biosynthesis, was more abundant in NIL3 at 0 and 6 hpi. Genes playing important roles in PAT were also more abundantly expressed in NIL3 compared with NIL2, including <italic>AVP1</italic>, <italic>LAR</italic>, <italic>HCT</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>). All these results suggest a role for PAT in the susceptibility of plants to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> infection, and disruptions of PAT would undoubtedly result in altered resistance of maize to <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. The <italic>qRfg2</italic> may increase maize resistance to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> by inhibiting PAT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The <italic>qRfg1</italic> increases maize resistance to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> through both the constitutive and induced high expression of defense-related genes, and after <italic>F. graminearum</italic> inoculation it can elegantly fine-tune the metabolic processes between defense and growth. The <italic>qRfg2</italic> mediated resistance via the differential expression or induction of genes involved in auxin signaling and PAT, implying again the linking of growth to resistance.
