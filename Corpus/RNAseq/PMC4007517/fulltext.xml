The results of our transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses are in agreement with those of a previous study in which we showed that female moths prefer susceptible oaks due to their specific profile of herbivore-induced volatiles.

With more than 200,000 secondary metabolites, plants directly resist microbial and insect attacks, animal predation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and multiple environmental stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The suite of secondary metabolites in plants is composed both of metabolites that are constitutively expressed in different plant tissues and of inducible compounds that complete the overall armament of plants in response to herbivore feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>To ensure optimal defence responses, plants must be able to up- and down-regulate primary and secondary metabolic pathways at every level to exert temporal and spatial control in an effective and efficient way, thereby minimising damage and ensuring vegetative growth and reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. For this purpose, plants have evolved constitutive and induced defence mechanisms. Preformed molecular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], chemical, and physical mechanisms may reduce the accessibility or availability of the plant resources to herbivorous insects. For example, one of the most important groups of constitutive defence compounds that act against herbivores and pathogens are the condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins; PA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These are polyphenolic compounds synthesised via the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Analyses of specific PAs have been performed in many tree species, such as poplar and oaks (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]) and in herbaceous plants (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). In oak foliage, for example, different levels of condensed tannin content in combination with nitrogen content seem to be essential in determining the susceptibility to herbivorous insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition to the condensed tannins, the so-called hydrolysable tannins (i.e., gallotannins, ellagitannins) are also important and have only recently become a focus of research into the defence response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Interestingly, insect specialists prefer lower tannin content than do insect generalists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Inducible defence reactions involve a broad range of molecules whose synthesis is temporally controlled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We know of at least two types of inducible defence responses: the direct defences that inhibit the growth or development of herbivorous insects and the indirect defences that include the plant volatiles, which may, for example, attract the parasitoids and predators of the herbivore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Transcript profiling using DNA microarrays has significantly improved our understanding of the regulatory and transcriptional networks of gene activation/inactivation in plants during plant-insect interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, while this technology is restricted to profiling transcripts that are represented by corresponding DNA probes on the microarray, recent developments in RNA sequencing (RNAseq) allow the genome-wide profiling and quantification of transcripts, and these approaches can be used to study plant defence responses in more comprehensive detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. To date, the use of RNAseq in studies of herbivory has been rare. Gilardoni <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] analysed the <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> transcriptome using SuperSAGE and 454 sequencing after elicitation with fatty acid-amino acid conjugates known to act as elicitors in <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> herbivory.</p><p>As transient or constitutive end products of the cascade that begins with gene activation, the constituents of the metabolome define the biochemical phenotype of an organism. Thus, quantitative and qualitative measurements of the plant metabolome during herbivory can provide a wide overview of the biochemical status of the plant and essential information regarding the influence of metabolite levels on the phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In the present work, we applied RNAseq and non-targeted metabolome analysis, performed using Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], to examine the transcriptional and metabolomic differences in pedunculate oak (<italic>Quercus robur</italic> L.) varieties that differ in their degree of defoliation and susceptibility to herbivory by the green oak leaf roller (<italic>Tortrix viridana</italic> L., Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). <italic>T. viridana</italic> is a specialist herbivorous insect that feeds only on species of the genus <italic>Quercus</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In Central Europe, the perpetual outbreak of the green oak leaf roller is one reason for oak decline events reported during the last century. During a past outbreak episode in Germany in the years 2003&#x02013;2005, in which <italic>T. viridana</italic> caused almost the complete defoliation of oaks in a selected forest stand in North Rhine-Westphalia, we observed that a few individual oaks were remarkably less defoliated than neighbouring trees. We defined these less-defoliated individuals as resistant ('T-oaks&#x02019;) and the heavily defoliated trees as susceptible ('S-oaks&#x02019;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In recent work, we demonstrated that the resistance of T-oaks to herbivore attack by <italic>T. viridana</italic> is related to the amount and scent of herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). In the same study, we showed that the T- and S-oaks differed in their polyphenolic leaf constituents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>To unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms related to the resistance and susceptibility of oaks towards herbivory by <italic>T. viridana</italic>, we performed controlled laboratory experiments to identify candidate genes that exhibited induced differences in their expression patterns after insects feeding. Moreover, analysing the unfed control plants aided in the identification of candidate genes that exhibit constitutive expression differences between the oak types. To complete our systems biological approach, we comparatively analysed the metabolome of T- and S-oaks to correlate gene expression patterns and metabolite profiles. Moreover, this analysis provided the opportunity to identify the overall metabolomic differences between T- and S-oaks in addition to the local and systemic changes induced by <italic>T. viridana</italic> feeding or by developmental alterations in plant metabolite patterns.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Transcriptional differences between T- and S-oaks after <italic>T. viridana</italic> feeding</title><p>As a first step, we used the MapMan tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] for displaying the transcriptional differences between T- and S-oaks after 16&#x000a0;h of <italic>T. viridana</italic> feeding to obtain a global overview of the related cellular pathways. All transcripts showing any difference in their expression level (RPKM-value: reads per kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads) between the T- and S-oaks after <italic>T. viridana</italic> feeding were included in this analysis. When comparing the two oak types, 30 MapMan functional categories (BINs) showed a significantly different average BIN response (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test in the MapMan tool; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) compared to the response of all other BINs. The most significant of these BINs are related to photosynthesis and ribosomal protein synthesis, while other differences were identified in BINs related to chromatin structure, redox, targeting to mitochondria, and other cellular functions (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p><p>In the second step, we selected candidate transcripts that were potentially involved in the different transcriptional responses of T- and S-oaks to <italic>T. viridana</italic> feeding.

Although these samples represent pooled samples of different S- and T-oak individuals, one has to consider that some of the differentially expressed genes identified from this comparison between S- and T-oak controls would contribute to other phenotypic differences than resistance to the green oak leaf roller.</p><p>Considering all transcripts with any difference in the values between the samples, 28 BINs were identified that showed expression differences that deviated from those of all other BINs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Among these BINs were the E3 (E3 ubiquitin ligase) BIN and the flavonoids BIN, which are related to secondary metabolism (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p><p>In total, 1,464 transcripts showed constitutively different expression levels.

It is obvious at first glance that a much higher percentage of the T<sub>CO</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;S<sub>CO</sub>-group transcripts (red bars) were present in the protein BIN compared with those of the T<sub>CO</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;S<sub>CO</sub>-group (blue bars; Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). The same trend in distribution was also observed for the cell, photosynthesis, DNA, cell wall, amino acid metabolism, and lipid metabolism BINs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). It is interesting to note that the cell, DNA, and cell wall BINs showed an inverse profile of transcript enrichment in the insect-fed leaves (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A).</p><p>When we analysed the enrichment of specific BINs in the T<sub>CO</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;S<sub>CO</sub>-group compared to the <italic>Q. robur</italic> reference set, we observed that several BINs showed significant over-representation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>); among these were many protein synthesis-related BINs. With regard to secondary metabolism, the farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase BIN of the cytosolic isoprenoid pathway was also over-represented in this group. Two BINs related to cell wall degradation, were also over-represented in the T<sub>CO</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;S<sub>CO</sub>-group: (i) the pectate lyases and polygalacturonases BIN and (ii) the cellulases and beta-1,4-glucanases BIN (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In the T<sub>CO</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;S<sub>CO</sub>-group, transcripts corresponding to glutathione-S-transferases and metal handling (especially metal binding, chelation, and storage) showed an over-representation.

Among the metabolites showing strong differences in levels between T- and S-oaks, we focused our attention on the most abundant metabolites measured. Nicotinate ribonucleotide, an important precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), was found to be strongly up-regulated in T-oaks. Several end-products of secondary metabolism, particularly galloylated flavonol glycosides (of which kaempferol galloylgalactoside and quercetin galloylglucoside were the most likely candidates among all potential isomers), were found to occur at levels that were 10- to 20-fold higher in T-oaks than in S-oaks. The amounts of these compounds did not differ between D and I leaves, which indicates that they likely show constitutive differences between T- and S-plants. The concentration of corilagin, a tannin and galloyl derivative, was higher in T-oaks. The amount of ellagic acid, another galloyl derivative typically found in oaks, was also greater in T-oaks. In addition, many biosynthetic precursors of condensed tannins were found at higher levels in T-oaks. Amongst these were flavan 3-ol derivatives, such as epigallocatechin, a catechin with an additional phenolic hydroxyl group. Additionally, some phenolic intermediates, such as coumaric acid, sinapoyl malate, coumaroyl quinic acid, were much more abundant in T-oaks than in S-oaks.</p><p>Conversely, S-oaks showed higher levels of basic flavonol glycosides.

T-oaks also contained higher amounts of other sugars, such as glucarate (an intermediate of ascorbate metabolism) and ribose 5-diphosphate, compared to S-oaks. Metabolites from nucleotide metabolism were significantly more abundant in S-oaks, which had relatively high levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cytidine monophosphate.</p><p>We could generally characterise the developmental changes in leaf metabolism using 169 metabolites that exhibited significantly altered expression in our study. Leaf maturation was associated with an increase in amino acids related to phenylalanine derivatives, while it was also associated with decreased levels of tryptophan, aspartic acid, and homoserine derivatives (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>).

Leaf development was also characterised by strong differences of the levels of specific flavonoids and phenolic compounds.</p><p>Local and systemic responses were indicated by significant changes in the levels of 14 metabolites between D- and I-leaves. Directly damaged leaves exhibited a greater accumulation of FA, FA oxidation products related to wounding responses, signalling compounds, and healing agents, such as traumatic acid, tuberonic acid, tuberonic acid glucoside, linolenic acid, and 13-L-hydroperoxylinoleic acid. Conversely, intact leaves had relative higher levels of carbohydrates and secondary metabolites (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Combined mapping of metabolites and transcripts to metabolic pathways</title><p>In an initial study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], we described differences in the emission pattern of HIPVs among T- and S-oaks. T-oaks displayed higher emission rates of sesquiterpenes (&#x003b1;-farnesene and germacrene D), while the HIPV pattern of S-oaks was dominated by monoterpenes and the irregular acyclic homoterpene 4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT), a derivative of the sesquiterpene nerolidol produced by oxidative degradation by a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. Moreover, we found distinct differences in the phenolic compound composition of T- and S-oaks, and these differences were analysed in more detail, as described above.

Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref> summarizes the constitutive and induced transcriptomic and metabolomic differences in T- and S-oaks responding to green oak leaf roller herbivory. The transcript levels of cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDE) are constitutively high in T-oaks (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>A) but were found to be more inducible in S-oaks (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>B). Changes in hormone signalling are likely to occur via the CDPK (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascades. Moreover, transcriptional changes at transcription factor genes are most likely responsible for the eventual activation of several defence response genes, such as those involved in the synthesis of volatiles and pathogen-related genes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). The activated cascade results in a different response in T- and S-oaks mainly characterised by transcriptomic and metabolomic differences in the biosynthesis of tannins, flavonoids and terpenes (which is discussed in detail below).</p><fig id="F10" position="float"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p><bold>Model of a signalling cascade for oak&#x02019;s constitutive and induced defence response.</bold> The model of the cascade is derived from a model recently published by Arimura <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. <bold>A:</bold> In the unfed control, the cascade is expected to be triggered by some 'damaged-self&#x02019; oligosaccharids (OS; grey circles) acting as elicitors activated by constitutively expressed cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDE; higher expressed in T-oaks than in S-oaks). <bold>B:</bold> Feeding by the leaf chewing insect <italic>T. viridana</italic> induces the release of herbivore-derived OS (green circles; elicitors) as well as of 'damaged-self&#x02019; OS and therefore initiates the cascade.

In the present comparison, we discovered higher transcript levels of plant CWDEs (polygalacturonases and beta-1, 4-glucanases) in T-oak controls (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>A), including increased levels of transcripts for the putative cellulase Cel1 (Figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). At first glance, it is striking that T-oaks constitutively express higher levels of transcripts encoding enzymes that are normally inhibited by plants, e.g., by secreting polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins, when being attacked by the polygalacturonases of a pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Conversely, cell wall-degrading enzymes may activate defence responses by releasing oligosaccharides as elicitors. Thus, the increased expression of several beta-1,4-glucanase genes, such as CEL1, in T-oaks (Tables&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>; Figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>A) may result in higher constitutive levels of oligosaccharides. Additionally, cellulose-derived oligosaccharides have been shown to act as elicitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. So far, there are no reports on the influence of higher constitutive expression levels of plant beta-1,4-glucanases and polygalacturonases on pathogen resistance.

Oral secretions from herbivores can initiate plant cell trans-membrane potential (Vm) depolarization, an early response to herbivore feeding that is associated with the opening of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, changes in the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Immediately after this event, protein phosphorylation signalling via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, as well as via calcium-dependent kinases (CDPKs), triggers the production of phytohormones. After <italic>T. viridana</italic> feeding, we primarily observed the induction of transcripts associated with ethylene, jasmonic acid, and auxin production in both T- and S-oaks (Figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>).

For example, a transcript weakly similar to an <italic>A. thaliana</italic> histone 3B gene showed a distinctly higher level of expression in T-oaks (Tab. I). Functionally, DNA-associated histones may be involved in chromatin remodelling. Among the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodelling accomplished through the activity of histone-modifying enzymes and ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling complexes is emerging as a key process in the orchestration of plant biotic stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Whether the observed transcriptional differences in histones are related to differences in chromatin remodelling in T- and S-oaks remains an open question.</p></sec><sec><title>Defence responses: metabolites</title><p>Metabolically, T-oak leaves were very rich in galloyl flavonol glycosides, condensed and hydrolysable tannins, and phenolic glycosides. Conversely, leaves of the S-oak genotype had a greater abundance of flavonoid glycosides and some related intermediates, of plastidic terpenoid intermediates, and of sugars and nucleotides. The results of our analysis are in agreement with those of our earlier investigation of soluble polyphenols performed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which showed higher constitutive concentrations of some quercetin 3-glycosides and the PA precursor catechin in T-oaks than in S-oaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Moreover, the non-targeted metabolomic analysis revealed higher levels of plastidic terpenoid intermediates in S-oaks, which could be sustained and may therefore explain the increased herbivore-induced emission rates of monoterpenes previously observed in these lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><sec><title>Flavones and tannins</title><p>Flavonoids, particularly condensed tannins such as PA, are biologically active compounds that play an important role in plant-insect interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The higher levels of galloylated flavonol glucosides in T-oaks compared to S-oaks after feeding (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>B) may play a role in oak resistance. Once, it was believed that tannins were &#x0201c;quantitative defences&#x0201d; limiting protein digestion by herbivorous insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], but now it seems that the most important role of tannins is their pro-oxidant activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The oxidation of phenolics in the guts of insects produces ROS (e.g., quinones, peroxides), which can damage both essential nutrients and midgut tissues and therefore negatively influence insect performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>The concentrations of hydrolysable and condensed tannins in <italic>Quercus robur</italic> have been considered to be negatively correlated with insect abundance since the first pioneering study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Many other studies in different woody plant species have demonstrated the functional role of hydrolysable and condensed tannins as plant defences against generalist insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. There are also counter-examples where generalists, such as the forest tent caterpillar, are sensitive to hydrolysable tannins, while others, such as the white-marked tussock moth (<italic>Orgyia leucostigma</italic>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and the gypsy moth (<italic>Lymantria dispar</italic>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], are tannin-resistant. The same is true for condensed tannins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The defensive effects of condensed tannins in <italic>Quercus</italic> sp. are even stronger on specialist insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. For the autumnal moth (<italic>Epirrita autumnata)</italic>, it has been shown that high gallotannin concentration reduces the growth rate of this insect, whereas PAs impair larval growth only when the gallotannin content is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. A more recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] concluded that ellagitannins are the most bioactive tannins, while gallotannins have intermediate to low bioactivity and condensed tannins have low oxidative activities. Although we observed clear genotypic differences in tannin patterns and galloylated flavonol glycoside levels, the biological effect of these differences on green oak leaf roller larvae seem to be rather marginal. Our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] showed that larval mortality was equal on both oak genotypes, but larvae developing on T-oaks needed more leaf biomass to gain similar weights to larvae reared on S-oaks. Therefore, we speculate that the enrichment of gallotannins, such as corilagin, in the foliage of T-oaks may play a role in the defence properties in this resistant oak type. Furthermore, in our previous study, we found that some substances in S-oaks seem to attract female <italic>T. viridana</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In a recent study with a chrysomelid beetle, luteolin-7-glycoside was identified as a key substance in determining the attractiveness of plants to the females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The beetles preferred the plants with high amounts of luteolin-7-glycosides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. This finding fits very well with our observation of high levels of luteolin-7-glycosides in S-oaks.</p></sec><sec><title>Terpenoids</title><p>In a previous study, we showed that <italic>T. viridana</italic> avoided T-oaks, which may have occurred because their blend of volatile organic compounds contained a higher ratio of sesquiterpenes and higher emission rates of &#x003b1;-farnesene and germacrene D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The transcriptomic data (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) support the higher sesquiterpene activities and emission rates measured in T-oaks. We found higher expression levels (constitutive and induced) of a putative sesquiterpene synthase in T-oaks (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), which showed 75% amino acid identity to a germacrene D synthase of <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> (XP_003634696.1).</p><p>We observed a clear increase in the transcript levels of plastidic MEP pathway-related genes and metabolites in S-oaks after pathogen feeding (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Because the biosynthesis of monoterpenes originates in the plastidic MEP pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], the observed transcriptomic and metabolomic data agree well with the more pronounced herbivory-induced emission of monoterpenes from the susceptible oak type observed in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Herbivore feeding elicits the accumulation of traumatic acid (TA), as observed clearly in damaged oak leaves. This dicarboxylic acid is a potent wound-healing agent in plants that is associated with JA biosynthesis. The volatile form of JA, methyl jasmonate, induces the activation of sesquiterpene synthases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Therefore, the different emission patterns of sesquiterpene (which is emitted at higher levels in T-oaks) and the nerolidol (a sesquiterpene) derivative DMNT (which is emitted at higher levels in S-oaks) observed in T- and S-oaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] might be under the control of the phytohormone JA, which was synthesised at different levels in these two lines (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>B). However, further studies are needed to determine whether there is a direct involvement of JA in controlling the different terpenoid profiles of the T- and S-oaks.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Different defence strategies of T- and S-oaks</title><p>The differences in the results of transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling between T- and S-oaks led us to the assumption that the two oak types follow different defence strategies. There are several theories about effective plant defence strategies against pathogens and herbivores. These include the Quantitative Defence Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], the Optimal Defence Theory (ODT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], the Growth-Differentiation Balance (GDB) hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], and the Resource Availability Hypothesis (RAH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Furthermore, there has been much general discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of constitutive and induced defence responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]; and references cited therein). However, the complexity of the defence response in plants often also leads to questioning of the proposed theories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Herms and Mattson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] got to the heart of all these theories with the title of their review &#x0201c;The dilemma of plants: To grow or defend&#x0201d;. This title highlights the recurring theme in all defence theories, which is that defence is costly.</p><p>The most important advantage to possessing constitutive defence, exemplified in T-oaks by the high levels of bioactive tannins, is the fast response during herbivore attack. These plants are defended from the first moment of attack, whereas a 'just-in-time&#x02019; induced defence strategy can take hours to days to protect the plant against such an attack. Furthermore, a constitutive defence can perhaps lead to a reduction in the number of attackers because, when volatile substances act as a direct defence, the insects may not even lay their eggs on the resistant plants. We suppose that this is the case for our T-oaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Our hypothesis that T-oaks follow a constitutive defence strategy is further supported by the higher levels of constitutive expression of sesquiterpenes and cell wall-degrading beta-glucanase genes.</p><p>Plants with induced resistance might have an advantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] if constitutive resistance against herbivores incurs fitness costs, such as reduced reproduction or lower growth rate. This advantage has been shown for the sticky monkey flower (<italic>Diplacus aurantiacus</italic>), where genotypes with higher resin concentrations had a lower growth rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Such allocation costs occur when large quantities of fitness-limiting resources are reserved for resistance traits. <italic>Quercus robur</italic> is one of the tree species that host the highest number of herbivorous insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Thus, most oaks are permanently attacked, but severe defoliation, e.g., by green oak leaf roller larvae, only occurs every five or six years and then only for one or two years in a very strong manner. It is therefore questionable whether the costs of these attacks justify a permanent resistance. The T-oak genotypes seem to follow the strategy of constitutive direct defence against the herbivores with the success to become less defoliated by the green oak leaf roller than S-oaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Interestingly, S-oaks have high constitutive transcript levels of a gene encoding the defence substance osmotin 34, which is known to function in the defence against biotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. We do not know whether the specialist <italic>T. viridana</italic> is already adapted to a high level of osmotin34. However, the capability of forest insects to adapt to defence substances does exist, as demonstrated for the resistance of <italic>Lymantria dispar</italic> to tannins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>A commonly found trade-off between constitutive and induced defences occurs when the investment in constitutive defence is already high. In this case, fewer inducible defence responses exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. This is exactly what we found for the two different oak types (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In light of the present data, we conclude that the T- and S-oak types differ in their metabolic profiles and the levels of key metabolites and that T-oaks rather follow the strategy of constitutive defence, while S-oaks follow the 'just-in-time&#x02019; strategy of induced defence (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>A, B).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The transcriptomic and metabolomic differences identified in this study, together with our previous physiological and behavioural results, deepen our understanding of plant defence responses to specialist herbivore attack. Our data provide valuable information that paves the way for the identification of molecular and biochemical biomarkers. We identified several promising candidate genes in the functional groups 'protein&#x02019;, 'secondary metabolism&#x02019;, 'DNA&#x02019;, and 'cell&#x02019;. These sequences, together with transcripts of other functional groups, will be checked for SNPs and InDels that may explain the differences in defence between the two oak types. Additionally, further tests will be performed for the development of biochemical markers. The knowledge gained from this study provides the basis for developing a method for the early selection of potentially green oak leaf roller-resistant genotypes in natural pedunculate oak populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant and insect material</title><p>During an outbreak of <italic>Tortrix viridana</italic> L.

These trees belonged to three genetically different populations (named 'Asbeck&#x02019;, 'Muenster&#x02019; and 'Warendorf&#x02019;) aged between 150 and 180&#x000a0;years (details on the oak stands were reported previously) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. We selected late and early bud-bursting individuals among both resistant and susceptible oaks. Among all forest stands analysed, the selected individuals of T- and S-oaks from the population 'Asbeck&#x02019; showed the most obvious differences in defoliation rate.

For the annotation we used KEGG combined with Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>] and with expanded lipids from LipidMaps (LMPK; version 06&#x02013;2011: As reference organism we selected <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic> because species of the genus <italic>Quercus</italic> are not included so far) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>]<italic>.</italic> In addition, the structure of uncertain annotated metabolites was confirmed with ChemSpider [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>]. Next, the results were filtered manually with a maximal mass error acceptance of 1.3&#x000a0;ppm, the error caused by spectra alignment. Finally log2 ratios of mass spectra intensities were calculated for T/S, O/Y, D/I in order to visualise in HeatMaps up- or down- regulation of the different metabolites grouped into the main metabolic pathway according to KEGG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping of transcriptomic and metabolomic data to KEGG pathways</title><p>The web-based functional annotator KAAS (KEGG Automated Annotation Server) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>] was used to map the transcript identifiers to KO numbers thus assigning the transcripts to KEGG pathways (single bidirectional best hit-method using the representative set for genes at KAAS; default blast score of 60). All metabolites were included in the pathway mapping, which showed statistically significant discriminant masses between T- vs. S-oaks after feeding (see above). The selected masses were mapped to specific metabolites in KEGG pathway displays using MassTRIX3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>]. Log2 fold ratios of mapped transcripts and metabolites were displayed onto the KEGG pathways in color code.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BINs: MapMan functional categories; CDPK: Calcium-dependent kinases; DMNT: Homoterpene 4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene; FA: Fatty acids; FT-ICR-MS: Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometer; GDB: Growth-Differentiation Balance hypothesis; HIPVs: Herbivory-induced plant volatiles; HPLC: High-performance liquid chromatography; JA: Jasmonic acid; MDA: Multivariate data analysis; MAPK: Mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEP pathway: 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway; ODT: Optimal Defence Theory; PA: Proanthocyanidins; PCA: Principal components analysis; PLSR: Partial least squares regression; RAH: Resource Availability Hypothesis; RNA-seq: RNA sequencing; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; RPKM-value: Reads per kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads; S-oak: Susceptible oak type; TA: Traumatic acid; T-oak: Resistant oak type</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>BK performed the bioinformatic analysis, the combined mapping of transcriptomic and metabolomic data, and drafted the manuscript.
