The interplay between the automated pipeline and the quality control indicated which additional processes were required to improve the transcriptome reconstruction.

While individual tools missed genes and artificially joined overlapping transcripts, combining the results of several tools improved the completeness and quality considerably.

Nevertheless, non-model organisms are of great ecological and economic significance; consequently the understanding of their unique metabolic pathways by investigating their gene expression profiles is crucial. The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) and its continuing improvement, as well as the development of corresponding bioinformatics analysis tools have boosted the number of sequenced transcriptomes in non-model organisms and their automated assemblies have become common over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Numerous software and pipelines have been used to automatically build transcriptomes and several methods that integrate <italic>de novo</italic> assembly together with genome based assembly have been proposed for non-model organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Two major alternatives can be employed: 1) Aligning reads to the existing reference genome and then assembling the remaining unmapped reads or 2) Performing a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly first and then using the genome to improve the transcript assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, many open challenges in defining genes remain, particularly where genomes are not available or are incomplete. In spite of the large numbers of transcriptome assemblies that have been performed, quality control of the transcript building process is rarely performed.</p><p>Manually defined and curated transcripts or good quality ESTs could be used to assess the quality of automated transcriptome assembly, but to the best of our knowledge, they have not been used. In non-model organisms in particular, it is critical to have genes built from the species being studied, as closely related well-annotated species might not be available. In spite of the great potential importance, the processes used to manually define and curate genes have not been documented until now (Ben-Dor S., in preparation).</p><p>In this study, the transcriptome of the bloom-forming alga <italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic> was built. <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> is a cosmopolitan unicellular photoautotroph that plays a prominent role in the marine carbon cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Its intricate calcite coccoliths account for a third of the total marine CaCO<sub>3</sub> production, making it highly susceptible to future ocean acidification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition to their role in the biogeochemistry of carbon and related climatic impacts, coccolithophores produce the sulfur containing compound dimethylsulphoniopropionate, precursor of the dimethylsulfide gas which is a major source of sulfur to the atmosphere where it can influence aerosol formation and consequently cloud condensation nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The recently published genome assembly of <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> is a draft that was constructed from Sanger reads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A large number of available unassembled genomic reads, numerous repeats and duplications, as well as holes in the genome, indicated that the genome alone would not provide a good basis for building transcripts. Therefore we opted for an integrative pipeline to build the transcriptome. To test and improve the quality of the automated transcriptome reconstruction, we used 63 manually defined and curated <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> genes, several of them experimentally validated. After each step in the automated definition pipeline, the presence of the manually defined genes was checked, allowing troubleshooting of missing genes and improving our pipeline. This is the first time that an automated transcript definition is subjected to quality control using manually defined and curated genes and thereafter the process is improved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Description of the experimental system</title><p>The experimental system was <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> cells subjected to viral infection over a time course, with two different viruses, lytic (EhV201) and non-lytic (EhV163). RNAseq was performed for six samples using the Ilumina HiSeq2000 as follows: control (no virus) and infected with EhV201 or EhV163, at two time points: 1 and 24 hours post infection. The in-depth description of the experiment and its biological significance was submitted elsewhere (Rosenwasser S, Mausz MA, Schatz D, Sheyn U, Weinstock E, Tzfadia O, Ben-Dor S, Feldmesser E, Pohnert G, Vardi A: Rewiring host lipid metabolism is central in infection by large viruses regulating the fate of algal blooms in the ocean, Submitted). Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> summarizes the number of reads obtained for each sample after removing adaptors and trimming to 90 bases. The sequences were trimmed because of a decrease in quality scores in late sequencing cycles due to the high GC content (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1). The sample containing EhV201 for 24 hours had the highest number of reads with adaptor sequences (about 15 million) and a relatively low number of reads, since many of the <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> cells were dead due to the viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and therefore there was a higher percentage of low quality or degraded RNA (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Read counts</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="center"><bold>Sample</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Total reads (cleaned*)</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Reads aligned to Emihu1plus**</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Reads mapped to transcripts</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">2BE<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">79,031,642<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">51,787,959 (66%)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">65,282,968 (83%)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">4BE<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">70,232,202<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">44,631,230 (64%)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">57,466,155 (82%)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">6BE<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">71,097,330<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">44,755,528 (63%)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">57,685,982 (81%)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">8BE<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">84,292,692<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">50,341,359 (60%)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">64,839,232 (77%)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">10BE<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">30,393,401<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">3,559,270 (12%)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">6,042,025 (20%)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">12BE</td><td align="center">74,680,032</td><td align="center">44,832,848 (60%)</td><td align="center">58,182,177 (78%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*After removing adaptors and trimming to 90 bp (removed 15million reads in 10BE and up to 5 million in the other samples) **Each sequence was counted once even if several reads have the same sequence, each sequence aligned to the genome ~2-2.5 times in average (for 10BE, 4 times).

There are unassembled reads available, and this together with our experience in hand-curation, where we observed many repeats, duplications, and holes in the genome (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), led us to believe that additional genomic information is essential to achieve a high quality transcript assembly. In addition to the genome, there were publicly available ESTs, which can provide additional information. In light of this, three different approaches were applied to define <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> transcripts (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), two of them utilizing our RNAseq data. The first was <italic>de novo</italic> assembly; the second was a genome-based alignment to an improved version of the genome assembly. The third approach utilized a collection of publicly available <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> ESTs. All approaches were integrated at the end.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Genome assembly quality assessment.</bold> Blast alignments were performed at the JGI web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/pages/blast.jsf?db=Emihu1">http://genome.jgi-psf.org/pages/blast.jsf?db=Emihu1</ext-link>) to examine the Emihu1 assembly <bold>(A)</bold> Hole in the genome. &#x0201c;Gold standard&#x0201d; gene 1 was compared to the genome.

The outcome was 6734 contigs and 94068 singlets.</p></sec><sec><title>Genome based definition of transcripts</title><p>In addition to the Emihu1 current assembly of the genome, the JGI website database includes Sanger sequencing reads that were not included in the current assembly. They are called unplaced genomic reads and consist of 95120247 bases (106669 N's and 95013578 A, C, G or T) in 161432 sequences. The unplaced reads were assembled using Newbler, resulting in 13227 contigs. To evaluate the possible contribution of these contigs to the transcriptome definition, the reads of Sample 10BE which had the lowest number of <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> reads (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), were aligned to these newly assembled contigs. 742435 reads were mapped to the new contigs, as compared to 3.51 million reads previously aligned to Emihu1. In view of the high number of reads aligned to the new contigs, they were assembled to the available genome using Minimus2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] to create an improved genome version, Emihu1plus (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).</p><p>The reads of each sample were aligned separately to the Emihu1plus genome using TopHat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The total number of reads aligned to the genome per sample spanned from 44 to almost 52 million. The exception was Sample 10BE, as mentioned above, which has only 3.56 million aligned reads due to advanced cell lysis (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). After alignment, Cufflinks and Cuffcompare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] were applied to all the TopHat outputs to define transcripts. In this process, 90921 potential transcripts were defined.</p></sec><sec><title>EST collection</title><p>ESTs were downloaded from NCBI, using the taxid 2903, for a total of 129641 ESTs. The ESTs were clustered using TGICL. 113756 of them were assembled into 16882 clusters containing at least two ESTs. Single ESTs that were not clustered (15885) were not utilized for further transcriptome reconstruction.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Manual definition of genes</title><p>In parallel to the automated approach for transcript assembly, we manually defined a set of <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> genes. These genes were used in order to assess the quality of the automated pipeline. The manual definition started from the choice of a target gene (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Protein sequences of the target gene from human, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, and yeast (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), and if necessary additional species, were compared to the <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> genome on the JGI genome website using TBlastN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Hits were inspected to see if there was any transcript evidence (ESTs). If there were matching ESTs, they were assembled into transcripts, and compared to the predictions, if there were any. If there was incomplete EST coverage, but a JGI predicted gene model, the blast results were used to fix the prediction accordingly. When the RNAseq reads became available, if possible, the putative transcripts were corrected on the basis of the reads. If there was more than one genomic hit in the blast results, each successive hit was checked to see if it was a truly independent hit, representing a family member, or a duplication, which was then classified as real or artificial (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). If no ESTs were available to use as an anchor for a predicted transcript, then a combination of reads (if available), prediction based on blast hits and the JGI predictions were used to construct a transcript.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Manual gene definition procedure.</bold> The procedure of manual gene definition is presented as a decision tree, with the start and end in purple. The procedure starts from the choice of the target gene (purple circle, top middle), which was taken from three species, human, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, and yeast.

Transcripts were then constructed and extended as far as possible by running Blast.</p><p>The sequence was then translated, and a BlastP search was run at NCBI to determine if the putative protein was closest to the target gene in other species, and if it had the proper domains. We found that in many proteins repetitive sequences interrupted the canonical domain composition, and in some cases the domains themselves.</p><p>After the protein sequence was finalized, multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees were constructed with protein sequences from representative species to see that the sequence indeed belonged, who its closest relatives were, and in the case of multiple family members, to attempt to assign orthology.</p><p>We compiled a set of 63 &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; genes (Sequences in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>) that were used afterwards for quality control of the automated transcript assembly. Validation of 18 of the sequences was performed by real-time PCR with primers designed to the manually constructed sequences or Western blot (Method of construction and validation status: Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). All of the sequences but two had reads in the RNAseq data of the current dataset, and the remaining two have reads in an additional dataset (not shown).</p><p>The &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; genes all have known functions, come from at least five different biological pathways, and are distributed in various cellular compartments. They include both globular and transmembrane proteins. They are a mix of short and long transcripts ranging from 569 to 4661 base pairs, with varying numbers of exons, ranging from single exon to 17 exon genes, and are expressed in varying levels according to the RNAseq data (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). The &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; genes therefore have a wide representation of the various types of genes extant in <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>First round of quality control using manually defined genes</title><p>To assess the quality of the transcriptome reconstruction, presence of the 63 &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; genes in the three transcript definition approaches was examined (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). The transcripts were compared to the standard genes using Blat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], with a minimum hit score of 200, in order to ensure significant hits. Four of the genes had less than 10 reads in the RNAseq, and therefore could not be found in the read-based arms of the assembly. In the genome based transcript collection, of the 59 possible genes, eleven were missed. In the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, twelve genes were missed. In the EST branch, 44 genes were found out of 48 with ESTs. The four that were missed either had only one EST, or non-overlapping ESTs that were therefore not clustered.

Partek was used to find regions where reads aligned, excluding regions with Cufflinks transcripts (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A).

We did not require an initial Methionine, as many of the transcripts are incomplete. Only 36 (68%) of the standard set were found on the protein level. Missed proteins were inspected on a case-by-case basis, to understand how they were lost and improve the pipeline.</p><p>Three causes were identified: 1) Frameshifts due to either sequence or assembly errors; 2) Correct reading frames were shorter than the longest incorrect frame (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>); 3) Fusion of transcripts on opposite strands due to overlaps in 3&#x02019; UTRs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In order to improve the fusion transcripts, we decided to split them. For each transcript the three longest ORFs were examined, and in cases where translations derived from different ORFs did not overlap and the resulting peptides were at least 100 amino acids length, the transcripts were split.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Problems in the automated transcriptome reconstruction.

When this set of translations was compared to the 53 transcripts of the standard set that were detected, 42 proteins out of the 53 were found (79%) an improvement of 11%.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional improvement of the transcriptome</title><p>At this point, it was clear that TGICL lost transcripts during the clustering process. To overcome the problem of missing genes, the initial transcripts from the four approaches were clustered using CAP3 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Further redundancy was removed by CD-HIT-EST. The number of potential transcripts longer than 300 base pairs was 79939. In order to split artificially fused transcripts, the algorithm developed to split the sequences previously was used. 2393 sequences were split in two, and 66 were split in three. Once again, approximately half of the split sequences (1143) were from opposite strands. Redundancy at the protein level was removed with CD-HIT, and subsequently the redundant transcripts were removed, resulting in 79408 defined transcripts. These transcripts were compared to the standard set, and 61 out of 63 transcripts were found.</p><p>Two different clustering algorithms were applied to the collection of potential transcripts. TGICL strongly removed redundancy, and makes longer transcripts (median 1242 bp) but loses genes. CAP3 does not lose genes, but makes shorter transcripts (median 907 bp) and leaves redundancy in the collection (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). To take advantage of both algorithms, the two collections were compared. Transcripts defined by CAP3 that were identical (19845) or were contained in (14953) TGICL defined transcripts were replaced by their matching counterparts in TGICL (30482). This reduced the number of transcripts by 4316. Additional transcripts defined by CAP3 that did not have a good match to TGICL defined ones (44610) were introduced into the final collection without changes. The final collection included 75092 transcripts.</p><p>The final collection was compared to the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; set both on the DNA and protein level. 61 transcripts and 47 proteins were found, an improvement versus the TGICL alone. The transcripts that were not detected on the protein level were analyzed in depth to discover the possible flaws in our pipeline. There were two major causes, one on the transcript level, and one in the translation process. On the transcript level, we discovered that many of the genes had both spliced forms and intronic read-throughs (intron retention) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S9, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>, Example 1). The retained introns disrupted the coding sequence. The second major cause of missing protein sequences was due to our definition of an open reading frame from stop-to-stop (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>, Example 2).</p><p>We examined whether 63 genes were enough for quality control by increasing the number of hand constructed genes to 100, and running comparisons on the DNA and protein levels at all stages of transcriptome reconstruction. The results show no change in the percentage of genes or proteins found in any of the steps (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The additional 3 transcripts and 9 proteins that were not found at the final stage were due to reasons seen previously, lack of reads or longer irrelevant open reading frames, respectively.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Evaluation of enlarged &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; gene set</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th rowspan="2" align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th colspan="2" align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Transcripts</bold><hr/></th><th colspan="2" align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Peptides</bold><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center"><bold>63</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>100</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>63</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>100</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">De Novo (CLC assembly cell)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">75%<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">72%<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cufflinks<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">76%<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">78%<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Partek genomics suite*<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">33%<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">24%<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">ESTs<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">70%<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">69%<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">TGICL<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">84%<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">81%<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">66%<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">62%<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAP3<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">97%<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">95%<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">75%<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">75%<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Final collection</td><td align="center">97%</td><td align="center">95%</td><td align="center">75%</td><td align="center">75%</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The percentage of sequences found by each step of the transcriptome reconstruction is given.</p><p>*Partek percentages are lower as the program was used to define transcripts in very limited regions.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Characterization of the E. huxleyi transcriptome</title><p>The 75092 transcripts range in length from 301 to 34193 base pairs (bp).

The full collection of <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> ESTs was mapped to the genome using Blat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The mapping results were very noisy, so for automated analysis the donor junctions were filtered for AG acceptors (34089 final junctions). The GC to GT ratio was approximately 3:1, further corroborating our initial finding (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B). In addition, 269 junctions from 32 EST-based transcripts in 25 randomly chosen genomic loci were manually aligned and examined, and the percentage of GC junctions was 64% (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>).</p><p>Splice junctions from automatically generated Cufflinks transcripts were also analyzed, and donor (73358) and acceptor (71535) sites were extracted from Emihu1plus. In order not to count the same junction twice in cases of alternate splicing, non-redundancy was performed on the genomic coordinates. The most prevalent splice donor is GC (61%, Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C) while the canonical sequence GT was only used 37% of the time. The splice acceptor is almost entirely the canonical AG (98.5%). The even less canonical sequences (for example a donor not starting with a G), or at least part of them, represent misalignments of TopHat (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S3). Validation was performed by manual inspection of spliced RNASeq reads mapped to the genome, representing 36 randomly chosen transcripts. A total of 270 junctions were inspected, and GC was found in 65% of the donors, while GT was found in 35% (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S9). In contrast, the JGI &#x02018;Best transcript&#x02019; models have the opposite distribution, with 82% GT and only 15% GC (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>D).</p><p>Intron retention was observed as a major cause of redundancy in the transcript collection and loss of proteins in the translations. Therefore the phenomenon was assessed in an attempt to quantify the level of intronic reads and additional types of alternative splicing. Currently available programs to determine types of splicing could not be used, for two reasons. Firstly, many have a transcript mapping step which relies on GT-AG junctions, which is inappropriate for <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>. Others require a database of defined splice junctions, which is problematic to create due to the pervasive nature of the intronic reads (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S9). A manual inspection was performed on 535 introns taken from 68 loci, and 89% (478) showed reads throughout the length of the intron. The other instances of alternative splicing observed were: 8 exon skipping, 6 alternate acceptors, and 5 alternate donors.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptome annotations</title><p>The final transcripts were annotated using Gene Ontology (GO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] terms by applying Blast2GO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] at the DNA level. 61% (45704) of the transcripts had at least one Blast hit. GO terms were transferred to 84% (38510) of the transcripts with Blast hits, and finally, GO terms were successfully assigned to 40% of the total transcriptome (29868), after setting the Annotation Cut-Off to 45 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S4). The total number of annotations was 143794; the mean number of GO annotations per gene was 5 and the mean level in GO was 5.5 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S5).

Fully automated transcript building, while the only practical method on a large scale, can be improved, particularly for the individual genome. We recommend a manually curated reference set for quality control per genome, which will allow detection of genome specific issues, and allow improvement of existing tools and pipelines. Once done, the new pipeline can then be utilized for all future transcriptomes of the same genome. In our particular case, <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>, the genome has non-canonical splice junctions, overlapping genes, duplications and holes in the genome. These issues were addressed, to the best level possible, utilizing the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; set of genes for quality control. We have since successfully analyzed additional transcriptomes from the same organism, taking these issues into account.</p><sec><title>Assembly strategy</title><p>One of the goals of this study was to achieve a complete picture of the transcriptome: utilizing all the available data, build accurate transcripts without either missing genes, or including spurious sequences. The data at hand was the genome assembly from JGI, ESTs from GenBank, and our RNAseq reads. The genome was incomplete, and the EST coverage was very partial, with only 129,000 sequences for a genome with an estimated 30,000 genes, and many more transcripts. The RNAseq data had good read depth, however, reads were relatively short (90 bp) and transcript coverage was incomplete due to the low complexity and highly repetitive nature of the underlying sequence.</p><p>We used three different approaches to assemble the sequence: two utilized the reads, one genome based and one <italic>de novo</italic>, and an EST only branch. For the read-based arms, the first decision that had to be made was whether to combine the reads from the different biological samples or to analyze them independently. For the genome-based approach, we chose to analyze each lane individually (Cufflinks), and then join them (Cuffcompare), while for the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly (CLC Assembly Cell), without the basis of the genome to build on, we used all the lanes together in order to maximize the chances of building a transcript, particularly those with low expression levels. The next decision was whether or not to include the ESTs in the <italic>de novo</italic> construction, as ESTs allow elongation of putative transcripts due to their length and different sequencing method (Sanger). We decided to cluster and analyze the ESTs on their own first, in order to improve the ESTs&#x02019; reliability, and to combine the various tracks afterwards.</p><p>When the analysis was performed, the programs chosen were considered state-of-the-art. New tools have been developed in the interim, such as Trinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and SOAPdenovo-trans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] among others. Programs developed for genome assembly and later adapted to transcript assembly (SOAPdenovo-trans, Oases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]) seem to be less accurate than purpose-built transcriptome tools (such as Cufflinks and Trinity, personal communication). While some of the newly developed tools may perform better building transcripts, a manually curated gene set is still highly recommended for troubleshooting, particularly for non-model organisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Manually constructed and curated transcripts</title><p>The process of manual construction of genes is highly complex. Complications arise in cases when the target sequence is not related closely enough to the genome of interest to rely on as a basis for comparison, and when there are no cDNA or genomic sequences to compare to. We have both obstacles in <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>, but the first is the greater issue, as there are no close relatives, and each gene has a unique history, some closer to plants, some to mammals, some even to bacteria (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S6).</p><p>Various techniques are used to bridge the gaps, many of which can be implemented manually, but are difficult to automate, particularly integration of information from multiple sources. This is particularly true of the human ability to process data based on visual presentation. Theoretically, any one of these techniques may potentially be programmed, but in practice, it is not trivial, and the combination of methods for the decision-making process is not possible in the computer capabilities currently available.</p></sec><sec><title>Quality control</title><p>One of the major goals of this project was to test the quality at each step of the transcriptome construction. In the very first step, examination of the reads, we found that the reads had to be trimmed due to a noticeable drop in quality towards the end (last 10 cycles, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1) due to the high GC content.</p><p>The manually curated genes gave us the opportunity to detect faults in the process of automated transcript building. When we compared the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; to our initial gene build, many transcripts were missing. The loss of genes was caused by: 1) Genes that were only predicted, with no transcript evidence at all; 2) Genes that had coverage, but by only one EST and had no reads; 3) Genes with no reads and more than one non-overlapping EST; 4) Genes without enough sequence coverage for an automated program to build a long enough transcript; 5) Genes that had read coverage, but Cufflinks and CLC Assembly Cell did not build. We improved our initial build by using the Partek Genomics Suite to define transcripts missed by the earlier methods, and indeed, found all the missing genes that had coverage on the nucleotide level.</p></sec><sec><title>Lost in translation</title><p>After we found all the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; transcripts possible in the dataset, we compared the hand curated and automated datasets on the protein level. Many genes were lost on the protein level, even though they could be detected on the DNA level. The first class of missing proteins was due to artificial joining of transcripts. This phenomenon has been observed in model as well as non-model plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Transcripts were joined in several ways including on opposite strands overlapping in the 3&#x02019; UTR, and on the same strand with some overlapping reads (possibly due to the repetitive nature of the genome). It is interesting to note that we did not observe any overlapping transcripts in the coding regions. We corrected many cases by using a script to split transcripts, based on non-overlapping open reading frames.</p><p>The second class of missed proteins was due to the choice of the longest open reading frame, from stop to stop. In some cases, full ORFs from Methionine to stop were in the correct frame and longer than stop to stop (examples in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>), and in other cases, the functional protein was not the longest frame. We decided to use stop to stop because many of the transcripts were partial, and did not expect to see a methionine in these cases. Another reason was that frame-shifts may cause the methionine to be lost. It may be worthwhile to build a program that will look at both stop to stop and Met to stop and choose the longer of the two. For the cases where the longest frame was not the functional one, an additional check can be performed, for example utilizing BlastX results to choose the proper frame. These issues are compounded in our particular case due to high percentages of intron retention and genomic repeats.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional observations</title><p>An additional observation that resulted from the hand curation is the high percentage of non-canonical splice junctions. In the hand curated transcripts, ESTs, and Cufflinks defined transcripts, there is a clear majority of GC splice donors (~60/40 GC/GT). In contrast, the JGI &#x0201c;Best transcript&#x0201d; collection has the opposite ratio (~20/80 GC/GT). The probable cause of the shift from GT to GC is the high GC content of the <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> genome, 65% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], among the highest of all eukaryotes sequenced to date. This can create a burden on the splicing machinery, as the canonical junctions are 50% AT (GT-AG). The splice donor GC is also seen in many other species, though at very low percentages, but the &#x02018;universal&#x02019; splice machinery knows how to deal with GC, which may be why the splice acceptor remains completely canonical. The &#x0201c;new&#x0201d; canon for <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> GC-AG, is 25% AT, and is much closer to the DNA at hand. The JGI &#x0201c;Best transcript&#x0201d; collection is composed of 68% <italic>ab initio</italic> predicted genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Most of the <italic>ab initio</italic> algorithms are programed to look for canonical GT-AG junctions, and will only use non-canonical if there is nothing else. This leads to the many mispredicted junctions in that dataset.</p><p>The non-canonical splicing may contribute to the high frequency of intron retention. This phenomenon was observed both in the manually curated as well as automatically processed transcripts. From the hundreds of alternate events inspected manually, mainly intron retention was observed. It is not clear if the transcripts with intron retention are functional, as in virtually all cases checked, it led to premature stop codons in the putative protein and disturbed the domain structure of the potential proteins (data not shown). This raises the following questions: 1) Is the nonsense-mediated decay mechanism functional in <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>? 2) To what extent is the splicing machinery conserved? 3) Is the efficiency of splicing affected by the change in the junction sequence? Another possible explanation for the observed intronic read-throughs is the presence of unspliced pre-mRNA in the RNA used for sequencing. We view this as unlikely, as the RNA was polyA selected, though it cannot be ruled out, as this may also be different in <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>. These issues will have to be resolved by further research into the various mechanisms mentioned.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of programs</title><p>Cufflinks missed putative exons and transcripts, where Partek Genomics Suite was able to define them. Partek describes reads mapped to the genome, while Cufflinks attempts to build gene structure. There was no obvious reason for the transcripts to be missed by Cufflinks, as these regions had a minimum of 50 reads and length of 300 bp. It may be that the high rate of intron retention did not allow Cufflinks to predict transcripts in those regions.</p><p>We clustered the transcripts using both TGICL and Cap3. While TGICL utilizes Cap3, due to its initial Blast stage, it gives very different results. While TGICL reduced redundancy very efficiently, it lost many transcripts. On the other hand, Cap3 alone clustered well, but left redundancy in the dataset. In both cases, it is not clear why the programs did not perform optimally. As there is no explanation of how or why sequences are removed by TGICL, we were surprised by this finding. Cap3 left the redundancy in the dataset due to the many alternative isoforms.</p><p>The final dataset has redundancy, mainly due to putative splice variants. Due to the high level of intron retention, many transcripts are predicted both with and without introns. The programs cannot differentiate between real splicing and spurious splicing, though one possible way to discern correct transcripts would be to take intact reading frames into account.</p></sec><sec><title>Parameters to measure quality of the transcriptome</title><p>Using the manually curated transcripts, we found all of the transcripts possible given the constraints of minimum coverage per transcript. On the protein level, we found most of the genes, but have room to improve the pipeline. In independent measures of quality, the length of the transcripts was reasonable (median length of ~1000 bp), and 70% of the transcripts had ORFs over more than 80% of their length. Most reads and ESTs mapped to the final transcripts. Taken together, it indicates a good quality build.</p><p>We compared our set of transcripts to the JGI &#x02018;Best transcript&#x02019; models, which are mostly based on gene prediction. While most of the JGI set was found in our transcript collection, we had many transcripts not covered at all by the JGI set (37%). This raises the question of fairness of comparison: Firstly of a predicted versus a sequence based set, and secondly our full transcriptome with isoforms included to the &#x02018;Best transcript&#x02019; collection. While the JGI models were partially sequence based, and many of the predictions had some evidence of existence in their RNA tag sequencing, the incompleteness of the genome caused issues for proper gene prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The predictions suffered additionally due to the fact that they relied on canonical splice junctions, while in <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>, the majority of junctions are non-canonical. While the &#x02018;Best transcript&#x02019; models generally have one isoform per locus, the full transcript set has additional transcripts of previously covered loci, while we have coverage of many loci not covered by JGI at all.</p><p>While this manuscript was in preparation, a study on the sulfate deficiency response in <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> was published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], where RNAseq was also performed. They found, as we did, that the JGI models were severely lacking, and do not give good coverage of the transcriptome. We cannot compare our results to theirs, as their sequences are not yet available in a public repository.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>As has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] a reference set of transcripts should be generated for quality control. We have shown that the reference set should be genome specific and manually defined, and that it is critical for troubleshooting and accurate quality control. This is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that a manually built set of genes has been used to improve a transcriptome pipeline. The advantages are clear; it gives an organism-specific picture of the pitfalls and problems that accompany any <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome sequencing, particularly for non-model organisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Improved assembly of the Emihu1 genome</title><p>The current assembly of the <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> genome: Emiliania_huxleyi_CCMP1516v1.0 (Emihu1) was downloaded from the JGI (Joint Genome Institute) website.
