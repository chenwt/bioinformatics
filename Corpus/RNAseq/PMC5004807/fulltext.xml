responses. Here, we demonstrate a novel function of NS5 in the nucleus where it interferes with cellular splicing. Using global proteomic analysis of infected cells together with functional studies, we found that NS5 binds spliceosome complexes and modulates endogenous splicing as well as minigene-derived alternative splicing patterns. In particular, we show that NS5 alone, or in the context of viral infection, interacts with core components of the U5 snRNP particle, CD2BP2 and DDX23, alters the inclusion/exclusion ratio of alternative splicing events, and changes mRNA isoform abundance of known antiviral factors. Interestingly, a genome wide transcriptome analysis, using recently developed bioinformatics tools, revealed an increase of intron retention upon dengue virus infection, and viral replication was improved by silencing specific U5 components. Different mechanistic studies indicate that binding of NS5 to the spliceosome reduces the efficiency of pre-mRNA processing, independently of NS5 enzymatic activities. We propose that NS5 binding to U5 snRNP proteins hijacks the splicing machinery resulting in a less restrictive environment for viral replication.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Mapping host-pathogen interactions has proven fundamental for understanding how viruses manipulate host machinery and how cellular processes are regulated during infection. Dengue virus poses a major threat to public health: two-thirds of the world&#x02019;s population is now at risk from infection by this mosquito-borne virus. In this work, using a global proteomic approach in the context of viral infections with tagged dengue viruses, we constructed a comprehensive protein-protein interaction map of the multifunctional NS5 viral protein. NS5 is central for viral RNA replication and for immune evasion. Our studies revealed the interaction of NS5 with core components of the splicing machinery, specifically with proteins of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle, and that viral infection reduces splicing efficiency. Mechanistic studies analyzing endogenous splicing events and in vitro splicing assays indicated that NS5 binds active spliceosomes and reduces the efficiency of pre-mRNA processing. Our results provide a new function of the dengue virus NS5 protein and support a model in which manipulation of specific splicing components favors viral infection.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI095175</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gamarnik</surname><given-names>Andrea V.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HR001111C0094</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gamarnik</surname><given-names>Andrea V.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006668</institution-id><institution>Fondo para la Investigaci&#x000f3;n Cient&#x000ed;fica y Tecnol&#x000f3;gica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICT 2014-2111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gamarnik</surname><given-names>Andrea V.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006668</institution-id><institution>Fondo para la Investigaci&#x000f3;n Cient&#x000ed;fica y Tecnol&#x000f3;gica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICT-2015 1731</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Srebrow</surname><given-names>Anabella</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Institute of Heath, NIAID, R01AI095175 to AVG, Agencia Argentina de Promoci&#x000f3;n Cient&#x000ed;fica y Tecnol&#x000f3;gica PICT 2014-2111 to AVG, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) HR001111C0094 to AVG, RA, and NK, and Agencia Argentina de Promoci&#x000f3;n Cient&#x000ed;fica y Tecnol&#x000f3;gica PICT 2012-0136, PICT 2014-2888 to AS, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina (UBACyT) 20020130100157BA to AS.

It is responsible for about 390 million infections worldwide every year [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In spite of this great burden, vaccines and specific antivirals remain elusive. In fact, a steady increase in the number of infections is being registered in the last years (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/75303/1/9789241504034_eng.pdf?ua=1">http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/75303/1/9789241504034_eng.pdf?ua=1</ext-link>). DENV belongs to the Flavivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family, together with a large number of emerging and re-emerging human pathogens that cause fevers and encephalitis, such as West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and Zika virus [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Like in other RNA viruses, the DENV genome encodes a limited set of proteins, but relies on the host machinery for productive replication. During infection, viral components subvert cellular processes, remodeling intracellular membranes, changing host metabolic routes and blocking innate antiviral responses [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These changes in the cellular environment are the result of an intimate host-virus interaction and co-evolution. Although in the last decade a great deal has been learned about the DENV biology, the intricate network of viral-host interactions that provide the appropriate setting for viral replication is largely unknown.</p><p>Global mapping of protein-protein interactions through systematic overexpression of viral proteins and proteomic studies have recently identified complete cellular pathways harnessed by HIV and HCV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, the generation of recombinant viruses able to replicate expressing tagged viral proteins allowed identification of protein complexes in the context of measles, influenza and HIV infections [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A technical limitation for this kind of proteomic approach is the feasibility to design recombinant viruses that tolerate the addition of tags. Here, we developed a tool for proteomic studies by incorporating purification tags in fully functioning DENV, and generated affinity purification-mass spectrometry data from infected human cells focusing on the viral protein NS5.</p><p>NS5 is the largest viral protein, bearing multiple enzymatic activities and functions during infection. It bears the RNA dependent RNA polymerase and methyl transferase activities, which are fundamental for viral genome amplification [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, NS5 interacts with different host proteins to counteract the IFN-&#x003b1; mediated antiviral response through STAT2 degradation [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although viral RNA replication takes place in the cytoplasm of the infected cell, NS5 distributes between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Intriguingly, for certain DENV serotypes, the majority of NS5 accumulates in the nucleus [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The importance of this NS5 subcellular distribution remains unsolved and could be related to an auxiliary function that has not yet been elucidated. In order to identify new functions of NS5, we conducted an unbiased proteomic study and constructed a map of physical interactions between NS5 and host proteins in the context of a productive DENV infection. These studies revealed the presence of NS5 in complex with core components of the cellular splicing machinery.</p><p>The process of precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing involves the removal of introns and the precise joining of exons, which results in mature eukaryotic mRNAs [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The cellular splicing machinery, the spliceosome, is composed of five uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (U snRNPs) known as U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs and non-snRNP associated proteins. Each snRNP comprises a small RNA molecule (snRNA), a common set of proteins (Sm or SMN) and a number of particle-specific proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The exon and intron definition depends on information present in the pre-mRNA: 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; splice sites (SS), branch sites (BS) as well as intronic or exonic enhancers and silencers that recruit regulatory proteins that modulate assembly and disassembly of spliceosomal complexes. The splicing machinery is dynamic and exceptionally flexible, allowing fine regulation of gene expression and protein function [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Relevant for our studies, modulation of splicing has been shown to be a regulatory mechanism for balancing the host antiviral response [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In this regard, a growing number of pathways that link viral infection, antiviral responses and splicing regulation are being considered as emerging antiviral evasion mechanisms [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Here, we identified a novel function of DENV NS5 in modulating cellular splicing. NS5 alone or in the context of viral infection binds to CD2BP2 and DDX23, core components of U5 snRNP, and incorporates in active spliceosomes. Analysis of endogenous splicing events showed that DENV infection affects splicing efficiency and alters cellular splicing patterns. Mechanistic studies using in vitro splicing assays and reporter minigenes in cultured cells indicate that NS5 interferes with pre-mRNA processing. Importantly, depletion of CD2BP2, DDX23 or EFTUD2 by RNA interference (RNAi) increases the efficiency of DENV infection, providing evidence for how NS5 works in promoting viral replication independently of its canonical enzymatic activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Mapping physical interactions of DENV NS5 with host proteins in infected cells</title><p>The DENV NS5 protein plays multiple functions during viral infection, likely by interacting with different cellular components. In order to investigate physical interactions of NS5 with cellular proteins during infection, we undertook an unbiased proteomic approach. We used an affinity-purification mass spectroscopy (AP-MS) strategy in the context of an infectious virus carrying a tagged NS5 protein. To this end, we developed recombinant DENVs encoding modified NS5 proteins. In contrast to over-expressing the individual protein, this approach facilitates identification of protein-protein interactions in a cellular environment that has been conditioned by the viral infection.</p><p>Using the 3D structure of NS5 [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], four different sites were selected to incorporate a purification tag (2 X Strep) in the DENV2 16681 full length clone. The replication capacities of recombinant viruses were compared with that of the WT by immunofluorescence (IF) assays after RNA transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Only one of these viruses (r4-DV) retained a high replication capacity. A comparative analysis of the WT and r4-DV by IF as a function of the time and growth curves indicated similar replication of the two viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005841.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Therefore, the r4-DV was employed as the tool to establish a protocol for NS5-host protein complex isolation and purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The pull-down was conducted under mild (non-denaturing) conditions, in order to recover proteins that interact either directly or indirectly with NS5.</p><fig id="ppat.1005841.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1005841.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Interaction network of DENV NS5 and human proteins from infected cells.</title><p>(A) Construction of recombinant DENVs.

This experiment was repeated sixteen times using two different cell lines, in the presence and absence of nucleases. Eluates were examined by western blotting, coomassie blue and silver staining and submitted to mass spectrometry analysis. It is worth noting that a reduction in the amount of purified NS5 binders was observed if comparing cell lysates treated or not with nucleases, suggesting the presence of nucleic acid-mediated binders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Based on a total of 48 samples analyzed, we identified 362 cellular proteins as potential NS5 interactors. This list was shortened to 53 candidate proteins after removing any candidates that i) appeared in negative control experiments (untagged virus or uninfected cells), ii) were not reproducible in &#x0003e;50% of the experiments, and iii) were promiscuous protein binders based on databases of over-expression studies [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

The set of 53 proteins exhibited an important enrichment in proteins involved in transcription and RNA metabolism. In particular, about 40% of these proteins were splicing related factors, with many of them known as core spliceosomal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). Among the splicing proteins detected as NS5 interactors, the most represented complex was the U5 snRNP, for which seven of the eight specific core components were present, suggesting a strong interaction with this particular snRNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). It is important to highlight the consistent appearance of two members of this particle CD2BP2 and the helicase DDX23.

The mature tagged viral protein was individually expressed in cultured human cells and extracts were used for non-denaturing pull down assays and western blot analysis. As a control, the same experimental procedure was carried out with a GFP expression vector. NS5 and GFP were expressed and purified with similar efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

To examine whether NS5 binds to assembled complexes, we performed RIP analysis and evaluated the presence of the RNA component (snRNAs) of different snRNPs, since the presence of these molecules is indicative of fully assembled ribonucleoprotein particles. RNA isolated from pull-down experiments obtained from cells expressing NS5 or GFP was used for quantification of different snRNAs by RT-qPCR. Significant enrichment of U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 RNAs from 2 to 9 fold was observed in the complexes purified with NS5 in relation to that with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). We next explored whether NS5 binds to active spliceosomes by measuring the presence of immature transcripts (pre-mRNAs) that are being spliced out in complex with NS5. To this end, we evaluated the association of different pre-mRNAs including housekeeping or highly expressed endogenous genes (HSPCB, Akt, RPS9, HPRT1 and TBP) to either NS5 or GFP-containing complexes. We found a significant enrichment of these pre-mRNAs in complexes with the viral protein NS5 compared to GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). To further confirm this observation, we analyzed the subcellular localization of NS5. Considering that active spliceosomes are mainly associated with chromatin [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], we carried out subcellular fractionation and evaluated the presence of NS5 in the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm and chromatin fractions.

Thus, we speculate that NS5 is, at least in part, responsible for splicing modulation during viral infection. To examine this possibility, splicing was monitored by analyzing mRNA isoforms derived from splicing reporter minigenes co-transfected with expression vectors for different variants of NS5 or control proteins. The reporter minigenes are cloned gene fragments that include the splicing event of interest, in particular, an alternative exon and the flanking intronic regions, downstream of a constitutive promoter. Transcription from this promoter generates minigene-derived pre-mRNA molecules, which are canonically processed to render distinguishable mature products.

Any of these activities could presumably modulate splicing, by altering pre-mRNA or snRNA properties. Thus, we evaluated whether the enzymatic activities of NS5 were involved in splicing modulation. To this end, we designed NS5 constructs with mutations that specifically impair either the MTase (Mut-MTase) or the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (Mut-RdRp) activity.

Interestingly, we observed an enrichment of intron sequences in mature RNAs at both 24 and 36 post DENV infection. Intron retention (IR) is the process by which an intron remains unspliced in a polyadenylated transcript, and although it was considered a rare event, increase IR rates have been recently reported in a large number of human cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In infected cells, IR increased in about 70% of the event that changed at 24 and 36 hours, indicating a reduction of intron excision in hundreds of transcripts, which could be associated to a perturbation of the splicing catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g008">Fig 8B</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].

In addition, transcriptome analysis of infected cells revealed splicing changes with intron removal perturbation in a large number of genes. To evaluate whether U5 snRNP composition is relevant for DENV infection, we conducted siRNA-mediated knockdowns of U5 proteins identified as NS5 binders and assessed the virus ability to infect and replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Specific siRNAs were transfected into A549 cells, 48 hours later the cells were infected with a reporter DENV virus encoding luciferase [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and viral replication was evaluated as a function of time. Negative and positive controls, non-related siRNAs or siRNAs directed to the luciferase gene, respectively, were included. Silencing of STAT2 was used as a control for a negative regulator of viral replication that binds NS5. Interestingly, depletion of CD2BP2 or DDX23 showed a significant increase on viral replication. It is important to mention that the rise of viral replication detected upon silencing any of these U5 components was similar or higher than that obtained by silencing STAT2. In contrast to the effect observed with components of U5, silencing a core component of U2 snRNP (SF3A2) greatly reduced viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g009">Fig 9A</xref>), supporting the idea that viral modulation of cellular splicing must be specific to provide a beneficial environment for viral infection. To confirm this observation the impact of silencing core components of U5 on replication of the WT virus was evaluated. In this case, an increase in viral RNA replication was observed upon silencing CD2BP2, DDX23 or EFTUD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g009">Fig 9B</xref>).</p><fig id="ppat.1005841.g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1005841.g009</object-id><label>Fig 9</label><caption><title>Silencing U5 snRNP components enhances DENV replication.</title><p>(A) Reporter DENV replication in A549 cells transfected with siRNA directed to spliceosomal proteins (CD2BP2, DDX23, SNRNP40, PRPF8, EFTUD2, SNRNP200 or SF3A2).

Proteomic analysis and functional studies revealed that NS5 binds to active spliceosomes in infected cells and modulates splicing. Mechanistic studies indicate that NS5 interacts with components of the U5 snRNP and reduces the efficiency of pre-mRNA splicing. Our findings support a model in which NS5-mediated regulation of specific spliceosomal components renders an advantageous cellular environment for DENV replication, providing a new function for the viral NS5 polymerase in infected cells.</p><p>In this work, we present a comprehensive DENV NS5 protein-protein interaction network using a tagged infectious virus. The study revealed a significant enrichment of splicing related proteins, with particular abundance of U5 snRNP components. About 20% of the proteins identified were previously associated with NS5 or DENV infection. These proteins include STAT2, THRAP3, PRPF8, SNRNP200 and UBR4 that have been recently reported to interact with DENV NS5 [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], ERC1 that was found to be downregulated during DENV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and ILF3 that also interacts with the viral NS3 protein [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Because NS5 was proposed to function as an adaptor for the ubiquitination system in association with UBR4, and the screen also identified UBR5 as NS5 binder, it will be interesting to further evaluate whether this ubiquitin ligase is involved in NS5-mediated proteasome degradation of specific host factors. In addition, our study identified two members of the Y box binding protein family, YBX2 and YBX3, as NS5 binders. In this regard, YBX1 is an alternative splicing regulator that has been previously associated to DENV replication [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>Based on the enrichment of splicing factors as NS5 binders, we evaluated the impact of DENV infection on cellular splicing by analyzing first a panel of endogenous well-characterized alternative splicing events. A substantial change in inclusion/exclusion ratios was observed when comparing infected versus mock infected cells. Differential splicing during DENV infection was also examined at the wide genome level by high throughput RNA sequencing. This analysis revealed changes in splicing and defects in intron removal during viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g008">Fig 8</xref>). It is important to mention that increased intron retention was recently associated to pathological conditions [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], and in some of these cases mutations or alterations of core splicing factors were reported [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. We hypothesize that perturbation of splicing efficiency during DENV infection is, at least partially, explained by NS5 interaction with core splicing factors.</p><p>Our findings are in agreement with a recent study using RNAseq in DENV infected cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this particular report, a transcriptome comparison of cells infected with WT or an attenuated strain of DENV1 revealed important differences in splicing of transcripts involved in innate immune responses and cell cycle control [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The alteration in cellular splicing observed during DENV replication could be the result of a combination of processes that take place within infected cells. On one hand, it can be a consequence of the cellular response to infection, associated with cellular damage or to a cellular antiviral state. On the other hand, splicing alteration could be a viral mechanism to counteract the antiviral response or to favor gene expression of pro-viral factors. In this regard, there is an emerging theme that links viral infection with specific alteration of U5 snRNP components. Several lines of evidence obtained with different RNA viruses support the significance of this emerging link. In the case of picornaviruses, it has been shown recently that the viral polymerase 3D binds to PRPF8, a core components of U5, and blocks mRNA maturation, with the consequent accumulation of the lariat intermediate [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In addition, RIPseq analysis of 3D-PRPF8 complexes identified transcripts associated to cellular growth, proliferation and differentiation [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In the case of hepatitis C virus (HCV), a siRNA screen aimed to detect genes associated to the antiviral response revealed the involvement of three specific splicing factors: EFTUD2, PRPF8, and SNRNP200, which are all components of the U5 snRNP complex [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Further research with HCV showed that EFTUD2 contributes to the antiviral response through RIG-I/MDA5 pre-mRNA maturation and it was found that viral infection down-regulates EFTUD2, resulting in splicing alteration of antiviral factors [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our results using DENV are consistent with these previous observations and contribute to the model that viral infection perturbs cellular splicing. Despite the similarity with that described for HCV, the underlying mechanism exploited by DENV seems to be different since viral infection does not involve a significant reduction of the abundance of U5 components or a reduction in the assembly of snRNP complexes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g005">5</xref>). In addition, the impact on splicing efficiency during DENV infections, observed by increase intron retention in polyadenylated transcripts, also provides an evidence for viral manipulation of the splicing machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p><p>Mechanistic studies suggest that DENV NS5 binding to active spliceosomes modulates splicing efficiency, without involving any known NS5 enzymatic activity neither altering localization/abundance of splicing components during DENV infection (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g005">5</xref>). In addition, our results support that NS5 interaction with the spliceosome is not mediated by RNA binding because treatment with RNases did not impair the NS5-U5 complex interaction. In vitro studies using reconstituted systems with recombinant NS5 showed a clear reduction in the amount of RNA intermediates and pre-mRNA processing in the presence of the native NS5 protein. We propose a model in which binding of NS5 to protein components of the spliceosome reduces the efficiency of the splicing reaction. In the same line, evaluation of splicing efficiency of endogenous pre-mRNAs, such as RIG-I, as well as alternative splicing events derived from a variety of endogenous genes or reporter minigenes, showed that NS5 expression was sufficient to alter both splicing efficiency and alternative splicing. In this context, it is important to highlight that a growing body of experimental evidence points out that alterations in core spliceosomal components by depletion, mutation or pharmacological treatment, alter different cellular pathways. This seems to be dependent on the differential sensitivity or differential requirement for splicing factors for the processing of distinct pre-mRNAs [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>Although NS5 alone is able to lower the efficiency of the splicing reaction in vitro and in cells, in the context of infection, splicing modulation is extremely more complex. In this regard, our findings with transcriptome analysis provide a new angle to study the link between splicing modulation and viral infection. The question is whether there are key changes in the splicing machinery and cellular gene expression that yields a more permissive scenario for viral replication.</p><p>Interestingly, manipulating the levels of core splicing factors resulted in splicing changes with different outcomes for viral infection. For instance, upon silencing certain U5 components we observed: a) increased DENV replication and b) reduced ability to induce the antiviral response by an unrelated virus. In contrast, silencing U2 components caused viral inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005841.g009">Fig 9</xref>). This observation supports a model in which modulating specific splicing components leads to a more or less restrictive environment for viral replication. The finding that several RNA viruses evolved mechanisms to interfere with the U5 snRNP and that different viral proteins bind components of U5, points to a function of this specific splicing particle in facilitating an antiviral state and is consistent with the known essential roles of U5 components during spliceosome catalytic activation. In this context, our study provides novel information strengthening this emerging viral mechanism that manipulates cellular splicing.</p><p>DENV is currently the most significant insect-borne viral pathogen around the world without effective vaccines or antivirals.

To construct the libraries, RNA was first extracted from cells using Trizol, followed by chloroform extraction and DNAse treatment and isopropanol precipitation. RNA quality was determined by 260/280 ratio using a Nanodrop 2000 and by agarose gel analysis of 28S and 18S rRNA bands. The resulting RNA was then PolyA purified using the BioO Scientific PolyA purification beads (catalog number 512979). PolyA purified RNA was then used to create sequencing libraries using the KAPA stranded RNA-seq kit (catalog number KK8400).

Briefly, multiexonic genes were partitioned into features defined as &#x0201c;bins&#x0201d; and then classified into exon, intron and annotated alternative splicing bins. Using this strategy, the transcriptome was partitioned in 468132 bins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005841.s007">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005841.s008">S3</xref> Tables). These datasets were then filtered according to several criteria applied at the gene and bin level. First, defined subgenic regions (i.e. bins) were considered for differential splicing analysis only if the genes with which they are associated were expressed above a minimum threshold level (more than 10 reads per gene and RD &#x0003e; 0.05) in all experimental conditions. Next, bins were considered for differential splicing analysis only if they had more than 5 reads and a RD bin/RD gene ratio &#x0003e; 0.05, in at least one experimental condition. After applying these filters, reads summarized at the bin level were normalized to the read counts of their corresponding gene. Differential bins usage was estimated using the edgeR package version 3.14.0 [<xref rid="ppat.1005841.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], and resulting <italic>P</italic>-values were adjusted using a false discovery rate (FDR) criterion.

Bins with FDR lower than 0.1 and absolute delta PSI/PIR between 5 and 95% were considered differential used bins.
