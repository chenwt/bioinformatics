critical process in endothelial cell (EC) biology and pathology, which has been extensively studied at protein level. Numerous gene expression studies of EC apoptosis have also been performed, however few attempts have been made to use gene expression data to identify the molecular relationships and master regulators that underlie EC apoptosis.

Gene regulatory networks (GRN) represent a systems biology approach, taking advantage of the growing number of RNA abundance data sets generated by modern high throughput methods such as microarrays or RNAseq, to holistically model interactions between molecules in cells and tissues. GRN are usually displayed as directed graphs - <italic>nodes</italic> represent mRNA abundance and <italic>edges</italic> represent some form of regulatory relationship between the nodes. The reverse engineering of GRN from gene expression data has been used to understand molecular interactions in both bacterial and lower eukaryotic organisms, as well as in more complex mammalian systems. GRN employ simple correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] or Boolean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] methods, algorithms based on mutual information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] as well as Bayesian methods. Computational frameworks have been generated to simultaneously perform several types of GRN analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Bayesian GRN are in theory especially powerful for inference of <italic>causal</italic> relationships between mRNAs in noisy microarray data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In Bayesian GRN, the probability of the abundance of each mRNA node is modelled using a function that takes as its inputs the abundance of the node's parent mRNAs. The edges in a Bayesian GRN can represent hidden protein, non-coding RNA or metabolite-based regulatory relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Therefore, Bayesian GRN can in theory capture information about a subset of the complex cellular regulatory circuitry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Many GRN developed to date have had a &#x02018;scale free&#x02019; structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], in which a small number of &#x0201c;hub&#x0201d; RNAs can be identified that are connected to large numbers of downstream RNAs in the networks. These hub RNAs are candidate master-regulators of transcription and other cellular processes. Their identification is based on relationships in the data between the hub RNA and their downstream RNAs in the GRN structure, which are usually referred to as "children". Therefore, the amount of data behind the identification of hub RNAs is much greater than the amount of data behind the identification of individual edges, and correct identification of hubs may be easier in theory than the correct identification of individual edges.</p><p>Apoptosis is pivotal for normal EC function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and the dysregulation of endothelial apoptosis is a key step in the development of numerous pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], including cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and tumourogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Understanding the regulatory events occurring during this process in a holistic manner may provide insight into normal vascular development and maintenance, as well as vascular pathologies. Although there has been extensive characterisation of the EC proteins involved in apoptotic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], there have been fewer investigations into regulation of the transcriptome in ECs undergoing apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>To begin to address this issue, our group have previously used Bayesian GRN to identify molecular interactions involved in survival factor deprivation (SFD)-induced EC apoptosis and cell cycle arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This previous study used micorarray data over a triplicated eight time point SFD time course. Previous studies have illustrated the value of supplementing time series data with gene disruption data (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]). Since at the time we were especially interested in regulation of the cell cycle, in this previous work the time series data was supplemented by eight microarrays from EC cultures treated with siRNAs targeting molecules associated with the cell cycle. This analysis identified several GRN master regulator RNAs including the <italic>&#x003b3;-amino butyric acid (GABA)-Receptor Associated Protein</italic> (<italic>GABARAP</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In theory, the greater the volume of high-quality siRNA data used to supplement time course data, and the broader the range of RNAs targeted by the siRNAs, the more likely it is that accurate predictions can be made by GRN. Therefore, in this current study we have expanded our previous analysis by combining triplicated eight time point SFD time course data with a much larger library of EC siRNA disruptant microarray data, which was generated from the knockdown of 351 different mRNA transcripts that encode proteins with a broad range of functions in EC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This expanded analysis identified numerous GRN master regulators, many of which were already known to play important roles in EC biology. However, we noted one major master regulator RNA named <italic>Vasohibin-1</italic> (<italic>VASH1</italic>) that had not at the time been extensively studied in EC apoptosis. Therefore, we investigated the function of <italic>VASH1</italic> in regulating mRNA abundance and in the process of EC apoptosis. We targeted <italic>VASH1</italic> using siRNA and then used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to examine the abundance of 10 of the 31 mRNAs directly downstream of <italic>VASH1</italic> in the GRN. 7 of these 10 mRNAs were significantly up- or down-regulated in the direction predicted by the GRN when <italic>VASH1</italic> expression was reduced. We also show that <italic>VASH1</italic> is required for the apoptotic response in EC treated with SFD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and siRNA transfection</title><p>Umbilical cords were collected with written informed maternal consent and the approval of the Cambridge (UK) Research Ethics Committee.

The log base2 (log2)&#x02013;transformed apoptosis time course data and 351 siRNA disruptant data were then both normalised using the Loess method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. For the disruptant dataset log2 ratios against a virtual median array were calculated and these ratios were then z-transformed within each microarray prior to network inference.</p><p>For the SFD time course data, we selected transcripts concordantly regulated in abundance across the timecourse to used for GRN generation as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Briefly, log ratios between each time point and the first time point were calculated for all transcripts. For each transcript at each time point z-scores were then calculated by subtracting the log2 ratios from the mean of log2 ratios for that time point, and dividing by the standard deviation of log2 ratios for that time point. Transcripts were then selected that had &#x02212;2 &#x02264; z &#x02264;+2 at &#x02265; <italic>two</italic> adjacent time points in the triplicate data set. This analysis was repeated using the last time point instead of the first time point, and the union of the RNA lists prodced by the analyses that used the first and last timepoints was taken as the final list of concordantly expresed RNAs. For comparison to this z-score method, ANOVA was used to identify RNAs significantly differntially expressed at <italic>two</italic> adjacent time points relative to either the first or last time point, and the empirical Bayes method of Tai and Speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] was also applied. In addition, a statistically more complex method was used to identify RNAs significantly differntially expressed across the timecourse; generalised estimating equations with a Markov correlation model were fitted to the timecourse data. Contrasts were used to identify linear relationships and quadratic trends within the data using Matlab's GEEQBOX toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/</ext-link>).

Given the relative sizes of the time-course and siRNA data sets, a dynamic GRN generated from the time-course data was used as a prior for GRN generated from the siRNA data as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>When estimating the time-course GRN from the apoptosis time course microaray data, a method of bootstrapping was applied to the data. With 8 time points (obtained 0, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24hrs after serum withdrawal) and 3 replicate microarray time course experiments, there are 3<sup>8</sup> = 6561 possible combinations to create combinatorial apoptosis time course datasets. With such a large number of combinations, it is not computationally viable to fit regression curves through all combinations. Therefore the time course data used for network estimation was generated from the random resampling of 25 of the possible 6561 combinations as follows: Let <italic>D</italic> be the combinatorial time course data of all genes. If <italic>D</italic>(<italic>c</italic>) is the 8 time points, with each time point consisting of one of 3 replicates, then <italic>D</italic>(<italic>c</italic>) can be randomly resampled with replacement 25 times from the 6561 combinations so that <italic>D</italic>(<italic>c</italic>) (1 &#x02264; <italic>c</italic> &#x02264; 6561). The bootstrap sample can therefore be defined as <italic>D</italic><sup>*</sup> = {<italic>D</italic><sup>*</sup> (1),&#x02026;., <italic>D</italic><sup>*</sup> (25)}. Using this sample of 8 x 25 = 200 randomly resampled microarrays, the apoptosis GRN was estimated. This bootstrapping procedure was repeated 100 times to generate 100 different GRNs; <italic>&#x0011c;</italic><sup>*</sup><sub><italic>&#x02009;&#x02009;T</italic></sub><sup>&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x02009;1</sup>,&#x02026; . <italic>&#x0011c;</italic><sup>*</sup><sub><italic>&#x02009;&#x02009;T</italic></sub><sup>&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x02009;100</sup>, where <italic>&#x0011c;</italic><sup>*</sup><sub><italic>&#x02009;&#x02009;T</italic></sub><sup><italic>&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x02009;B</italic></sup> is the estimated graph based on the <italic>B</italic>-th bootstrap sample.

In theory, the more data that GRN are based on, the the more accurate their predictions can be. Therefore, for GRN generation we used a combination of the SFD timecourse data and a library of 351 siRNA disruptant microarrays. A total of 694 RNAs were used for GRN generation; the union of the 486 RNAs concordantly regulated in abundance during SFD and the 351 RNAs that were targeted by siRNA. The methodology used to generate this Bayesian network has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and is illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.

These two datasets were used in network inference. Bayesian GRNs were generated to maximise the posterior probability, which consists of two priors; (a) the dynamic Bayesian GRN prior (generated from the time course data) and (b) the array prior (measuring the relationships between the gene knockdowns and their regulatees, as measured by z-score in the 351 disruptant dataset), as well as the marginal likelihood. This is the non-parametric regression through estimated edges based on the 351-disruptant dataset. The gene list of 694 transcripts chosen for network inference was selected based on (1) the transcripts regulated during the apoptosis time course and (2) the 351 siRNA targeted transcripts. Using the dynamic Bayesian GRN as a prior for the disruptant dataset, the relationships for the 694 transcripts within the 351 disruptant dataset were inferred. Bootstrapping of the network prior and the estimated static network helped improve edge reliability in the final network.

In a directional GRN such as the Bayesian networks generated here, they can be identified on the basis of having large numbers of downstream children. The distribution of the number of children of all nodes in the GRN is shown in the histogram in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Figure S1. A list of the 50 hub genes with the largest number of children (all with &#x02265;20 children) in the network is shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>. Given that the set of RNAs used for GRN inference was already enriched for cell cycle and stress response functions as described above, it is not surprising that many of the GRN hubs appeared to be involved in these processes. Only 53 of the 351 genes that were targetted by siRNA knock-down to generate the prior microarray data were significantly concordantly regulated in abundance over the survival factor deprivation timecourse (according to the same z-score criteria that were used to select the 486 RNAs). Of these 53 RNAs, 10 are in the list of the to 50 hubs (ranked by the number of downstream children).</p><p>We looked specifically at apoptosis-associated RNAs in the GRN. Analaysis using the Fatigo software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fatigo.org/">http://www.fatigo.org/</ext-link>) identified 505 probes in the Codelink array data that encoded proteins involved in apoptosis, 58 of these probes were included as nodes in the apoptosis gene network (highlighted in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>); two of these (<italic>HSPE1</italic> and <italic>BUB1B,</italic> with 28 and 23 children respectively) were found in the top 50 hubs ranked by number of downstream network children.</p><p>We also looked specifically at cell cycle-associated RNAs in the GRN, since SFD induces cell cycle arrest in addition to programmed cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

The results of this analysis are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> and examples are given below. The hub transcript <italic>BLM</italic> (7<sup>th</sup> largest hub, 33 children) encodes a DNA helicase that is important for mitotic DNA replication and DNA repair, and is mutated in a broad range of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. 16 of the 31 children of <italic>BLM</italic> encoded proteins involved in aspects of cell cycle regulation (GO:0008283, GATHER Bayes Factor = 22.3, p = 3x10<sup>-9</sup>). Another hub gene encodes the cyclin dependent kinase-binding protein <italic>CKS1B</italic>, which has 16 of its 49 GRN children associated with cell cycle control (GO:0007049, GATHER Bayes Factor = 7.5 p = 0.007). The hub <italic>KNTC2</italic> encodes a kinetochore complex component that functions as a spindle checkpoint signalling molecule, and has 10 of its 18 children associated with the cell cycle (GO:0007049, GATHER Bayes Factor = 16 p = 7.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-7</sup>).

The children emenating from the apoptosis-associated hubs <italic>HSPE1</italic> and <italic>BUB1B</italic> mentioned above also shared comon functions, however the degree of enrichment for these functions was not statistically significant.

We applied GRN analysis to combined time course microarray data following serum deprivation-induced apoptosis of EC, and a large microarray data set generated from 351 targeted EC siRNA disruptions, in order to identifiy new information about gene regulatory relationships during EC apoptosis.</p><sec><title>GRN topology and limitations</title><p>We have used GRN analysis to identify hubs, which potentially act as master regulators of the expression of downstream RNAs in EC. For one hub, <italic>VASH1</italic>, we then confirmed the concordant regulation of a subset of downstream children as hypothesised by the GRN, and an impact on apoptosis. VASH1 protein has previously been identified as a negative feedback regulator of angiogenesis, and is induced through signalling via VEGFR2 and protein kinase C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. These findings are consistent with a role for VASH1 as a key regulator of EC biology, and with the position of <italic>VASH1</italic> as a hub in the GRN with an effect on EC apoptosis.</p><p>We suggest that GRN analysis may provide a useful compliment to traditional analysis of microarray or RNAseq data, especially for identifying putative master-regulators for further study. We showed that alternative methods to identify apoptosis-associated RNAs from time course expression data were unlikely to have selected <italic>VASH1</italic> as a candidate gene for subsequent functual analaysis. Methods based on: z-scores, ANOVA and empirical Bayes all failed to prioritise <italic>VASH1</italic>. However, we also recognise the potential limitations of gene network analysis. Firstly, only a few of the transcripts that encode protein mediators of apoptosis are expected to be up- or down-regulated during relatively short time points of SFD-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] to a sufficint degree to be included in this analysis, and SFD is only one of many inducers of apoptosis. Therefore, only a subset of known apoptosis-associated genes are accessible to this type of GRN study. Secondly, many genes known to be important in the apoptotic process may not be &#x0201c;master regulators&#x0201d; detectable as hubs in gene networks, which requires that they rapidly regulate the abundance of large numbers of downstream RNAs. Since we used timecourse microarray data from EC cells treated with survival factor deprivation, we expected to identify only master regulators that were specifically related to the molecular processes that occur during this timecourse. To be identified as a "hub" in the gene network, both an RNA, and its downstream "child" RNAs, must be significantly concordantly regulated over the timecourse. Therefore, not all RNAs important for EC biology will be concordantly regulated during this specialised type of apoptosis, and even if they are, they will not be identified as hubs unless they rapidly regulate the abundance of large numbers downstream RNA transcripts. Thirdly, like all <italic>in silico</italic> modelling based on microarray or RNAseq data, results of special interest from GRN analysis need to be confimred using laboratory experiments as we have done here.</p></sec><sec><title>Inference of local relationships within the network</title><p>Several GRN methods have proven informative for identifying regulatory hubs or cohorts of co-expressed genes in complex eukaryotic cells, which are involved in important disease processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. However, most of these methods fall short of inferring directional relationships at a local level. Therefore, having identified the <italic>VASH1</italic> hub based on network topology, we examined the GRN predictions surrounding this hub in more detail. Using siRNA we knocked down <italic>VASH1</italic> mRNA and determined the effect on expression levels of downstream mRNAs for ten out of <italic>VASH1</italic>'s 31 GRN children. Seven out of the ten children tested were significantly up- or down-regulated in the direction predicted by the GRN (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The lack of clear influence of <italic>VASH1</italic> knock-down on three child-transcripts may be due to several factors: (i) Reducing <italic>VASH1</italic> RNA may have little effect on the abundance of those gene network children of <italic>VASH1</italic> that are strongly influenced by other parents in addition to <italic>VASH1</italic> - the undiminished effects of these other parents would be expected to hide the effect of reducing <italic>VASH1</italic> expression. (ii) Regulatory relationships that are not represented in the GRN may influence the expression of some of <italic>VASH1</italic>'s gene network children, (iii) Despite best efforts, the effects of experimental noise and unintended model over-fitting are likely to have introduced error in the inference process. These issues are further described in our recent publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. It is possible that additional siRNA data may improve the accuracy of GRNs around <italic>VASH1</italic>, which is a subject for future research.</p><p>Whether the observed level of concordance between the network predictions and the results of experimental <italic>VASH1</italic> knockdown only surrounds the major hubs within the Bayesian network structure, or is randomly distributed throughout the network, requires further investigation. Due to resource constraints we have only evaluated a minority of edges downstream of a single hub. This is clearly not enough to draw any general conclusions about GRNs and their reliability. Given further resources, we would like to evaluate the relationships between <italic>VASH1</italic> and the remaining 21 children that we have not yet tested, as well as the relationships between several other nodes and their children. To more completely test local network relationships we would ultimately need to simultaneously perform siRNA-mediated "knockdown" of all the gene network parents of each <italic>VASH1</italic> child then measure the effect on <italic>VASH1</italic> child abundance. In addition, as computational capabilities improve, it would be interesting to re-engineer GRNs with the inclusion of more of the replicate arrays and compare the reliability with that of the current network model. Nevertheless, given the early stage of this technology, the fact that only one (<italic>VASH1</italic>) of several parents of the evaluated <italic>VASH1</italic> children was knocked down, and the fact that there are data missing from the network (due to computational constraints it contains only 694 transcripts), these current findings appear promising.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional significance of the VASH1 gene network hub</title><p>To investigate whether the <italic>VASH1</italic> hub was biologically relevant during endothelial apoptosis, we used siRNAs targeted against <italic>VASH1</italic> to reduce mRNA abundance to &#x0003c;20% of its initial level and quantified the level of apoptosis in these cells under conditions of SFD relative to control cells transfected with an irrelevant siRNA. The measurement of active caspase-3 and &#x02212;7 and the ADP:ATP ratio were used as end-points and the knock-down of <italic>VASH1</italic> conferred resistance to the pro-apoptotic stimulus of serum deprivation. This confirms a role for <italic>VASH1</italic> in the process of EC apoptosis, and is consistent with a study published since this research was conducted that shows over expression of VASH1 induced apoptosis in proliferating human fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>Although the mechanism by which VASH1 regulates EC survival is beyond the scope of this study, it is intriguing to examine the function of <italic>VASH1</italic>&#x02019;s GRN children in the anticipation that this may suggest how VASH1 acts. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) suggested that the <italic>VASH1</italic> GRN children are significantly enriched for genes associated with angiogenesis (FDR = 0.025), including several well-known angiogenic regulators; <italic>BDNF</italic>, <italic>DLL4</italic> (<italic>delta-like 4</italic>), <italic>FLT4</italic> (<italic>vegfr-3</italic>), <italic>PPARA</italic>, <italic>PTX3</italic>, <italic>SOX18</italic>, <italic>TIE1</italic>, and <italic>TNFSF12</italic> (<italic>tweak</italic>). Several of the <italic>VASH1</italic> children have previously been associated with the linked control of proliferation and apoptosis e.g. <italic>CDKN1C</italic> (p57/kip2), <italic>CDC2L6</italic>, <italic>GSN</italic> (<italic>gelsolin</italic>) and <italic>DLL4</italic>. It is interesting that 20 of the 31 <italic>VASH1</italic> children have binding sites for members of the E2F transcription factor family in their promoters (V$E2F1_Q3, FDR = 0.002); experiments to assess whether E2F transactivation is regulated by VASH1 may be worthwhile.</p><p>One mechanistic hypothesis was investigated in this study. The autocrine action of BDNF in cellular processes including angiogenesis, proliferation, differentiation and survival is well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Therefore, the inverse relationship between <italic>VASH1</italic> and its validated child <italic>BDNF</italic>, suggests a hypothesis that upregulation of <italic>BDNF</italic> when <italic>VASH1</italic> is knocked down may promote survival. However, recombinant <italic>BDNF</italic> was unable to rescue the cells from SFD induced death. It is possible that the chosen concentration of recombinant BDNF (100nM) and time point of administration were not optimal. However, the results suggest that it is unlikely that the mechanism of <italic>VASH1</italic> action in EC apoptosis is as simple as up-regulation of <italic>BDNF.</italic> The relatively low expression of the BDNF high affinity (TrkB) and the low affinity (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) receptors observed in the microarray data from these cells (<italic>TrkB</italic>, percentile rank expression = 0.142113 and <italic>p75</italic><sup><italic>NTR</italic></sup>, percentile rank expression = 0.414449 in healthy HUVEC) may also explain why exogenous BDNF was not effective.</p><p>Since this study was conducted, several publications have described the role of <italic>VASH1</italic> in regulating EC proliferation, vascular tube generation and vascular maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], as well as a potentially wider functional role in other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. In addition, VASH1 may interact in complex functional networks with related proteins such as VASH2 to regulate angiogensis and EC survival differently in distinct angiogenic mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Whatever its mechanism of action, VASH1 appears to be associated with angiogenesis in pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], and further investigation of the molecular networks that surround <italic>VASH1</italic> seem highly worthwhile.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>GRN analysis is able to supplement the reductionist methods of traditional molecular biology, providing testable hypotheses about the synergistic actions and interactions of multiple molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. We therefore applied Bayesian GRN methods to further our understanding of the regulation of EC apoptosis and proliferation. The SFD Bayesian GRN generated in this study identified <italic>VASH1</italic> as a candidate master regulator, which we found was functionally important during EC apoptosis. We also found that several individual directed edges emanating from <italic>VASH1</italic> in the GRN appeared to operate in ECs. We hope that in future studies the datasets we describe here can be used by other researchers to identify additional candidate master regulators for laboratory evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Ther are no strong competing interests.
