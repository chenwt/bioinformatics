In contrast to the wild type strain, the transformant displays a greater resistance to environmental stress and a higher virulence toward target insect host. However, the underlying mechanisms for these characteristics remain unclear; hence experiments were initiated to explore the possible mechanism(s) through physiological and molecular approaches. Although both transformant and wild type strains could infect and share the same insect host range, the former germinated faster and produced more appressoria than the latter, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. The transformant showed a significantly shorter median lethal time (LT<sub>50</sub>) when infecting the diamondback moth (<italic>Plutella xylostella</italic>) and the striped flea beetle (<italic>Phyllotreta striolata</italic>), than the wild type. Additionally, the transformant was more tolerant to reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced 40-fold more orthosporin and notably overexpressed the transcripts of the pathogenicity-relevant hydrolytic enzymes (chitinase, protease, and phospholipase) genes i<italic>n vivo</italic>. In contrast, appressorium turgor pressure and destruxin A content were slightly decreased compared to the wild type. The transformant's high anti-stress tolerance, its high virulence against five important insect pests (cowpea aphid <italic>Aphis craccivora</italic>, diamondback moth <italic>Pl. xylostella</italic>, striped flea beetle <italic>Ph. striolata</italic>, and silverleaf whitefly <italic>Bemisia argentifolii</italic>) and its capacity to colonize the root system are key properties for its potential bio-control field application.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

Thus, in a previous study aiming at enhancing the applicability of <italic>Metarhizium</italic> spp., we introduced genes of the melanin biosynthesis pathway from <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> into the wild-type <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> strain BCRC35505. The transformant strain <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> MA05-169, which is capable of expressing exogenous dihydroxynaphthalene melanin (DHN-melanin), exhibited a greater tolerance to UV-irradiation, high temperatures, and desiccation and a higher virulence toward <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic><xref rid="pone.0090473-Tseng1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Because melanin is well known for its role in protecting organisms against environmental stresses <xref rid="pone.0090473-Andre1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090473-Kavanagh1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, the increased stress tolerance observed in <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> 05-169 is expected. The enhanced virulence of the melanized transformant MA05-169 on <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, in contrast, brought up some interesting questions - Is melanin associated with the enhanced virulence? If so, at which stage(s) of pathogenesis is melanin playing a role? Finally, what are the physiological, biochemical and/or molecular mechanisms involved in the superior performance of this melanin-producing strain?</p><p>Several studies have revealed the pathogenesis of entomopathogenic fungi and the interactions between entomopathogenic fungi and their insect hosts during the process of infection. Infection with an entomopathogenic fungus is initiated when the conidium adheres to the insect cuticle by means of hydrophobicity and static electricity <xref rid="pone.0090473-Boucias1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Hydrophobins, a class of structural proteins of the fungal spore surface, are known to be involved in the nonspecific attachment of the conidium to the hydrophobic surface of the insect cuticle <xref rid="pone.0090473-Hoch1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Some enzymes are also involved in conidia adhesion to the insect cuticle. The activities of ecto-phosphatase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) also affect the adhesive capability of spores <xref rid="pone.0090473-Hoch1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090473-CosentinoGomes1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. MAD1, an adhesin-like protein generated after spore germination, mediates stronger and more specific cohesion between <italic>Metarhizium</italic> spp. and their insect hosts <xref rid="pone.0090473-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In entomopathogenic fungi, the germination speed and adhesive capability of spores have been found to be positively correlated with virulence <xref rid="pone.0090473-Altre1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090473-Ment1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Using the conidia of <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> from different nutrient sources, Shah et al. (2005) observed a positive correlation between the germination speeds and the virulence of <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> and <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0090473-Shah1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Altre and Vandenberg (2001) also found that for <italic>Paecilomyces fumosoroseus</italic>, the level of virulence was correlated with the conidial germination speed on the external surface of <italic>Lepidopteran</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0090473-Altre2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Following adhesion, the conidium germinates and forms an appressorium for penetration, although infection can also be achieved by direct penetration of the extended hyphal tip. The appressorium produces adhesive substances, enabling it to adhere firmly to the host body <xref rid="pone.0090473-Campos1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090473-Inyang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The appressorium secretes hydrolytic and lipolytic enzymes, such as proteases, chitinases, lipases, and esterases, to decompose the epidermal structure of the host <xref rid="pone.0090473-Leger1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. With the aid of the enormous turgor pressure generated inside the appressorium due to water entering the cell by osmosis, the emerging infection peg uses mechanical force to penetrate the weakened insect cuticle.</p><p>Entry into the host is just the beginning of the infection process. After penetration, the invasive hyphae of the entomopathogenic fungus first encounter the immune system of the insect. In general, pathogenic fungi that invade animal bodies are subject to attacks by large numbers of immune cells, such as monocytes and macrophages in humans and hemocytes in invertebrates. Only the pathogenic fungi that successfully escape or resist immune attacks have the opportunity to colonize the host body and cause diseases <xref rid="pone.0090473-Kavanagh1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090473-Czarna1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Nodulation, phagocytosis, and encapsulation are immune responses that are commonly observed in animal systems. For instance, in the human body, the foreign microbe detected by the immune cell may be engulfed via pinocytosis and then put into the phagocytic vacuole. In the phagocytic vacuole, the activated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen oxidase (NADPH oxidase) catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen into peroxide and superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>). The O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> subsequently reacts with nitric oxide (NO) to produce peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) <xref rid="pone.0090473-Kavanagh1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) also enters the phagocytic vacuole, using the Cl in the vacuole to generate HOCl. Among the diverse defensive responses in an animal cell, the rapid generation of <sup> &#x002d9;</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by NADPH oxidase is crucial for establishing early resistance against the pathogen. The virulence of a pathogenic fungus is thus considered to be associated with its ability to directly or indirectly affect the production of O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the host cell <xref rid="pone.0090473-Nappi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>The innate immune system of insects resembles that of mammals <xref rid="pone.0090473-Bergin1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Among the various types of hemocytes in the insect haemocoel, plasmatocytes and granulocytes have features similar to macrophages in vertebrates. Upon contact with non-self antigens such as bacteria or fungi, hemocytes engulf foreign objects and trigger oxidative metabolism, which transforms oxygen into antimicrobial reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). For example, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the generation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> was observed during the melanotic encapsulation of the parasitic <italic>Leptopilina boulardi</italic>. In superoxide dismutase (SOD)- and catalase (CAT)-deficient <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, the immunodeficiency disorders were partially attributed to a defect in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> metabolism <xref rid="pone.0090473-Nappi2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, nitric oxide proved to be a key component of the hemocyte-mediated immune system <xref rid="pone.0090473-Hillyer1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Melanin is known to contribute to the stress tolerance and virulence of many fungi - examples include the human pathogenic fungus <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0090473-Thines1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and the plant pathogenic fungi <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp., <italic>Alternaria</italic> sp., and <italic>Magnaporthe</italic> sp. <xref rid="pone.0090473-Eisenman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In plant pathogenic fungi, the main contribution of melanin to virulence is the formation of a melanin layer on the appressorium between the inner cell wall and the plasma membrane, which permits only water and small molecules to enter. Triacylglycerol and glycogen accumulated in the appressorium enable extracellular water to enter the appressorium, forming an enormous turgor pressure that serves as the necessary mechanical force for invasion <xref rid="pone.0090473-Thines1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090473-Howard1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. To survive and multiply in the animal body, a successful pathogenic microbe must develop ways to minimize the free radical damage caused by the animal immune system. It has been reported that in some species of pathogenic animal fungi, melanin acts as a free radical scavenger <xref rid="pone.0090473-Ranowska1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. For instance, melanin production in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., <italic>Sporothrix schenckii</italic>, and <italic>Fonsecaea pedrosoi</italic> has been associated with increased tolerance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and to the damage caused by nitrogen or oxygen free radicals <xref rid="pone.0090473-Cunha1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090473-Nosanchuk1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In addition to the free radical&#x02013;eliminating property, melanin also protects fungal pathogens against antimicrobial peptides <xref rid="pone.0090473-Doering1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, allowing the pathogens to overcome the host immune responses.</p><p>As a follow-up to our previous work on the development of a melanin-producing <italic>M. anisopliae</italic>, this study aims to uncover the potential cause(s) of the enhanced virulence of the melanized transformant, <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> MA05-169, on the insect host <italic>P. xylostella</italic>. Because virulence is a complex trait that is determined by numerous factors, we used a series of histological and molecular approaches to examine different aspects of the interactions between entomopathogenic fungi and their insect hosts. To analyze the effect of melanin on the degree of virulence we examined the melanized <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> transformant MA05-169 and the wild-type BCRC35505 under <italic>in vitro</italic> and/or <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. We compared conidial germination, appressorium formation, and appressorial turgor pressure generation and their ability to resist free radical damage. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, changes in gene expression and secondary metabolites production in <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> MA05-169 and BCRC35505 were further investigated by real-time RT-PCR, liquid chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Inoculum preparation</title><p>The mycelial disc of either the melanized transformant MA05-169 or the wild-type BCRC35505 of <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> was inoculated onto a potato dextrose agar (PDA) plate and incubated in darkness at 28&#x000b0;C for 21 days.

The collapse of the appressoria became evident after the cricket wings were immersed in a higher concentration of PEG-8000 solution for 10 min, which was linearly proportional to the concentration of PEG-8000. The appressorium collapse rate reached approximately 65% when the cricket wing was immersed in PEG-8000 at a concentration of 1.2 g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.

As a result, the tricyclazole-treated <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> MA05-169 was less virulent than the untreated <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> MA05-169.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Correlation of enhanced germination and appressorium formation abilities with the increased virulence of the <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> transformant MA05-169</title><p>For many entomopathogenic fungi, pathogenic development is initiated from conidial germination and appressorium formation, followed by the secretion of adhesive substances that affix the appressorium to a host insect's body surface <xref rid="pone.0090473-Arruda1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. This enables the invasive hyphae to penetrate the insect cuticle. Microscopic investigations were performed in this study to examine the <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> transformant MA05-169 and the wild type at the pre-penetration stage. When placed on either the mylar membrane or on <italic>Pl. xylostella</italic>, both strains developed inflated and irregular-shaped or elliptical appressoria at the ends of their germ tubes. The morphological phenotypes of the appressoria and the adhesive substances visible below the base of the appressoria were consistent with those observed by Arruda et al. (2005) during the interaction between <italic>Metarhizium anisopliae</italic> and <italic>Boophilus microplus</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0090473-Arruda1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. This indicates that transgenesis does not impair the appressorium function of <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> MA05-169.</p><p>Our previous study has shown that when cultured on PDA medium, the germination and hyphal growth abilities of the <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> transformant MA05-169 were superior to those of the wild type <xref rid="pone.0090473-Tseng1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In this study, we further revealed that compared with the wild type, <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> MA05-169 showed much greater efficiencies of conidial germination and appressorium formation both <italic>in vitro</italic> (on the mylar membrane) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (on <italic>Phyllotreta striolata</italic> and <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic>, but not on <italic>Aphis craccivora</italic> or <italic>Bactrocera dorsalis</italic>). Because germination and appressorium formation are essential for the infection of many entomopathogenic fungi, it is reasonable to infer that the higher virulence of <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> MA05-169 could be at least partially explained by its enhanced germination and appressorium formation abilities, although the underlying cause of such an enhancement is unclear. Currently, we do know that melanin disperses in the cytoplasm, as visualized under confocal scanning light microscopy (data not shown). However, the exact ultrastructural distribution of melanin in the spore or appressorium of the transformants remains unknown. A study comparing the infection model of both the transformant and wild type on <italic>Pl. xylostella</italic> is underway, and this study should resolve the puzzle. In other aspects, the hydrophobic attraction force and water absorption capacity of the melanized transformant should be enhanced, which in turn should facilitate and consolidate the adhesion of the hydrophobic conidia to hydrophobic insect host cuticle, thereby enhancing the water uptake from the surrounding atmosphere. The physical or chemical cues on the insect cuticle will further stimulate the germination and formation of the appressorium and the secretion of mucilages and hydrolytic enzymes (chitinase, phospholipase and protease, etc.) <xref rid="pone.0090473-Boucias2" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090473-White1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. In combination, these factors might help to account for the enhanced virulence of the transformant compared with the wild type. It is also possible that the global metabolism and physiological functions of <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> MA05-169 have been affected due to the introduced exogenous genes and/or the alterations in the expression of some endogenous genes located across from or near the T-DNA insertion sites. However, the NGS and BLAST analyses of the available sequences encompassed in the eight fosmid clones did not allow us to further identify genes likely involved in fungal germination/appressorium formation.</p><p>Another interesting observation is that there are differential levels of virulence of <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> (wild type or transformed) in various insect hosts. It is also worth noting that the transformant MA05-169 exhibited elevated levels of virulence in some but not all of the insect hosts being tested in this study. Differences in virulence-associated phenotypes such as germination rate and appressorium formation suggest the presence of some determining factors in the insect hosts' body walls. The insect cuticle is a dynamic structure, and thus, the lipid acids and wax precursors secreted by epidermal cells can be transported to the surface through the pore canal system <xref rid="pone.0090473-Gorb1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. The components of the insect cuticle can induce spore germination and allow certain fungi to enter <xref rid="pone.0090473-Boucias3" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. The cuticle also contains substances/compounds that are selectively inhibitory to particular fungi. For instance, caprylic acid, valeric acid, and nonanoic acid on the larval surface of corn earworms and fall armyworms possessed mycostatic activity toward <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0090473-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Barnes &#x00026; Moore (1997) have reported that short-chain fatty acids (such as caprylic acid) inhibit the germination of <italic>Metarhizium flavoviride</italic> spores <xref rid="pone.0090473-Barnes1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, whereas long-chain fatty acids promote their germination. James et al. (2003) also indicated that cuticular lipids extracted from silverleaf whitefly nymphs (<italic>Be. argentifolii</italic>) affect the conidial germination of <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic> and <italic>Paecilomyces fumosoroseus</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0090473-James1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Poor germination behavior of <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> was observed on the surface of live but not dead flea beetle cuticles, indicating that the body wall of a live flea beetle may contain a substance or substances that can inhibit <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> germination <xref rid="pone.0090473-Butt1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. In entomopathogenic fungi, appressorium differentiation can also be affected by the cuticular structures of different insects. For both the transformant MA05-169 and the wild type, the <italic>in vivo</italic> germination rates were found to be high (&#x0003e;80%) on <italic>A. craccivora</italic>; however, less than 5% of the germinated spores formed appressoria. Similar findings were observed during the infection of <italic>Myzus persicae</italic> and <italic>Lipaphis erysimi</italic> by <italic>M. anisopliae</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0090473-Butt1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. It is likely that the appressorium is not a required infection structure for <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> to penetrate the soft-bodied <italic>Ap. craccivora</italic>. Instead, the infection of <italic>Ap. craccivora</italic> mainly occurs through the direct penetration of infectious hyphae.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Secondary metabolites produced by transformant and wild type <italic>M. anisopliae</italic></title><p>To understand whether and how the expression of exogenous <italic>PKS</italic>, <italic>SCD</italic>, and <italic>THR</italic> genes in <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> MA05-169 changes its overall metabolism, <italic>in vitro</italic> metabolic profiles were investigated using HPLC, LC/MS, and NMR analyses. Two differentially produced compounds were identified in the study &#x02013; the transformant MA05-169 accumulated 3.2 times less destruxin A and 43.7 times more orthosporin than the wild type. Orthosporin is a polyketides <xref rid="pone.0090473-Wang4" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, a large class of secondary metabolites that are biosynthesized through the involvement of diverse <italic>PKS</italic> genes. Although the <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions do not fully reflect <italic>in vivo</italic> mechanisms, changes in melanin and orthosporin levels indicated that the exogenous genes (<italic>PKS</italic> in particular) may have altered the complex polyketide biosynthesis network in <italic>M. anisopliae</italic>. This hypothesis was further supported by the whole-transcriptome RNAseq analyses of the transformant and the wild type grown in liquid SDB cultures (data not shown). Through the transcriptome analysis, six endogenous <italic>PKS</italic>-like genes were found to be over- or under-expressed by more than twofold in <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> MA05-169.</p><p>For the commercially available mycotoxins we chose to test, a significant difference between the transformant and the wild type was only observed in destruxin A production. Destruxin A is a cyclic hexadepsipeptide that is produced by several taxonomically distinct fungi, in which destruxin A has a wide range of biological activities against their respective hosts <xref rid="pone.0090473-Moon1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. In the <italic>Metarhizium</italic> spp. biosynthetic pathway of destruxins, the nonribosomal peptide synthetase DtxS2 is responsible for the conversion of destruxin B into destruxin C, destruxin D, and then destruxin A <xref rid="pone.0090473-Wang5" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>.

Our HPLC and NMR analysis detected a dramatic increase in orthosporin production in the <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> transformant MA05-169, indicating the activation of an unknown biosynthetic pathway to produce a novel metabolite. A similar phenomenon has been observed in <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic>, where the overexpression of a transcriptional regulator was found to trigger a naturally silent polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster, leading to the production of orthosporin <xref rid="pone.0090473-Nakazawa1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. To date, the biofunctional properties of orthosporin have not been characterized in any organisms. Orthosporin is inferred to be a potential virulence factor, based on the known bioactivities of other isocoumarins. Studies have shown that isocoumarin and its derivatives possess antibacterial, antifungal, and insecticidal activities <xref rid="pone.0090473-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The inhibitory effects of isocoumarin on cancer cells, human leukocyte elastase, and blood coagulation have been confirmed in clinical trials <xref rid="pone.0090473-Kerrigan1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Isocoumarin is also highly effective in inhibiting calpains and serine proteases <xref rid="pone.0090473-Pochet1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. In invertebrates that rely on the innate rather than the acquired immune systems, serine proteases are known to be involved in pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-mediated defense responses. When a PRR senses a pathogen-associated molecular pattern such as bacterial polysaccharide and fungal beta-1,3-glucan, it activates serine protease activity, which subsequently initiates a series of immune responses against the pathogen <xref rid="pone.0090473-Amparyup1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. Serine proteases can regulate various defense reactions in invertebrates, including hemolymph coagulation, antimicrobial peptide synthesis, and melanization. For example, in <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, a serine protease is required for the rapid activation of defense responses against <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0090473-Gorman1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. If orthosporin in the <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> transformant MA05-169 does play a similar role as the isocoumarins in other pathogenic fungi, it may work as an antifungal compound and/or a serine protease inhibitor that attenuates the induced innate immune responses of insects.</p><p>In conclusion, the dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin metabolically engineered entomopathogen <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> 05-169 was capable of infecting several important pest insects, including the diamondback moth (<italic>Plutella xylostella</italic>), striped flea beetle (<italic>Phyllotreta striolata</italic>), whitefly (<italic>Bemisia argentifolii</italic>), cowpea aphid (<italic>Aphis craccivora</italic>) and oriental fruit fly (<italic>Bactrocera dorsalis</italic>) across Orders Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera and Diptera Orders. Moreover, the transformant showed a significantly shorter median lethal time (LT50) in <italic>Pl. xylostella</italic> and <italic>Ph. Striolata.</italic>, which was correlated with an elevated conidia germination and appressorium formation rate <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090473-t003">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090473-t004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090473-t006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090473-t007">7</xref>). The enhanced virulence toward the insect hosts may be directly correlated with the production of huge amounts of secondary metabolites melanin <xref rid="pone.0090473-Tseng1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and orthosporin which could indirectly be responsible for the notably enhanced conidia germination and appressoria formation rate, and overexpressed transcripts of key hydrolytic enzymes (chitinase, protease and phospholipase), involved in the infection and colonization of insect hosts. Rationally, the synthesized melanin in the transformant will considerably enhance its hydrophobic attraction force and water absorption capacity, which not only consolidate the adhesion of the hydrophobic conidia to hydrophobic insect host cuticle, but also enhance conidia germination and desiccation tolerance. In addition, melanin plays multiple roles in nature. Importantly it can efficiently scavenge the free radicals, such as the reactive oxygen species (ROS) as those generated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and sodium nitroprusside. Thus, the melanized transformants will be more capable of counteracting the oxidative burst exerted by host immune system <italic>in vivo</italic>, thereby enhancing its virulence toward insect hosts. Although the underlying mechanisms responsible for the drastically increasing in the germination and appressorium formation rate , the formation of orthosporin and the overexpression of hydrolytic enzymes encoding transformant genes remain unknown, these superior characteristics combined with an increased environmental stress tolerance and strong root colonization ability will allow the transformant to infect and colonize the insect hosts more effectively <xref rid="pone.0090473-Tseng1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090473-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090473-Kerrigan1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090473-Boucias2" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090473-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090473-Fang2" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090473-StLeger3" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>, giving it a biocontrol potential for future field applications.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr. Tsui-Hsu Chan, Development Center for Biotechnology, Taiwan for assisting in the purification and structure determination of orthosporin; and Ms. Sue-Ting Chuang, Kaohsiung Experimental Station, Council of Agriculture, Taiwan for raising the insect hosts for the host range and susceptibility tests toward the entomopathogen.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0090473-Braga1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Braga</surname><given-names>GU</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Flint</surname><given-names>SD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>DW</given-names></name> (<year>2001</year>) <article-title>Both Solar UVA and UVB Radiation Impair Conidial Culturability and Delay Germination in the Entomopathogenic Fungus <italic>Metarhizium anisopliae</italic></article-title>. <source>Photochem Photobiol</source><volume>74</volume>: <fpage>734</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>739</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11723803</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0090473-Fang1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Fang</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fernandes</surname><given-names>&#x000c9;K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>DW</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bidochka</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>St Leger</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name> (<year>2010</year>) <article-title>A laccase exclusively expressed by <italic>Metarhizium anisopliae</italic> during isotropic growth is involved in pigmentation, tolerance to abiotic stresses and virulence</article-title>. <source>Fungal Genet Biol</source><volume>47</volume>: <fpage>602</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>607</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20382249</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0090473-Rangel1"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Rangel</surname><given-names>DE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Butler</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Torabinejad</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Braga</surname><given-names>GU</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal> (<year>2006</year>) <article-title>Mutants and isolates of <italic>Metarhizium anisopliae</italic> are diverse in their relationships between conidial pigmentation and stress tolerance</article-title>. <source>J Invertebr Pathol</source><volume>93</volume>: <fpage>170</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>182</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16934287</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0090473-StLeger1"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">St Leger RJ, Screen S (2001) Prospects for strain improvement of fungal pathogens of insects and weeds.
