We describe the first genome sequence of globe artichoke. The assembly, comprising of 13,588 scaffolds covering 725 of the 1,084&#x02009;Mb genome, was generated using ~133-fold Illumina sequencing data and encodes 26,889 predicted genes. Re-sequencing (30&#x000d7;) of globe artichoke and cultivated cardoon (<italic>C. cardunculus</italic> var. <italic>altilis</italic>) parental genotypes and low-coverage (0.5 to 1&#x000d7;) genotyping-by-sequencing of 163 F<sub>1</sub> individuals resulted in 73% of the assembled genome being anchored in 2,178 genetic bins ordered along 17 chromosomal pseudomolecules. This was achieved using a novel pipeline, SOILoCo (Scaffold Ordering by Imputation with Low Coverage), to detect heterozygous regions and assign parental haplotypes with low sequencing read depth and of unknown phase. SOILoCo provides a powerful tool for <italic>de novo</italic> genome analysis of outcrossing species. Our data will enable genome-scale analyses of evolutionary processes among crops, weeds, and wild species within and beyond the Compositae, and will facilitate the identification of economically important genes from related species.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Globe artichoke (<italic>Cynara cardunculus</italic> var. <italic>scolymus</italic> L.) is an out-crossing perennial vegetable crop that is native to the Mediterranean Basin and grown worldwide. Its production has risen from about 1.5 Mt in 1993 to 1.8 Mt in 2013 (FAOSTAT, 2013) with a gross production value of about US$600 million. Italy, which harbours the richest primary gene pool of cultivated globe artichoke, is the top producing country, but globe artichoke cultivation has spread to other Mediterranean countries and in recent years to the Americas and China. In addition to globe artichoke, the <italic>C. cardunculus</italic> complex includes the cultivated cardoon (var. <italic>altilis</italic> DC) and the wild cardoon [var. <italic>sylvestris</italic> (Lamk) Fiori]. The cultivated forms have evolved independently from the wild cardoon in the Mediterranean Basin with selection for different plant characteristics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The two cultivated and the wild forms are fully cross-compatible. The primary product of globe artichoke is the immature inflorescence (compound head or <italic>capitulum</italic>), whose inner bracts and fleshy receptacle are consumed as a fresh, preserved or frozen delicacy; as are other members of the <italic>C. cardunculus</italic> complex, it is also a source of bio-active compounds, such as antioxidant phenolics, sesquiterpene lactones, and inulin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> and can be exploited for the production of lignocellulosic biomass and seed oil for both edible and biofuel purposes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p><italic>C. cardunculus</italic> is a diploid species (2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2&#x000d7;&#x02009;=&#x02009;34) with a medium-sized genome estimated by flow cytometry to be 1.07&#x02009;Gb<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The few genomics data currently available for this crop include a restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) genome analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and RNAseq data, which provided a reference transcriptome of 38 K unigenes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. In addition, several <italic>C. cardunculus</italic> genetic maps have been developed based on a two-way pseudo-testcross approach and QTL analyses for key breeding traits have been conducted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The sequence of the chloroplast genome has recently been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p><italic>C. cardunculus</italic> is a member of the Compositae (a.k.a. Asteraceae), which is the largest and one of the most ecologically successful botanical families<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The family most likely originated in South America (30 to 100 Mya)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Rapid diversification of the Compositae in the mid-Eocene (40 Mya) is associated with a polyploidization event near the base of the family<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and it has been conjectured that the base chromosome number for the family is nine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Of the Compositae crop genomes, the 2.7&#x02009;Gb lettuce genome (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lgr.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu">http://lgr.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu</ext-link>; GenomeProject ID: PRJNA68025) and the 3.5&#x02009;Gb sunflower genome (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sunflowergenome.org">http://www.sunflowergenome.org</ext-link>; GenomeProject ID: PRJNA64989) have been released; however, neither genome has been formally published. The only published sequence of a Compositae species is that of the 335&#x02009;Mb genome of horseweed (<italic>Conyza canadensis</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. However, the sequence scaffolds of horseweed have not been placed into linkage groups or integrated into pseudomolecules, so its genome cannot be used for syntenic analyses. Beyond the Compositae, the genomes of several Asterid species (potato<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>; tomato<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, pepper<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and eggplant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) have been recently sequenced; thus, the availability of the globe artichoke genome adds to our understanding of ancestral genome duplications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and contributes insights into the evolution of the Compositae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p>Understanding of the genome structure of globe artichoke provides the foundation for the molecular deciphering of complex traits, the establishment of gene orthology and the study of synteny across the family to strengthen community research. Short-read sequencing technologies offer a cost-effective opportunity for non-model species to gain access to the genomic era. However, chromosome-scale assembly of genomes remains an endeavor that is constrained by costs and limited analytical toolkits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. We generated the reference genome for globe artichoke using a clone with low residual heterozygosity. To assign scaffolds to genetic bins ordered along chromosomal linkage groups, we implemented a novel pipeline named SOILoCo - Scaffold Ordering by Imputation with Low Coverage. This utilizes low coverage (&#x0003c;1&#x000d7;) whole genome shotgun genotyping-by-sequencing of an F<sub>1</sub> progeny to reliably identify heterozygous loci as well as segregation data for the haplotypes derived from the heterozygous parental lines. Such haplotypes do not need to be present in the reference sequence. The globe artichoke sequence provided information on the overall genome organization and gene content, along with structural and functional annotation. We also inferred the timings of speciation, whole genome duplication and expansion of mobile elements.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genome sequencing and assembly</title><p>The Illumina Hiseq2000 platform was used for whole-genome shotgun sequencing of the globe artichoke clone designated &#x02018;2C&#x02019;. This clone had been obtained by three cycles of selfing (S<sub>3</sub>) and had a residual heterozygosity of approximately 10%, as assessed by analysis of 115 SSR markers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. DNA was extracted from young leaves and one paired-end and two mate-pair libraries generated, consistent with requirements of the ALLPATHS-LG assembly software<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The 100&#x02009;+&#x02009;100&#x02009;bp reads of the paired-end library that had an average insert size 170&#x02009;bp produced 67&#x02009;Gb of raw data (equivalent to an estimated genome coverage of 62&#x000d7;), with a 96% efficiency in generating 3&#x02019;-overlaps with an average overlap of 26&#x02009;bp. The sequencing of the two mate-pair libraries, with average effective insert sizes of 2.5&#x02009;Kb and 5.5&#x02009;Kb, produced 56&#x02009;Gb and 7&#x02009;Gb of raw data respectively (corresponding to 52&#x000d7; and 6.5&#x000d7; genome coverages). After trimming of sequencing adapters and removal of low-quality bases, a total of 133.7&#x02009;Gb were available for assembly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The analysis of K-mer spectra confirmed the limited residual heterozygosity of the 2C breeding line; this was markedly lower than the levels detected in the parental genotypes (globe artichoke and cultivated cardoon) of our mapping population (see below; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Based on K-mer statistics and sequencing depth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, the globe artichoke genome size was estimated to be 1,084&#x02009;Mb, in close agreement with the previous estimation by flow cytofluorimetry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The error-correction routine implemented in ALLPATHS-LG resulted in 87.5% of the filtered paired-end reads being used in the assembly. The 50% of the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly (<italic>N</italic><sub>50</sub>) was included in 10,596 contigs of 17.5&#x02009;Kb or larger, with 32% G&#x02009;+&#x02009;C content (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). The contigs were assembled into 13,588 scaffolds (&#x02265;1,000&#x02009;bp), with a <italic>N</italic><sub>50</sub> of 1,408 and a <italic>L</italic><sub>50</sub> equal to 125.9&#x02009;Kb. The final assembly spanned approximately 724.7&#x02009;Mb. The longest scaffold was 1.5&#x02009;Mb and the median gap size within a scaffold was 660&#x02009;bp. Scaffolds were finally filtered to remove chloroplast sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>).</p><p>The assembly was compared to the available UniGene set<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> to assess the coverage of the <italic>C. cardunculus</italic> gene space; 37,018 of the 38,726 unigenes (95.6%) aligned to the assembled genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods and Results</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1a</xref>). Unaligned ESTs were analysed by BLASTx as in<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> against Viridiplantae proteins (Refseq); 675 (69%) of these had hits. These unigenes (1.7% of all available unigenes) can contribute to a hypothetical total of 27,564 gene models, which would reflects a predicted proportion of non-assembled genes up to 2.5%. The genomic draft assembly was also surveyed for the presence of 248 complete conserved eukaryotic genes (CEGs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) of which more than 85% were mapped (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1b</xref>). The inclusion of partial matches increased the percentage of mapped CEGs to 96%. While the yield of complete CEGs increased from less conserved (Group 1&#x02013;80.3%) to highly conserved genes (Group 4&#x02013;93.85%), the coverage obtained with partial alignments was similar among the groups (95.45% to 98.46%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>). This suggests that most of the missing complete alignments were due to sequence divergence and thus, it can be concluded that at least 95% of the gene space was captured in our genome assembly.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>A pipeline for anchoring scaffolds using low-coverage data</title><p>Linkage analysis of an F<sub>1</sub> population of 163 individuals, obtained by crossing globe artichoke C3 as the female parent and cultivated cardoon Alt41 as the male parent, was performed to identify the genetic position of sequence scaffolds and to generate chromosomal pseudomolecules. To achieve this, we developed and implemented a novel method for genotyping-by-sequencing individuals of an F<sub>1</sub> progeny from low-pass sequencing data combined with conventional deep sequencing of the heterozygous parents, whose linkage phase was unknown. The method relies on the <italic>de novo</italic> identification of parental allelic phases (haplotype blocks), with no reliance on haplotypes being shared with the reference sequence assembly. The pipeline, whose workflow is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, was named SOILoCo (Scaffold Ordering by Imputation with Low Coverage). It requires: (i) a draft assembly of a reference genome; (ii) whole-genome sequencing of each parent to a coverage of at least 20&#x000d7; (being permissive of haplotype reconstruction with HAPCUT; genomes with lower SNP frequencies may require larger fragments to obtain phase calls); and (iii) whole-genome sequencing of their segregating progenies to a coverage as low as 0.5&#x000d7; each. Illumina reads of parental lines were first mapped to the reference sequence assembly in order to identify the positions of robust heterozygous SNPs. The haplotype blocks of each parental genome sequence were subsequently built using the HAPCUT algorithm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. SNP polymorphisms were then called with low-confidence for each progeny individual based on low sequence coverage. A set of custom Perl scripts was then applied in order to: (i) catalogue SNP sites expected to segregate in a test-cross fashion; (ii) split the two segregating haplotypes for each parent (i.e. segregating SNP sites from either one or the other homologous chromosomes, phase-0 and phase-1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>); (iii) recover SNP calls for each individual in any given haplotype block/segregating phase; (iv) invoke an Hidden Markov Model (HMM) engine to infer a haplotype block-wide genotype call (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary information</xref>); and finally, (v) summarize data and generate a dataset of genotypes for each individual.</p><p>Illumina sequencing of the two parental genotypes yielded a total of 520&#x02009;M (52.0&#x02009;Gb) and 467&#x02009;M (46.8&#x02009;Gb) raw reads, corresponding to a coverage of about 48&#x000d7; and 43&#x000d7; for C3 and Alt41, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). After read trimming and mapping to the reference genome, 5,828,006 and 3,092,899 heterozygous SNP sites were called in the two parental genotypes. In the C3 genotype of globe artichoke, <italic>de novo</italic> haplotype blocks assembly allowed us to compute a total of 192,938 blocks, corresponding to 364&#x02009;Mb (L<sub>50</sub>: 4,772&#x02009;bp, N<sub>50</sub>: 19,921) and an average density of 1 SNP per 59&#x02009;bp. In cultivated cardoon parent Alt41, 122,570 haplotype blocks were successfully identified, corresponding to 187&#x02009;Mb (L<sub>50</sub>: 4104&#x02009;bp, N<sub>50</sub>: 12,001) and an average density of 1 SNP per 59&#x02009;bp. The identical SNP frequency of the parental haplotype blocks indicates that SNP-dense regions contributed most in extending haplotype blocks, while similar contiguities is consistent with our observation that the lower frequency of heterozygous SNP sites in Alt41 is due to long homozygous segments in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) rather than due to a genome-wide reduced level of polymorphism. After the extraction of candidate SNP sites segregating in a test cross fashion (TC-SNPs), 2,128,486 were retained in globe artichoke C3, which were scattered across 138,608 haplotype blocks; while in cultivated cardoon Alt41 1,356,998 were retained, which covered 78,458 haplotype blocks. By invoking the HMM engine and combining the complementary segregation information from either phase-0 or phase-1 polymorphic sites, we retrieved genotype calls for phased haplotype blocks with a minimum calling rate of 70%. Since this F<sub>1</sub> mapping population had previously been used for linkage mapping in which no extensive segregation distortion had been observed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, we filtered out blocks with &#x003a7;<sup>2</sup> test p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.03. The pseudo-testcross segregation analysis for C3 generated genotype calls for 23,381 blocks, representing 4,234 unique scaffolds, while analysis of Alt41 provided 15,262 genotyped blocks for 2,779 scaffolds; 1,677 mapped scaffolds were shared between the C3 and Alt41 datasets. Using the two-way pseudo-testcross approach<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, an independent linkage analysis was carried out for each parent, defining 1,157 and 1,497 genetic bins for the globe artichoke C3 and the cultivated cardoon Alt41 maps, respectively. This anchored 445&#x02009;Mb of the assembly as 23,366 markers in C3 and 358&#x02009;Mb as 15,227 markers in Alt41. Correction of putative missed calls by a Perl implementation of the SMOOTH algorithm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> and subsequent markers re-ordering was iterated twice and resulted in final maps spanning 1,460 cM in C3 and 1,748 cM in Alt41, with an average inter-marker distance of 1.28 cM and 1.18 cM, respectively. Maps were highly co-linear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and the generation of a consensus map provided mutual disambiguation of positions within genetic bins. The final dataset comprised of 2,178 distinct genetic anchors ordered along 17 chromosomal pseudo-molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>) that contained 5,322 scaffolds spanning 526&#x02009;Mb. Of these, 936 scaffolds (210&#x02009;Mb) were oriented by correlating the genetic position of each marker within a given scaffold along with their physical coordinates. Chromosomal pseudomolecules were numbered so as to be consistent with previously published linkage groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>).</p><p>In order to assess the robustness of our method for genetically anchoring <italic>de novo</italic> assembled scaffolds without the availability of a validated reference genome, we exploited the availability of the two maps generated for each parent. To do this, we made pairwise comparisons of scaffold doublets separated by 5 cM or less. Doublets were considered concordant when the two scaffolds maintained the same reciprocal position across the two maps. This analysis demonstrated that 23,558 pairs of scaffolds (87%) were collinear, while only 3,480 had discordant positions.

The analysis of a nearly homozygous genotype can facilitate the assembly of a single representative sequence with de Brujin graph-based algorithms. High density genetic analysis is an efficient strategy to validate assemblies and assign contigs and scaffolds to genetic bins ordered along chromosomal linkage groups. Next generation sequencing offers several methods to collect massive amounts of genotyping data in a cost-effective manner. Some rely on complexity reduction with restriction enzymes (GBS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, RADseq<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, ddRAD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, MSG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>) that are robust tools for NGS-based genotyping. However, the choice of restriction enzymes and the rate of polymorphisms between the parental genotypes can define the numbers and distribution of informative loci that cover only a subset of sequences. Several approaches have been described that utilize low coverage whole genome sequencing of segregating individuals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. However, they require some <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of at least one parental haplotype along with the expectation of homozygous parental lines. Moreover, assignment of genotypes from shallow sequencing data (&#x0003c;1&#x000d7;) is only robust when two known alternative haplotypes are expected to segregate as homozygotes, thus restricting their application to RILs. Other populations, such as F<sub>2</sub> and BC progeny, require much higher sequencing coverage to permit confident calls of heterozygous genotypes. Situations in which both parents are highly heterozygous and their F<sub>1</sub> progeny is segregating in a two-way pseudo-testcross pattern, render previously described methods unsuitable for low coverage whole genome sequencing data.</p><p>In order to provide the draft sequence of chromosomal pseudomolecules of the highly heterozygous, outbreeding <italic>C. cardunculus</italic>, we developed the novel SOILoCo methodology, which employs low coverage genotyping-by-sequencing of an F<sub>1</sub> progeny based on haplotype phase information computed at parental level. The method does not require <italic>a priori</italic> reconstructed parental haplotypes and can be applied regardless of which, if any, haplotype is present in reference genome sequence. Our pipeline proved successful in positioning and orienting scaffolds of the <italic>de novo</italic> reference assembly of globe artichoke. The accuracy of our approach was validated by aligning the two independently generated parental maps. Although the pipeline was developed to analyse F<sub>1</sub> progeny data, it also could be utilized for mapping with other progenies, such as F<sub>2</sub>, RILs, and BC populations.</p><p>The first reference genome for <italic>C. cardunculus</italic> provided the possibility to analyse both its coding gene space and non-coding elements. Expansion of multigene families through gene duplication is an important component in the evolution of new gene functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Moreover, it has become evident that some of the complexity of higher organisms, which is related to an increase in the number and complexity of regulatory pathways derives from an increase of the size of non-coding regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Repetitive elements, particularly transposable elements, which are one of the major components of most plant genomes, have largely contributed the formation and family expansion of miRNAs, a major class of small non-coding RNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>.</p><p>Analysis of the globe artichoke gene-space revealed specific expansions of some gene families such as the genes encoding phytocystatins (PhyCys), which have been reported to be highly effective in pest defense<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, and P450 proteins which are potentially involved in production of secondary metabolites. Some other expansions of gene clusters encoding NBS-LRR proteins were also shown to be present in lettuce. All these genes are candidates for further investigation to understand their role in biotic stress resistance and generating the repertoire of secondary metabolite in globe artichoke. Physically clustered and/or species-specific genes involved in the same biological process are a frequent trait in globe artichoke.

The findings on non-conserved artichoke miRNAs are also of interest because of recent work in other species suggesting that such miRNAs may contribute to stress responses (Qin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014). Unlike ancient, conserved miRNAs, which are often highly expressed, young (lineage-specific or species-specific) miRNAs tend to be weakly expressed, processed imprecisely, and lack functional targets, implying that they are non-functional. However, a handful of newly derived miRNAs display high levels of expression in specific tissues or under particular stress treatments, consistent with a possible role in environmental adaptation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Future analysis based on smallRNA-seq, degradome sequencing and/or 5&#x02032; RACE are required to test this hypothesis and to reveal details of the potential biological role(s) of non-conserved miRNAs in stress responses of globe artichoke.</p><p>Analysis of LTR insertion times suggests that most of the genome expansion of <italic>C. cardunculus</italic> was relatively recent and mainly occurred after divergence from the Heliantheae - Cichorieae lineage. Recent increase in retrotransposon activity has also been reported in another Compositae species, sunflower<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. This pattern could be related to evolutionary events rather than a direct relationship between the expansions since they occurred after the separation of the tribes. The sunflower expansion is more recent, less than 1 Mya, than the expansion that occurred 2.5 Mya in the globe artichoke lineage. This could be related to the second WGD event in the Heliantheae lineage and also explain part of the difference in genome size between the two species.</p><p>In summary, the genomic sequences and features revealed in the present study not only enhance the taxonomic breadth of the data available for comparative plant genomics, but will also facilitate the identification of evolutionarily interesting and economically important genes from related species within the Compositae family.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genome Sequencing and Assembly</title><p>A globe artichoke Brazilian breeding line, designated &#x02018;2C&#x02019;, was subjected to three cycles of selfing to significantly reduce the level of heterozygosity and to be used as the source of DNA for sequencing and <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the reference genome sequence.

The core part of the SOILoCo pipeline is written in Perl and available at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bitbucket.org/dscaglione/soiloco">https://bitbucket.org/dscaglione/soiloco</ext-link> with a subsample of the dataset used in this work. Primary input data was generated as follows: Each set of parental reads was aligned to the draft reference assembly using the BWA aln algorithm with default parameters. SNP calling was performed with samtools mpileup on each parent separately and both together in a multi-sample call. To populate the initial SNP table, a minimum mapping quality of 25 and SNP quality of 20 were required. Similarly, each progeny read set was aligned and a multi-sample call was carried out on all 163 samples. HAPCUT algorithm (v0.5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,) was used to reconstruct haplotype blocks of each parent utilizing its individual SNP call table, 100 iterations were performed. The first script of the pipeline (&#x0201c;TC-separator.pl&#x0201d;) leverages two-sample parental SNP calling and the phase assembly of each to (i) split candidate testcross segregating SNP sites for each parent, (ii) divide coordinates as segregating from either phase-0 or phase-1 (type) and return an updated version of the progeny-wide SNP calling table (in VCF format), with scaffolds organized in haplotype blocks and types (depending on the phase of the segregating allele). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> shows how SNPs within a haplotype block of parent P1 are sorted depending whether they segregate from phase-0 or phase-1 with respect to the reference genome sequence. An ancillary script (&#x0201c;vcf2string.pl&#x0201d;) was then used to parse parent-specific VCF files and construct the sequence of calls for each individual over a given haplotype block; at this stage population-wide allele frequency constraints were applied to filter out possible false testcross SNPs (TC-SNPs). For this study, given the expected haplotype segregation (1:3), minor allele frequencies (MAFs) in the range of 0.075 to 0.425 were allowed. The Markov chain&#x02013;based algorithm embed in &#x0201c;gt-hmm.pl&#x0201d; applies a Viterbi decoding procedure given matrices of emission and transition probabilities of unknown genotypes in the finite states diagram depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>.

In case a candidate best path contained one or more state transitions (i.e. genotype switching), trimming routines are invoked to remove imputation errors. Such procedures consider relative length of two juxtaposed genotype sequences and their relative SNP density. Longer paths and SNP dense regions are favoured in contrast to short paths and relatively SNP poor regions, given maximum ratios of length and SNP density. The analysis was run with probabilities set as follows: T&#x02009;=&#x02009;10e<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>, C&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.2, E<sub>hom</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01, E<sub>het</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01. The minimum length of an observed genotype call was set to 6. Maximum accepted ratios of SNP density and path length were both set to 0.2. Minimum LOD to accept the best call path was 2. If any of these conditions was not satisfied, the genotype imputation for that particular individual was not generated. Afterwards, &#x0201c;TC_string_merger.pl&#x0201d; was used to join (where necessary) genotype imputation by complementary sets of SNPs over a haplotype block given the segregation from each homologous chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). This procedure was implemented in order to recover missing imputations and to correct wrong low-quality ones. A maximum ratio of missing genotypes per block/type was set to 0.30, while a minimum consensus of 0.50 between each segregation type was required to initiate consensus calling. In the case of contrasting genotype calls between types, the imputation with the highest LOD score was retained. Finally, &#x0201c;calls2csvr.pl&#x0201d; was used to convert the type-merged genotype calls to a segregation data matrix (in a format accepted by R/qtl) by filtering for minimum genotyping ratio of 0.70, and genotype distortion X<sup>2</sup> p value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.03.</p><p>Linkage analysis was performed by grouping haplotype-block markers with the &#x0201c;R/qtl&#x0201d; package, with minimum LOD&#x02009;=&#x02009;10, rec &#x02264;0.20.

A multi-sample VCF file of all the progeny was then processed to identify informative heterozygous sites based on parental SNPs and the phase of haplotype blocks (TC-separator.pl, blue box). This assigned the sites according to which phase (i.e. homologous chromosomes) they are expected to segregate in. Subsequently, an HMM-based algorithm was used to impute the most likely genotypes of each haplotype block segregating in the progeny (gt-hmm.pl, red box). A LOD score was also calculated to permit filtering of ambiguous imputations. Genotype imputation from the two alternative segregating phases were then summarized; when there was a discordant call between phases, a majority rule was applied and the highest LOD score for each segregating haplotype used to impute the most likely genotype (TC-string-merger.pl, green box). After grouping markers, linkage maps were generated for each parent using reiterative ordering with the MSTmap software (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~yonghui/mstmap.html">http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~yonghui/mstmap.html</ext-link>) and error correction using a Perl implementation of SMOOTH algorithm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.
