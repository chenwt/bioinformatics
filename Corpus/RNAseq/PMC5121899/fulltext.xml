Exhibiting extraordinary levels of morphological and developmental complexity, insects are the most diverse animal class on earth. Their evolutionary success was in particular shaped by the innovation of holometabolan metamorphosis in endopterygotes. Previously, miRNA evolution had been linked to morphological complexity, but astonishing variation in the currently available miRNA complements of insects made this link unclear. To address this issue, we sequenced the miRNA complement of the hemimetabolan <italic>Blattella germanica</italic> and reannotated that of two other hemimetabolan species, <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> and <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic>, and of four holometabolan species, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Our analyses show that the variation of insect miRNAs is an artefact mainly resulting from poor sampling and inaccurate miRNA annotation, and that insects share a conserved microRNA toolkit of 65 families exhibiting very low variation. For example, the evolutionary shift toward a complete metamorphosis was accompanied only by the acquisition of three and the loss of one miRNA families.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Although discovered more than 20 years ago, microRNAs (miRNAs) have appeared as important players in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. During these years, thousands of new miRNAs have been discovered, the pathways of miRNA biogenesis have been unveiled, and the mechanisms governing target regulation have been basically understood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Today, the contribution of miRNAs to the regulation of almost all cellular processes is considered crucial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. These processes rely on the coordinated expression of genes, which is implemented through gene-regulatory networks, and the participation of miRNAs in them increase functionality precision and reduce intrinsic noise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Moreover, it is plausible that miRNAs have played a role in the emergence of evolutionary innovations and increase of organismic complexity in animals, as apparition of new clades is accompanied by the emergence of new miRNAs, which became highly conserved<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>Insects, with about 1 million species described, represent approximately 90% of recorded metazoan species living on Earth and exhibit an extraordinary level of morphological and developmental diversity. Moreover, they show growing levels of organismal complexity within the class, from the most &#x0201c;primitive&#x0201d; Palaeoptera, to Polyneoptera and Paraneoptera (including Condylognatha), until to the more modified and megadiverse Endopterygota (=Holometabola)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. An important innovation that explains most of the insect evolutionary success has been the holometabolan metamorphosis, by which the juvenile stages can adopt a body plan very different from that of the adult, thus allowing the exploitation of new resources<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Recent reviews emphasize the importance that miRNAs play in insects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, also in metamorphosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>Moreover, a substantial number of insect miRNAs has been published and the correlated number of deposited miRNA sequences in miRBase is significant (26 insect species and 3,119 miRNAs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. However, the representation of insect-groups is highly biased, as we found that out of the 26 insect species represented, there are two hemimetabolan species (1polyneopteran and 1 paraneopteran) and 24 holometabolan (endopterygotes). Moreover, the information is also unequal, as the number of miRNAs ranges from 7 in the locust, <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic>, to 487 in the silkworm, <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, while a recent paper described 833 miRNA genes from the locust<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Therefore, this underrepresentation of hemimetabolan species and the dramatic inequality regarding the completeness of the miRNA complement of each species precludes any serious analysis on whether miRNAs played any role in insect evolution. To address this problem, we have studied in detail the miRNAs of the cockroach <italic>Blattella germanica</italic> (a hemimetabolan species), and we have revised the data of the hemimetabolan and holometabolan species that have the most robust information available on miRNAs.</p><p>Concerning <italic>B. germanica</italic>, we used an initial miRNA catalogue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, together with the information of a number of new small RNA-seq datasets (including Dicer-knockdown libraries, to validate miRNA candidates) and the newly available genome [ <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.hgsc.bcm.edu/arthropods/german-cockroach-genome-project">https://www.hgsc.bcm.edu/arthropods/german-cockroach-genome-project</ext-link>]. The criteria used to establish the miRNA complement of this cockroach were those reported by Fromm <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Concerning insect species having a good level of miRNA knowledge, we have chosen <italic>L. migratoria</italic> (paleopteran, hemimetabolan), with 833 described miRNA genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, the pea aphid <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic> (paraneopteran, hemimetabolan), for which 176 miRNAs have been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, and the endopterygotes and holometabolan <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, the honeybee, with 254 miRNAs recorded in miRBase, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, the flour beetle, with 220 miRNAs recorded in miRBase and 123 recently reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, <italic>B. mori</italic>, with 487 miRNAs recorded in miRBase, and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the fruit fly, with 165 miRNAs described by Fromm <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>Our goal was to study and identify the miRNA complement in insects in a robust manner, which can be useful in different fronts. For example, the study can allow to test if the great disparity of miRNA numbers in insects is real or only apparent. Data obtained would contribute to understand miRNA evolution in insects, with special attention to the transition from hemimetaboly to holometaboly, and facilitate comparisons with the equivalent miRNA complement in other clades in order to derive evolutionary conclusions. Finally, establishing the essential miRNA toolkit in insects can allow to address general evolutionary questions, like testing whether miRNA number correlate with genome size in insects, or contributing to the debate on the parallelism between the evolution of complex organisms and the evolution of gene regulation mechanisms.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>B. germanica</italic> miRNA complement</title><p>To identify the miRNAs of <italic>B. germanica</italic>, we started using two prediction tools, applied to all the small RNA-seq reads available and the <italic>B. germanica</italic> genome assembly. The mirDeep* tool produced an output file containing the coordinates for 1,724 miRNA candidates. The other tool, a modified version of mirDeep2 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mdc-berlin.de/8551903/en">https://www.mdc-berlin.de/8551903/en</ext-link>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, predicted 1,104 putative miRNAs. Both predictions were merged into a single file containing 2,761 miRNA candidates.</p><p>Comparisons of our predictions with miRBase data led to the identification of previously described, conserved miRNAs, which were then grouped into families according to similarity, especially in the seed region. When families contained miRNAs in different loci, we compared their sequences and flanking regions to discard eventual assembly artefacts. With this approach, we discarded three miRNA loci that would correspond to MIR-137, MIR-29 and MIR-276 families, as they resulted from misassembling artefacts. Reciprocal antisense miRNAs, like Mir-iab-8 and Mir-iab-4, were considered as single miRNA genes. Following these premises, we ended with 59 miRNA families containing 86 miRNA genes under the category of conserved in <italic>B. germanica</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Two miRNA families expected to be present were not found: MIR-36, which emerged with protostomes, and MIR-309, which emerged with pancrustaceans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). To confirm their apparent absence, we assessed that there were no reads corresponding to these miRNAs in the small RNAseq data. Additionally, using the miRNA precursor sequence of other insect species where it was available, we carried out homology searches on the <italic>B. germanica</italic> genome assembly and we assessed that there were no significant hits. Conversely, MIR-2001, MIR-932, MIR-3770 and MIR-6012 families that were considered exclusive of dipterans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, were now found in <italic>B. germanica</italic>.</p><p>In addition, our predictions gave 2,675 miRNA candidates with no significant similarity with any previously known miRNA. To discard false positives, we depleted Dicer-1 by RNAi, which resulted in significant reduction of miRNA levels, in general, as previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Subsequently, we prepared and sequenced two libraries from <italic>B. germanica</italic> treated with a dsRNA targeting Dicer-1, and two libraries from control specimens (treated with an unspecific dsRNA). The reads obtained from sequencing them are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. Then, the read counts for each arm of each miRNA candidate were recorded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). To set the limits for discarding false positives, we considered the effects of Dicer-1 depletion on conserved miRNAs. Thus, we recorded the read counts for conserved miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). The expression of 90% of the conserved miRNAs was reduced in some degree, whereas that of 81% of them was reduced with a log2(FC) lower than &#x02212;0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). As a negative control, we selected 558 non-coding RNA regions and we compared the expression change of them in Dicer-1 libraries and in control libraries, which resulted in a median fold change of &#x02212;0.18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). These results suggest that miRNA expression differences between control and dsDicer-1libraries are due to Dicer-1 processing of miRNA precursors and not to unspecific effects.</p><p>Subsequently, we excluded the miRNA candidates that were not significantly reduced after Dicer-1 depletion by setting a threshold of log2(FC)&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.5. Moreover, we also excluded the candidates that did not have at least 1 read-pair from the two control libraries in each arm. This rendered 213 miRNA candidates. Finally, we further filtered these candidates by using the criteria detailed in the methods section (secondary structure of the precursor forming a hairpin and with free energy InitialdG &#x0003c;&#x02212;22 kcal/mol; occurrence of more than 16 nucleotides paired between the mature and star sequence; and occurrence of two bases overhang from each arm). After that filter we obtained 13 <italic>bona fide</italic> novel miRNA loci belonging to 9 miRNA families (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). One of these families was MIR-bg5, which had been previously described in <italic>B. germanica</italic> as &#x0201c;candidate 1&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. It contains two miRNA genes and, as this MIR-bg5 family was also found in <italic>L. migratoria</italic> and <italic>A. pisum</italic> (see below), we will later consider it as conserved in insects. Therefore, we ended with 11 miRNAs novel genes belonging to the 8 novel miRNA families specific of <italic>B. germanica</italic>.</p><p>Using the mirPLOT bioinformatic tool available at GitHub (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/labP64/mirPLOT">https://github.com/labP64/mirPLOT</ext-link>) that was developed ad hoc, we generated a graphical report for each conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data S1</xref>) and specific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data S2</xref>) <italic>B. germanica</italic> miRNAs, which contains all structural and genomic information on every miRNA.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Properties of the <italic>B. germanica</italic> miRNA complement</title><p>The frequencies of occurrence of the mature miRNA in the 5p or 3p arm of the hairpin precursor are consistently similar in the 86 conserved miRNAs: 49% are placed in the 3p and 44% in 5p. When both are similarly expressed and the ratio between the most abundant divided by the least abundant is &#x0003c;2, we considered the miRNAs of both arms as co-mature, which represent a 7% of the miRNAs. The sample of novel miRNAs is smaller, and the frequencies of occurrence of the mature miRNA in the 5p or 3p arm are not so similar (3p&#x02009;=&#x02009;64%, 5p&#x02009;=&#x02009;27%, co-mature&#x02009;=&#x02009;9%, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;11) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The length of mature miRNAs ranges between 20 and 25 nucleotides, the most common being 22 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Moreover, the loop length of the precursor ranges between 8 and 40 nucleotides, the most common being 14&#x02013;15 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). In 66% of the cases the first nucleotide of the mature miRNA is U, as occurs in miRNAs, in general<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, followed by A (17%), C (11%) and G (6%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p>In terms of number of reads, specific miRNAs are significantly less expressed than conserved miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We then wondered whether specific miRNAs might have more or less potential targets than conserved miRNAs. Thus, we estimated the number of potential targets in both cases, considering the protein coding genes in the <italic>B. germanica</italic> genome using the algorithms RNAhybrid, miRanda and RNA22. For conserved miRNAs, RNAhybrid predicted 2,362,584 unique miRNA-mRNA pairs, miRanda 371,604 and RNA22 a total of 426,515. Then, we selected the 75,549 miRNA-mRNA pairs predicted by the three algorithms, and ended with an average of 803.96 mean targets predicted per conserved miRNA. The same approach gave 363.36 mean targets predicted per specific miRNA, which is significantly lower value (t-test p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). As a baseline reference, we predicted potential targets in the <italic>B. germanica</italic> genome for randomly generated 100 different sequences of 20 nucleotides each. The number of targets predicted for these 100 mock miRNAs was 31,270, which gives an average of 312.70 targets per mock miRNA. This value is significantly lower than the 803.96 putative targets per conserved miRNA, and a slightly lower than the 363.36 targets per specific miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The miRNA complement of <italic>B. germanica</italic> and the insect context</title><p>Current data on insect miRNAs recorded in miRBase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>) show that the number of miRNAs per insect species ranges between 100 and 200, although <italic>B. mori</italic> is an exception with 487 reported miRNAs. However, miRBase information on different species is unequal, as shown, for example, by the seven miRNAs recorded for <italic>L. migratoria</italic>, whereas a recent work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> reports 833 miRNAs for this species. This inequality suggests that comparisons should be performed with species that have the miRNA complement accurately established, especially on the basis of robust sequencing data. In addition to <italic>B. germanica</italic>, examples of species that accomplish this criterion are <italic>L. migratoria</italic>, <italic>A. pisum</italic>, <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, <italic>A. mellifera</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>).</p><p>From an evolutionary point of view, <italic>L. migratoria</italic> is the closest relative to <italic>B. germanica</italic>, for which 833 miRNAs have been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In order to compare this species with <italic>B. germanica</italic>, we submitted the miRNAs described by Wang <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> to the filtering procedure described herein. Results showed that 532 of the originally described <italic>L. migratoria</italic> miRNAs fulfilled the filtering criteria. From these, we discarded seven candidates that were identified as miRNA duplicated loci resulting from genome assembly artefacts. We also noticed that seven miRNA families present in <italic>B. germanica</italic> (MIR-2001, MIR-375, MIR-3049, MIR-3770, MIR-317, MIR-316 and MIR-971) were not recorded in <italic>L. migratoria</italic>. Blast approaches on the genome assembly and on small RNA-seq reads led to find three of them: MIR-317, MIR-316 and MIR-971, as well as a new Mir-10 gene. In summary, 85 conserved miRNA belonging to 57 families were identified in <italic>L. migratoria</italic>, including a MIR-bg5 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). The 444 remaining candidate genes are <italic>L. migratoria</italic> specific, which gave 365 different mature miRNAs (as some genes expressed identical mature miRNAs) that were grouped into 312 families. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data S3</xref> shows the complete reports of these <italic>L. migratoria</italic> miRNAs, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S6</xref> shows the correspondence between these miRNAs, the family assigned by us and the miRNA identifiers of Wang <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. <italic>L. migratoria</italic> specific miRNAs are clearly less expressed than conserved miRNAs, as occurs in <italic>B. germanica</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>As an example of paraneopteran, we used the 176 miRNAs reported in <italic>A. pisum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, as well as small RNA-seq data used for the predictions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Among them we found 65 conserved miRNAs belonging to 44 families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). In an attempt to find possible missing conserved miRNAs, we examined the <italic>A. pisum</italic> genome and the available expression data, finding the additional conserved miRNAs: Mir-133, Mir-193, two miRNAs of the MIR-210 family, Mir-750, Mir-375 and two miRNAs of the MIR-bg5 family. The case of Mir-133 is of note, as the precursor has a loop of about 200 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). However, it shows a good star-mature complementarity, both are supported by small RNA-seq reads and present the typical two overhanging nucleotides resulting from Dicer-1 and Drosha cleavage. Importantly, both arms show clear similarity with Mir-133 of other insect species. We included the ancestral Mir-2001 in the <italic>A. pisum</italic> complement since we found a genome locus highly similar to that of <italic>B. germanica</italic> Mir-2001, despite expression data for this miRNA was not available in <italic>A. pisum</italic>. Moreover, using a newer version of <italic>A. pisum</italic> genome (ABLF00000000.2), we identified Mir-31 and Mir-1175. We ended with 76 conserved miRNAs belonging to 52 families, including MIR-bg5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data S4</xref>). As members of the MIR-bg5 family were found in <italic>A. pisum</italic>, <italic>B. germanica</italic> and <italic>L. migratoria</italic>, we considered it as a miRNA conserved in insects. Concerning specific miRNAs, 34 fitted our filtering criteria and were considered <italic>bona fide</italic> specific miRNAs of <italic>A. pisum</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data S4</xref>).</p><p>With respect to endopterygotes, we used the 254 miRNAs of <italic>A. mellifera</italic> and the 487 of <italic>B. mori</italic> available in miRBase. We also examined the 220 miRNAs of <italic>T. castaneum</italic> deposited in miRBase, and 123 specific miRNAs recently described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In the case of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> we directly used the miRNA data reported by Fromm <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, who followed the filtering criteria used herein. In the case of <italic>B. mori</italic>, we additionally identified Mir-971 and Mir-76. Concerning Mir-1007 of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and Mir-6037 of <italic>A. mellifera</italic>, we considered that they were homologues (using the older name Mir-1007 for both), because conservation extends not only to the seed sequence and most of the mature miRNA, but also because there is significant conservation in the hairpin loop (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Finally, we recorded 92 conserved miRNAs belonging to 64 families in <italic>A. mellifera</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data S5</xref>), 94 conserved miRNAs belonging to 58 families in <italic>T. castaneum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data S6</xref>) and 81 conserved miRNAs belonging to 56 families in <italic>B. mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data S7</xref>).

Our predictions with mock miRNAs afford quantitative data to this suggestion.</p><p>Intriguingly, the number of <italic>B. germanica</italic> specific miRNAs appears very low, in comparison with the 365 specific miRNAs (belonging to 312 families) of <italic>L. migratoria</italic>. This difference can be hardly explained by differences in genome size between <italic>L. migratoria</italic> and <italic>B. germanica</italic> (5.8 and 2.0 Gbp, respectively). Rather, the low number of specific miRNAs found <italic>in B. germanica</italic> must be mainly due to less extensive representation of tissues and ages in the libraries used in this species. Novel miRNAs are expressed generally at lower levels than conserved miRNAs and in specific tissues and/or stages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>; and <italic>B. germanica</italic> libraries did not cover specific tissues and stages as important as nervous system and the embryonic development, for example.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The miRNA toolkit of insects</title><p>Our analyses indicate that the complement of 65 conserved miRNA families is quite constant in the species studied, which are representative of the three more diverse insect suborders: Polyneoptera, Paraneoptera and Endopterygota, which contain 98% of insects species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, spanning about 390 my of insect evolution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. This complement varies from 52 miRNA families in <italic>A. pisum</italic> to 64 in <italic>A. mellifera</italic> (average 58.00&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.65, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Equally, the number of miRNA genes in each miRNA family is notably stable. Most families have an average of 1 miRNA gene (37 families out of 65: 57%) or between 1 and 2 (18 families out of 65: 28%). Then, 5 families (8%) have between 2 and 3 genes, 4 families (6%) have between 3 and 5, and only one family (MIR-2) that have between 5 and 16 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S8</xref>).</p><p>There is no correlation between the number of miRNA genes in a given family and the time of emergence of the family (MIR-2 family, which is the one that have more genes, appeared with the protostomes, whereas there are many monogenic miRNA families that emerged with the bilaterians) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Thus, the quite constant and generally low number of genes in a family suggest that this number is evolutionarily constrained. Of note, this set of 65 miRNA families is independent of genome size, which varies from 0.12 Gbp in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (with 57 miRNA families) to 5.80 Gbp in <italic>L. migratoria</italic> (also with 57 miRNA families).</p><p>The last common ancestor of the species studied emerged some 390 million years ago<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and in this temporal frame, a total of four families have been acquired, three at the origin of endopterygotes, and one at the origin of coleopterans&#x02009;+&#x02009;panorpids) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). At species level, the losses of miRNA families range from 1 (considering the loss of MIR-bg5 in endopterygotes) in <italic>A. mellifera</italic> to 10 in <italic>A. pisum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). It is surprising that the emergence of the endopterygotes, the most successful group of metazoans on Earth in terms of diversity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, entailed the appearance of only three microRNAs: Mir-989, Mir-1006 and Mir-1007. One of the more derived features of this subclass and possibly the most influential for diversification, is the holometabolan mode of metamorphosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, which implies key developmental divergences in the embryo stage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Thus, further efforts to identify miRNAs in the embryo of holometabolan species should possibly increase the number of specific endopterygote miRNAs.</p><p>Concerning losses, data suggest that miRNAs that appeared later in evolution are more prone to disappear. For example, 7 out of 12 miRNA families of apterygotes (58%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>) were lost in one or other species and often in more than one species, whereas only 8 out of 29 miRNA families of bilaterians (28%) were lost in one or other species, but rarely in more than one species. The pea aphid <italic>A. pisum</italic> is notable for the large number of miRNA family losses (9 out of the 62 miRNAs families). Aphids display an XX/X0 sex-determination system and combine an unusual (autosome-like) inheritance of the X chromosome with the alternation of sexual and asexual reproduction. This has led to an accelerated evolution of sex chromosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and to a masculinization of the X chromosome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, three of the miRNA families lost in <italic>A. pisum</italic> (MIR-216, MIR-22 and MIR-12) are located on the X chromosome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. If they were also located in the X chromosome of <italic>A. pisum</italic>, then it would be plausible that these three families were lost in the context of the unusual evolution of the X chromosome. Finally, it is important to take into account that the absence of a given miRNA family in the complement of a given species can be also due to an incomplete genome and/or small RNA sequencing. Thus, it is always possible that some of the reported losses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>) might be attributable to incomplete data.</p><p>Our analyses have also revealed that genomic miRNA clusters are conserved in the species studied, and that losses of some miRNA genes are associated to the loss of the entire cluster. Intriguingly, the size of the cluster is notably variable and correlate with genome size, which suggests that cluster size is not constrained by natural selection. Transposable elements could be one of the sources of the miRNA cluster expansions as we observed on <italic>B. germanica</italic> Mir-71/Mir-2 cluster.</p><p>Concerning specific miRNAs, it is premature to draw general trends, as the data in the different species is unequal. In principle, the number of specific miRNAs might be correlated with the more or less derived features of the species, but this does not fit with the data available, as the list is headed by <italic>L. migratoria</italic> with 365 miRNAs, followed by <italic>T. castaneum</italic> (127 miRNAs), <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (65 miRNAs), <italic>A. pisum</italic> (34 miRNAs), <italic>A. mellifera</italic> (22 miRNAs), <italic>B. mori</italic> (14 miRNAs) and <italic>B. germanica</italic> (11 miRNAs). Again, sampling effort, in terms of tissues and stages, are the factors that by the moment determine the number of specific miRNA in each species. Possibly, genome size have also some influence, especially on the number of miRNAs rather than on the number of families, but data on specific miRNA is still too imperfect to establish correlations.</p><p>From a practical point of view, the accurate establishment of the miRNA toolkit in a given clade has predictive power, thus facilitating the empirical identification of the conserved miRNA complement in a given species of the clade. From an evolutionary point of view, the miRNA toolkit can enable comparisons between different clades of the tree of life using comparable data, and derive possible correlations between changes in the toolkit and changes in the organization and complexity during evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Insect Colony</title><p><italic>B. germanica</italic> specimens used were from a colony reared in the dark at 29 &#x000b1; 1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 60&#x02013;70% r.h.

To avoid misidentifications due to assembly artefacts, we examined all cases where two miRNAs from different loci had the same precursor sequence. In these cases, we retrieved the precursor plus 50 flanking nucleotides, aligned them and, if a perfect identity of the extended precursors was found, we considered that there was an assembly artefact.
