It has a sophisticated life cycle with several distinct stages including amoebal, flagellated, and plasmodial cells. It is unusual in switching between open and closed mitosis according to specific life-cycle stages. Here we present the analysis of the genome of this enigmatic and important model organism and compare it with closely related species. The genome is littered with simple and complex repeats and the coding regions are frequently interrupted by introns with a mean size of 100 bases. Complemented with extensive transcriptome data, we define approximately 31,000 gene loci, providing unexpected insights into early eukaryote evolution. We describe extensive use of histidine kinase-based two-component systems and tyrosine kinase signaling, the presence of bacterial and plant type photoreceptors (phytochromes, cryptochrome, and phototropin) and of plant-type pentatricopeptide repeat proteins, as well as metabolic pathways, and a cell cycle control system typically found in more complex eukaryotes. Our analysis characterizes <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> as a prototypical eukaryote with features attributed to the last common ancestor of Amorphea, that is, the Amoebozoa and Opisthokonts. Specifically, the presence of tyrosine kinases in <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> and <italic>Physarum</italic> as representatives of two distantly related subdivisions of Amoebozoa argues against the later emergence of tyrosine kinase signaling in the opisthokont lineage and also against the acquisition by horizontal gene transfer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Amoebozoa</kwd><kwd>tyrosine kinase receptor</kwd><kwd>two-component system</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>phytochrome</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Physarum polycephalum</italic> belongs to the Amoebozoa, the sister group to the Opisthokonts (i.e., fungi and animals) (<xref rid="evv237-B10" ref-type="bibr">Cavalier-Smith 2003</xref>) which both together form the supergroup Amorphea (<xref rid="evv237-B1" ref-type="bibr">Adl et al. 2012</xref>). In the course of its complex life cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evv237-F1">fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>), <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> is able to differentiate into various specialized cell types depending on environmental conditions (<xref rid="evv237-B9" ref-type="bibr">Burland et al. 1993</xref>). Macroscopic multinucleate plasmodial cells contain a naturally synchronous replicating and differentiating population of nuclei and can grow to tens or even hundreds of centimeters in size. Individual pieces cut off from a single plasmodium maintain synchrony, providing unique experimental options for single-cell biology. The occurrence of open and closed mitosis in amoebae and plasmodia, respectively, is another well-known aspect of its rich cell biology (<xref rid="evv237-B2" ref-type="bibr">Aldrich and Daniel 1982</xref>; <xref rid="evv237-B57" ref-type="bibr">Sauer 1982</xref>; <xref rid="evv237-B16" ref-type="bibr">Dove et al. 1986</xref>). Accordingly, <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> has served as a classical model organism in cell and developmental biology since the early 1960s and has been used extensively to study cell cycle regulation, cell differentiation (amoeba-flagellate transition, spherulation, sporulation), cell fusion, DNA replication, developmental gene expression, histone modification, sensing, and response (e.g., chemotaxis) (for reviews see <xref rid="evv237-B2" ref-type="bibr">Aldrich and Daniel 1982</xref>; <xref rid="evv237-B57" ref-type="bibr">Sauer 1982</xref>; <xref rid="evv237-B16" ref-type="bibr">Dove et al. 1986</xref>; <xref rid="evv237-B9" ref-type="bibr">Burland et al. 1993</xref>). More recently, <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> plasmodia have been used for studies ranging from cell biology and biophysics to unconventional computing for path finding, the biosensory control of robots, or the generation of music (<xref rid="evv237-B73" ref-type="bibr">Tsuda et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="evv237-B72" ref-type="bibr">Tero et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evv237-B7" ref-type="bibr">Braund and Miranda 2014</xref>). Plasmodial cells also contain thousands of mitochondria, providing the means to study the highly unusual form of insertional RNA editing used to generate functional mitochondrial transcripts.

(<italic>A</italic>) Schematic representation of the different stages that form during the heterothallic or the apogamic life cycle, as represented by the outer or the inner circle, respectively. One haploid (n) mononucleate amoeba hatches from each germinating haploid mononucleate spore. Amoebae have four developmental options. They can propagate by cell division through an open mitosis or differentiate into a flagellate, a cyst or a multinucleate plasmodium. <bold>Heterothallic cycle:</bold> Two amoebae of different mating type mate with each other to form a mononucleate diploid (2n) zygote by karyogamy. The zygote develops into a diploid multinucleate plasmodium. In the plasmodium, nuclei divide synchronously, while the nuclear envelopes remain intact (closed mitosis). The plasmodium keeps growing as long as environmental conditions are favorable. A mature, multinucleate plasmodium can develop into a sclerotium to survive drought. Sporulation of a starving plasmodium is induced by visible light or heat shock. During sporulation, the protoplasmic mass develops into multiple fruiting bodies. Each sporangium contains hundreds of haploid (n), mononucleate spores that have been formed through meiosis. <bold>Apogamic cycle:</bold> A haploid, mononucleate amoeba that carries a <italic>gadAh</italic> mutant allele may develop into a multinucleate, haploid plasmodium without mating. Upon sporulation, the low number of diploid nuclei that have been formed within the plasmodium gives rise to viable spores. Apogamic development can be suppressed experimentally by elevated temperature, which allows propagation of amoebal clones or the formation of a diploid plasmodium by mating of two amoebae of different mating type. As mating of amoebal cells and plasmodium formation are controlled by different mating type genes, sophisticated approaches based on Mendelian genetics are possible (<xref rid="evv237-B14" ref-type="bibr">Dee 1987</xref>).

The maximum likelihood method with the JTT matrix was used. <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> genes were omitted for calculating the tree, because endoparasites are known to evolve at different rates as compared with free-living organisms.

The model organism most closely related to <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> for which a genome sequence has previously been determined is <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> (<xref rid="evv237-B20" ref-type="bibr">Eichinger et al. 2005</xref>). The two model species differ in several important aspects. <italic>D. discoideum</italic> is a cellular slime mold where differentiation occurs in developmentally interacting cells, whereas in the acellular slime mold <italic>P. polycephalum,</italic> a single, multinucleate plasmodial cell differentiates in a manner reminiscent of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos or other developing syncytia. A comparison of <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> and <italic>D. discoideum</italic> may help to elucidate the different evolutionary trajectories the members of the two branches, cellular and acellular slime molds, have taken in establishing sophisticated life cycles that are so different.</p><p>The established lab strains of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> do not form viable progeny after mating, which hinders genetic experiments, whereas mating of strains and segregation of meiotic progeny in <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> is under ready experimental control. The classical genetics are well-established in <italic>P. polycephalum,</italic> and the possibility to experimentally switch the life cycle between haploid and diploid stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evv237-F1">fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>) is very useful for the generation and analysis of mutants (<xref rid="evv237-B13" ref-type="bibr">Dee 1982</xref>, <xref rid="evv237-B14" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). Amoebal strains derived from different natural plasmodial isolates, such as Wis-1 and Wis-2 (see Appendix A of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv237/-/DC1">Supplemental Methods, Results</ext-link>, and Discussion), allow forward genetic approaches by mapping genes identified in phenotypic screens. Mendelian analysis based on the co-segregation of phenotype and single nucleotide polymorphisms (<xref rid="evv237-B60" ref-type="bibr">Schedl and Dove 1982</xref>) can be performed by sequencing pools of cDNAs of phenotype-carrying segregants (Barrantes and Marwan, unpublished results). These high-throughput methods combined with Mendelian genetics mitigate current difficulties of reproducibly making transgenic lines. Methods for knocking down gene expression have recently been developed for <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> (<xref rid="evv237-B25" ref-type="bibr">Haindl and Holler 2005</xref>; <xref rid="evv237-B33" ref-type="bibr">Itoh et al. 2011</xref>), opening up additional experimental avenues. Here, we present an overview of the whole genome of <italic>P. polycephalum</italic>, focusing on some of its peculiar features such as its surprisingly extended signaling system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Assembly</title><p>Combined sequence reads from different libraries (including 3- and 8-kb mate pairs) were assembled using the Newbler software version 2.6 (<xref rid="evv237-B79" ref-type="bibr">Margulies et al. 2005</xref>), and the Newbler contigs were then assembled into scaffolds using Bambus version 2.3 (<xref rid="evv237-B80" ref-type="bibr">Pop et al. 2004</xref>), and a custom transcriptome-guided scaffolding algorithm.

This initial analysis yielded 733,443 potential transcripts.</p><p>After clustering with usearch (<xref rid="evv237-B18" ref-type="bibr">Edgar 2010</xref>), we obtained 31,770 clusters, each represented by the largest sequence in a cluster. The mean length of transcripts in the thus constructed reference transcriptome is 1,264 bases. These transcripts were mapped onto the genome using blat (<xref rid="evv237-B37" ref-type="bibr">Kent 2002</xref>). Only 485 transcripts could not be mapped to the genome sequence, of which only 90 have a blast score of 250 or higher in a search against the reference sequence database (NCBI July 2013). Fifteen of these 90 appear to be of <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> mitochondrial origin and a further 13 are certainly contaminants from the sequencing process, as they have identity values higher than 85% to some bacteria and mouse sequences. Thus, only a minor fraction of transcripts is not represented by the assembled genome. Manual inspection of some transcript/genome alignments revealed that transcripts frequently span gaps in the scaffolds, which account for missing small exons. Inability to assemble genome junctions at these positions is likely caused by the low complexity of intron sequences and the small size of the missing exons. As contiguity of a sequence is required for accurate gene prediction, we relied heavily on the transcript data for annotation and analysis. The Transcriptome Reference Assembly has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession GDRG00000000. The version described in this paper is the first version, GDRG01000000.

The transcriptome data were used to train this program according to the manual, and to provide splice information for the algorithm. The program itself was run with default values. This way we predicted 47,779 protein coding genes. We noticed, however, that the fragmented nature of the genome sequence and missing contiguity within scaffolds led to an overprediction. To get a better estimate of the number of protein coding genes in the <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> genome, we tried to combine gene prediction and reference transcriptome for the definition of gene loci. To this end, we mapped the reference transcriptome data to the genome. We then fused predicted genes and reference transcripts to gene loci if predicted genes were covered by the same reference transcript and/or if predicted genes were present in the near vicinity (&#x0003c;50 bases apart) and at least one of them was covered or partially covered by a transcript sequence. Predicted genes without transcript coverage and no transcript in the near vicinity (&#x0003c;50 bp apart) were counted as independent gene loci. In this way, we defined 34,438 gene loci, of which 17,280 are not supported by transcript data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evv237-T1">table 1</xref>).

Construction of gene models therefore heavily relied on accompanying transcriptome data (see Materials and Methods).</p><p>The genetic material used for sequencing the <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> genome was derived from axenic, haploid amoebal cells (strain LU352). The assembly of 454 and paired end Illumina reads with an estimated coverage of 50 &#x000d7; (calculating with a genome size of 250 Mb) resulted in scaffolds covering 182 Mb. However, assembling the genome has been challenging owing to extremely long stretches of di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats and large homopolymeric tracts, which likely lead to polymerase slippage and premature polymerase termination <italic>in vitro.</italic> The unresolvable sequence patches cause innumerable gaps in the final sequence, resulting in a mean scaffold size of only slightly larger than 2 kb. PacBio sequencing yielded only minimal improvement. We therefore tested whether our assembly captures most of the coding information of the genome by investigating the primary metabolism capacity encoded by the assembly. We found that all expected pathways were entirely present and, therefore, conclude that the current assembly is complete enough for further analysis.</p><sec><title>Gene Content and Introns</title><p>To further evaluate gene content and completeness, we generated transcriptome data sets from multiple life-cycle stages and constructed a reference transcriptome (see Materials and Methods).</p><p>We next trained the gene prediction program Augustus (<xref rid="evv237-B66" ref-type="bibr">Stanke et al. 2004</xref>) with sequences derived from mapped transcripts. Gene predictions using the splicing information from all transcripts initially yielded more than 47,000 gene models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evv237-T1">table 1</xref>). However, because in the current assembly some shorter introns and exons are missing in scaffolds owing to simple repeat sequences at both ends, we used the reference transcripts together with the gene predictions to define gene loci. Transcripts and predicted genes overlapping each other or being in close vicinity on the assembly (in the range of an intron length) were fused to a common gene locus. A total of 34,438 gene loci were defined in this way (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evv237-T1">table 1</xref>), half of which are represented by transcripts (17,158). The gene loci with corresponding transcripts have a mean length of 1951 bases, whereas those without transcript support have a mean length of only 579 bases. This suggests that the majority of unsupported gene loci may represent false-positive predictions, which is fairly typical of highly fragmented genome assemblies.</p><p>There are scores of complex repeats in the genome, which contains a minimum of 484 integrase domains (PF00665) and 1,014 reverse transcriptase domains (PF07727 and PF00078). This greatly exceeds the number present in other Amoebozoa species such as <italic>A. castellanii</italic> and <italic>D. dis<italic>c</italic>oideum</italic>, which contain only 38 and 118 reverse transcriptase domains, respectively. In total, <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> complex repetitive elements contribute approximately 3 Mb or 1.3% to the size of the genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv237/-/DC1">supplementary table S4</ext-link>). Most <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> genes contain multiple introns, many of which are composed of extended repeats flanked by splicing signals. The median size of the 160,988 introns confirmed by transcript data is 231 bases, and the total number of predicted introns is 676,387. Thus, the mean number of confirmed introns per gene is approximately 5. If only the genes with transcript data are counted, the number of introns per gene increases to well above 9. This intron frequency is higher than the estimated number of introns in the last common ancestor (LCA) of eukaryotes (<xref rid="evv237-B78" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al. 2014</xref>). Thus, <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> has likely acquired introns during its species history.</p></sec><sec><title>Domain Analysis</title><p>Using iprscan (<xref rid="evv237-B77" ref-type="bibr">Zdobnov and Apweiler 2001</xref>), we defined the domain content for each gene locus. A comparison with <italic>A. castellanii</italic> and <italic>D. discoideum</italic> showed that <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> has the highest number of domain hits of the three organisms, reflecting the larger genome and the higher gene count. In terms of distinct domains, <italic>A. castellanii</italic> and <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> are similar, whereas fewer types of domains have been identified in <italic>D. discoideum,</italic> suggesting domain loss in the social amoebae (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evv237-T2">table 2</xref>).

PPR proteins are sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins that act in diverse processes of RNA maturation, mainly in mitochondria and chloroplasts (<xref rid="evv237-B62" ref-type="bibr">Schmitz-Linneweber and Small 2008</xref>). The PPR motif is a loosely conserved 35-aa motif identifying individual ribonucleotides on a one-repeat-per-nucleotide basis (<xref rid="evv237-B5" ref-type="bibr">Barkan et al. 2012</xref>). As in other taxa, the <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> proteins contain PPR arrays of variable sizes ranging from only a few up to more than 20 tandem PPRs in individual proteins. With some 100 PPR protein genes, <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> features much more than tenfold the number found in other slime mold genomes such as <italic>Polysphondylium pallidum</italic> or <italic>D. discoideum.</italic> In fact, the set of PPR proteins present in <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> is significantly larger than in other Amoebozoa and, more broadly, within the Amorphea super-domain at large. Indeed, larger numbers of PPR proteins have hitherto only been observed in Dinoflagellates and in land plants, where large families of PPR proteins were initially discovered (<xref rid="evv237-B64" ref-type="bibr">Small and Peeters 2000</xref>). Two observations are particularly intriguing: In contrast to other Amorphea, <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> has a highly derived mitochondrial genome, the transcripts of which are affected by abundant and diverse types of RNA editing, including alterations of transcript sequences by nucleotide insertions and base conversions (<xref rid="evv237-B46" ref-type="bibr">Mahendran et al. 1991</xref>; <xref rid="evv237-B71" ref-type="bibr">Takano et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="evv237-B8" ref-type="bibr">Bundschuh et al. 2011</xref>). We speculate that some of the PPR proteins in <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> take part in these processes. Most notably, 16 of the <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> PPR proteins are &#x0201c;plant-like&#x0201d; in carrying a carboxyterminal DYW domain with cytidine deaminase similarity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv237/-/DC1">supplementary fig</ext-link>.

Several such DYW-type PPR proteins have been characterized as site-specific C-to-U editing factors in plants. Intriguingly, the first discovery of PPR proteins with a DYW domain outside of land plants in the genome of <italic>Naegleria gruberi</italic> led to the subsequent discovery of C-to-U editing in the mitochondria of this heterolobosean protist (<xref rid="evv237-B40" ref-type="bibr">Knoop and R&#x000fc;dinger 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evv237-B54" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000fc;dinger et al. 2011</xref>). As in plants and <italic>Naegleria</italic>, the residues likely coordinating a zinc ion for deaminase activity are highly conserved in the <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> DYW domains. Given that in its natural environment there is direct physical contact with the slime mold growing on decaying plant materials, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from plants may be a possible source of the <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> PPR genes. However, no evidence for particularly high similarity of any <italic>Physarum</italic> PPR protein to a homolog in another taxon indicating a recent HGT has been found. The DYW-type PPR protein families of <italic>Physarum polycephalum, Naegleria gruberi,</italic> and the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens,</italic> for example, cluster taxon-wise without evidence for recent HGT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv237/-/DC1">supplementary fig</ext-link>.

Pteridines (e.g., folate, biopterin, riboflavin, etc.) function as important cofactors (or their precursors) of various enzymatic reactions. Pterines are synthesized from the common precursor GTP (guanosine 5&#x02032; triphosphate).</p><p>Analysis of the <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> genome for pteridine metabolic enzymes revealed that it is unusual in encoding enzymes for all common pteridine biosynthetic pathways (for the biosynthesis of molybdopterin, tetrahydrofolate, tetrahydrobiopterin, 7-aminomethyl deazaguanine, and riboflavin) and, in addition, the enzymes alkylglycerol monooxygenase and nitric oxide synthases. Alkylglycerol monooxygenase and nitric oxide synthase, in its full length form with oxygenase and reductase domains, are regularly found only in animals. Nitric oxide synthases are required for sporulation in <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> by acting via cGMP signaling (<xref rid="evv237-B24" ref-type="bibr">Golderer et al. 2001</xref>).

The reading frames for nitric oxide synthases found in <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> do not occur in the <italic>D. discoideum</italic> genome. Furthermore, another surprising feature is the comparatively frequent presence of homologous enzymes that catalyze the same enzymatic reaction, whereas most species including <italic>D. discoideum</italic> use only one.

Fragmin, homologous to severin in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and gelsolin in more complex organisms (<xref rid="evv237-B76" ref-type="bibr">Yin et al. 1990</xref>), was first described by the Hatano group (<xref rid="evv237-B29" ref-type="bibr">Hasegawa et al. 1980</xref>) and its 1:1 complex with actin was further investigated by Vandekerckhove and colleagues (<xref rid="evv237-B21" ref-type="bibr">Gettemans et al. 1992</xref>; <xref rid="evv237-B19" ref-type="bibr">Eichinger et al. 1996</xref>). The latter group isolated a kinase that phosphorylated actin, but only in the 1:1 actin-fragmin complex. Upon phosphorylation, the activity of the actin-fragmin complex changed to an F-actin capping function and was, therefore, a putative regulator of fast changes in local viscoelasticities in the F-actin network, a prerequisite for cytoplasmic streaming. Surprisingly, the protein sequence of the purified protein did not show any of the well-known protein kinase domains (<xref rid="evv237-B27" ref-type="bibr">Hanks and Hunter 1995</xref>), and it could not be excluded that a minor contamination was responsible for actin phosphorylation. Only the crystallization of the protein finally showed that it was in fact a kinase whose structure was in its catalytic domain nearly identical to protein kinase A (<xref rid="evv237-B69" ref-type="bibr">Steinbacher et al. 1999</xref>). These data lead to major conclusions: The actin-fragmin kinase is clearly an example for convergent evolution. There is no common ancestor as in the case of divergent evolution of conventional protein kinases. Thus, the evolutionary pressure is on the structure of the molecule in determining its function. There is no need to keep a distinct amino acid sequence with a certain arrangement of protein domains, just structure/function relationships count. Consequently, this type of actin phosphorylation in <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> is possibly not unique as suggested above. One cannot exclude convergent evolution of kinases with similar substrate specificity also in other organisms, as these molecules may have completely unrelated sequences and are not easily detectable by sequence similarities. Perhaps most importantly, this example demonstrates the limitations of any whole-genome approach. In the end, only biochemistry and molecular cell biology will cross the border from &#x0201c;gene products of unknown function&#x0201d; to proteins with known activities.</p><p><italic>P. polycephalum</italic> possesses a wealth of motor domains. We searched all defined gene loci for the presence of such domains. With this initial search, we found 43 gene loci with a kinesin domain (PF00225), 23 gene loci with a dynein heavy-chain domain (PF03028), and 53 gene loci with myosin motors (PF00063). As the genome assembly is fragmented and thus gene loci likely do not always represent a whole gene, we further investigated these loci making use of the reference transcriptome library. This approach enabled us to define eight complete dyneins, one N-terminal half, and two N-terminal fragments. Ten further fragments of varying length show homology to the middle and C-terminal parts of dyneins. Thus, the <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> genome likely encodes at least 11 dynein proteins. This number is in the same range as in other species.</p><p>With the same approach, we defined 15 complete or nearly complete myosin proteins and 16 fragments of varying lengths. Five of the full-length genes and seven of the fragments have the highest similarity to class VII unconventional myosins, indicating an amplification of this family in <italic>P. polycephalum.</italic></p><p>Kinesins have a wider length range than the other motor proteins, and the regions outside the motor domain are highly variable. This makes it impossible to distinguish between full-length genes and fragments, as with the other motor domain proteins. Matching possible kinesin gene loci with transcript data yielded 39 defined loci. Three of these are small without transcript data. The mean length of the others is well above 700 amino acids. Thus, we conclude that at least 36 kinesin genes reside in the <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> genome. Strikingly, most of the gene loci we defined here are represented in our reference transcriptome library indicating their expression.</p><p>Dynein domains and, much more pronounced, kinesin domains are overrepresented in <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> as compared with two other organisms within the Amoebozoa, <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and <italic>A. castellanii</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv237/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>). The enrichment of dynein domains is likely owing to the fact that <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> possesses flagella. It was shown previously that a plasmodial species, <italic>Reticulomyxa filosa</italic>, has amplified its complement of kinesin domain-bearing genes, which may be associated with the increased requirements of intracellular transport in a huge cell (<xref rid="evv237-B23" ref-type="bibr">Gl&#x000f6;ckner et al. 2014</xref>). We see this gene family expansion also in <italic>P. polycephalum</italic>, hinting at a common prerequisite for acquiring a plasmodial life stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell Cycle Regulation, Cellular Signaling, and Photoreceptors</title><p>The detection of external stimuli and the processing of these stimuli into an appropriate response is an essential property of all living organisms. For a free-living, motile, phagocytotic, unicellular organism like <italic>P. polycephalum</italic>, physiologically relevant stimuli may include environmental factors such as light, humidity, temperature, pH, osmolarity, mechanical stress, or chemical signals released by mates, prey, predators, competitors, or symbionts<italic>.</italic> As a true free-living species, <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> should have retained most, if not all, components of such signaling systems inherited from the LCA of Amoebozoa.

By analyzing macroscopic samples taken at regular time intervals from a single plasmodial cell at subsequent points of a time series, one can exploit the remarkable natural mitotic synchrony of plasmodial nuclei (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv237/-/DC1">Supplementary Results</ext-link> and Discussion) and resolve time-dependent regulatory events within individual cells at transcriptome and proteome-wide scales. In this context, the current finding that the control system of the mitotic cycle of <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> is typical of most eukaryotes, including plants and animals while different to that of the yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evv237-F2">fig. 2</xref>), makes an important point.

Although there are deep functional similarities across all these organisms, suggesting a &#x0201c;universal&#x0201d; control mechanism for eukaryotes (<xref rid="evv237-B51" ref-type="bibr">Nurse 1990</xref>, <xref rid="evv237-B52" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), there are differences in the regulators that control the G1/S transition in yeast cells (&#x0201c;start&#x0201d;) and animal cells (&#x0201c;restriction point&#x0201d;). The key decision point for proliferation and development in animal cells occurs in G1 phase.

Many of these SHKPs contain small molecule or light-sensing domains, such as the GAF, PAS/PAC, or phytochrome domains, which are likely to detect stimuli and activate phosphotransfer, whereas others contain protein kinase or AAA-ATPase domains. These domains could be downstream effectors, which are regulated by phosphorelay.

The accessibility of both genome sequence and extensive transcriptome data sets strongly enhances its usefulness as a model system. The availability of the transcriptome of amoebae and plasmodia at different stages of development now permits reverse genetic approaches through identifying mutants in genes of interest in mutant libraries obtained by chemical mutagenesis of amoebal cells. In addition, the transcriptome sequences provide the basis for quantitative proteomic approaches by mass spectrometry. Our analysis highlights a wealth of interesting molecular features and will help in enabling work at the molecular level in combining the well-established classic genetics with second-generation sequencing approaches.</p><p>The results of the <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> sequencing project described here provide interesting information with respect to the evolution of signaling systems in the Amorphea branch of the eukaryotes. Virtually all aspects discussed here characterize <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> as an organism with higher molecular complexity than other sequenced Amoebozoa. This becomes most obvious for cellular signaling through the extensive use of two-component signaling systems in parallel with RTK signal transduction. Other important aspects such as cell cycle regulation, cytoskeletal motor proteins, and the enzymes of the pteridine metabolism point in the same direction. Together with recent findings on <italic>A. castellanii</italic> (<xref rid="evv237-B11" ref-type="bibr">Clarke et al. 2013</xref>), our results indicate that the molecular evolution of these features, notably signaling through RTKs, which has previously been considered a hallmark of multicellularity of animals, is deeply rooted in the Amorphea and has been secondarily lost in other Amoebozoa like <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and in the fungi. Another interesting feature of <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> is the occurrence of photoreceptors: two bacterial-type phytochromes, not found in other Amoebozoa, a phototropin-like LOV-domain blue light photoreceptor, and a cryptochrome. In conclusion, among the unicellular genetic model organisms, <italic>P. polycephalum</italic> displays many features of animal cells and, with respect to its molecular complexity, the cross-talk of signaling molecules, and the resulting dynamic behavior. As such, it is anticipated that it will serve as an interesting model system contributing complementary information for the study of mammalian and other animal cells. In combination with its ability to form multinucleate giant plasmodia, this provides unique options for investigating fundamental biological processes in individual cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>Supplemental Methods, Results, and Discussion with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv237/-/DC1">figures S10, S13&#x02013;S18, S20, S21, table S2&#x02013;S4</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv237/-/DC1">Supplementary Spreadsheets</ext-link> including <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv237/-/DC1">Supplementary Spreadsheets 1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv237/-/DC1">2</ext-link> are available at Genome Biology and Evolution online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/">http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>).</p>
