Other benefits, as enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses have been reported to some diazotrophs. Here we aim to study the effects of the association between the diazotroph <italic>Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus</italic> PAL5 and sugarcane cv. SP70-1143 during water depletion by characterizing differential transcriptome profiles of sugarcane. RNA-seq libraries were generated from roots and shoots of sugarcane plants free of endophytes that were inoculated with <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> and subjected to water depletion for 3 days. A sugarcane reference transcriptome was constructed and used for the identification of differentially expressed transcripts. The differential profile of non-inoculated SP70-1143 suggests that it responds to water deficit stress by the activation of drought-responsive markers and hormone pathways, as ABA and Ethylene. qRT-PCR revealed that root samples had higher levels of <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> 3 days after water deficit, compared to roots of inoculated plants watered normally. With prolonged drought only inoculated plants survived, indicating that SP70-1143 plants colonized with <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> become more tolerant to drought stress than non-inoculated plants. Strengthening this hypothesis, several gene expression responses to drought were inactivated or regulated in an opposite manner, especially in roots, when plants were colonized by the bacteria. The data suggests that colonized roots would not be suffering from stress in the same way as non-inoculated plants. On the other hand, shoots specifically activate ABA-dependent signaling genes, which could act as key elements in the drought resistance conferred by <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> to SP70-1143. This work reports for the first time the involvement of <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> in the promotion of drought-tolerance to sugarcane cv. SP70-1143, and it describes the initial molecular events that may trigger the increased drought tolerance in the host plant.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The research was supported by Instituto Nacional de Ci&#x000ea;ncia de Tecnologia (INCT) in Biological Nitrogen Fixation, Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ), Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior (CAPES) and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico (CNPq).

Its capability to store sucrose as a primary energy source, instead of more complex compounds as starch, proteins or lipids, makes its use for energy production easier. Statistical data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations indicate that sugarcane production covered, in 2012, more than 26 million hectares worldwide, with a global production of 1,8 billion tons, representing a 30% of growth since the beginning of the century. Nowadays, Brazil stands as world's first country in sugarcane harvesting and production, being alone responsible for 40% of the global production (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://faostat3.fao.org/">http://faostat3.fao.org/</ext-link>). Given the growth of sugarcane industry worldwide, demands for higher sugarcane yield per hectare have been increasing to lower production costs, especially in areas with adverse conditions such as drought and cold. As water availability is the major limiting factor for sugarcane productivity <xref rid="pone.0114744-Tammisola1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, studies that lead to an increase of sugarcane drought tolerance are needed to provide tools to allow sugarcane plantation in drier regions. This is one of the greater challenges for the sustainable expansion of sugarcane production that is being carried out in Brazil since 2007 <xref rid="pone.0114744-Rudorff1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>As most grasses, sugarcane established during its evolution an efficient interaction with particular types of microorganisms. Plant-growth-promoting-bacteria (PGPB) can offer several benefits to host plants such as increase in biomass, promotion of plant development <xref rid="pone.0114744-Oliveira1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114744-Oliveira2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, pathogen defense <xref rid="pone.0114744-Muthukumarasamy1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114744-Arencibia1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and tolerance to abiotic stresses, including drought <xref rid="pone.0114744-Arzanesh1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114744-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Some PGPB can also transfer fixed nitrogen to plants, in a process called Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF) <xref rid="pone.0114744-Urquiaga1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The diazotrophic PGPB comprise many species, including <italic>Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus</italic> and facultative endophytes as <italic>Azospirillum</italic>, among others <xref rid="pone.0114744-Pedraza1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The use of inoculants containing nitrogen-fixing bacteria can generate large benefits to farmers, for example by decreasing nitrogen fertilizer expenses and reducing losses by drought or diseases. However, these gains depend on cultivars able to take full advantage of the benefits generated by bacterial associations. Previous studies reviewed plant drought tolerance promoted by several types of microorganism interactions such as fungi <xref rid="pone.0114744-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, endophytic and rhizospheric bacteria <xref rid="pone.0114744-Dimkpa1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and rhizobium interaction <xref rid="pone.0114744-Zahran1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Some works specifically described drought tolerance improved by <italic>Azospirillum</italic>, a facultative endophyte diazotrophic bacteria, in monocots <xref rid="pone.0114744-Creus1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114744-RuzSnchez1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and in dicots <xref rid="pone.0114744-DominguezNez1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, little is known about the molecular pathways involved in the drought tolerance promoted by beneficial endophytic diazotrophic bacteria that colonize sugarcane. Besides drought tolerance, the use of diazotrophic bacteria in crop production can also help minimizing the use of nitrogen fertilization <xref rid="pone.0114744-Bhattacharjee1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. As potential groundwater pollutant, nitrogen fertilization is a major environmental concern related to agriculture practice <xref rid="pone.0114744-Good1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Thus, a better understanding of the interaction between host plant and diazotrophic bacteria may favor the emergence of new technologies that enable more sustainable use of natural resources in agricultural production. With the purpose to efficiently use water in sugarcane crop production, enlightening the molecular mechanism involved in drought tolerance promoted by plant-diazotroph interaction might be a step forward to bring agriculture to a more sustainable level.</p><p>Plant responses to drought involve a complex network of signaling mechanisms, regulating several different physiological and biochemical processes <xref rid="pone.0114744-Chaves1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114744-Bhargava1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and responses could be different depending on plant species or even cultivars <xref rid="pone.0114744-Ahmad1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Hormone regulation is known to have an important role in plant responses to abiotic stresses. Because it regulates diverse processes in plants, hormone signaling can induce some levels of stress tolerance <xref rid="pone.0114744-Wilkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene (ET) are stress responsive hormones that play important roles in drought sensing and response <xref rid="pone.0114744-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114744-Mizoi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The drought responsive gene expression can be regulated by ABA-dependent or ABA-independent pathways, mainly through Transcription Factors (TFs) family ABRE-binding protein/ABRE-bing factors (AREB/ABF) or DRE/CRT-binding protein (DREB), respectively <xref rid="pone.0114744-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The AREB/ABF TFs are members of the Basic Leucine Zipper (bZIP) superfamily of TFs with a binding motif to ABA-responsive element (ABRE), and the DREBs are members of APETALA2 (AP2)/ethylene-responsive element binding factor (ERF) with a binding motif to dehydration-responsive element/C-repeat (DRE/CRT), which are known to be involved in abiotic stress responses in Arabidopsis and Grasses <xref rid="pone.0114744-Nakashima1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>In this work, responses of sugarcane-diazotrophic bacteria association were characterized during drought stress. For this purpose, a water depletion assay of the interaction between the sugarcane cultivar SP70-1143 and the diazotroph <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> strain PAL5 was performed. Sugarcane cv. SP70-1143 responds efficiently to diazotrophic bacteria association, whose contribution of BNF is estimated to be able to reach levels up to 70% <xref rid="pone.0114744-Urquiaga1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114744-Boddey1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. SP70-1143 was widely cultivated in the mid-80s in Brazil and today participates as progenitor of new improved varieties <xref rid="pone.0114744-Matsuoka1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, which highlights the importance this cultivar still has in Brazilian agriculture. On the other hand, <italic>G.diazotrophicus</italic> is known to establish beneficial interactions with sugarcane, providing a good model system for associations between monocots and diazotrophic bacteria <xref rid="pone.0114744-Baldani1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The results indicate that under our experimental conditions, sugarcane cv. SP70-1143 plants colonized with <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> became more tolerant to drought stress than non-inoculated plants. Higher levels of <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> colonization were quantified in inoculated plants after water deficit, compared with plants growing in normal watering conditions. To better understand the early molecular responses promoted by diazotroph-sugarcane interactions in plants submitted to drought stress, especially the hormone signaling responses, differential transcriptomes of shoots and roots of cv. SP70-1143 inoculated by <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> submitted to water deficit were generated by RNA-Seq. The results showed that SP70-1143 plants free of diazotrophs respond in a classical way to water deficit, activating well-known drought-responsive markers. Nevertheless, bacteria's colonization suppresses in the host plant several of the drought stress responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Colonization of sugarcane cv.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, quantification of <italic>G.diazotrophicus</italic> colonization was measured by qRT-PCR of ribosomal RNA (23S rRNA). Ribosomal RNA is considered a constitutive gene, and it is widely used to detect the presence of target microorganisms in a variety of samples <xref rid="pone.0114744-Vargas1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The results showed that plants were highly colonized by bacteria after 7 days of inoculation in hydroponic solution. Interestingly, bacteria colonized roots in higher numbers than shoots when the hydroponic system was used for plant inoculation and growth. To be certain that bacteria were promoting benefits to host plant, the fresh weight of roots and shoots was evaluated 14 days after inoculation, confirming the plant growth promotion effect of <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> one day before treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>A second type of analysis was conducted to define the period of water deficit treatment suitable for the investigation of early molecular and biochemical responses of cv.

As physiological modifications are the first responses of plants to overcome water deficit, phenotypic analysis of SP70-1143 plants were monitored along water deficit condition. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, plants in treatments WD and WD+GD started showing visible signals of stress, such as leaves with senescent edges, 3 days after withholding watering, and leaf rolling was not observed. No significant difference was found in fresh weight after 3 days of treatments (not shown). Sugarcane cultivars with contrasting tolerance to drought, as RB 867515 (higher tolerance) and RB855536 (low tolerance), showed both leaf rolling and senescence after the second day of stress <xref rid="pone.0114744-Ferreira1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, suggesting that SP70-1143 cultivar responds in a similar timing, although possibly using different strategies to avoid drought.</p><p>To answer whether water conditions would affect plant colonization by <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic>, qRT-PCR of ribosomal RNA (23S rRNA) was performed in order to detect <italic>Gluconacetobacter</italic> genera in all treatments after 3 days under water deficit. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, relative expression of <italic>Gluconacetobacter</italic> 23S rRNA indicated the presence of high numbers of bacteria in inoculated root samples compared to non-inoculated samples, validating the successful plant colonization. Interestingly, inoculated root samples of SP70-1143, after 3 days under water deficit (WD+GD), showed 23S rRNA levels 3-fold higher than inoculated roots with normal watering conditions (GD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). By contrast, inoculated shoot samples subjected or not to water deficit (WD+GD or GD) did not show a significant expression of 23S rRNA, indicating that under these experimental conditions, the bacteria do not colonize shoot tissues efficiently. The data suggests that drought stress could lead to higher colonization rates by <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> in root tissues of sugarcane cultivar SP70-1134. As the aim of this work is to address the early responses to drought in plants colonized with <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic>, samples 3 days after treatments were chosen to be further analyzed.</p><p>Next, to investigate the impact of a prolonged water deficit to sugarcane cv.

While non-inoculated SP70-1143 plants died after a month withholding watering, plants inoculated with the beneficial diazotroph survived, albeit with visibly shorter shoots compared to inoculated plants normally watered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). As the analysis showed high levels of <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> colonization in plants under water deficit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), the data indicates that sugarcane cv SP70-1143 plants colonized with <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> become more tolerant to drought stress than non-inoculated plants.</p><p>Drought tolerance promoted by the interaction of diazotrophs, such as <italic>Azospirillum brasilense</italic>, and grasses, such as wheat, maize and rice, were already reported.

Between 19 and 26 million 100 bp single-end reads were obtained from each of the eight cDNA libraries derived from the sugarcane SP70-1143 samples. The sequences of low quality were removed using quality trimming and quality filtering. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0114744-t002">Table 2</xref> shows the number of reads retained after each processing step, which were used to perform <italic>de novo</italic> assembly. In order to generate a sugarcane reference transcriptome suitable to this study, two assemblies were performed, both using the VELVET transcriptome assembler <xref rid="pone.0114744-Zerbino1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> in combination with OASES <xref rid="pone.0114744-Schulz1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The first assembly, called R1, was the sequencing result from a previous sugarcane transcriptome experiment, using root and shoot tissues of two sugarcane genotypes, with different efficiencies of BNF: SP70-1143 (high BNF) and Chunee (low BNF). The second assembly, R2, was performed during this work, using the sequencing result of the eight cDNA libraries derived from the four different treatments. A reference transcriptome was obtained combining R1 and R2. To avoid redundancy, CD-HIT <xref rid="pone.0114744-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> was used to search for similar sequences between both assemblies, with a threshold of 0.95. A total of 95,946 unique transcripts were detected from R2, and combined to 116,384 transcripts from R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Between 50 to 55% of mapped reads matched several positions on the RT2, indicating a high percentage of non-unique read mappings in each library. In this case, the read mapping tool was assigning each read randomly to a transcript. Due to this random effect, it was possible to infer mistaken differences in expression for transcripts of the same locus. To avoid this issue, the longest transcript was selected to represent one locus. Using one transcript per locus, these reads were all used to quantify a single sequence per locus. With this procedure, 30,298 loci were obtained from R2 and 88,927 from R1, generating a total of 119,225 sequences in the Sugarcane Reference Transcriptome (RT2). Transcriptome sequences were evaluated against Viridiplantae proteins in the PLAZA 2.5 database using a BLASTX search <xref rid="pone.0114744-VanBel1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. An E-value cutoff threshold of 1e-05 was considered to define a significant hit. A total of 60,376 sugarcane sequences produced a hit against any plant. Of these, 54,747 produced a hit against a monocot proteome database (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> ssp indica, <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> ssp. japonica, <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>, <italic>Brachypodium dystachion</italic> or <italic>Zea mays</italic>). A group of 58,849 loci did not map with plant databases. Since their sequences are mostly very short, these loci are probably parts of real transcripts that could not be merged in the assembly.

Therefore, to infer gene functions for the sugarcane transcriptome, it was used the TRAPID tool <xref rid="pone.0114744-VanBel2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> and functional annotation based on best BLAST hit searches against <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> protein databases. TRAPID is a user-friendly web tool that allows functional and comparative analyses for <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome data sets. The RT2 was loaded into TRAPID and processed for sequence similarity searches against reference monocot proteins and gene families (GF). From the total of 119,225 sequences, with an average sequence length of 550.9 bp, 27% presented a full-length or quasi full-length transcript, according to TRAPID meta-annotation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). TRAPID found a total of 9,102 GF, 6,244 InterPro domains and 4,065 GO terms in the RT2, which included 55.1% genes in GF, 46.9% with protein domain and 43.6% with GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). This data shows that it was possible to infer functions for at least 50% of the genes from the total RT2, despite the presence of many partial gene sequences.</p><p>Trough best BLAST hit searches against <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>O. sativa</italic> protein sequences, a functional MapMan mapping for putative sugarcane genes was created. The functional mapping generated a reference file that was uploaded on MapMan software <xref rid="pone.0114744-Thimm1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> in order to visualize diagrams of metabolic pathways and other processes in the datasets. The functional contribution of each assembly, R1 and R2, in the final generation of RT2 is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0114744.s002">Figure S2</xref>. The major contribution of R2 that is common to all tree datasets, in both roots and shoots, was seen in protein (3&#x02013;6%), RNA (2&#x02013;5%), signaling (2&#x02013;3%), development (1&#x02013;2%), transport (1&#x02013;2%) and stress (1&#x02013;2%) classes. The overall expression profiles of genetic regulation between roots and shoots in a same comparison, observed trough MapMan viewer, were strongly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g003">Figure 3</xref>), despite the number of DEG being very similar between root and shoot comparisons, except in <italic>Drought</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0114744-t004">Table 4</xref>). This result supports the empirical knowledge that plant tissues respond differently to environmental cues. Also, the fact that only in <italic>Drought</italic> the numbers of DEG are much higher in shoots than in roots might suggest that, in SP70-1143 plants under drought condition, shoots are more exposed to transcription regulation than roots, which could be related to evidences that shoot growth is more responsive to water deficit than root <xref rid="pone.0114744-Hsiao1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114744-Sharp1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0114744-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0114744.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>MapMan overview of differentially expressed genes in sugarcane SP70-1143 colonized or not with <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> and subjected to water deficit.</title><p>MapMan &#x02018;regulation overview&#x02019; of differentially expressed genes (DEG) from roots and shoots in two dataset comparisons: <italic>Bacteria&#x00026;Drought</italic> and <italic>Drought</italic>.

As very little is known about the molecular responses to water deficit of sugarcane plants free of diazotrophic bacteria, a drought transcript profile was first determined in diazotroph-free sugarcane cv.SP70-1143 plants.

Some of the most referenced gene markers that are generally regulated in abiotic stresses, i.e. the TFs ERF (Ethylene Response Factor, subfamily of ERF/AP2), CBF/DREB (Dehydration Response Element, subfamily of ERF/AP2), ERD (Early Responsive to Dehydration), RD (Response to Dehydration) and genes related to ABA pathway <xref rid="pone.0114744-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114744-Mizoi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114744-Taji1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, were annotated in SP70-1143 under water deficit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0114744-t005">Table 5</xref>).

ABA1 has a role in the first step of ABA biosynthesis; and NCED3 is a key gene in ABA biosynthesis that acts later on in the pathway catalyzing the carotenoid cleavage to form xanthoxin <xref rid="pone.0114744-Behnam1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. ABA signaling and response also seemed to be activated in roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g007">Figure 7</xref>), since members of ABA-insensitive (ABI) and AREB/ABF family of TF that regulate ABA responses were upregulated.

In contrast, ABA responses operating in SP70-1143 shoots under 3-days of water deficit were less clear. Several ABA signaling and response genes seemed to be activated in shoots, such as PYL8, a member of PYR1/PYL/RCAR family of ABA receptors, as well as two transcripts homologues to AREB3 and the drought molecular markers HAI3/PP2C, HVA22E and RD22A. ABA2 (encoding a zeaxanthin epoxidase) that is an intermediate of ABA biosynthesis was also upregulated in shoots. Nevertheless, several NCED family members were downregulated suggesting that ABA synthesis decreased in the shoots subjected to water deficit. This decrease was also supported by downregulation of several members of the ABA-aldehyde oxidase (AAO) gene family, including AAO3 which is known to catalyze the final step in abscisic acid biosynthesis in leaves, and downregulation of the ABA signaling gene ABI3 <xref rid="pone.0114744-Seo1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that PYL8, as well as HVA22F and RD22A were upregulated in shoots under water deficit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).Taking together, the data suggest that ABA signaling and response seem to be activated both in roots and shoots of non-inoculated SP70-1143 plants subjected to 3 days of water deficit, while ABA biosynthesis seems mostly activated in roots, compared to watered plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0114744.s005">Table S3</xref>).</p><p>ET biosynthesis appeared to be increased both in roots and shoots under drought stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This was suggested by the upregulation of key genes in the pathway, such as several homologs of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO) and, in roots, of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase 6 (ACS6), confirmed by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g004">Figure 4</xref>). ET synthesis begins with the formation of S-Adenosylmethionine (S-AdoMet) through methionine's catalysis by SAM synthetase. S-AdoMet can be converted to the immediate precursor of ET, ACC, by ACS. ACO acts on the final step on ET synthesis, using ACC as substrate. Both ACS and ACO are encoded by multigene families that can be regulated transcriptionally by biotic and abiotic stresses. Nonetheless, S-AdoMet can work as methyl group donor for nucleic acids, proteins and lipids and also as precursor in the polyamine synthesis pathway, which makes the conversion of S-AdoMet to ACC a crucial and rate-limiting step in ET biosynthesis <xref rid="pone.0114744-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. In that case, high levels of ACS transcripts induced by stresses, such as drought, can be better associated with ET production <xref rid="pone.0114744-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114744-Achard1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. ET signal transduction and response also appeared to be increased in <italic>Drought</italic> datasets. This was shown especially by the downregulation, in shoots, of two transcripts with homology to the ethylene receptor EIN4, a negative regulator of ET signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g007">Figure 7</xref>); and by the upregulation of several TFs involved in ET perception and signal transduction. Lower EIN4 mRNA levels were also identified by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), corroborating the RNAseq data. In the signaling pathway most DEG belonged to the AP2/ERF superfamily of TFs, which suggests that ET responses were regulated in non-inoculated SP70-1143 under water deficit. At least 12 DEG classified as AP2/ERF TFs were equally upregulated in roots and shoots of SP70-1143 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g007">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0114744.s005">Table S3</xref>). ERF proteins act primarily as regulators of transcription; having a possible role in responses to biotic and abiotic stresses as well as in development and metabolism <xref rid="pone.0114744-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114744-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>.

The induced levels of expression of ERF12 and TINY under drought conditions were validated by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g004">Figure 4</xref>).downregulatedThus the results suggest that in root and shoot of non-inoculated SP70-1143 subjected to water deficit, ethylene biosynthesis, signaling and responses are activated.</p><p>Auxin biosynthesis and responses appeared to be activated in roots of non-inoculated SP70-1143 under water deficit. YUCCA genes, which encode an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of IAA from indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) <xref rid="pone.0114744-Korasick1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, were induced in root's <italic>Drought</italic> dataset. Members of the GH3 and SAUR families were also upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g007">Figure 7</xref>) and the increased mRNA levels of SAUR24 were confirmed by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). It is already described that both GH3 and SAUR genes are auxin transcriptionally inducible genes <xref rid="pone.0114744-Ljung1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114744-Woodward1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. The GH3 family includes genes involved in auxin conjugation <xref rid="pone.0114744-Ljung1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, and the function of SAUR-family genes is still unknown <xref rid="pone.0114744-Woodward1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. A greater number of genes involved in auxin biosynthesis, signaling and response were regulated in shoots of non-inoculated SP70-1143 under water deficit, compared with the auxin profile in roots. Auxin biosynthesis in shoots seemed to be mostly decreased during water deficit, which was suggested by the repression of YUCCA and CYP genes. Another route of auxin synthesis in plants is the indole-3-acetonitrile (IAOx) pathway. IAOx is produced through L-tryptophan by the action of several cytochrome P450s (CYP), and it is subsequently converted to indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN) <xref rid="pone.0114744-Korasick1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. This molecule is the substrate of the reaction catalyzed by nitrilases (NIT) leading to the production of the auxin IAA <xref rid="pone.0114744-Korasick1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g007">Figure 7</xref>, although one NIT2 gene was upregulated in SP70-1143 shoots, the CYP gene, responsible for the production of the substrate of the NIT reaction was downregulated. One important point of regulation of the auxin pathway is the auxin homeostasis, and this mechanism appeared to be operating in shoots under water deficit. Although plant hormone homeostasis depends on its biosynthesis, IAA conjugation with carbohydrates, amino acids or peptides contribute to this process, and IAA conjugate forms are generally considered inactive <xref rid="pone.0114744-Korasick1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Conjugate hydrolysis is also a mechanism involved in the conversion to active auxin <xref rid="pone.0114744-Korasick1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. UDP glucosyltransferases (UGT) genes, which conjugate IAA to glucose, were downregulated in shoots, as well as most of the ILL/ILR genes, involved in hydrolysis of IAA-amino acid conjugates in <italic>Drought</italic> dataset <xref rid="pone.0114744-Korasick1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. The regulation of auxin signaling in SP70-1143 shoots after 3 days of water deficit was not so clear. While auxin receptors as AFB5 and ABP1 <xref rid="pone.0114744-Ljung1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, negative regulators of the pathway, were downregulated, the auxin signaling repressor AUX/IAA31 <xref rid="pone.0114744-Ljung1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref> was induced, which could result in an inhibition of some shoot responses regulated by auxin. While GH3 family members were transcriptionally repressed in SP70-1143 shoots in response to water deficit, most of SAUR genes were induced. The increased mRNA levels of AUX/IAA31 and SAUR71 in shoots were confirmed by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), The results indicate that shoots and roots present different profiles of regulation in SP70-1143 plants subjected to water deficit, and. auxin signaling is not very responsive to this stress in root. On the other hand, auxin biosynthesis, hydrolysis of auxin conjugates, as well as auxin signaling seem to be actively regulated in shoots under water deficit, being mainly repressed.</p><p>Altogether, analyses of DEG enrichment and drought molecular markers suggest that non-inoculated sugarcane cv. SP70-1143 responds to water deficit stress by the activation of well-known drought-responsive markers, as well as by the induction of hormone pathways well known to be involved in drought stress, such as ABA and ET. The decreased enrichment of GO terms related to development in shoots, together with downregulation of auxin pathway in shoots, suggest that one possible strategy adopted by sugarcane cv. SP70-1143 to try to tolerate drought might involve modulation of development, by restraining growth in shoots, while possibly improving growth in roots.

This repression was indicated by the downregulation of positive regulators of ABA biosynthesis, such as NCED3, ABA2 and ABA3, and of several members of the AAO gene family, including the key element AAO3 <xref rid="pone.0114744-Seo1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. ABA signaling also seemed repressed in roots in the <italic>Bacteria&#x00026;Drought</italic> comparison, which was deduced from the downregulation of key regulators in almost every step in the ABA signal transduction, such as putative homologs of the ABA receptors (GCR2 and PYL8),), PP2C, SnRK2, AREBs and several HVA22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g007">Figure 7</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that ABA2, PYL8 and HVA22F mRNA levels were downregulated in root or shoot of <italic>Bacteria&#x00026;</italic>Drought dataset, and showed a different expression pattern compared to <italic>Drought</italic> datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The data suggests that in roots of SP70-1143 plants inoculated with <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> and under 3 days of water deficit, ABA biosynthesis, signaling and response are mostly inhibited when compared to non inoculated sugarcane in the same abiotic conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0114744.s005">Table S3</xref>).</p><p>Members of ACS and ACO gene families, positive regulators of ET biosynthesis that are induced in the <italic>Drought dataset</italic>, were inhibited in <italic>Bacteria&#x00026;Drought</italic> datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The reduced mRNA levels of ACS6 and ACO were confirmed by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Negative regulators of ET signaling, such as ET receptors ETR1, ERS1 and EIN4 and Constitutive Triple Response 1 (CTR1), were repressed in roots, which could indicate an activation of the pathway. However, it has been shown that mRNA levels of ET receptors and CTR1 are increased in the presence of ET <xref rid="pone.0114744-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. As ET synthesis was apparently reduced in <italic>Bacteria&#x00026;Drought</italic>, it is possible that the lack of ET could cause a reduction of ET receptors in roots. Similarly, transcription of positive key regulators in ET signaling was also repressed in roots from <italic>Bacteria&#x00026;Drought</italic>, suggesting that the ET pathway was not activated. This can be seen by the downregulation of the positive regulators EIN2 and EIN3-like, and ET response factors members as ERF1, ERF3 and ERF12, as well as members of DREB family of TF such as TINY2 and DREB1A/CBF3. The reduced levels of EIN4, EIN2, ERF12 and TINY were validated by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114744-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

In the present work, the study of the interaction of sugarcane cv SP70-1143 with the diazotrophic bacteria, <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic>, provided first insights of how beneficial associations with nitrogen-fixating bacteria could affect plant metabolism to improve stress response and survival of host plants.The results showed, for the first time, that <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> can improve drought tolerance in sugarcane cv. SP70-1143, prolonging its survival even after 40 days withholding water. RNA-seq data, corroborated by qRT-PCR expression analysis, showed that several molecular and biochemical responses to water deficit were differentially regulated when plants were colonized by the beneficial diazotrophic bacteria compared to plants free of bacteria. This was clearly shown by the opposite ABA and ET signal transduction responses to drought, mainly downregulated in SP70-1143 inoculated plants and upregulated without the bacteria's presence. We can hypothesize that SP70-1143 has its early drought responses partially inhibited because <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> might be softening plant stress in several aspects. Thus, the divergent transcriptome profile in <italic>Bacteria&#x00026;Drought</italic> compared to <italic>Drought</italic> dataset could reflect gene expression in a less stressed plant.</p><p>A major challenge is to unravel the mechanisms regulated by colonization with <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> that are in fact mediating the drought tolerance conferred to SP70-1143. Transcriptomic and physiological data suggest that SP70-1143 might modulate development, restraining shoot growth while possibly improving root growth, in order to overcome stress; but not when associated with <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic>. Downregulation of the complete auxin pathway in roots when the diazotrophic bacteria are present supports this hypothesis, since this hormone is a positive regulator of root growth. Also, colonization with <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> seems to shift SP70-1143 gene expression during drought stress to specific ABA-dependent responses. TFs specifically activated in shoots from inoculated plants under drought conditions, which participate in ABA-dependent signaling, were identified and could act as key elements in the drought resistance conferred by <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> to SP70-1143.</p><p>The present work describes the initial events that may trigger the sugarcane drought tolerance promoted by <italic>G.diazotrophicus</italic> inoculation.

As a second cutoff, only those genes with |Log<sub>2</sub>FC|&#x02267;1, a difference of expression at least 2-fold higher or lower than the control, were selected as differentially expressed. To better select the genes related to plant response to water deficit only when associated with bacteria, loci that had an overlap between <italic>Bacteria&#x00026;Drought</italic> and <italic>Drought</italic> or <italic>Bacteria</italic> comparisons, for shoot or root tissues, were removed from <italic>Bacteria&#x00026;Drought</italic> datasets using a Venn Diagram (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/">http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/</ext-link>), leaving a dataset of genes uniquely regulated by bacteria during water deficit.</p><p>To assign a function to each sugarcane gene, RT2 sequences were searched against <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> proteins databases and best BLAST hits were retained (E-value&#x0003c;1e-05). A MapMan reference mapping was created with <italic>A. thaliana</italic> bincodes and using the <italic>O. sativa</italic> genomic database to complement the functional annotation. This mapping was uploaded on the MapMan platform, together with lists of DEG, in order to visualize diagrams of metabolic pathways or other processes.</p><p>Functions of differentially expressed genes (as Arabidopsis or Rice homologous) from both pairwise comparisons were visualized using MapMan <xref rid="pone.0114744-Thimm1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the PageMan visualization tool <xref rid="pone.0114744-Usadel1" ref-type="bibr">[103]</xref> with Bin-wise Wilcoxon test, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR multiple testing correction and 1.0 as ORA cutoff. TRAPID <xref rid="pone.0114744-VanBel2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> was used to assign annotations and Gene Ontology (GO) terms to the predicted genes of Sugarcane SP70-1143. TRAPID was also used to detect open reading frames and frameshift correction in each transcript, which was useful to design specific sugarcane primers. The final Sugarcane Reference Transcriptome (RT2) was loaded to the TRAPID database, which uses the PLAZA 2.5 database <xref rid="pone.0114744-VanBel1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/">http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/</ext-link>, to assign functions based on sequence similarity. If the length of a transcript was not strongly different than the average protein length of the gene family it was assigned to, it received the label &#x0201c;Quasi Full Length&#x0201d; as meta-annotation. When a transcript was assigned as &#x0201c;Quasi Full Length&#x0201d;, and its associated ORF had both a start and stop codon, than the meta annotation was changed to &#x0201c;Full Length&#x0201d;. To add gene families and functional annotations to each transcript, the sequences from the final RT were processed using the following pipeline for similarity searches: &#x0201c;phylogenetic clades&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;monocots&#x0201d; (database type), 10e-2 (e-value), &#x0201c;gene families&#x0201d; (gene family type) and &#x0201c;transfer from both gene family and best hit&#x0201d; (functional annotation type). DEG from each comparison (<italic>Drought</italic> and <italic>Bacteria&#x00026;Drought</italic> for shoot and root) were set as subsets on TRAPID to distinguish them in the entire RT. GO enrichment analysis was done based on the dataset compared to a background (p-value&#x0003c;0.05). Hierarchical clustering was done using Genesis software (version 1.6.0 beta1), with Pearson correlation and Average linkage clustering (between genes and experiments) <xref rid="pone.0114744-Sturn1" ref-type="bibr">[104]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>RNA expression by qRT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA isolated from roots and shoots were treated with DNAse I (Biolabs). Reverse transcription was made using Super-Script III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers as primer, according to the manufacturers instruction. To analyze gene expression, qRT-PCR reactions were performed with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). To each well, 2.5 &#x000b5;L of 1&#x000d7; diluted first strand cDNA, 5 &#x000b5;L of SYBR Green solution, 0.9 &#x000b5;L of the forward primer (10 &#x000b5;M) and 0.9 &#x000b5;L of reverse primer (10 &#x000b5;M) were added, along with 0,7 &#x000b5;L of sterile, ultrapure water to bring the final volume to 10 &#x000b5;L in each well. qRT-PCR was performed using Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems, under standard conditions. The constitutive plant 28S ribosomal RNA (28S rRNA) was used as reference gene. To confirm bacteria colonization in plant inoculated tissues, specific primers were designed for amplification of <italic>G. diazotrophicus</italic> 23S rRNA. To validate the expression pattern of differentially expressed transcripts identified in the RNA-seq analysis, 15 specific primers were designed with Primer Express software (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0114744.s008">Table S6</xref>). The sequence used for primer design of each transcript was carefully selected in order to be specific to each putative gene. To accomplish that, the sequence of interest was aligned to the NCBI sugarcane database, to the currently available sugarcane reference transcriptome, and to other sugarcane transcripts annotated with the same function in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> or <italic>O. sativa</italic>. Only sugarcane transcripts with specific regions were selected for validation. For each sample (a pool of three plants), reactions were performed with three technical replicates, and with two biological replicates. The results of qRT-PCR were analyzed using &#x00394;Ct quantitative method according to Livak and Schimittgen <xref rid="pone.0114744-Livak1" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref>.
