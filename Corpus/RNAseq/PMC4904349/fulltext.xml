However, undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells share few properties with mature neurons. In this study, we present an optimized neuronal differentiation protocol for SH-SY5Y that requires only two work steps and 6 days. After differentiation, the cells present increased levels of ATP and plasma membrane activity but reduced expression of energetic stress response genes. Differentiation results in reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased robustness toward perturbations with 6-hydroxydopamine. We are convinced that the presented differentiation method will leverage genetic and chemical high-throughput screening projects targeting pathways that are involved in the selective vulnerability of neurons with high energetic stress levels.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SH-SY5Y</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>energetic stress</kwd><kwd>vulnerability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1087057115625190"><title>Introduction</title><p>Studies aiming to understand relationships between molecular and cellular events typically require large numbers of genetic or environmental perturbations. Compound as well as genetic screens are increasingly demanded approaches for systems biology studies targeting multifactorial neurodegenerative diseases. The interpretability of results, however, depends on experimental reproducibility and controllability. In a recent publication, we analyzed the whole genomic sequence of SH-SY5Y, presented RNAseq and proteomics datasets for undifferentiated cells, and provided network analysis tools for the evaluation of cell line suitability in the context of genetic perturbation studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> This information provides a solid base for experimental design and data interpretation. The ability of SH-SY5Y cells to differentiate to a neuronal phenotype further leverages their potential for screening projects in neuroscience.</p><p>SH-SY5Y cells are a subclone of the SK-N-SH cell line, which was originally established from a bone marrow biopsy of a 4-year-old female neuroblastoma patient and is presumed to arise from neural crest cells. The SH-SY5Y cell line has been described to produce both substrate adherent (S-type) and neuroblastic (N-type) cells that can undergo transdifferentiation.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Therefore, even though the SH-SY5Y cell line is derived from triple successive subclone selection of N-type cells, it contains a small proportion of S-type cells. Several differentiation protocols have been developed in order to optimize the properties of SH-SY5Y as a neuronal cell culture model.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The most widely accepted are differentiation protocols involving treatments with retinoic acid (RA), and it has been reported that the established effects of RA on neuronal differentiation can be further enhanced by the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> As retinoic acid has known effects on mitochondria and energy metabolism,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and as mitochondrial dysfunction is supposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, we studied whether differentiation might affect the resilience of SH-SY5Y toward energetic stress. Indeed, cellular vulnerability and underlying energetic stress are important model properties for research in Parkinson&#x02019;s disease. Mainly neurons with high energetic stress levels are affected in this disorder.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In contrast, undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells have a low metabolic rate and can adapt their metabolism according to available substrates.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Here, we introduce an optimized differentiation protocol for SH-SY5Y cells and study related changes in neuronal marker fingerprints, energy homeostasis, and oxidative vulnerability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section2-1087057115625190"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="section3-1087057115625190"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>SH-SY5Y (cat.

P96GC-1.5.5-F, MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and immediately fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at pH 7.4. After 1 min washing in PBS, the cells were permeabilized for 5 min in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and again washed 3&#x000d7; for 10 min in PBS. Next, the samples were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% goat serum in PBS. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin (TUJ1, 1/100; neurofilament [NF], 1/100; Tom20, FL-145, cat. sc-11415, Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany, 1/100) and incubated together with permeabilized cells for 1 h at room temperature before being removed via 3&#x000d7; 10 min washing in PBS. For the binding of secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 555 (cat. A21422, Invitrogen, 1/100) or Alexa 488 (cat. A11008, Invitrogen, 1/100), samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature before being washed 3&#x000d7; for 10 min in PBS. For mounting, Fluoroshield medium (cat. F6057, Sigma-Aldrich) containing DAPI was used. Images were acquired on an Opera QEHS microscope (PerkinElmer, Hamburg, Germany), using a 20&#x000d7; water immersion objective (NA 0.7). DAPI was excited with a 405 nm laser and detected behind a 450/50 nm bandpass filter. Alexa 488 was excited with a 488 nm laser and detected behind a 520/35 nm bandpass filter. Alexa 555 was excited with a 561 nm laser and detected behind a 600/40 nm bandpass filter. Of note, all washing steps were pipetted at low speed and cell drying, leading to cell detachment was avoided.</p><p>Image analysis was done in Matlab R2013b (The MathWorks, Natick, MA). For each field of view and channel, the five acquired planes were maximum projected to a single plane. Masks for nuclei and cytoplasma were computed via thresholding, and small objects with an area below 250 pixels were removed. The mask for mitochondria was constructed from a flat-field-corrected mitochondria image highlighting local contrast information. For flat field correction, a Gaussian blurred image of mitochondria was subtracted from the corresponding maximum projection. Next, the mitochondrial mask was computed via thresholding and by restricting the area of interest to the cell area, which is defined as the union of nuclei and cytoplasma masks. Segmentation of cell bodies is based on the following rule set: (1) cell bodies lie within perinuclear zones, (2) cell bodies lie within the cell mask, and (3) at least some mitochondria are present within the perinuclear zone. The perinuclear zone was computed via dilatation of the nuclei mask using a disk-shaped structuring element. The presence of mitochondria was detected via thresholding on maximum projections. Furthermore, the raw cell body mask was filtered with a median filter in order to remove pixel noise. Boolean operations were used to define the cell periphery and to assign mitochondrial area to either cell body or periphery. The plotted variables were defined per field of view as follows: (1) Neurite growth corresponds to the ratio between the sum of periphery pixels and the sum of cell body pixels. (2) The area of mitochondria per cell corresponds to the ratio between the sum of mitochondrial pixels and the sum of cell mask pixels. (3) The area of mitochondria per nucleus is defined as the ratio between the sum of mitochondrial pixels and the sum of nuclei mask pixels. (4) Mitochondrial distribution is defined as the ratio between the sum of mitochondrial pixels in the periphery and the sum of mitochondrial pixels in the cell body.</p></sec><sec id="section7-1087057115625190"><title>Analysis of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and 6-Hydroxydopamine Perturbations</title><p>6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, Sigma-Aldrich, H4381) solutions (10 mM) were freshly prepared in antioxidant saline corresponding to water supplemented with 0.9% NaCl and 0.2% ascorbic acid. The cells were perturbed with 25, 100, or 200 &#x000b5;M 6-OHDA and incubated for 24 h at 37 &#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Nuclei were stained with 1 &#x000b5;g/mL Hoechst 34580 (Invitrogen, H21486), membranes with 0.5&#x000d7; CellMask Deep Red (Invitrogen, C10046), and active mitochondria with 10 nM tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM, Invitrogen, T-668), allowing us to analyze mitochondrial membrane potential according to the TMRM subquenching method, where an increase in fluorescence indicates an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential. After staining for 1 h at 37 &#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, the media were replaced with fresh media containing appropriate 6-OHDA concentrations and TMRM, but no Hoechst and CellMask. Images were acquired on an Opera QEHS microscope (PerkinElmer, Hamburg, Germany). Hoechst and CellMask were measured in a simultaneous exposure, using a double excitation with 405 and 640 nm lasers. Hoechst was detected behind a 450/50 nm bandpass filter and CellMask behind a 690/70 nm bandpass filter. In a second exposure, TMRM was excited with a 561 nm laser and detected behind a 600/40 nm bandpass filter.</p><p>Image analysis was done with Matlab 2013b (illustrated in <bold>Suppl.

For cell segmentation, the CellMask channel was flat field corrected and thresholded according to the Otsu method.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The threshold value returned from the Otsu method was further reduced in order to automate the recognition of dim cell areas. This optimization problem was solved in iterative steps that analyzed the binary masks returned from image thresholding. The algorithm works according to the following rules: The mask for differentiated cells is allowed to become two times larger than the initial Otsu mask and four times larger than the nuclei mask. For undifferentiated cells, the area is only allowed to become 1.25 times larger than the Otsu mask and 2.5 times larger than the nuclei mask derived from the Hoechst staining. Mitochondria were segmented as described above. Average TMRM intensities were computed for both segmented mitochondrial pixels and cellular pixels, as described in the results.</p><p>The same images were also used for manual analysis of cells with connected neurites. Cell counts were derived from the Hoechst channel, and neurite connectivity was analyzed in the CellMask channel. Only cells with visible neurites, connecting via these neurites to other cells, were considered as cells with connected neurites. The metric &#x0201c;morphologically defined differentiation efficiency&#x0201d; is the difference between cells with connected neurites in differentiated and undifferentiated cells, expressed in percent.</p></sec><sec id="section8-1087057115625190"><title>ATP Assay</title><p>For the analysis of ATP levels, cells were seeded at a density of 20,000 cells per well in CellCarrier-96 plates (cat. 6005550, PerkinElmer). Before starting the ATP assay, the amount of cells was quantified via Hoechst staining and fluorescence microscopy. Briefly, nuclei were stained using 125 ng/mL Hoechst 34580 (cat. H21486, Invitrogen) and fluorescent images were acquired on an Opera QEHS microscope (PerkinElmer), using a 10&#x000d7; objective (NA 0.4). For normalization against uneven cellular distribution within a well, 47 fields of view covering the total area of the well were acquired. To cover both flat and elevated nuclei at each position, <italic>z</italic> stacks with three planes at a distance of 7.7 &#x000b5;m between each plane were acquired. Hoechst fluorescence was excited with a 405 nm laser, and the emission was detected behind a 450/50 nm bandpass filter.</p><p>Image analysis was performed in Matlab 2013b. First, the three planes available for each field of view and channel were maximum projected. Nuclei were highlighted with a white 15-pixel large top-hat filter. To reduce noise in the resulting images, a Gaussian filter of size 5 &#x000d7; 5 pixels with a standard deviation &#x003c3; = 2 was applied. An approximate nuclei mask was then created by applying a fixed threshold. Small pixel noise objects were removed by erosion with a two-pixel-radius disk-shaped structuring element. The resulting mask was used for morphological reconstruction of the nuclei mask described above.</p><p>For ATP assays, the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay kit (cat. G7571, Promega, Leiden, Netherlands) was used. CellTiter-Glo reagent was prepared according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions and luminescence was measured in white Costar 96-well plates (cat. 3912, Corning, Amsterdam, Netherlands) using a Synergy Mx monochromator microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) with an integration time of 1 s. The average nucleus area per cell for each of undifferentiated and differentiated cells was determined manually. Luminescence data were transformed to quantitative ATP data by integrating ATP titrations. Finally, the number of nuclei was estimated by dividing total nucleus areas by average nucleus areas. The ratio between titrated ATP level and cell number corresponds to average quantities of ATP per cell.</p></sec><sec id="section9-1087057115625190"><title>Cell Proliferation Assay</title><p>Cell proliferation was quantified using Celltrace Violet (cat.

For staining, cells were incubated with 1 &#x000b5;M Celltrace Violet in PBS for 20 min at 37 &#x000b0;C. Excess staining was quenched with five sample volumes of complete growth medium (DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% P/S) and washed away. The stained cells were plated on six-well plates at a density of 300,000 cells per well and differentiated as shown in the results. Prior to cytometry, the cells were detached with trypsin. Trypsinization was blocked with complete growth medium, and cells were resuspended in PBS.

Available experimental models range from purely molecular systems to cell culture, brain slice culture, and animal models. Cells are the simplest models that allow us to study relations between molecular events and cellular physiology. Primary cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and their differentiated daughter cells are a good choice for projects that aim to study complex individual traits. However, available sample sizes are typically limited and investments required for sustainable isogenic screening are high. For screening projects, however, the availability of large amounts of phenotypically homogenous cells with identical genetic background is a prerequisite. SH-SY5Y cells meet these criteria, and the characterization of this cell line further leverages educated experimental design and data interpretation. A further advantage of SH-SY5Y cells is the possibility for neuronal differentiation. Considering differentiation under RA treatment, a reported caveat is that substrate adherent S-type cells do not differentiate but continue dividing and tend to overgrow neuroblastic N-type cells.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> This lack of N-type selective pressure in RA-only differentiation can at least in part be explained with transdifferentiation and selection of dividing S-type cells, resulting in heterogeneous cultures that are a suboptimal choice if homogenous neuronal cultures are required.

Human primary embryonic neurons raise ethical concerns and once terminally differentiated are postmitotic. Thereby the number of available cells becomes a limiting factor for explorative screens. Considering that we decided to grow SH-SY5Y cells up to passage ATCC+15 before starting differentiation, and used splitting ratios of 1/4 during passaging, SH-SY5Y cultures can be scaled up to 4<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> times the number of live cells in an original ATCC freezing stock. In contrast to SH-SY5Y, IPS-derived neurons provide low differentiation efficiencies and therefore require neuronal counterstaining and filtering during image analysis. The main disadvantage in this scenario is that counterstaining requires a fluorescence channel and thereby limits the possibilities for other cell physiological readouts in high-content screening. An advantage compared to other fast differentiation models such as LUHMES cells<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> is the compatibility with uncoated plates, leveraging applications such as automated cell culture and high-content screening.</p></sec><sec id="section17-1087057115625190"><title>Evaluation of Neuronal Differentiation</title><p>The analysis of neuronal markers shows two major characteristics of SH-SY5Y maturation: a reduced expression of premature markers and an increased expression of synaptic markers.

To leverage future screening studies investigating mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases, we aimed not only to optimize existing neuronal differentiation methods for high-content screening but also to mainly characterize the differentiated cells in the context of energetic vulnerability. Our hypothesis was that neuronal maturation might increase the energetic stress level in SH-SY5Y, and that this stress might increase the sensitivity toward mitochondrial perturbations. Analyzed key parameters related to neuronal energy homeostasis were the expression of mitochondrial genes, ATP levels, and the electrical activity of the plasma membrane. The downregulation of mitochondrial stress response genes contrasting an increase in both ATP levels and electrical plasma membrane activity indicates that differentiation leads to a cell state with increased energetic needs and reduced ability to balance energetic stress situations via the classical mitochondrial stress response machinery. It has been reported that mitochondrial membrane potential and reserve capacity are increased in RA differentiated SH-SY5Y cells.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Similarly, for RA/BDNF differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, increased spare respiratory capacity and oxygen consumption rates were reported. This indicates intensified oxidative phosphorylation in differentiated SH-SY5Y.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In the context of elevated ATP levels and plasma membrane activity, this indicates an increased ATP production rather than a decreased ATP consumption rate in RA/BDNF differentiated SH-SY5Y. In addition, differentiated SH-SY5Y form networks with their extended neurites. Maintaining and expanding such networks has been reported to require increased ATP levels and increased control of mitochondrial transport.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Both the high ATP levels and the mitochondrial redistribution that we report in RA/BDNF differentiated SH-SY5Y cells are in line with these neuronal vulnerability features and show that differentiated SH-SY5Y cells might be better suited for studies related to neuronal vulnerability than undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells.</p><p>Increased LRRK2 expression is also in line with increased vulnerability for energetic stress. It has been proposed that LRRK2 might act as a negative regulator of autophagy,<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and hence the ability to remove defective mitochondria via autophagy might be reduced in differentiated SH-SY5Y.</p><p>Based on the finding that the expression of oxidative stress response genes is reduced after differentiation, we asked whether this phenomenon was also reported in brain-derived neurons. Indeed, the very high-energy consumption of healthy brain tissue suggests high expression levels of oxidative stress response genes. However, human tissue&#x02013;specific expression profiles from BioGPS show that whole brain expression levels of the stress response genes Park7, HSPA9, and TRAP1 are close to their respective average expression levels over all tissues. In the disease context, in contrast, the expression of oxidative stress response genes in the brain might be increased.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> SH-SY5Y cells are originally derived from bone marrow, the most frequent location of metastases in neuroblastoma.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Knowing that cancer cells escape from oxidative stress during metastasis, high expression levels of oxidative stress response genes can be expected in undifferentiated cells.</p></sec><sec id="section19-1087057115625190"><title>Vulnerability toward 6-OHDA</title><p>Reports concerning the vulnerability of RA differentiated cells toward oxidative stress are contradictory: One study reported no change in dopaminergic marker expression during differentiation but reduced sensitivity toward 6-OHDA perturbations.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Another study, in contrast, reported increased vulnerability toward 6-OHDA.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> It has been proposed that these contradictions could be due to different amounts and types of FBS in differentiation media.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> An advantage of the RA/BDNF differentiation presented here is that FBS is not required for the second phase of differentiation.</p><p>It is striking that 6-OHDA perturbations on undifferentiated cells cause moderate but significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential but no significant change in cell death. Differentiated cells, in contrast, die at high 6-OHDA concentrations. Indeed, the comparatively lower mitochondrial membrane potential in differentiated cells, revealed by our high-throughput TMRM assay, might exacerbate compensatory cell responses and increase their oxidative vulnerability compared to undifferentiated SH-SY5Y.</p><p>Indeed, selective vulnerability of neurons is believed to be an underlying factor of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, and therefore screening of metabolic modifiers is a promising approach for the discovery of disease-modifying compounds.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1087057115625190" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Furthermore, the genetics underlying selective neuronal vulnerability are not yet fully understood. However, it is widely accepted that many cell fate decisions related to neurodegeneration spare somatic cells but not energetically vulnerable neurons. We are convinced that genetic screens in energetically vulnerable SH-SY5Y will leverage the understanding of such selective neurodegeneration.</p><p>Our study consists of an optimization of the RA/BDNF differentiation protocol and the characterization of underlying mitochondrial changes and their impact on oxidative vulnerability. The accelerated and highly efficient differentiation protocol provides considerable advantages for studies, such as chemical or genetic screens that require large homogeneous cell populations.</p><p>Because differentiated SH-SY5Y cells present reduced expression of oxidative stress response genes, increased electrical plasma membrane activity, increased levels of ATP, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased robustness toward 6-OHDA perturbations, we conclude that differentiation triggers the transition from an oxidative stress&#x02013;resistant cell state to a neuronal cell state with increased energetic stress and oxidative vulnerability. In consequence, differentiated SH-SY5Y cells are better suited for studies related to neuronal energetic vulnerability than undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells.</p><p>The differentiation protocol in combination with the presented image analysis methods for the analysis of mitochondrial features provides a robust starting point for medium- and large-scale high-content screening projects.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="10.1177_1087057115625190_supp.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e880" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Thomas Knopfel from the Riken Institute, who kindly provided voltage-sensing protein constructs.
