We found that approximately 60&#x000a0;% of the transcriptome consists of ncRNAs transcribed from antisense and intergenic regions of the genome that were transcribed at lower levels than mRNA. In the transcriptome, a substantial number of long antisense ncRNAs (lancRNAs) are differentially expressed and enriched in carbohydrate and energy metabolism pathways. Furthermore, this enrichment is evolutionarily conserved, at least in yeast. Particularly, the mode of regulation of mRNA/lancRNA pairs is associated with mRNA transcription levels; the correlation between the pairs is positive at high mRNA transcriptional levels and negative at low levels. In addition, significant induction of mRNA and coverage of more than half of the mRNA sequence by a lancRNA strengthens the positive correlation between mRNA/lancRNA pairs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Transcriptome sequencing of <italic>K. marxianus</italic> in the exponential growth phase reveals pervasive transcription of ncRNAs with evolutionarily conserved functions.

These properties facilitate the development of efficient fermentation processes utilizing <italic>K. marxianus</italic>. As a result, this Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) species shows potential for use as a cell factory with high capability for improving biomass yields in industrially relevant biotechnological applications. For example, <italic>K. marxianus</italic> has been utilized for the reduction of lactose content in food products as well as for the production of ethanol, various enzymes, heterologous proteins, aromatic compounds, and bioingredients, and for bioremediation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>In order to engineer this species to be more suitable for use in various applications, genetic resources, such as its genome and transcriptome, are required at the genomic scale. <italic>K. marxianus</italic> is a member of the Saccharomycetales; however, the genetics and metabolism of this yeast are considered quite different from those of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> from an evolutionary point of view [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For instance, the mode of regulation of genes in the glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle pathways differs between the two yeast species, although they are largely conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In particular, regulatory mechanisms in metabolic networks governing carbon assimilation have not yet been explored. It has been established that transcriptional regulatory networks, comprising of transcription factors and other auxiliary components, control metabolic flexibility and robustness in response to environmental conditions. Therefore, a full understanding of the cellular response to growth conditions as well as the roles of cognate regulators, such as transcription factors, is necessary for the elucidation of changes in transcript levels of metabolic genes due to the effects of growth conditions.</p><p>Interestingly, genome-wide transcriptome analyses have demonstrated that the eukaryotic genome is pervasively transcribed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], e.g., more than 85&#x000a0;% of the genome of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is transcribed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This is due to a plethora of previously unannotated non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are pervasively transcribed from intergenic and antisense regions of annotated genes. As transcription requires a large amount of cellular energy, nonfunctional pervasive transcription may impose a metabolic and regulatory burden on cells. In accordance with this, diverse functions of ncRNAs, such as in the modulation of gene expression related with metabolism and pathogenesis, have been revealed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, there have been few reports on the functional characterization of ncRNAs in non-model yeast, despite accumulating evidence of the roles of regulatory ncRNAs in model organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The evolutionary conservation of antisense RNA (asRNA) has been reported between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces paradoxus,</italic> which are in the <italic>sensu stricto</italic> Saccharomycetales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Additionally, the evolutionary conservation of long asRNAs between five <italic>sensu stricto</italic> Saccharomycetales members and <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic> has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thus, the evolutionary conservation of pervasive ncRNA transcription in budding yeasts suggests that these ncRNAs perform important functions in these organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In order to examine the functions and extent of transcription of ncRNA, we analyzed the transcriptomic changes at three time points during the exponential growth phase in <italic>K. marxianus</italic> by conducting strand-specific RNA-seq. The results indicated pervasive ncRNA transcription in the exponential growth phase. Additionally, we performed enrichment analysis of differentially expressed transcripts to demonstrate that long antisense ncRNAs (lancRNAs) show functional associations with carbohydrate and energy metabolism. The correlation between transcription levels in mRNA and lancRNA pairs suggests potential mechanisms by which these RNAs perform their functions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>RNA-seq at the exponential growth phase</title><p>We are particularly interested in transcriptional regulation at exponential growth phase where most biomass production is accomplished. In order to measure dynamic transcriptomic changes during exponential growth in the non-model yeast <italic>K. marxianus</italic> and achieve further understanding of the cellular response to the exponential growth conditions, we sequenced total RNAs isolated at three time points corresponding to early-exponential (EE), mid-exponential (ME), and late-exponential (LE) growth phase, with two biological replicates for each sample (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). We employed the dUTP method for RNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and obtained 23,309,796 mapped reads for EL, 28,076,013 mapped reads for ML, and 37,484,281 mapped reads for LL (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These corresponded to 68.6&#x000a0;% of the genome being transcribed from one strand of DNA and 17.2&#x000a0;% being transcribed from both strands of DNA. Considering only the gene region, 68.8&#x000a0;% of the sense strand and 30.5&#x000a0;% of the antisense strand were transcribed, and 24.8&#x000a0;% of the gene regions were transcribed from both strands. Most of the sequence reads were mapped to the sense strand of protein coding genes (~70&#x000a0;%), intergenic regions (~20&#x000a0;%), and antisense strand of protein coding genes (~10&#x000a0;%) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). A low number of sequence reads (&#x0003c;1.2&#x000a0;%) were mapped to rRNAs, indicating that rRNA depletion was successfully carried out. During cell growth, the fraction of reads mapped to the sense strand of protein coding genes was increased (68.2&#x000a0;%&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;71.0&#x000a0;%&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;73.4&#x000a0;%), while that mapped to the intergenic region was decreased (20.5&#x000a0;%&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;17.7&#x000a0;%&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;16.3&#x000a0;%). The fraction of reads mapped to the antisense strand of protein coding genes was almost unchanged (9.5&#x000a0;%&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;10.3&#x000a0;%&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;9.6&#x000a0;%). This result suggested that not only mRNA, but also a substantial amount of ncRNAs, were changed to achieve rapid cell growth in the exponential phase. Hierarchical clustering of biological replicates showed that, overall, experimental procedures were reproducibly conducted (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). In particular, the transcriptional landscape of RNA-seq indicated high strand-specificity and distinct transcriptional expression patterns during cell growth (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Genome-wide measurement of transcriptome during exponential growth phase. <bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>e</bold> EE, ME, and LE indicate early-exponential (EE), mid-exponential (ME), and late-exponential (LE) growth phase, respectively. <bold>a</bold>

Gene units were defined without taking exon-intron structures into account, as the number of introns in the <italic>K. marxianus</italic> genome is less than 5&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Cmsearch program in Infernal version 1.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] yielded 273 RNA genes using Rfam data (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Subsequently, we obtained transcription units across the genome by transfrag method and subsequent post-processing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Transfrag is defined as contiguous genomic region actively transcribed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Briefly, we discarded transfrags of transcriptional level lower than 1.34 (25 percentile) to reduce false positives in the detected transcripts. In addition, transfrags overlapping with either the forward strand or reverse strand of RNA genes were removed in order to focus on the ncRNAs associated with protein-coding genes. We then classified the transfrags into five RNA classes based on their length (short: length&#x02009;&#x0003c;200&#x000a0;nt and long: length&#x02009;&#x02265;200&#x000a0;nt) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], coding potential (non-coding: CPAT coding potential&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.364 and coding: CPAT coding potential&#x02009;&#x02265;0.364) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and location relative to gene annotation (sense, antisense, and intergenic) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]: (1) mRNA (sense transfrag with coding potential) (2) long antisense ncRNA (lancRNA), (3) long intergenic ncRNA (lincRNA), (4) short antisense ncRNA (sancRNA), and (5) short intergenic ncRNA (sincRNA). We obtained 14,298 transfrags, corresponding to 5785 mRNAs (40.5&#x000a0;%; average length&#x02009;=&#x02009;~802&#x000a0;bp), 3067 lancRNAs (21.5&#x000a0;%; average length&#x02009;=&#x02009;~538&#x000a0;bp), 1430 lincRNAs (10.0&#x000a0;%; average length&#x02009;=&#x02009;~456&#x000a0;bp), 2726 sancRNAs (19.1&#x000a0;%; average length&#x02009;=&#x02009;~117&#x000a0;bp), and 1290 sincRNAs (9.0&#x000a0;%; average length&#x02009;=&#x02009;~117&#x000a0;bp) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S4). These data demonstrate pervasive ncRNA transcription, which comprised ~60&#x000a0;% of transfrags with ~30&#x000a0;% of mapped reads (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Detection and classification of transcriptional unit (transfrag). <bold>a</bold> Schematic demonstration of analytical procedures for transfrag detection and classification.

The average length of mRNA transfrags was ~802&#x000a0;bp, which is about half the length of protein-coding genes (average length&#x02009;=&#x02009;~1545&#x000a0;bp) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Among the protein-coding genes with mRNA transfrags (78.3&#x000a0;%; 3788 genes), 66.7&#x000a0;% of genes had only one transfrag and 88.2&#x000a0;% of genes had no more than two transfrags. In addition, the number of genes covered by transfrags indicated that the majority of mRNA transfrags covered more than 90&#x000a0;% of the gene annotation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Although lancRNA and sancRNA transfrags covered much fewer genes than mRNA transfrags, a substantial proportion of the gene region was covered by lancRNAs. Approximately 40&#x000a0;% of lancRNAs covered more than 50&#x000a0;% of the gene annotation while only ~2.5&#x000a0;% of sancRNA covered the same proportion. Taken together, no more than two transfrags were detected for most genes, and thus over-fragmentation of transcripts into multiple transfrags was negligible.</p><p>In principle, the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-end position of each transfrag represents the transcription start site (TSS) and transcription termination site (TTS), respectively. These genomic features enabled us to determine whether the transfrags contained artifacts. In order to test this, we compared mapped read enrichment for each RNA class of <italic>K. marxianus</italic> with those of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, sampled at exponential phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The comparison showed that the mapped read enrichment of all RNA classes was highly similar to that of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, suggesting that the transfrags are highly accurate and ncRNAs are pervasively transcribed in <italic>K. marxianus</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S2). Unexpectedly, lincRNAs and sincRNAs also showed high levels of transcription at the opposite strand, with a much lower transcriptional level than those of lancRNAs and sancRNAs. The proportion of intergenic ncRNA region covered by antisense transcription was ~26.0&#x000a0;%. In accordance with this, several cases of antisense transcription in ncRNAs have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Regulatory roles of ncRNA</title><p>In order to investigate whether pervasive ncRNA transcription at the exponential growth phase plays a functions, we focused on mRNA, lancRNA, and sancRNA, as the functions of genes within these RNA classes may be simply inferred from gene annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. By using DESeq for EE to ME condition and EE to LE condition (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05), we obtained 3572 differentially expressed transfrags, comprising of 2449 sense, 615 antisense, and 508 intergenic transfrags (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. From these transfrag pairs, significantly enriched KEGG pathways were separately obtained for sense and antisense strands (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These results demonstrated enrichment of carbohydrate metabolism, including glycolysis and amino acid biosynthesis pathways as well as respiration pathways. These pathways are important for the synthesis of fundamental cellular components and energy production to fulfill energy requirements for rapid growth during the exponential phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, we observed gradual inactivation of respiration-related pathways, such as the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation during cell growth. The gradual inactivation of the pathways indicates that aerobic condition had been changed to anaerobic condition due to a decrease in dissolved oxygen levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This pathway enrichment pattern at the exponential phase is consistent with the fact that <italic>K. marxianus,</italic> being a Crabtree-negative species, uses aerobic-respiration, thereby producing energy from carbon sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Interestingly, the enriched pathways could be categorized into three groups based on the differential expression of sense, antisense, or both strands. Each group showed distinct functional associations; genes with differential expression of only the sense strand were mostly associated with amino acid metabolism and energy production related to mitochondrial respiration, whereas those with differential expression of antisense strands only, or both strands, were associated with mostly carbohydrate metabolism. The asRNA-mediated regulation of carbohydrate metabolism was mostly conducted by lancRNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Enrichment of KEGG pathways. <bold>a</bold> Overlap of genes with mRNA, lancRNA, and sancRNA and their enriched KEGG pathways. <italic>Blue colored letters</italic> indicate amino acid metabolism pathways and <italic>red colored letters</italic> indicate carbohydrate metabolism or energy metabolism pathways. <bold>b</bold> Heatmap of significantly enriched KEGG pathways by differentially expressed sense and/or antisense transfrags.

Considering <italic>PFK</italic> gene encodes a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis in yeast and human cancer cells, it is highly regulated at the transcriptional level by ncRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We detected two <italic>GAPDH</italic> homologs that showed significant induction of antisense transcription at ME and LE conditions; however, no transcription induction was observed in their sense strands. The <italic>GAPDH</italic> gene encodes a key glycolytic enzyme and functions as a metabolic switch to reroute carbohydrate flux to protect against oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The <italic>ENO</italic> gene encodes one of the most highly expressed glycolytic enzymes in many organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] whose activity is known to be regulated by gene expression to a very low extent. We found that the transcription from the sense strand of the <italic>ENO</italic> gene was slightly reduced, while that from the antisense strand was significantly induced. The antisense strands of two genes, <italic>IDH</italic> and <italic>MDH,</italic> which encode enzymes of the TCA cycle, were significantly induced. The <italic>IDH</italic> gene encodes a rate-limiting enzyme of the TCA cycle. Antisense transcription of the <italic>IDH</italic> gene was significantly induced while sense transcription was slightly increased. MDH catalyzes the final step of the TCA cycle (conversion of malate into oxaloacetate) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Antisense strands were significantly induced in two <italic>MDH</italic> homologs; however, antisense transcription was increased in one homolog but decreased in the other. This suggests that each homolog is under distinct antisense-mediated transcriptional regulation.</p><p>We observed that three fermentation genes, <italic>PDC</italic>, <italic>ADH</italic>, and <italic>ACS</italic>, showed significant induction of antisense strands. Induction of the fermentation genes is consistent with the inactivation of the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation genes in Crabtree-negative species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. <italic>PDC</italic> encodes a key enzyme of alcoholic fermentation, which cleaves pyruvate into carbon dioxide and acetaldehyde, and is auto-regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Antisense transcription of the <italic>PDC</italic> gene was significantly induced and sense transcription was concordantly increased with antisense transcription. The antisense strands of three <italic>ADH</italic> homologs, which are responsible for conversion alcohol into aldehyde in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, were significantly induced. Two of the sense strands were significantly induced and one was significantly repressed. The ACS enzyme is responsible for the transformation of acetate into acetyl-CoA. We detected differentially expressed transfrags from two <italic>ACS</italic> homologs. In one homolog, both strands were significantly induced whereas in the other, only the sense strand was significantly induced. The RPE enzyme, a constituent of the pentose phosphate pathway, is responsible for the conversion of ribulose 5-phosphate into xylulose 5-phosphate. Both the sense and antisense strands of the <italic>RPE</italic> gene were differentially expressed.</p><p>Among the genes described above, we selected three genes, <italic>ACS</italic>, <italic>ADH</italic>, and <italic>MDH</italic>, for the investigation of their antisense transcription pattern. RNA-seq profiles of the genes demonstrated an increase in transcription from both sense and antisense strands under ME and LE conditions, which indicated concordant increase of transcriptional level of mRNA/lancRNA pairs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). Furthermore, they showed obvious strand specificity, except in genes with lancRNA. These demonstrate that their antisense transcription is transcribed and their transcriptional level is simultaneously increased indeed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Mode of regulation of mRNA/lancRNA pairs</title><p>A given lancRNA can exert both positive and negative regulation of its cognate mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Accordingly, we had observed both cases. In order to investigate mode of regulation, we compared the transcriptional levels of mRNA/lancRNA pairs, where either one or both of the pairs were differentially expressed under EE, ME, and LE conditions. LancRNAs regulate their target by base-pairing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and this suggests that interaction between mRNA and lancRNA may be associated with the mode of regulation. Therefore, we hypothesized that the following two factors are associated with mode of regulation, (1) three differential expression types of mRNA/lancRNA pairs, as follows: differentially expressed mRNA/differentially expressed lancRNA pairs, differentially expressed mRNA/non-differentially expressed lancRNA pairs, and non-differentially expressed mRNA/differentially expressed lancRNA pairs, and (2) length fraction of mRNA covered by lancRNA.</p><p>In order to test the former hypothesis, we compared transcriptional levels of sense and antisense strands for each differential expression type separately, and found that they showed distinct correlation patterns. Taking all the mRNA/lancRNA pairs into account, our results showed weak positive correlation between lancRNA and mRNA which was consistent with findings in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Differentially expressed mRNA/differentially expressed lancRNA pairs demonstrated strong positive correlation whereas differentially expressed mRNA/non-differentially expressed lancRNA demonstrated weak positive correlation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). The strong positive correlation indicates that transcriptional expression level of mRNA is co-regulated with lancRNA for each mRNA/lancRNA pairs. Interestingly, non-differentially expressed mRNA/differentially expressed lancRNA pairs showed unexpected results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Although a weak positive correlation was observed when all the pairs were taken into account, they showed obvious negative correlation at low mRNA transcription level while positive correlation at high mRNA transcription level. This shows that a certain threshold of transcriptional level of cognate mRNA is important to determine the mode of enhancing or repressing by lancRNAs. Thus, we concludes that this was the result of switch-like behavior of lancRNA, as negative regulation at low mRNA transcription levels could be interpreted as ensuring the &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; state of mRNA transcription, and vice versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Thus, our results suggest that the transcriptional mode of regulation of lancRNA was influenced by differential expression types of the pairs and mRNA transcriptional levels.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Correlation between transcriptional level of mRNA and lancRNA pairs. <bold>a</bold> All mRNA/lancRNA pairs where either one or both member of each pair was differentially expressed during EE, ME, and LE. <bold>b</bold> Differentially expressed mRNA/differentially expressed lancRNA pairs. <bold>c</bold> Differentially expressed mRNA/non-differentially expressed lancRNA pairs. <bold>d</bold> Non-differentially expressed mRNA/differentially expressed lancRNA pairs. <bold>e</bold> Pairs with more than 50&#x000a0;% of mRNA covered by a lancRNA. <italic>Red points</italic> represent genes with high transcription level while <italic>blue points</italic> represent genes with low transcription level. <italic>Black</italic>, <italic>red</italic>, and <italic>blue lines</italic> indicate least squares fitting of mRNA and lancRNA pairs</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2016_2474_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p>In order to test the latter hypothesis, we compared the transcriptional level of mRNA/lancRNA pairs in which more than 50&#x000a0;% of an mRNA was covered by a lancRNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>).

Similar length fractions of genes (73.4&#x000a0;%) had ncRNAs at the opposite strand when only expressed genes were considered.

Enrichment analysis for lancRNAs covering more than half of the protein-coding genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> revealed a similar enrichment pattern of carbohydrate and energy metabolic pathways (e.g. carbon metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and pyruvate metabolism at mid-exponential phase) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Figure S4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

The importance of these pathways for rapid growth via the synthesis of fundamental cellular components and energy production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] suggests that lancRNAs may play major role in rapid growth during the exponential phase through currently unknown mechanisms.</p><p>Elucidation of the mode of regulation of lancRNA may provide insights into these unknown mechanisms. It is generally accepted that lancRNAs positively or negatively regulate their cognate mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A recent report proposed that lancRNAs function as on/off switches, thereby increasing the variability of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Several cases of lancRNAs with on/off switch-like behavior have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Our results showed that mRNA/lancRNA pairs demonstrate inverse mode of regulation according to the transcriptional level of mRNA, especially in differentially expressed lancRNA/non-differentially expressed mRNA pairs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>), although the same trend was also observed in other types of mRNA/lancRNA pairs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). Therefore, the relationship between transcriptional levels of mRNA and lancRNA involves switching mRNA transcriptional level between on and off states. In other words, lancRNAs enhance the transcriptional level of their cognate mRNAs if the mRNA transcriptional level is higher than certain threshold, but repress this if it is lower. Therefore, our results not only support the view of lancRNA functioning as an on/off switch, but also suggest that this represents a widely used mode of regulation, particularly in carbohydrate and energy metabolism pathways. In addition, our results showed that strong positive correlation exists between transcriptional levels of mRNA/lancRNA pairs, if both pairs are differentially expressed or if the length fraction of mRNA covered by lancRNA is more than 50&#x000a0;% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). These data suggest that the two factors are important for enhancing mRNA transcriptional levels by a currently unknown mechanism. Consistent with this finding, a recent study showed that lancRNAs indeed play a role in enhancing mRNA transcriptional levels in several cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Taken together, our results suggest that a single lancRNA may play either a switch-like roles or an enhancing role depending on conditions such as the mRNA transcriptional level and differential expression of mRNA. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this mode of regulation should be investigated in a specific candidate gene, as our findings are based on observations of the mRNA/lancRNA population. Besides, evolutionarily conserved enrichment of lancRNA differential expression, and several cases of lancRNA functioning as a switch for regulating mRNA in carbohydrate and energy metabolism pathways suggest that the switch-like function of lancRNA may be prevalent across a wide range of species.</p><p>Among genes with differentially expressed lancRNA, <italic>PFK</italic> encodes an enzyme that catalyzes fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) with the release of energy via ATP hydrolysis. <italic>PFK</italic> is one of the primary targets of glycolytic flux regulation according to ATP demand, and this regulation is conserved from bacteria to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Reporter metabolites, such as ATP for <italic>PFK</italic>, play an important role in monitoring the environment or nutrient status by modulating the transcriptional level of associated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Most genes with differentially expressed lancRNA are associated with cofactors used as reporter metabolites. The ACS enzyme also uses ATP whereas GAPDH, MDH, and PDC use NAD, and IDH uses NADP as cofactor. Recent studies show that long ncRNAs promote transcriptional poising of the immediate-early response of inducible genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Therefore, the transcriptional status of these genes may serve as a good target for the regulation of glycolytic flux.
