Identifying a novel mechanism, here we demonstrate that bacteria use the universal communication molecule AI-2 to induce virulence genes and transfer them via phage release. High concentrations (i.e. 100 &#x003bc;M) of AI-2 promote dispersal of bacteria from already established biofilms, and is associated with release of phages capable of infecting other bacteria. <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> V583&#x00394;ABC harbours 7 prophages in its genome, and a mutant deficient in one of these prophages (i.e. prophage 5) showed a greatly reduced dispersal of biofilm. Infection of a probiotic <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strain without lytic prophages with prophage 5 resulted in increased biofilm formation and also in biofilm dispersal upon induction with AI-2. Infection of the probiotic <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strain with phage-containing supernatants released through AI-2 from <italic>E. faecalis</italic> V583&#x00394;ABC resulted in a strong increase in pathogenicity of this strain. The polylysogenic probiotic strain was also more virulent in a mouse sepsis model and a rat endocarditis model. Both AI-2 and ciprofloxacin lead to phage release, indicating that conditions in the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized patients treated with antibiotics might lead to distribution of virulence genes to apathogenic enterococci and possibly also to other commensals or even to beneficial probiotic strains.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>All higher organisms live in intimate contact with bacteria and viruses in their direct environment. Some of these bacteria in our gut can switch between being harmless commensals and causing severe and sometimes lethal infections. This involves a tight regulation of the mechanisms needed to initially colonize and later to harm the host. Here we describe a novel mechanism by which phages (i.e. viruses that infect bacteria) contribute to virulence in commensal gut bacteria. Our results show that bacteria "sense" the number of bacteria present at any given moment through a process called quorum sensing and this provides them with the information needed to assess the specific step during the infectious process. At late stages of infection bacteria are usually present in high numbers, and at this point release viruses that can infect nearby bacteria and transfer genes that are needed to cause infection, thereby enabling previously harmless bacteria to become dangerous pathogens.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the DFG (SFB1054), BMBF (DZIF Partnersite Munich), and the Care-For-Rare Foundation.

It has been suggested that some clinical isolates may lack a functional CRISPR-CAS system leading to more adaptable strains that are able to acquire new virulence factors [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the precise mechanisms and triggers of phage release and the dynamics of infection of gut commensals is still poorly understood [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In the process of quorum sensing, bacteria detect secreted signaling molecules from the same or even different species, and respond by up- or down-regulation of genes to adapt to their environment. Autoinducer-2 (AI-2), a universal bacterial communication molecule, has been identified and studied extensively [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This molecule (4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione) is produced by many bacterial species, including enterococci, and has previously been shown to be involved in the regulation of biofilm formation [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Generally, the biofilm mode of growth is used by bacteria to establish an infection, while later stages of biofilm maturation involve the detachment (i.e. dispersal) of a sub-fraction of bacteria from the biofilm, resulting in the dissemination of infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Enterococci are gut commensals and some <italic>Enterococcus faecalis s</italic>trains are strong biofilm producers, leading to gastrointestinal colonization [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and causing severe biofilm-related infections (i.e., endocarditis, central-venous-catheter infections, or implant infections) [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Therefore we analyzed the time course and the maximum amount of secreted AI-2.

At 5 to 6 hours the AI-2 concentration peaked at a maximum of 108 &#x003bc;M (+/- 2 &#x003bc;M) and then slowly decreased.

All significantly up-regulated genes are located in a single cluster on the bacterial chromosome (EF2085-EF2113) and belong to prophage 5 (<italic>pp5</italic>)&#x02014;one of seven prophages present in the genome of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> V583&#x00394;ABC. To determine whether the decrease of biofilm formation after addition of 100 &#x003bc;M AI-2 is caused by the up-regulation and release of prophage 5, a mutant in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> V583&#x00394;ABC lacking prophage 5 (<italic>pp5-</italic>) [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] was tested.

To study whether AI-2 inhibits biofilm formation or leads to the dispersal of an already formed biofilm, 100 &#x003bc;M AI-2 was added to biofilms statically grown over 18 hours.

Certain toxic metabolites can provoke a stress response once a critical concentration has been reached. Therefore, a cell-to cell signal molecule needs to be defined with caution. Nevertheless, we believe that <italic>E. faecalis</italic> uses AI-2 as a cell-to cell signal molecule arising from a certain population density to infect neighboring bacteria and to adapt to its environment. However, there are experimental data for <italic>S. aureus</italic> that AI-2 may be more important as a metabolite as opposed to a Quorum sensing signal [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The impact of AI-2 on biofilm formation was shown previously by Shao and colleagues and they also proposed that AI-2 may play a role in the regulation of a number of important metabolic pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. None of the genes identified by these authors were found in our transcriptome analysis. However, this discrepancy is explained by the different experimental settings: the results of Shao <italic>et al</italic>. identified genes up-regulated at 2 h, while our RNA-seq data (taken at 6 h) show a different set of genes that were up-regulated at the later time point. Moreover, the concentration of AI-2 used by Shao and colleagues was between 0.2&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;M and was therefore much lower compared to the concentrations used in the present study (100 &#x003bc;M AI-2). Influence of AI-2 concentration on biofilm formation was reported previously by Rickard [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Cuadra-Saenz [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] in <italic>Streptococcus oralis</italic> and <italic>S. gordonii</italic>, showing that high AI-2 concentrations interfere with the communication signals bacteria need to establish complex biofilm architectures.</p><p>Several studies have characterized ubiquitous phages in enterococci and have elucidated important aspects of the underlying pathogenicity, the role of prophage dynamics, and provided evidence for their impact on evolution towards pathogenicity [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Matos et al. showed that six of seven prophages (i.e. pp1, pp3, pp4, pp5, pp6, and pp7) are inducible and four of them form infectious virions regulated by a network that was described as the first "enterococcal phage-related chromosomal island" [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. They also demonstrated that pp1 and pp7 only transfer together [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>We observed a decrease in biofilm when 100 &#x003bc;M AI-2 was added and concluded that this represents dispersal of an already formed biofilm. This hypothesis is concordant with the electron micrographs and the up-regulation of phage genes that are involved in lysis (i.e. EF2086&#x02014;an endolysin, and EF2087&#x02014;a holin). However, additional experiments are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of dispersal of biofilm through phage release. Further studies should also determine whether an endogenous gradual increase of AI-2 up to 100 &#x003bc;M leads to similar effects (e.g. phage release and/or pp5 induction) compared to the sudden increase through the addition of 100 &#x003bc;M exogenous AI-2.</p><p>Based on our results we hypothesize that AI-2 plays an important role in expression and distribution of virulence factors. With increasing bacterial density, bacteria from biofilms must disperse, migrate across epithelial linings, and disseminate by overcoming the host&#x02019;s antimicrobial defense systems. These adaptive mechanisms require a set of virulence factors, which are induced by increasing bacterial density and consequently higher concentrations of AI-2 in the microenvironment. To confirm this hypothesis, a LuxS mutant would be helpful. However, while our attempts to create such a mutant were futile, others were able to create a LuxS mutant in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> but were not able to complement this mutant, probably due to the essential role of LuxS in detoxification or due to second site suppression (Lynn Hancock, personal communication).</p><p>Phage release in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> is induced either by antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin) [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or by higher amounts of AI-2. Both situations may be encountered in the gastro-intestinal tract of hospitalized neutropenic patients, who often receive quinolone antibiotics for prophylaxis, leading to a selective enrichment of enterococci in the intestinal flora. As a consequence, released phages become much more likely to infect neighboring bacteria, leading to an increase in virulence, as demonstrated in our mouse bacteremia model. Via stool analysis of patients on quinolone antibiotics, an expansion of the phage metagenome has been reported recently by Modi and colleagues [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

Here the Refseq genes were retrieved from the UCSC microbial genome browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microbes.ucsc.edu">http://microbes.ucsc.edu</ext-link>). Regions in which genes overlap were filtered out, since the library preparation protocol was not strand conserving. This annotation file was used to count reads for each feature in each bam file. Reads with fewer than 5 counts in any sample were removed from the data set (41/5349), and differentially expressed mRNAs were calculated using the Bioconductor package &#x02018;edgeR&#x02019; [<xref rid="ppat.1004653.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] using the generalized liner model approach.

The animals were anesthetized by subcutaneous application of 5.75% ketamine and 0.2% xylazine. Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis was caused by insertion of a small plastic catheter (polyethylene tubing; Intramedic PE 10) via the right carotid artery. The artery was accessed by cutting the neck laterally on the right side. The carotid artery could be easily exposed and ligated distally. The polyethylene catheter was introduced via a small incision of the vessel and advanced until a slight resistance indicated passage through the aortic valve. The catheter was advanced through the aortic valve into the left ventricle. Proper placement was ensured via invasive pressure measurement through the catheter&#x02019;s lumen. To minimize confounding factors we focused on standardization of the catheter insertion and its positioning. Preliminary experiments without secondary bacterial colonization showed that pressure monitoring and therewith objectification of catheter positioning could minimize overly traumatic injury (which may lead to pronounced thrombotic lesions) and ensured constant lesions. The catheter was secured in place and distally ligated. A simple running suture was used for wound closure. Postoperatively the rats were returned to their cage and monitored closely.</p><p>Inoculation of bacteria followed 48 h after catheter placement via injection into the tail vein. Rats were assigned to two groups, 6 receiving the wild type strain Symbioflor 1, and 8 being challenged with transduced Symbioflor 1. Animals were sacrificed on postoperative day 6 and the correct placement of the catheter was verified. The extent of native valve endocarditis was assessed and graded macroscopically, and subsequently valve vegetations were removed aseptically. After weighing of the vegetations, 500 &#x003bc;L TSB was added per sample and the vegetations were homogenized.</p><p>The primary evaluation criterion was the bacterial count in the vegetation (cfu per gram and per ml, respectively). The mean and standard deviation was calculated for each group. Statistical significance was determined by Mann-Whitney U test. The appropriate sample size was calculated using Mead&#x000b4;s resource equation.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Scanning electron microscopy</title><p>Biofilms grown on poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides (BD biosciences) were mock treated or treated with 100 &#x003bc;M AI-2 in growth medium in 12-well-plates and carefully washed with 2 x 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Biochrom) to remove medium and fixed for 1 h with 2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (Sigma) in PBS at room temperature.
