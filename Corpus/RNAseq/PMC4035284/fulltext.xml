It is known that brain-specific miR-9 is controlled transcriptionally; however, it is unknown whether post-transcriptional processes contribute to establishing its levels. Here, we show that miR-9 is regulated transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally during neuronal differentiation of the embryonic carcinoma cell line P19. We demonstrate that miR-9 is more efficiently processed in differentiated than undifferentiated cells. We reveal that Lin28a affects miR-9 by inducing the degradation of its precursor through a uridylation-independent mechanism. Furthermore, we show that constitutively expressed untagged but not GFP-tagged Lin28a decreases differentiation capacity of P19 cells, which coincides with reduced miR-9 levels. Finally, using an inducible system we demonstrate that Lin28a can also reduce miR-9 levels in differentiated P19 cells. Together, our results shed light on the role of Lin28a in neuronal differentiation and increase our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the level of brain-specific microRNAs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>miRNA biogenesis</kwd><kwd>neuronal differentiation, brain-specific microRNAs</kwd><kwd>RNP complex</kwd><kwd>Lin28a</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Small (21-22 nt) RNAs called microRNAs (miRs) have emerged as vital regulators of the post-transcriptional control of gene expression<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.

However, the contribution of post-transcriptional control to the establishment of the levels of transcriptionally regulated microRNAs is largely unknown.</p><p id="P4">The human nervous system expresses approximately 70% of the known microRNAs, and some of these are specific to neurons<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. It has been demonstrated that brain-specific miR-9 and miR-124 play an important role in neuronal development<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) has been shown to promote miR-9 expression<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. miR-9 is evolutionarily conserved at the nucleotide level but its expression profile and functions are diverse within the nervous system of different species<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. This microRNA was shown to interfere with the fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8)<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> signaling cascade, an important pathway for neural plate patterning and development of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, we have identified a number of other primary microRNA transcripts (including neuro-specific miR-9) with highly conserved terminal loops and hypothesized that this may reflect their requirement for auxiliary factors to regulate their processing<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Recently, we have demonstrated that the brain-enriched expression of miR-7, which is processed from a ubiquitous primary transcript, is supported by inhibition of its biogenesis in non-neural cells<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. This inhibition is achieved through the HuR-mediated binding of MSI2 to the CTL of the miR-7 primary transcript. The regulation of pri- and pre-let-7 processing by the pluripotency factor Lin28 is an another example of post-transcriptional control of microRNA levels<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. It has been well demonstrated that the binding of Lin28a to pre-let-7 induces 3&#x02032;-terminal uridylation through recruitment of the TUT4 polymerase<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.

We demonstrate that Lin28a, a protein previously implicated in the regulation of let-7 biogenesis, binds to the miR-9 precursor and decreases the cellular levels of miR-9 during retinoic acid-mediated P19 cell neuronal differentiation. We show that the constitutive expression of untagged but not GFP-tagged Lin28a causes a severe differentiation phenotype by reducing the size of embryonic bodies. Importantly, the constitutive expression of GFP-tagged Lin28a reduces the levels of let-7a but not miR-9, whereas untagged Lin28 inhibits both miR-9 and let-7a. We reveal that Lin28a controls miR-9 levels by a uridylation-independent mechanism. Finally, using an inducible Tet-On 3G system we demonstrate that Lin28a can also reduce miR-9 levels in differentiated cells. Our results provide the basis for better understanding the mechanism regulating the levels of brain-specific microRNAs and their control of neuronal differentiation.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S2"><title>miR-9 is controlled transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally</title><p id="P7">To determine whether post-transcriptional regulation of brain-specific miR-9 contributes to establishing its intercellular concentrations, we analyzed the level of mature and corresponding primary transcripts at different stages of P19 cell neuronal differentiation. Throughout differentiation, we observed a steady increase in the miR-9 levels to approximately 50-60-fold on days 4 and 5, reaching approximately 500-550-fold between days 8 and 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Importantly, the increase in primary miR-9 transcripts was higher at these time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). On day 4, we observed an approximate 520-fold increase in pri-miR-9-2, whereas on day 8, pri-miR-9-1, -2 and -3 were induced by approximately 400-, 1300- and 260-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). A gradual increase in let-7 and rapid decrease in miR-302a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, d</xref>) together with a decrease in Lin28 protein and an increase in the neuronal markers Tuj1 and GFAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>) validated an efficient neuronal differentiation phenotype. Northern blot analysis of miR-9, let-7a and miR-302a confirmed their abundance at selected stages of P19 cell neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Crucially, an unbiased RNAseq and small RNAseq analysis of undifferentiated (day 0) and differentiating (day 4) P19 cells revealed that while primary miR-9-2 levels accumulate from undetectable in d0 to ~900 of normalized reads in d4, the mature miR-9 accumulates very modestly to ~4 normalized reads in d4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). This is in stark contrast with another microRNA, which is rapidly induced upon Retinoic Acid treatment &#x02013; miR-10a. Primary levels of miR-10a accumulate from undetectable in d0 to ~170 normalized reads in d4. Unlike miR-9 the levels of miR-10a increase from ~4 normalized reads in d0 to ~460 normalized reads in d4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The levels of control primary and mature miR-16 are much more stable during differentiation. This example clearly demonstrates that miR-9 processing is repressed post-transcriptionally during early stage of neuronal differentiation, whereas miR-10a is most likely free from post-transcriptional regulation. Altogether, these results show that the accumulation of brain-specific miR-9 does not linearly correspond with the changing levels in their primary transcripts. This result suggests the existence of additional post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating the abundance of brain-specific microRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>miR-9 processing is regulated during neuronal differentiation</title><p id="P8">To determine whether the biogenesis of brain-specific miR-9 is regulated during neuronal differentiation, we employed <italic>in vitro</italic> processing assays. We observed an accumulation of pre-miR-9-1 and pre-let-7a in pri-microRNA processing performed in extracts from differentiated cells when compared with those from undifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Conversely, the processing of pri-miR-302a was more efficient in d0 than in d9 extracts, whereas the <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage pattern of pri-miR-101 was more uniform throughout differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). This result suggests that miR-9 processing is regulated by negative or positive factors in undifferentiated and differentiated P19 cells, respectively. Abolished pri-miR-9-1 and pri-let-7a-1 processing in Drosha or DGCR8-depleted HeLa cell extracts confirmed the specificity of the reactions and the molecular weights of the corresponding microRNA precursors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, we observed nonspecific <italic>in vitro</italic> processing products in d0 extracts for pri-miR-9-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) that did not correspond to pre-miRs because they were not detected in processing reactions performed in d9 P19 or HeLa cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Hence, we assumed that the differentiation stage-specific accumulation of pre-miR-9-1 might arise from the regulation of Drosha cleavage or the control of their stability. Together, these observations corroborate our mature microRNA and pri-microRNA profiling results, indicating that during neuronal differentiation, the processing of brain-specific miR-9 is regulated at the post-transcriptional level.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Lin28a is a potential regulator of miR-9 biogenesis</title><p id="P9">Conserved Terminal Loops (CTLs) have been implicated in the regulation of miR biogenesis, and miR-9 has highly conserved terminal loop<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Thus, we hypothesized that miR-9 CTLs might be involved in the regulation of its processing during neuronal differentiation. To find the putative regulators of miR-9 biogenesis, we used SILAC combined with RNA pull-down and Mass Spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). miR-9 CTL was used to precipitate proteins from extracts derived from undifferentiated (d0) or differentiated (d9) P19 cells that were cultured with heavy [13C]Arg/[13C]Lys or light [12C]Arg/[12Lys] isotopes, respectively.</p><p id="P10">SILAC combined with RNA pull-down and Mass Spectrometry analysis revealed several proteins specifically interacting with miR-9 CTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Dataset 1</xref>). Our attention was drawn to the Lin28a protein, a factor implicated in the regulation of let-7 biogenesis, which was highly enriched in pull-downs from undifferentiated cells (17- and 11-fold for the miR-9 and miR-124-1 CTLs, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). We validated the strong interaction between Lin28a and the miR-9-1 CTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Crucially, this interaction was observed only in extracts derived from undifferentiated cells. In contrast, the Msi1 protein was found to predominantly interact with the miR-9-1 CTL in differentiated extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The observed interactions were specific because neither Lin28 nor Msi1 interacted with beads alone. Moreover, hnRNPA1, which is a ubiquitous RNA binding protein, was found to interact equally with corresponding CTLs on days 0 and 9. Indeed, the majority of the identified proteins did not show a differentiation-regulated expression. This however does not preclude their potential roles in regulating miR-9 biogenesis. Because Lin28a is a potent inhibitor of let-7 biogenesis, we hypothesized that it can also function in the regulation of brain-specific microRNA biogenesis.</p><p id="P11">To further confirm the interactions, we performed SILAC combined with pre-microRNA pull-down and Mass Spectrometry using extracts from undifferentiated P19 cells. Pre-let-7a pull-down identified Lin28a as well as Khsrp and hnRNP A1, proteins previously implicated in the regulation of let-7 biogenesis<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Dataset 2</xref>). Surprisingly, we did not find TuT4 in the pre-let-7a pull-down, suggesting that the Lin28a/TuT4 interaction might be transient under our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Dataset 2</xref>). Full-length pre-miR-9-1 and pre-miR-9-2 pulled down Lin28 with fold enrichment similar to that observed for pre-let-7a. The pre-miR-9 pull-down revealed a number of other specific factors that may contribute to the regulation of miR-9 processing.</p><p id="P12">To validate Lin28a binding specificity we performed RNA pull down followed by western blot analysis with a panel of pre-microRNAs. Pre-miR-9-1, pre-let-7a-1 and pre-miR-101 displayed efficient Lin28a binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Importantly, pre-miR-16 as well as pre-miR-9-1 with substituted TL from the miR-16 (pre-miR-9-1/miR-16TL) could not pull down Lin28a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This was also confirmed by EMSA analysis of pre-microRNAs and anti Lin28a antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In EMSA pre-miR-9-1 as well as pre-let-7a-1 form several complexes with proteins from d0 P19 cell extracts. Formation of one of the complexes is abolished upon addition of anti Lin28a but not unspecific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This suggests that Lin28a bound to pre-miR-9-1 and pre-let-7a-1 forms a complex with the anti Lin28a antibody, preventing the substrates to enter the gel. Alternatively, anti Lin28a antibody could be binding to Lin28a and precluding its association with its substrates. Importantly, pre-miR-16 was not shifted in undifferentiated cell extracts. This provides additional evidence for the specificity of Lin28a binding.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The knockdown of Lin28a leads to increased levels of miR-9</title><p id="P13">Lin28a expression is dynamically regulated throughout neuronal differentiation<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Its expression is elevated at early stages of development and is switched off during differentiation. This regulation is essential for the inhibition of let-7 production at the early stages of differentiation and development and for maintaining pluripotency<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. We observed a steady decrease in Lin28 until day 6 and a sharp drop in its expression on day 8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). This decline coincided with a sharp increase in miR-9 levels on day 8 even though a substantial accumulation of primary miR-9 transcripts occurs at earlier stages of neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To determine whether Lin28a controls miR-9 levels, we transfected P19 cells with anti-Lin28a siRNAs. To initiate miR-9 expression, we then induced transfected cells to differentiate. Western blot analysis of Lin28a expression on day 4 of differentiation demonstrated that the protein was depleted to approximately 20-30% of control treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). As expected, Lin28a depletion resulted in a 4-fold increase in let-7a levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The level of miR-101 and miR-122, miRs unrelated to neuronal development, was unchanged. Crucially, Lin28a knockdown resulted in a modest but statistically significant 1.6-fold increase in miR-9 levels on day 4 of P19 neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To uncouple the effects of differentiation and control of miR-9 levels we performed pri-microRNA transgene overexpression in undifferentiated P19 cells. Overexpression of pri-miR-9 and pri-let-7a driven by a CMV promoter resulted in a very small induction of mature microRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Importantly, overexpression of pri-let-7a-1/miR-16 TL mutant, which escapes Lin28a-medaited regulation, produced more than twenty fold more of mature let-7a. This suggests that the accumulation of miR-9 and let-7a levels in undifferentiated cells is post-transcriptionally suppressed. Interestingly, overexpression of cognate pri-miR-9-1/miR-16 TL mutant did not result in de-repression of miR-9 accumulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). This implies the existence of additional layers of post-transcriptional miR-9 regulation, most likely preventing accumulation of mature microRNA in undifferentiated cells.</p><p id="P16">All these results suggest that Lin28a expression has an influence on the level of miR-9 <italic>in vivo</italic>. The difference between the observed effects of Lin28 depletion on the miR-9 and let-7 levels could be due to different levels of corresponding primary transcripts available at early stages of differentiation. The expression of the let-7 primary transcript is stable throughout differentiation, whereas the miR-9 primary transcript is not detected in undifferentiated P19 cells and only begins to accumulate during early stages of neuronal differentiation<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Together, these results provide evidence implicating Lin28a in the regulation of brain-specific miR-9 abundance during neuronal differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Untagged Lin28a affects miR-9 and neuronal differentiation</title><p id="P17">Next, we wanted to determine whether prolonged expression of Lin28a during neuronal differentiation could affect the level of let-7a and miR-9. To test this hypothesis, P19 cells constitutively expressing untagged or GFP-tagged Lin28a together with the relevant control cell lines were subjected to retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation. Western blot analysis of untagged and GFP-tagged Lin28a confirmed their prolonged expression throughout P19 differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). During the differentiation of P19 cells constitutively expressing untagged Lin28a, we observed a significant reduction in the size of embryonic bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c,d</xref>). Surprisingly, P19 cells with stable Lin28a-GFP expression were phenotypically indistinguishable from control P19 cell lines. This result indicates that GFP-tagged Lin28a does not confer all of the functions of the wild type protein. Indeed, prolonged GFP-Lin28a expression during neuronal differentiation resulted in an approximate 4-fold decrease in let-7a compared with control cells but had no significant effect on the level of miR-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Strikingly, constitutive expression of untagged Lin28a resulted in a significant reduction in the miR-9 and let-7a levels at the final stages of P19 cell neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). Similar results were obtained from two independent Lin28a integrations. The western blot of Lin28a on extracts from differentiated P19 FRT/Lin28a and P19 Lin28a/GFP cells revealed similar levels of GFP-tagged and untagged Lin28a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, the observed phenotypic and functional differences arose from qualitative but not quantitative differences between tagged and untagged Lin28a. The level of primary miR-9 transcripts was also decreased in P19 cells constitutively expressing untagged Lin28a, corroborating the existence of a negative feedback loop between miR-9 and the REST complex, which controls miR-9 expression and is reciprocally controlled by miR-9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Together, these are important observations for two reasons: they validate Lin28a as a regulator of miR-9 levels, and they suggest that GFP-tagged Lin28a could be functionally compromised.

In contrast, pre-miR-9 was not converted to a uridylated form but instead was significantly destabilized in extracts derived from undifferentiated P19 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a,c</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Significantly, incubation of pre-miR-9 with extracts derived from days 4, 6, and 9 resulted in its gradual stabilization by 2-, 4-, and 5-fold, respectively, which correlates with the period when Lin28a expression is reduced. Pre-miR-9-2 and pre-miR-9-3 are also destabilized in extract derived from d0 P19 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Importantly, pri-miR-9-1/miR-16 TL mutant, which does not bind Lin28a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), is not destabilized in extracts from undifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Control pre-miR-101 and pre-let-7a probes were more stable under similar conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a,c</xref>). To establish how pre-miR-9 is degraded, we incubated 5&#x02032;-end-labeled microRNA precursors in d0 extracts. Pre-miR-9-1 is more unstable than pre-let-7a and pre-miR-101, showing signs of 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-3&#x02032; degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b,d</xref>). These results validate our <italic>in vivo</italic> data and point to different mechanisms by which miR-9 and let-7a levels are post-transcriptionally regulated during neuronal differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Lin28a destabilizes pre-miR-9 by a uridylation-independent mechanism</title><p id="P22">Thus far we have shown that Lin28a can bind to the miR-9 CTL and influence miR-9 cellular levels. In addition, we have demonstrated that pre-miR-9 is rendered unstable in P19 cell extracts by a mechanism that is different than that for pre-let-7. To determine whether Lin28a mediates the observed destabilization of pre-miR-9 in undifferentiated cells, we performed pre-miR processing assays in P19 cell extracts with depleted Lin28a. Incubation of pre-let-7a with Lin28a-depleted extracts resulted in a reduction in pre-let-7a uridylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a</xref>). The pre-miR-9 substrate was significantly stabilized in Lin28a-depleted extracts when compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a,b</xref>). In similar conditions, the level of pre-miR-101 remained largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a,b</xref>). Likewise, degradation of 5&#x02032;-end labeled pre-miR-9-1 was strongly suppressed in Lin28a RNAi-depleted P19 d0 extracts compared with reactions in control RNAi extracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p id="P23">To further demonstrate the role of Lin28a in controlling pre-miR-9 stability we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> processing in extracts derived from cell lines with constitutive Lin28a expression. Similarly to wild type, d9 extracts derived from P19 cells stably expressing Lin28a-GFP support degradation of pre-miR-9-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a,b</xref>). Pre-let-7a is uridylated in extracts from d0 and d9 derived from both P19 Lin28a-GFP and P19/FRT Lin28a cells. Notably, pre-miR-9-1 is not stabilized in d9 extracts derived from cells constitutively expressing GFP-tagged Lin28a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a,b</xref>). These results further support the role of Lin28a in pre-miR-9 destabilization, which leads to decreased cellular levels of miR-9. Since <italic>in vitro</italic> processing reactions are uncoupled from the effects of transcription, the above results suggest that Lin28a can regulate pre-miR-9 post-transcriptionally.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Induced Lin28a in differentiated cells downregulates miR-9</title><p id="P24">To test whether <italic>in vivo</italic> regulation of miR-9 by Lin28a is achievable after the cells have been differentiated we created Tet-On 3G P19 cells that express Lin28a under a doxycycline (Dox) inducible CMV promoter.

The cells were harvested at day 9 and compared with uninduced cells from the corresponding clones. One of the analyzed clones (P19 Tet-On 3G Lin28a 3#) showed induction of Lin28a upon Dox treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>); albeit the levels were much lower when compared with undifferentiated cells.

The levels of pri-miR-9 transcripts were also decreased upon Dox treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9b</xref>), suggesting that Lin28a can directly or indirectly influence the abundance of primary microRNA-9.

Despite extensive research in the biological functions of microRNAs, little is known about the post-transcriptional mechanisms controlling their abundance. In many cases, the levels of primary microRNA transcripts are not correlated with the absolute levels of corresponding mature microRNAs<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. In these cases, post-transcriptional regulation of microRNA processing is predicted to play a major role in controlling the level of the microRNAs in question<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. For example, during neuronal differentiation, the let-7 levels are negatively correlated with the expression of Lin28 but display no correlation with its corresponding primary transcripts<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Similar observations have been made during the development of <italic>C. elegans</italic><sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Additionally, the biogenesis of brain-enriched miR-7, which is produced from a ubiquitous primary transcript, is inhibited by the HuR/MSI2 complex in non-neuronal cells<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Our current study shows that the levels of neuro-specific miR-9, which is responsible for neuronal development, undergo extensive transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.</p><p id="P27">miR-9 is transcriptionally suppressed by the anti-neural REST complex<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. During neuronal differentiation, miR-9 target components of REST, allowing their own expression and that of other neuronal genes. Additionally, miR-9 promotes neural cell differentiation by targeting the TLX nuclear receptor, which is responsible for the maintenance of self-renewal<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. In accordance with previous findings, we observed an increase in the level of miR-9 during RA-induced neuronal differentiation in P19 cells<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. At the early stages of differentiation the accumulation of the three miR-9 primary transcripts substantially exceeded the accumulation of mature miR-9. These results point to the existence of previously uncharacterized post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating the intercellular levels of miR-9.</p><p id="P28">Using SILAC coupled with RNA pull-down and Mass Spectrometry<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, we identified several putative regulators of miR-9. We isolated Lin28a as a factor binding to the miR-9 CTL in undifferentiated P19 cells. It is believed that let-7 family members are the main microRNAs regulated by Lin28 during neuronal differentiation<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. During muscle differentiation Lin28 and MBNL1 control miR-1 biogenesis through a uridylation-dependent mechanism<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. An AGGAG consensus sequence was previously found to be crucial for the association between the Zn-knuckle domain (ZKD) of Lin28a and the let-7 CTL<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. The miR-9 CTL has a GGAG motif, which can provide a platform for interaction with Lin28a. However, other U-rich sequences were shown to interact with Lin28a through its cold shock domain<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. In accordance with these observations, pre-miR-9-1 and pre-miR-9-2 were shown to bind recombinant Lin28a <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Interestingly, several studies have used crosslinking and immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq) to identify targets for Lin28a binding but failed to detect miR-9 precursors<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. These studies focused on undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and somatic cells. Therefore, it is plausible that such an approach could result in a failure to capture targets that are dynamically regulated throughout differentiation.</p><p id="P29">The constitutive expression of untagged Lin28a during neuronal differentiation resulted in a severe differentiation phenotype characterized by small embryonic bodies and reduced levels of mature miR-9 and let-7a. Previously, it has been reported that constitutive expression of Lin28-GFP inhibits let-7a processing in P19 cells and results in a neuronal phenotype that is independent of let-7<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Unexpectedly, constitutive expression of a Lin28a-GFP-tagged protein resulted in efficient reduction of let-7a but not miR-9 levels. Likewise, a severe differentiation phenotype was only evident in P19 cells constitutively expressing untagged but not GFP-tagged Lin28a protein. Notably, it has been shown that miR-9 depletion also results in a severe differentiation phenotype characterized by small embryonic bodies, which corroborates our results<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. First, these findings suggest that decreased let-7 levels are not sufficient to induce an aberrant P19 differentiation phenotype. Second, the mechanisms for Lin28a-mediated inhibition of miR-9 and let-7 are different. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> processing results, obtained from the wild type cells and cells constitutively expressing Lin28a, indicate that Lin28a destabilizes pre-miR-9 but does not induce uridylation as observed for pre-let-7 transcripts<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Furthermore, induction of Lin28a expression in differentiated cells leads to reduction of miR-9 levels, arguing that the Lin28a control over miR-9 is not restricted to differentiating cells. Further in-depth analysis is required to determine the effectors of the Lin28a-mediated control of pre-miR-9 stability and understand their contribution to neuronal differentiation.</p><p id="P30">miR-9 and miR-124 have been shown to be master regulators of neuronal programs because they alone can transform adult fibroblasts into neurons<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that their highly restricted, brain-specific expression profile needs to be safeguarded by several non-mutually exclusive mechanisms. Here, we show that miR-9 is transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally controlled. We present evidence that untagged Lin28a inhibits miR-9 processing by destabilizing pre-miR-9 through a uridylation-independent mechanism. This finding sheds more light on the role of Lin28a in neuronal differentiation. Altogether, our results demonstrate that transcriptionally regulated microRNAs can undergo complementary post-transcriptional control. This has important implications for the understanding of how microRNAs are regulated and the development of novel microRNA-based compounds and therapeutics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S11"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S12"><title>Cell culture and neuronal differentiation conditions</title><p id="P31">Mouse teratocarcinoma P19 cells or HeLa cells (ATCC) were maintained in standard DMEM medium (Life Technologies), supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Life Technologies).
