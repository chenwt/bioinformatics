SNP discovery resulted in identification of ~58,000 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms including 24,479 which were predicted to fall within exons.

During transportation and sorting, several factors may also lead to stress including handling and tank confinement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Osmoregulatory disturbance may be an outcome of stress, for which altered salinity is routinely used to mitigate negative effects, however high salinity such as in adaptation to seawater induces a stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These and other stressors which are common to aquaculture production can induce physiological responses which may have adverse effects on traits important to producers and consumers, including those associated with growth, nutrition, reproduction, immune response, fillet quality, and environmental impacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Understanding and monitoring the biological mechanisms underlying stress responses will facilitate alleviating their negative effects through selective breeding and changes in management practices, resulting in improved animal welfare and production efficiency.</p><p>Studies which aim to characterize global gene expression in response to stress often use hybridization-based approaches (i.e. microarrays) to identify differences between challenged and control fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Hybridization techniques including those that employ microarrays can be high-throughput and are relatively inexpensive, however they present some limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For instance: 1) the preparation of custom-made arrays requires previous knowledge of the target transcriptome expected to be represented in a sample; 2) hybridization data often present high background levels due to cross-hybridization; and 3) microarrays are not suitable for genes expressed at very low or very high levels because there is a limited range of detection due to background and saturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Sequencing-based methodologies have also been used to characterize gene expression, full-length cDNA and EST (expressed sequence tags) libraries have been sequenced using Sanger technology, however, this method is low-throughput, expensive and usually not quantitative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Tag-based short sequence reads methodologies like SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) or MPSS (massive parallel signature sequence) are also high-throughput and quantitative, however the sequence reads cannot be unambiguously mapped to the reference genome; the transcriptome is still partially</p><p>analyzed; and it is usually not possible to distinguish different gene isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Recently developed high-throughput sequencing technologies offer a new approach (RNASeq) for characterizing transcriptomes through high-throughput sequencing, mapping and quantification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This approach is especially advantageous for non-model species, because it is not restricted by the unavailability of a genome reference sequence. Additionally, RNASeq has very low background and sequences can be unambiguously mapped to reference sequences. The quantification is based on the number of sequences obtained, therefore it offers the detection of a higher expression range and it is possible to identify low or highly expressed genes. Furthermore, this approach permits additional analysis such as the identification of putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which can be identified in transcribed regions and have the potential to affect gene function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. RNASeq has previously been used for transcriptome characterization of non-model species, including butterfly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], silkworm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], garter snake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], coral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], pearl oyster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and several fish species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], including rainbow trout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>In the absence of a genome reference sequence for rainbow trout, we used Roche 454 pyrosequencing technology to develop a reference transcriptome sequence to be used specifically in gene expression analyses associated with stress, including RNASeq based approaches. The library construction included a normalization process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] such that the reference transcriptome would constitute a qualitative resource attempting to represent the maximum number of unique transcripts from each of the tissues/treatment combinations as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Although the majority of stress gene expression research in rainbow trout has concentrated on evaluating the effect of only one stressor on one specific tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], our goal was to capture and characterize a collection of transcripts from multiple tissues from fish exposed to one of five stressors. As a result we aim to establish a comprehensive stress transcriptome resource that will facilitate understanding stress responses in this species. To this end we selected stressors that are among those commonly experienced by rainbow trout during aquaculture production and transport including high temperature, low temperature, low DO/high CO<sub>2</sub>, seawater transfer, and handling/confinement.</p><p>Previous studies have evaluated the combined effects of temperature and salinity on physiological condition of rainbow trout. Niu <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] transferred juvenile rainbow trout from 13.5&#x000b0;C to 25.5&#x000b0;C, held them for two hours, and then transferred them to a 32&#x02030; water at 13.5&#x000b0;C to observe the effects osmotic stress during transfer from freshwater to saltwater. Also, low temperature combined with sea water tolerance was analyzed by Findstad <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] who transferred fresh water acclimated rainbow trout to sea water at 1 and 8&#x000b0;C, and Saunders <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] who first acclimated the fish to salt water and placed them in floating cages until temperatures fell below 0&#x000b0;C. In this project we used similar parameters for high and low temperature and salinity treatments however we were conducted treatments independently. Previous studies have suggested that oxygen concentrations above 6 mg/l are not limiting factors for growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and carbon dioxide in culture tanks should range between 10 and 20 mg/l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] therefore we combined effects of low DO and high CO<sub>2 </sub>by supplying fish with re-use water, a common practice in aquaculture production which uses water from rearing sites "upstream" to increase production capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Finally, fish were subjected to a handling and confinement stress routinely used for rainbow trout stress response research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>We demonstrate that each stressor produced a physiological response by reporting changes in plasma variables indicative of various phases of a stress response (cortisol, glucose, lactate, and chloride concentrations and lysozyme activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]) as well as changes in the expression of genes in gill tissue related to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and Na/K transport. Our reference transcriptome created by sequencing RNA from multiple tissues of control and stressed fish is inclusive of transcripts expressed within the context of these unique physiological states and typical basal expression from control fish. We characterize the reference transcriptome by conducting an assembly of sequencing reads, assigning Gene Ontology annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and identifying putative SNPs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Water Quality Parameters</title><p>Water quality parameters including temperature, DO, pH, CO<sub>2</sub>, and ammonia were measured at 0, 3, and 6 hours during the challenges and as summarized in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> (Table S1 Water Quality Parameters). The desired parameters for each treatment were obtained within three hours of the beginning of the respective experiments. Water pH values varied between 7.5 and 7.9 for both treatment and control conditions. Concentrations of nitrogenous compounds levels were also within acceptable limits. In the "high temperature" treatment tanks, temperatures were elevated from 14.3&#x000b0;C to an average of 22.6&#x000b0;C within three hours (time 3) and remained elevated until the six hour (time 6) sampling period, at which temperatures averaged 24.8&#x000b0;C. For the "low-temperature" treatment, water temperature was reduced to 1.8&#x000b0;C within three hours (time 3), and was maintained at an average of 2.3&#x000b0;C until time 6. DO levels are one of the most critical water quality parameters in trout culture and exposure to low levels of DO (5.0 - 6.0 mg/l) can result in mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. However, critical levels are directly correlated with other water quality parameters, like water temperature. DO levels oscillated between 7.16 and 22.40 mg/l across the experimental tanks. Although the average DO concentration at sampling time (time 6) was lower in the re-use water treatment tanks than the control tank (7.8 versus 10.0 mg/l), it remained within acceptable limits for trout production. However, CO<sub>2 </sub>levels were significantly higher (67.8 mg/l average) in treatment tanks compared to control (21.7 mg/l). Recommended upper limits for dissolved CO<sub>2 </sub>range between 10 and 20 mg/l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological responses</title><p>We measured plasma cortisol as an indicator of primary response and glucose, lactate, chloride and lysozyme as indicators of secondary stress responses to detect if stress responses occurred and to characterize differences in responses that are unique to each stressor or shared among stressors. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> show the response of plasma glucose, lactate, chloride and cortisol concentrations in addition to lysozyme activity, respectively, compared across all treatments and controls. Values from all control tanks were pooled and presented as a single mean, which was compared to the mean for each stress treatment. Plasma glucose concentrations were significantly lower than control in high temperature and re-use water treatments, and significantly higher than control in the low-temperature treatment. Plasma lactate concentrations increased greater than 2-fold in high-temperature and saline treatments, and also increased after the handling treatment. In contrast, low temperature and re-use water treatments decreased plasma lactate concentrations. High temperature and saline treatments increased, while low temperature and re-use water treatments decreased plasma chloride concentrations compared to control. Lysozyme activity was slightly decreased in the re-use water treatment. Finally, plasma cortisol concentrations increased dramatically, between 5- to 12-fold, compared to the controls, across all treatment groups. The magnitudes and directions of the differences of these parameters between treatments and the control groups reflect unique physiological response portfolios that result from each stressor, such that a sequencing a collection of transcripts isolated from tissues from stressed fish would serve as a qualitative representation of various physiological responses.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Physiological Responses to Stress Treatments</bold>.

Detailed information on the assembly results is presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Newbler aligned 2,708,437 reads (85.7%) including 990,882,504 base pairs to contigs and 235,486 (7.4%) reads were identified as singletons. The sequences were assembled into 110,031 contigs with an average depth of 17.9&#x000d7; coverage; 90,417 of them were at least 100 base pairs long. The contigs were linked to form 83,166 isotigs in 41,879 isogroups. In addition, 1,123 contigs were entered in the assembly results of isotigs. Those contigs were larger than 500 base pairs and did not belong to any isotigs. Thus, the total number of sequences assembled into isotigs was 84,289. Additionally, 235,486 reads that presented a certain level of redundancy were considered singletons by Newbler. Those sequences were re-assembled using MIRA3. Consequently, 91,926 more reads were assembled, resulting in 37,143 MIRA3 contigs. This step improved the prediction of different gene variants. For example, there are two known variants of the apaf1 gene, and Newbler assembly only predicted one of them, but MIRA3 identified the other variant.

A total of 57,207 SNPs were identified from the Newbler assembly which represents 30,293 contigs assigned to 21,335 isogroups. The average number of putative SNPs in a contig was 1.9 and in an isogroup 2.7. The maximum number of putative SNPs in a contig was 20, and 15,667 contigs had only one putative SNP. On average, one putative SNP was found every 483 bp. The maximum number of putative SNPs in an isogroup was 392, and 13,254 isogroups had at least two SNPs. Similarly, an additional 808 putative SNPs were identified from the MIRA3 assembly. Overall, the putative SNPs would include 37,358 transitions and 20,657 transversions, similar to the 2:1 ratio observed in some but not all species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. To determine the potential for sequence variation to influence gene function we identified the location of putative SNPs in relation to gene sequences based on BLASTx alignments. Overall, 24,479 putative SNPs were determined to fall within exons, 4907 of which were located in the first position of a codon and 4110 the second, both sets expected to impact amino acid sequence and potentially gene function. We also predicted that 15,321 putative SNPs are located in the third position, which as expected is much more than the first and second positions combined. An additional 1322 SNPs were determined to be within exons however discrepancies of SNP positions across multiple alignments resulted in uncertainty of codon position.</p><p>It is likely that some of the putative SNPs are actually paralogous sequence variants (PSVs), and therefore are the result of gene duplication events and not sequence variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. In salmonids we expect a high frequency of PSVs due to an evolutionarily recent genome duplication event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. However, as all the sequences are transcribed differences may still be relevant to gene function as evolutionarily diverged paralogs sometimes have unique expression profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. These putative SNPs will be incorporated into a data set previously isolated from a genomic DNA reduced representation library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>] for genetic analyses in rainbow trout (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> Tables S3 and S4). Although it would be interesting to evaluate these SNPs for allelic specific expression, our combining multiple tissues from multiple individuals for the creation of a normalized library for this experiment would not produce meaningful quantitative data. However, additional studies of these samples using RNA-Seq will permit such an analysis, yet we must first determine how to distinguish differential expression of allelic variants from that of closely related genes resulting from the genome duplication events.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have generated and characterized a reference transcriptome for rainbow trout that represents multiple tissues responding to multiple stressors, and the unique expression portfolios for each.

All RNA samples were diluted in water and pooled together in a 500 ng/&#x003bc;l concentration. Library preparation and sequencing were performed at the Indiana University's Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics.

Briefly, cDNA was synthesized from the RNA pool using primers optimized for GS FLX Titanium sequencing and dsDNA was generated by PCR amplification. Then, cDNA was normalized to reduce sequence coverage of highly expressed transcripts. Accordingly, hybridization and double-stranded nuclease (DSN) digestion were used for the normalization. To optimize sequencing efficiency, libraries were titrated by emulsion PCR/bead enrichment, performed as suggested by Roche 454. Transcriptome sequencing was performed using GS FLX Titanium (Roche 454) pyrosequencing technology.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptome sequence assembly</title><p>The generated rainbow trout cDNA sequence reads were quality trimmed and the adaptor's sequences were removed. Subsequently, GS <italic>De Novo </italic>Assembler (Newbler) v 2.5p1 was used for sequence assembly. Default parameters for the algorithm of transcriptome assembly were selected, except for specific threshold parameters for generating isotigs. To further ensure the quality of the input reads, the contaminant database included in SeqTrim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>] package for screening of contaminant sequences such as those of <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>and cloning vectors was used as the optional trimming database of Newbler, in which a read is screened out if it entirely matches with a sequence in the contaminant database. The transcriptome algorithm of Newbler aligns one read completely or partially to a contig. This pipeline also identifies whether a read is repetitive, a singleton or too short (&#x0003c; 50 base pairs) to be used in the computation, or even if it is problematic for assembly. Portions of repetitive reads were included in the assembly results if they aligned to unique contigs. A unique feature of Newbler v2.3 and higher, is the ability of inferring splice-variants in its transcriptome assembly algorithm, in which all contigs are grouped into collections called isogroups based on the contig branching structures and the contig branching structures in each isogroup are further traversed, resulting in a set of isotigs, each representing a possible traversing path of the contigs in the isogroup. Therefore, there is a hierarchical structure among isogroups, isotigs, and contigs. An isogroup, which is analogous to a gene, is composed of a set of isotigs, which can be thought as all possible isoforms (splicing variants) of the gene; and an isotig contains one or more contigs, which can be roughly considered as exons in the gene as demonstrated by Ewen-Campen <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. In our study, some threshold parameters for generating isotigs were set to the maximum allowed values: the maximum number of isotigs in an isogroup was set to 1000, the maximum number of contigs in an isogroup to 1000, and the maximum number of contigs in one isotig to 200. These parameters enabled the program to generate all possible isotigs for most isogroups. After analysis, several reads were considered singletons by Newbler which included similar sequences, therefore Newbler singleton sequences were re-assembled using MIRA3 (MIRA-3.2.1).</p></sec><sec><title>SNP discovery</title><p>For SNP identification, high quality sequence reads were first screened for repetitive elements with RepeatMasker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>], using the cGRASP Salmon repeat library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>] and the INRA Rainbow Trout repeat library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>] as reference. Using ssaha2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>], repeat masked sequences with less than 100 base pairs of consecutive unmasked bases were mapped to the assembly contigs that were longer than 100 base pairs. Then ssaha_pileup pipeline was used to detect sequence variations among the mapped sequences. In order to increase the accuracy of the prediction, the identified putative SNPs were then further processed. First, putative SNPs having total component reads less than five or the component reads for the minor allele less than two were excluded. Then, to address the homopolymer errors commonly found in 454 sequences, only putative SNPs that were at least 50 base pairs apart from other putative SNPs were included. Additionally, flanking sequences were required to be at least 25 base pairs long. Alignment results for the Newbler isotigs and MIRA3 contigs from the BLASTx phase of the BLAST2GO annotation (see below) process were queried to identify query start, query end, and SNP position. These data were used to identify whether or not the SNP occurred inside an exon; if so they were used to calculate if the SNP is in the first, second or third position of the codon. Only data that was in agreement across all BLASTx alignments for each query was considered a positive result.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence Annotation</title><p>Functional annotations of Newbler isotigs/contigs, MIRA3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>] contigs, and unassembled reads were performed using Blast2GO (B2G) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>], a Gene Ontology (GO) based sequence annotation tool. The Blast step was performed using Blastx search against the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database, with the expectation value threshold set to 1.0e<sup>-6</sup>. Isotigs were first processed with CH-HIT to remove redundant sequences before being used in the annotation step. All isotigs with 90% or higher identities were grouped in one cluster and only a representative from each group was picked for annotation. Functional annotations of Newbler isotigs/contigs and MIRA3 contigs were performed using Blast2GO.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence datasets comparison</title><p>A total of 3,091,890 sequences that had been cleaned of vector and <italic>E. coli </italic>sequences with SeqTrim were compared with the rainbow trout sequences in public available databases using SAHHA2 with the command line parameters: -454 -seeds 5 - score 60 -kmer 13 -skip 4 -diff 0 -output cigar -identity 95.
