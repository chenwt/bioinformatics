Although chromosome ends display similar arrangements in different species, their sequences are highly divergent. In addition, these regions display a particular nucleosomal composition and bind specific factors, therefore producing a special kind of heterochromatin. Using data from currently available draft genomes we have characterized these putative Telomeric Associated Sequences in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>An all-vs-all pairwise comparison of <italic>T. gondii</italic> assembled chromosomes revealed the presence of conserved regions of &#x0223c; 30 Kb located near the ends of 9 of the 14 chromosomes of the genome of the ME49 strain. Sequence similarity among these regions is &#x0223c; 70%, and they are also highly conserved in the GT1 and VEG strains. However, they are unique to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> with no detectable similarity in other Apicomplexan parasites. The internal structure of these sequences consists of 3 repetitive regions separated by high-complexity sequences without annotated genes, except for a gene from the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> Specific Family. ChIP-qPCR experiments showed that nucleosomes associated to these sequences are enriched in histone H4 monomethylated at K20 (H4K20me1), and the histone variant H2A.X, suggesting that they are silenced sequences (heterochromatin). A detailed characterization of the base composition of these sequences, led us to identify a strong long-range compositional bias, which was similar to that observed in other genomic silenced fragments such as those containing centromeric sequences, and was negatively correlated to gene density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We identified and characterized a region present in most <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> assembled chromosomes. Based on their location, sequence features, and nucleosomal markers we propose that these might be part of subtelomeric regions of <italic>T. gondii</italic>. The identified regions display a unique trinucleotide compositional bias, which is shared (despite the lack of any detectable sequence similarity) with other silenced sequences, such as those making up the chromosome centromeres. We also identified other genomic regions with this compositional bias (but no detectable sequence similarity) that might be functionally similar.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1471-2164-15-21) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Toxoplasma gondii</kwd><kwd>Telomeric Associated Sites (TAS)</kwd><kwd>Subtelomeric heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>Trinucleotide compositional bias</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is a widespread obligate intracellular protozoan parasite, member of the phylum Apicomplexa. <italic>T. gondii</italic> has been recognized as an important pathogen for humans, particularly during pregnancy and for immunocompromised patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Toxoplasmosis has been also documented as an economically important disease that has considerable impact on the livestock industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It was for these reasons that <italic>T. gondii</italic> was one of the first protozoan parasites chosen for a genome-sequencing project. And more recently, the genomes of other strains of <italic>T. gondii</italic> were sequenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p><italic>T. gondii</italic> presents a haploid genome of &#x0223c;63 Mb, which is organized in 14 chromosomes that are well conserved in length and number among different strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The genomic DNA sequence, and the way it is organized in the nucleus are fundamental for the correct regulation of cell processes. The level of chromatin condensation, its nucleosome composition and positioning, together with their binding to non-histone nuclear proteins generates the different states of chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Euchromatin is a gene-rich decondensed chromatin, where transcription is facilitated, whereas heterochromatin is a gene-poor condensed chromatin, refractory to transcription. A general and very simplified rule is that euchromatin is active chromatin where nucleosomes are enriched in histones H3 and H4 acetylated (H3ac/H4ac), and H3 tri-methylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3); whereas constitutive heterochromatin nucleosomes are enriched in histone H3 di- and tri-methylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me2/3), which binds Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) forming a compact chromatin. These epigenetic marks are conserved from yeast to humans, and <italic>T. gondii</italic> is not an exception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Also, histones H2A and H2B, which are less conserved than H3 and H4, have several variants that contribute differently to the chromatin state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We have previously characterized histones H2A and H2B in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, and found the presence of a histone H2B variant (H2Bv) which is only present in protozoans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], recently renamed as H2B.Z [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and two H2A variants: H2A.X and H2A.Z [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We have also observed that H2A.Z and H2B.Z are enriched in active promoters, whereas H2A.X is associated to silenced promoters and heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thus, these modified histones and histone variants can be used in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> as epigenetic markers of euchromatin and heterochromatin.</p><p>In constitutive heterochromatin, two specialized domains can be readily identified, the centromere and the telomeres. The centromere is a genetic locus, where the spindle fibers attach to the chromosomes forming the kinetochore, and is required for proper chromosome segregation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]). Centromeric DNA sequences are not conserved among species, and they differ even between chromosomes in the same organism. However, the centromeric chromatin in all organisms studied to date, contains the histone H3 variant CENP-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The telomeres, on the other hand, are located at the chromosome ends and contain the telomeric repeats and the subtelomeric region, sometimes denominated Telomeric Associated Sequence (or TAS). Basically, telomeres are composed of a tract of simple repeats (like TTAGGG in humans and trypanosomatids), followed by the subtelomere that comprises repetitive elements and, in some cases, subtelomeric genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In general, these subtelomeric genes are associated with different stress responses, whose expression is regulated by the Telomeric Position Effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Telomeres and subtelomeres replicate late in the S-phase of cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The repetitive elements seem to be involved in blocking replication initiation in the subtelomeric regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and favoring their nuclear-periphery localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Although the features of chromosome ends are highly conserved, the DNA sequences are specific to each species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. TASs, as well as centromeres, display a specialized type of chromatin, with a particular nucleosome composition and a set of associated proteins responsible of its highly condensed state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, only a few heterochromatin-associated proteins have been described to date, including the histone markers mentioned above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and the recently described TgChromo1 with a peri-centromeric localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Concerning constitutive heterochromatin, only centromeres were identified. Centromeric sequences were determined as genomic regions enriched in cenH3 (<italic>Toxoplasma</italic> CENP-A homologous) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thus, <italic>T. gondii</italic> heterochromatin characteristics, composition, regulation, and distribution across the genome are still to be discovered.</p><p>In many protozoan pathogens, such as <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, <italic>Leishmania major</italic>, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and some yeast, the subtelomeric genes are contingency genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These are sets of genes responsible for pathogen diversity and for the clonal phenotype switches often associated with the parasite&#x02019;s escape from the host immune system. In the Apicomplexan parasite <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, chromosome ends consist of the telomeric repeat (T(G/A)AAGGG)n followed by a telomere-associated repetitive elements (TARE1-6) organized in six blocks flanked with the members of the <italic>var, stevor</italic> and <italic>rif</italic> multi-gene families responsible for the antigenic variation and cytoadhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. TASs in this parasite also present a specialized chromatin, different from the rest of the genome, rich in nucleosomes containing H3K9me3 and the histone deacetylase PfSir2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Despite the importance and growing evidence of the effect of telomeres and subtelomeres on the expression of surrounding genes and DNA replication timing modulation, in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> telomeres have not yet been analyzed; probably because clustered contingency genes at chromosome ends have not been described in this apicomplexan parasite, and/or because the chromosome ends are not completely assembled in the current available genomes. In this study we describe putative subtelomeric sequences in <italic>T. gondii</italic> assembled chromosomes, their nucleosome and nucleotide composition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Several <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>chromosome ends display significant sequence similarity</title><p>Subtelomeric sequences show extensive similarity across multiple chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This has also been observed in other Apicomplexa parasites such as <italic>Plasmodium</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], where they have been called &#x0201c;Telomeric Associated Sequences&#x0201d; (TASs). Therefore, we decided to use an all-vs-all BLAST comparison of assembled chromosomes to identify putative subtelomeric sequences in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. We validated this bioinformatic strategy using the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 genome assembly (PlasmoDB v8.2, where TASs were already identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]). In <italic>Plasmodium</italic> we observed that similarities among chromosomes were restricted to telomeric and subtelomeric sequences (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>A), and to regions in the center of the chromosomes 4, 6, 7, 8, and 12 that also contain subtelomeric genes, and are enriched in H3K9me3 a histone mostly restricted to telomeres in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We next performed the same all-vs-all BLAST comparison using <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> chromosomal assemblies of the ME49 genome (TgME49), obtained from ToxoDB version 7.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As a result, we identified a conserved region of approximately 30 Kb at the end of 9 out of the 14 chromosomes with high identity among them (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>B). Because these sequences present the same pattern of sequence similarity observed in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> subtelomeric regions, we denominated them <italic>T. gondii</italic> TAS-like sequences (TgTAS-like or TgTASL). These TAS-like regions were found in <italic>T. gondii</italic> chromosomes Ia, II, III, IV, V, IX, X, XI and XII; with chromosomes III and X containing two such regions each. The similarity among the different TgTASL and their localization can be observed in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A. In the figure, chromosomes are laid out in a circle, and blocks of sequence similarity longer than 180 bp and with &#x0003e;80% sequence identity are represented with ribbons; those corresponding to TgTASL sequences are highlighted in red. Consequently, black ribbons in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> correspond to other inter-chromosome repeated sequences, which most of them correspond to the mitochondrial-like repeats (data not shown) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Interestingly, at the end of chromosome XI and the begining of VIIb there are short sequences similar to TgTASL (red links Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>B). These sequences were not included in our analysis because they were too short, but they could represent TgTAS-like regions that were not correctly assembled. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> A also shows an additional data track corresponding to the annotated genes in the ME49 genome. A closer inspection of the TgTASL regions shows that they are depleted of genes, with the exception of only one gene located next to one end of the TgTASL region (blue arrows in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Telomeric-associated sequences are shared between</bold>

To uncover such patterns in our TgTASL regions, we performed detailed dotplots for the pairwise comparisons of them using Dotter (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. These plots allowed us to define the limits and organization of each TgTASL region. These limits were arbitrarily restricted to the shared (consensus) sequence present in all TgTAS-like regions. The location of these regions in each chromosome is shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. We named each TgTASL based on the chromosome number where it is located (for example TgTASL_Ia is the TgTASL of chromosome Ia). In cases where more than one TgTAS-like was present in a chromosome, we added a letter suffix (&#x0201c;-a&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;-b&#x0201d;, etc.) to reflect this fact (for example in chromosome III there is one TgTASL_III-a near the chromosome end and a second TgTASL_III-b towards the centromere, see Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A, and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). It is important to highlight that there are other genomic sequences that were excluded from our analysis because they are shared among a few chromosomes but do not present a conserved pattern (for example the sequences between TgTASL_III-a and _III-b which are also present at the end of chromosome IX and Ia). Nevertheless, this observation suggests that TgTAS-like regions could be larger than we describe here and/or that other sequences with similar characteristics can be found.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

These repetitive blocks were separated by non-repetitive DNA fragments which we denominated as Fragments A to C, respectively (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>A). Each TgTARE was analyzed with Tandem Repeat Finder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In all cases, the tandemly repeated unit was similar but not identical in size and sequence. Their sizes were &#x0223c; 350 bp or &#x0223c; 680 bp for TgTARE1, &#x0223c; 250&#x02013;300 bp for TgTARE2, and &#x0223c; 250&#x02013;300 bp for TgTARE3 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>B). The identity of these repeats was analyzed by BLAST. Interestingly, TgTARE1 belongs to the satellite DNA Sat350/Sat680 family already described to be near <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> telomeres by Bal31 digestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and also detected in <italic>Neospora caninum</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Another <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> element already described to be present at the end of several chromosomes is TgIRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This element was found to be part of every TgTASL, located contiguous to the TgTARE3 in Fragment C (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>A).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

Except for one gene localized at the end of every Fragment C (see Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>A), the lack of transcript expression and protein expression data mapped to these regions suggest that TgTASL are mostly silent and/or gene-free DNA. The single gene located at the end of Fragment C is a hypothetical protein annotated as a member of the &#x02018;<italic>Toxoplasma</italic> Specific Family&#x02019; (TSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Interestingly, the chromosomal location of TSF family members is restricted to the TgTASL region. Based on this observation, we could identify two extra members of this family: TGME49_098060 as TSF11, and TGME49_100990 as TSF12 (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>C). All these findings confirm that TgTAS-like regions have a conserved canonical structure.</p><p>All TSF genes are apparently transcribed; they have associated EST and RNA-seq data, as well as H3K9ac and H3K4me3 peaks that indicate the presence of an active promoter. In addition, the transcript levels of these genes seem to vary among parasite strains (type I, II, and III), stages (tachyzoite, bradyzoite, sporozoite), and/or cell cycle (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>C, expression evidence at ToxoDB v7.3). However, only TgTSF8 has evidence of expression at the protein level (mass spectrometry evidence at ToxoDB v7.3). This behavior is similar to the one described for subtelomeric genes. Further studies should be performed to elucidate the role of TSF members.</p><p>Comparing TgTASL chromosome coordinates (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and their DNA strand location (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), it is clearly evident that these genomic elements have a defined orientation. TgTARE1 is located at the beginning of the TgTASL, whereas the TSF is at the end of the element, being in the forward strand when it is located at the beginning of the chromosome, and in the reverse strand when it is located at the end of it. Therefore, TgTARE1 will be closer to the telomere and TSF toward the centromere. This is true for all TgTASL except for TgTASL_IV and TgTASL_IX, which are in an inverted orientation: they are both at end of the chromsome but in the forward strand. Interestingly, in the current genome assembly (ToxoDB v9.0) the TgTASL_IX is now at the end of chromosome XII in the reverse strand, as observed for the rest of the TgTASL sequences (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>G); hence, TgTASL_IV is the unique TgTAS-like region with a different orientation.</p><p>It is expected that subtelomeres start next to the tract of telomeric repeats. In <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> the TgTASL are located at the ends of chromosomal assemblies, but their proximity to the telomeric repeats is hard to determine because the chromosome ends are not completely assembled. In <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> the telomeric repeat seems to be TTTAGGG. Tracts of this repeat are assembled only at the end of chromosomes Ia, X and XI, and at the beginning of chromosomes III and XI. Only one TgTASL is close to them, TgTASL_XI, which is next to the telomeric repeat (data not shown). In other cases (TgTASL_Ia, _X, and _XII), where telomeric repeats are not assembled, the TgTASL are the first or last sequence region in assembled chromosomes (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>F). Except for TgTASL_IV, all TgTAS-like are within the 6% final portion of each chromosome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>F). Therefore, in general, these regions are either next to or in close proximity to telomeres. Recently, more repeat tracts of TTTAGGG have been assembled (ToxoDB v9.0). They can be observed at both ends of chromosomes Ib, III, XI, IV y VIIa, at the beginning of chromosomes VI and VIIb, and at the end of chromosomes Ia, IX y XII. They appear in the forward strand when they are the first chromosomal sequence element, and in the reverse strand when they are the last one. In this assembly, there is another TgTASL close to a telomeric repeat, TgTASL_III-a. There are &#x0223c; 50 Kb between the telomeric repeat and this TgTASL, where there are not annotated genes (Genome Browser in ToxoDB v9.0). Other curious observation is that the telomeric repeat at the end of chromosome IV is not so close to the end, and it is in the forward strand. Interestingly, it is &#x0223c; 60 Kb upstream the TgTASL_IV, which is the unique TgTASL at the end of a chromosome in the forward strand. In addition, the genomic sequence between the telomeric repeat and this TgTASL does not contain any annotated genes, as occur with TgTASL_III-a.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>TgTAS-like regions present a special nucleosomal composition, enriched in heterochromatin markers</title><p>Several sequences located within TgTAS-like regions were previously reported to hold characteristics of silent chromatin. Satellite DNA Sat350, (corresponding to TgTARE1) was shown to be enriched in the heterochromatin histone markers H4K20 mono- and tri-methylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In addition, there is a group of small RNAs identified in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> that perfectly map to Sat350 repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], probably contributing to their heterochromatin state. On the other hand, we already published that TgIRE, localized in Fragment C, is enriched in the heterochromatin markers H4K20me1 and H2A.X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Almost the rest of Fragment C corresponds to the TSF gene sequence. These genes are rich in H3K4me1 whithin the entire gen body, as it is observed for most genes in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (ToxoDB Genome Browser). Based on the availability of these previous data, we decided to analyzed the presence of these markers in sequences within Fragment A by ChIP-qPCR, together with the euchromatic histone markers H3ac, H2A.Z and H2B.Z [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The amplified sequences specifically match Fragment A of TgTASL_II, _V and _XII (triangles in Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B); where it was possible to design primers in order to obtain unique and specific products. In all cases, the ChIP-qPCR profile observed was similar, being enriched in heterochromatin markers (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The sag1 promoter was used as a control of active chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These data increase the evidence supporting the idea that TgTAS-like regions are indeed silenced domains of the chromosomes, in agreement with the data presented above.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>

In this section, the analysis performed with the ME49 (type III) genome data was extended to the genomes of the GT1 (type I) and VEG (type II) strains (data available in ToxoDB). Using the same BLAST strategy to detect similarity among chromosomes, all the TgTAS-like elements detected in ME49 were also detected in these two lineages (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In addition, we compared all identified TgTASL among strains. In all cases, the TgTASL regions were syntenic (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>), and the pairwise identity between each TgTASL and its syntenic partners in other strains was &#x0003e;96%. Furthermore, a new TgTASL regions was found in chromosomes VI of the VEG and GT1 strains (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which was not previously detected in ME49 chromosomal assemblies. We took advantage of the high identity between TAS-like regions in the three lineages, and used TgTASL_VI of GT1 and VEG to perform BLAST searches in ME49 contigs that were left out of the chromosomal assembly. Sequences corresponding to a putative TgTASL_VI could be identified in the ME49 contigs DS984876, DS984831, DS984825 (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The presence of additional sequences similar to TgTAS-like was examined in contigs and scaffolds, in the three strains: ME49, GT1 and VEG. Several sequences were retrieved, including contigs/scaffolds containing a complete TgTASL (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>E). These could represent assembly artifacts, or <italic>bona fide</italic> TgTASL regions that could not be accommodated properly in the current assembly. In total, we detected twelve TgTASL regions distributed in 10 chromosomes (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a new <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> ME49 genome assembly was made available in ToxoDB (version 9.0 release, September 2013). Although most of the TgTASL regions are conserved in the two assemblies, some differences could be observed. In the newest version there are two extra TgTASL regions, one at the opposite end of chromosome II, and one in chromosome X, upstream of TgTASL_ X-a (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>F); in addition to the relocation of TgTASL_IX. Overall, this suggests, together with the sequences found in scaffolds, that there may be additional TgTAS-like sequences. The current draft nature of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> genome currently prevents us from knowing if both chromosome ends are covered with these TAS-like sequences.</p><p>Finally, we also investigated the conservation of these TgTAS-like regions in other coccidian genomes available in ToxoDB (<italic>Neospora caninum</italic> and <italic>Eimeria tenella</italic>). BLAST searches using TgTASL sequences as query only revealed matching sequences with low similarity to these genomes. Besides, TgTASL sequences do not present detectable similarity to other Apicomplexan genomes available in EuPathDB. By using the same intra-species all-vs-all chromosomal comparisons used before, we could identify two putative <italic>N. caninum</italic> TAS-like regions in Nc chromosomes VIIa and VIIb, as well as other related DNA fragments (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>D, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The presence of a conserved structure of repetitive elements in these NcTASL regions were evaluated by pairwise comparisons using Dotter. Dotplots with representative results are shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>. In this analysis it is clear that NcTASL also present a conserved pattern, consisting of two blocks of repeats separated by non- repetitive DNA (first two dotplots of the first two rows in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). However, the similarity between NcTASL and TgTASL is extremely low (three last panels of the first two rows in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Consequently, TgTAS-like regions are composed of sequences that are unique to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>TgTAS-like show a unique bias in trinucleotide composition</title><p>Because TgTAS-like regions are depleted of genes and are localized near chromosome ends, we reasoned that they might present a different base composition from the rest of the genome. We thus investigated a number of ways to identify compositional bias in these sequences. For this, we analyzed the nucleotide composition of these regions using different metrics, which are all independent of linear sequence similarity. The trinucleotide composition of TgTAS-like sequences was used in our case to identify diagnostic biases. Our measure of compositional bias simultaneously considered all 64 trinucleotides across a given sequence using a multivariate statistical technique (Correspondence Analysis, see Methods).</p><p>Correspondence Analysis (CA) is a powerful statistical technique to explore high-dimensional categorical data. The trinucleotide composition of a DNA sequence is one such dataset; with each dimension/column measuring the count of a different trinucleotide (there are 64 trinucleotides/dimensions) in different genomic fragments (rows). The aim in a correspondence analysis is to identify trends in the variation of data and associations among datapoints. CA has been successfully applied to the study of synonymous codon usage bias associated with high levels of expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Using this technique, it is possible to summarize and explore most of the 64-dimensional information using only a few representative axes. This allows visual representations in 2- dimensional plots (also known as &#x0201c;CA maps&#x0201d;) that capture the most influential trends that define the compositional bias.</p><p>We performed a CA of trinucleotide composition of the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> ME49 genome, using different fragments lengths (see Methods). This analysis allowed us to compare the trinucleotide composition of TgTASL fragments to that of the genome. As a result of this analysis we found that TgTASL regions display a unique trinucleotide composition. They are highly enriched in TAA, TAG, ATT (and their reverse complements TTA, CTA, AAT), moderately enriched in other trinucleotides such as TAG/CTA, ATG/CAT, TGA/TCA, while depleted of AGA/TCT, CTC/GAG and CGC/GCG (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In this compositional signature, both the enrichment and the under-representation of some trinucleotides is important to explain TgTASL composition preferences. This compositional bias was not detected at 1 Kb nucleotide fragments, but it was significant at 10 Kb, and peaked at 40&#x02013;50 Kb resolution (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> left axis, relative bias), which is the average size of TgTASL regions. For larger window sizes, the composition of different TgTAS-like containing fragments begins to diverge due to mixture of different genomic contexts within the same window (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, right axis, TgTASL fragments compactness). CA maps for all window lengths are shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>. Interestingly, a similar trinucleotide bias was also observed in centromeres (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>), which are also gene-depleted genomic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], but without any similarity at sequence level among them and/or with TgTAS-like regions.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>

Distances between dots and triangles have no meaning, however, the directions of dots and triangles from the origin (0,0) are meaningful (e.g. fragments on the right of the origin use more TAA, CTA, ATT (and their reverse complements TTA, TAG, AAT) and less AGA, CTC and CGC (and reverse complements TCT, GAG and GCG), whereas the opposite is true for the fragments lying on the left of the origin).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2013_7001_Fig4_HTML" id="d30e1206"/></fig><fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>

The second trend, represented as the 2nd principal coordinate (vertical axis in Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which is independent to the 1st one (CA produces orthogonal axes by design), is lead by one trinucleotide pair (ATA, TAT).

A group of such non-TgTASL regions are the centromeric sequences, which are also gene-poor regions. To further explore the observed relationship between trinucleotide bias and coding potential we calculated a gene density index across the genome, and compared this to the trinculeotide bias (1PC in Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

Genomic fragments with low 1PC values are exclusively gene-rich while high 1PC values are associated to gene-poor or gene-depleted regions, such as TgTAS-like regions and centromeres (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This is also consistent with the observed over-representation of stop codons in sequences with high 1PC values. Genomic regions with similar TgTAS-like compositional bias were identified at every chromosome end (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>), which might correspond to other subtelomeric sequences.

Even though these three components vary between species, telomeric function is conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Here we have identified and characterized a number of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> TAS-like regions, which are localized near several chromosome ends, and are specific for <italic>T. gondii</italic>. They have features similar to those observed in other subtelomeric sequences like blocks of repeats, stress-asociated genes, and a heterochromatin-like structure, based on the presence of informative histones and histone post-translational modifications.</p><p>Even though the <italic>T. gondii</italic> genome was recently further sequenced and re-assembled, the subtelomeres of this important parasite were not identified or characterized. Telomeres and subtelomeric sequences are noticeably hard to assemble when using shotgun sequencing. This is because the telomeric repeat is identical in all chromosomes and therefore cannot be used to distinguish one telomere from another. Furthermore, they are not expected to be well represented in the Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) libraries used to guide the scaffolding and chromosomal assembly of draft genomes, due to the size-selection of recombinant DNA clones and the natural genomic instability of these regions. Finally, they provide large similarity segments that are rich in repetitive sequences, which are the cause of frequent assembly errors. Using the current chromosomal assemblies, we mapped TgTAS-like sequences to a conserved region of 30 Kb located at the end of most chromosomes. We defined the extent of these regions based on the consensus TgTAS-like structure present in most chromosomes. However, it is reasonable to consider that the actual size of each TgTASL may be larger. In this regard, the fact that the trinucleotide compositional bias peaks at 40-50Kb provides an independent estimate for the extent of these regions.</p><p>In all cases, the identified TgTASL regions displayed a similar structural pattern, consisting of three telomeric associated repeats (TgTARE 1-3), with a single member of the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> Specific Family, separated by silenced DNA. These TgTASL regions have a clear chromosomal orientation, with the TgTARE1 towards the telomere, and the TSF gene towards the centromere; similar to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> TASs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Nevertheless, several exceptions were detected in the ME49 genome that still remain in the new genome assembly (ToxoDB 9.0). In chromosomes III and X there are two consecutive TgTASL regions, and in chromosome IV, the TgTASL_IV is inverted (its TgTARE1 is towards the centromere and the TSF gene towards the telomere). These unusual features, which so far are unique to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> genomes, as well as the presence of TAS-like regions at only one end of the chromosomes, could be explained by simple chromosomal rearrangements, probably with functional consequences. However, they could also be explained by artifacts of the genome sequencing and/or assembly. Several observations support this last possibility: changes in the chromosome location and number observed between TgTAS-like regions in two different genome assemblies (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>F); the relocation of TgTASL_IX which is now located at the end of chromosome XII with the expected orientation; and the absence of BAC-end sequences connecting TgTASL regions with the rest of the assembled chromosome, as in the case of TgTASL_IV (ToxoDB Genome Browser; see also Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> in Khan <italic>et al.</italic> publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]).

TgChromo1 is the HP1 chromobox homologue. A number of studies focused on this protein provide additional evidence that TgTAS-like regions are embedded in a typical heterochromatin environment. Although TgChromo1 is mainly associated with pericentromeric heterochromatin, IFA-FISH experiments have shown that TgChromo1 is also in close proximity to repeats present at the end of chromosome Ia and IX at the nuclear periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Interestingly, the chromosome Ia probe used by Gissot <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] corresponds to TgTARE1, suggesting that TgTASL elements could be located at the nuclear periphery. In a separate set of ChIP- qPCR experiments, Braun <italic>et al.</italic> detected an enrichment of H4K20me1 and H3K9me1 heterochromatin marks associated with the Sat350 repetitive element (which would be TgTARE1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. We also revealed the enrichment of H4K20me1 and H2A.X (another silencing-associated histone in <italic>T. gondii</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]) in fragment A from three TgTASL, and also in TgIRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, Braun <italic>et al.</italic> uncovered the presence of repeat-associated siRNAs in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, which map to Sat350 (TgTARE1) and Sat529a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. It remains to be seen if these satellite-associated RNAs are involved in heterochromatin formation and/or in the regulation of longer telomeric noncoding RNA resembling the TERRA RNA from other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p>Genes that are close to subtelomeric regions have been implicated in a wide array of stress responses or niche adaptive roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This is also true for a number of important human pathogens, including <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, <italic>L. major</italic>, and <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, where so called contingency gene families are located embedded within or just next to the subtelomeric repeats. <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> contains several distinct, coccidian-specific multicopy gene families throughout its genome, including those that encode the SRS, ROPK, and SUSA proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Recently, a bioinformatics study showed that 60 out of the 144 ME49 SRS genes (42%) are located in subtelomeric sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. However, none of these genes are near TgTAS-like regions in the current genome assembly. We only detected one <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> specific family (TSF) member [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These TSF members were also found in VEG and GT1 <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains. Judging by the sequence, length, and number of TM domains, this family presents a high diversity among their members (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>C). Moreover, such diversity extends to their expression profiles, as the apparent expression of each TSF gene varies among different strains, life cycle stages, and/or throughout the cell cycle (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>C). Notwithstanding this, there is mass spectrometry evidence for only one TSF member, according with the experimental data available in ToxoDB version 7.3. Although the function of TSF genes is unknown, their expression profiles resemble those of tightly regulated genes associated to parasite adaptation to the environment (differences between species), or virulence (differences between strain). Hence, they could be proposed as <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> stress and/or contingency response genes. Notably, recent RNAseq experiments revealed some discrepancies between transcripts and annotated genes, and supported the existence of new genes and/or putative non-coding RNAs ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], and RNAseq evidences in ToxoDB v9.0). Some of these RNAseq transcripts can be detected within several TgTASL, suggesting there might be more genes present in these regions.</p><p>The trinucleotide composition of TgTASL DNA displays a strong bias when analyzing genomic fragments greater than &#x0223c;5 Kb. However this bias it not evident below this size, indicating that this is a long-range bias. The major compositional trend is associated with the relatively high frequency of stop codons in these regions, in correlation with the absence of genes. However, the trinucleotides TAA, TAG and TGA (together with their reverse complements) which are read as Stop codons within coding sequences, only contribute to 17.4% of this major trend. Other trinucleotides, not particularly associated with non-coding sequences, such as the pairs CTC/GAG, AGA/TCT, CGC/GCG, AAT/ATT, GTA/TAC have larger contributions to this major trend (in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>H). For example, the trinucleotide pairs AAT/ATT (enriched) and AGA/TCT (depleted) together represent 19.6% of the bias in the major trend, and show a clustering pattern of TgTAS-like and centromeric sequences similar to the one observed for the stop codons (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the second most relevant trend at &#x0223c;40 Kb is led by a single trinucleotide pair ATA/TAT. These trinucleotides also represent the major trend (1PC) at shorter fragments (1Kb). Although, there are other AT-rich trinucleotides such as ATA/TAT and TTA/TAA, they define two major independent trends, respectively. The trinucleotides ATA/TAT (but not TTA/TAA), which also govern the compositional bias at shorter window sizes, are part of microsatellite-like sequences (TpA dinucleotide repeats). These TpA tracts have the lowest base stacking energy, and therefore the greatest flexibility for unwinding the DNA (like in the TATA box); consecuently, they provide interesting functional features to these genomic territories in <italic>T. gondii</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p>All observed trinucleotide frequencies were approximately identical to the frequency of their reverse-complementary trinucleotides in the <italic>T. gondii</italic> genome (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These correlations between a trinucleotide and its reverse complement were evident even at windows of size 5 Kb, and strongly increase for larger fragments. We constructed these CA maps with trinucleotide counts obtained from a single-strand of each chromosome to show an important consequence of this fact: TgTAS-like regions located in the positive strand cluster together with negative-strand TAS (i.e. their trincucleotide compositions are highly similar), even though their sequences are completely different (they are reverse-complements). This forward/reverse- complement symmetry of trinucleotide frequencies is part of a more general property: Chargaff&#x02019;s second parity rule. This rule states that within a single strand of double-stranded DNA, each oligonucleotide occurs with approximately the same frequency as its reverse-complement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. This observation has been verified for &#x0201c;sufficiently long&#x0201d; (&#x0003e;100 Kb) genomic sequences, in a wide range of sequenced genomes of bacteria and eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Here we confirm that this is also true within the TgTAS- like regions of &#x0223c;40 Kb in <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p><p>Finally, it is also noteworthy that the major trend (1PC) in trinucleotide composition allows the separation of TgTAS-like regions from the rest of the genome. This essentially means that TgTASL represent some of the most peculiar regions of the genome when looked at the level of trinucleotide composition. Other genomic regions that share the same compositional bias are centromeric fragments, most of the chromosome ends in the current assembly, as well as other chromosomal internal regions (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). We propose that this compositional bias may be associated with a more general property of these regions, such as their preferred chromatin state. However, further studies will need to be performed to elucidate the functional features shared by all these regions in <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this work we have identified and described a number of chromosomal regions, that present a special long-range compositional bias, are gene-poor, and enriched in repeats and in heterochromatin-associated histones.

In addition, this long range compositional bias was also detected in other <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> gene-poor genomic regions that do not share any sequence similarity among them.

A number of contigency tables of size 64 x <italic>L</italic> were built by counting the number of each trinculeotide in every genomic fragment of length <italic>L</italic>. CA is an exploratory multivariate statistical technique used to decompose the contingency table variability and extract coordinates that explain major trends in the inertia of the table [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Inertia is defined as the total Pearson&#x02019;s Chi- Square of the 2-way table divided by the total sum and can be interpreted as a global measure of the data&#x02019;s deviation from expected values under the hypothesis of homogeneity (where all genomic fragments would have similar trinucleotide profiles). Correspondence Analysis was performed using the R package CA ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]). CA plots shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref> are symmetric maps displaying the 2 principal dimensions with most of the trinucleotide variability (rows and columns in principal coordinates). To determine trinucleotide bias associated with TgTAS-like regions, we considered genome fragments containing complete TgTASL regions as well as those fragments where the annotated TgTASL region would cover &#x0003e;80% of the window length. Average deviation of these fragments (<italic>i.e.</italic> TgTAS-like trinucleotide bias, or inertia in the CA theory) from the origin (position representing the expected composition under homogeneity of trinucleotide frequencies) was calculated, and then divided by the average deviation of all genomic fragments to derive a measure of TgTASL-specific bias. This was repeated for all window lengths (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, left axis). The compactness of TgTAS- like fragments was evaluated by measuring disimilarity in trinucleotide space, calculated as the mean of all TgTAS-like inter-fragments distances relative to the mean inter fragments distances considering all genomic fragments (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, right axis). To explore the relation between trinucleotide bias (at 40 Kb window length) and gene density, we calculated a gene coverage index defined as the proportion of bases covered by gene annotations (CDS, gene annotation from ToxoDB 01/2012). The gene coverage index was plotted against a 40 Kb trinucleotide bias index, which is simply the first principal coordinate of the CA.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec15"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12864_2013_7001_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>1: <bold>Pairwise comparisons between chromsomes.</bold> ACT visualization of chromosome similarities.
