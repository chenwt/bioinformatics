An example of this class of proteins is the mRNA-targeting endoribonuclease SOX from the gamma-herpesvirus Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Previous studies indicated that cleavage of messenger RNAs (mRNA) by SOX occurs at specific locations defined by the sequence of the target RNA, which is at odds with the down-regulation of a large portion of cellular transcripts. In this study, we address this paradox by using high-throughput sequencing of cleavage intermediates combined with a custom bioinformatics-based analysis pipeline to identify SOX cleavage sites across the mRNA transcriptome. These data, coupled with targeted mutagenesis, reveal that while cleavage sites are specific and reproducible, they are defined by a degenerate sequence motif containing a small number of conserved residues rather than a strong consensus sequence. This degenerate element is well represented in both human and KSHV mRNA, and its presence correlates with RNA destabilization by SOX. This represents a new endonuclease targeting strategy, in which use of a degenerate targeting element enables RNA cleavage at specific locations without restricting the range of targets. Furthermore, it shows that strong target selectivity can be achieved without a high degree of sequence specificity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The human tumor virus Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus uses a messenger RNA (mRNA)-targeting nuclease called SOX to cut cellular RNAs, thereby controlling gene expression in infected cells. How SOX causes destruction of the majority of mRNAs while at the same time achieving target and cut site specificity has remained unknown. To resolve this paradox, we mapped the location of SOX cut sites across the human RNA transcriptome, and confirmed that SOX recognizes specific RNA sequences. These sequences have some conserved features but are otherwise quite distinct. Thus, SOX uses a degenerate motif to achieve broad targeting capability while preserving cut site specificity within the RNA. Little is currently known about the targeting mechanisms of many host and viral ribonucleases, and thus these data provide a framework for understanding how these proteins may operate.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the following grants to BAG: NIH CA136367, NIH CA160556, Burroughs Wellcome Foundation Investigators in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease Award, and a W.M.

Viral factors from many different families including herpesviruses, coronaviruses and orthomyxoviruses either directly cut RNAs or indirectly stimulate RNA cleavages in an endonucleolytic fashion [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Cellular RNA exonucleases are then recruited to degrade the fragments, resulting in a reduction in RNA and consequently protein levels [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite the fact that the proposed role of most of these host shutoff ribonucleases (RNases) is to modulate immune responses, they are generally thought to have little or no specificity and to affect host messenger RNAs (mRNAs) indiscriminately. However, increasing evidence suggests that this view may be overly simplistic, and that some of the RNases display selectivity for or against specific targets [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This type of specificity may provide an additional level of regulation in viral control of the host transcriptome. How this selectivity is achieved and how it is balanced with the widespread shutoff phenotype remain open questions.</p><p>The SOX family of proteins from gamma-herpesviruses is an example of a viral RNase that displays both broad targeting of RNAs and a poorly understood level of selectivity. Gamma-herpesviruses include the human pathogens Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), which causes Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma as well as lymphomas in immunocompromised individuals and remains a leading cause of cancer-linked death in sub-Saharan Africa. The SOX (ORF37) protein is expressed early during the lytic cycle of KSHV infection and its expression triggers RNA degradation, which is recapitulated by expression of the protein alone [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Homologs of SOX in the other human gamma-herpesvirus, Epstein Barr virus (EBV BGLF5), and in the model murine pathogen murine herpesvirus 68 (MHV68 muSOX) also degrade RNA in cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Studies in MHV68 suggest that host shutoff by the SOX family of proteins is crucial for viral replication in specific cell types and for systemic spread of the virus and establishment of a latent infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Transcriptomic studies of mRNA levels during KSHV or MHV68 infection and in cells overexpressing SOX demonstrate that this family of proteins triggers the degradation of a majority of both host and viral transcripts [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, in-depth mechanistic studies of SOX reveal a more complex picture. SOX targets mRNAs, as opposed to non-coding RNA species, a specificity that is related to the association of SOX with polyribosomes [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, selected transcripts, like the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and apoptosis enhancing nuclease (AEN) [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], are spared from SOX-mediated decay. In the case of IL-6, protection is conferred by the presence of a protective sequence in the 3&#x02019; untranslated region (UTR) [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but AEN appears to be intrinsically resistant to SOX mediated degradation [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], without a clear protective element in its sequence. The most unexpected observation, however, is that KSHV SOX and EBV BGLF5 cut RNAs at specific locations that appear to be determined by an unknown targeting element [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These specific cleavages become apparent upon knockdown of the human RNase Xrn1, the major 5&#x02019;-3&#x02019;&#x02013;directed RNase in eukaryotic cells, which is responsible for clearing the 3&#x02019; RNA fragments generated by these RNases [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This ability of SOX to cut at specific locations within mRNA yet target the majority of transcripts argues for a degenerate targeting motif.</p><p>In general, the principles guiding the positioning of RNA cleavages by cellular and viral mRNA endonucleases are not well understood. In the case of endonucleases, the term &#x0201c;sequence specificity&#x0201d; is sometimes used to refer to preferential cutting at specific dimers, often inferred from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (for example in Datta et al. [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). However, this specificity cannot explain cutting of RNAs at single locations in mRNAs. Additional specificity can be conferred by localization of the target mRNA to a specific site in the cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or proximity to a &#x0201c;landmark&#x0201d; feature on the RNA, such as the 5&#x02019; of the transcript [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] or the stop codon location [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The SOX targeting system is unprecedented because the sequence of the targeting element alone appears to direct cleavages in mRNA, and because the targeting element is longer than 25 nt [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>To address how SOX specificity is mediated, we applied a degradome sequencing technique called parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE) [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] to map cleavage sites of the SOX protein across the human transcriptome. Development of a stringent Python-based analysis algorithm, which we term PyDegradome, allowed identification of SOX-dependent cuts at specific locations across the mRNA transcriptome. The sequences surrounding these sites contained no strong consensus sequence, but rather a degenerate sequence pattern that nonetheless conferred specificity when analyzed experimentally in endogenous mRNA targets. The presence of a more complex targeting motif explains how SOX achieves cleavage specificity without sacrificing target breadth, and offers a framework for understanding how additional viral and cellular endonucleases may operate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Development of a novel bioinformatics pipeline to detect high-confidence SOX cleavage sites across the transcriptome following PARE</title><p>Prior analyses of individual mRNAs indicated that the KSHV RNase SOX cuts at specific locations within the RNA, in a manner dependent on the sequence surrounding the cleavage site [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. By performing 5&#x02019; rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5&#x02019; RACE) on the GFP reporter mRNA, we found that the GFP mRNA was cleaved in the same location regardless of whether SOX was transiently expressed in 293T cells or expressed from the KSHV genome in lytically-reactivated iSLK.219 cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). This is in agreement with the fact that SOX activity does not rely on any additional viral proteins, and that its cleavage activity can be studied in transfected cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>To dissect the specificity of SOX cleavage across the mRNA transcriptome, we designed an approach to map SOX cleavage sites in endogenous mRNAs using PARE [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. PARE is an RNA-seq based methodology that allows mapping of the 5&#x02019; ends of uncapped, phosphorylated RNA species, such as mRNA degradation fragments (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). As we previously found that the SOX degradation intermediates are cleared by the host 5&#x02019;-3&#x02019; exonuclease Xrn1 [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], we stabilized degradation intermediates in 293T cells expressing a GFP-SOX fusion [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] by knocking down Xrn1 (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>). Cells expressing GFP alone were used as controls to filter out RNA fragments generated by cellular RNases or other processing events. This was important because multiple studies have shown that PARE and similar techniques detect a large number of RNA fragments in human cells, many of which are of unknown origin [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We prepared and sequenced PARE libraries from two replicates of SOX-expressing or GFP control cells and extracted the 5&#x02019; end of each mapped read, which represents the cleavage site (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).</p><fig id="ppat.1005305.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1005305.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>PARE experimental procedure and peak finding analysis pipeline.</title><p>A) Diagram of the PARE procedure. B) Schematic of PyDegradome analysis approach, which uses read counts in a control sample to generate a table of thresholds to compare test sample counts to. The table lists thresholds for a particular user-defined confidence level and for a range of ratios between control and test samples. The applicable ratio for each position is computed by multiplying a user-defined multiplicative factor by the ratio of total read counts for the exon in test vs. control samples, thus accounting for variation in RNA levels and total mapped reads. Read counts in test sample at each position must exceed the threshold to be identified as part of a peak. C) Example of plot of read counts (5&#x02019; end only) for 200 nt surrounding a SOX cut site identified by PyDegradome within the 3&#x02019;&#x02013;most exon of the LIMD1 NM_014240 transcript in the four samples. Note that y-axis has a logarithmic scale. This example shows the expected distribution for a cut site followed by exonucleolytic degradation due to residual Xrn1 activity or to the action of another nuclease, with the highest read count at cut site and decaying counts at following positions.

D) Flow chart of steps used to defined SOX cut sites used for further analyses.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1005305.g001"/></fig><p>Conventional analysis of PARE and similar degradome datasets relies on detecting cut sites in each condition and then comparing conditions to each other <italic>a posteriori</italic>, but initial attempts at detecting and validating cut sites indicated that this approach did not provide sufficient discriminatory power to identify SOX-specific cleavage sites. In previous studies using PARE or similar approaches [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], additional information about the pathways, such as the miRNA sequences for miRNA cut site studies or the proximity of the site to a stop codon for studies of SMG6 and nonsense mediated decay, was used to further select &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; cut sites. However, such contextual information does not exist for SOX cleavage specificity. Therefore, we devised a Python-based analysis approach that would directly use our control dataset as a baseline, which we termed PyDegradome (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). The analysis uses a Bayesian probability framework to determine whether the read counts at a given location differ significantly between control and test samples, taking into account random variations in the number of reads. Using Bayes' theorem, we determine for each location whether the underlying rate of fragment production in the test sample is a multiplicative factor larger than the control rate at a user-defined confidence level. The user also chooses the multiplicative factor. For a given control read count, we thus compute a threshold that the read counts in the test samples have to exceed to be considered part of a &#x0201c;peak&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). To improve efficiency when testing thousands of locations, the software builds a reference table of the thresholds for the entire dataset. This approach allowed the identification of locations within the transcriptome where the read counts were statistically higher in the samples from SOX-expressing cells than in control samples (peaks). In order to correct for up- or down-regulation of the RNAs and for the total number of reads obtained for each sample, the ratio used to determine thresholds was computed from the user-defined multiplicative factor and the ratio of the total number of reads mapping to each exon in test vs. control samples (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). To prevent isolated high read counts from skewing our analysis, we integrated read counts within small windows (4 nt) rather than single nucleotides. Adjacent windows that passed the cutoff were then combined into a single peak. We optimized the user-defined confidence level and ratio by determining how many peaks were detected when comparing each SOX replicate sample to its GFP control to detect SOX-specific peaks, or performing the opposite comparison to detect GFP-specific peaks. In addition, we also ran the program to detect peaks specific to only one biological repeat, by comparing the two SOX or GFP replicates to each other, as these peaks may represent experimental noise. Although we consistently detected more SOX-specific peaks than GFP-specific peaks, varying the parameters improved discrimination of SOX-specific peaks (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>) and reduced detection of &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d; peaks specific to one repeat. Based on this optimization, we empirically set the final iteration of the program to detect 4 nt windows with read counts in the test samples that are four fold higher than read counts in the control samples within a confidence level of 99.99%. Because these parameters are conservative, we expect that the SOX cut sites we detected do not represent a comprehensive list of all SOX cut sites, but rather only the highest confidence sites. Within each peak, we also determined the position where the read count was highest, and we considered this position the location of putative cut site (with the cleavage occurring 5&#x02019; of this position) (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). With similar optimization, this program could be used to identify the ends of degradation fragments in other degradome datasets that contain matching test and control samples.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>SOX cuts sites are abundant and not positioned relative to landmark features of mRNA</title><p>Using the approach detailed above, we detected a higher number of peaks specific to SOX-containing samples relative to control samples, consistent with broad mRNA targeting by SOX (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>; <xref rid="ppat.1005305.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).

Up to 20% of the SOX-specific peaks but fewer than 9% of the control GFP-specific peaks were shared between the replicates, indicating that many of the SOX cleavages reproducibly occur at a given site (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>).

To examine whether SOX cleavage sites in endogenous mRNAs are position-specific, we compared the location of the SOX-specific cut sites to those found only in control samples using the human transcript annotation from ENSEMBL GRch37. In both SOX and GFP control samples, more cut sites occur towards the ends of the transcripts, most frequently corresponding to the 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; untranslated regions (UTRs) of the mRNA (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). It remains unclear whether this non-specific end bias is due to a general preference for cleavage in non-translated regions or a consequence of the PARE approach. We also computed the position of the cuts relative to landmarks such as the transcript start site, start codon, stop codon or annotated 3&#x02019; end. Only a fraction of the peaks was located within 50 nt of any of these landmarks in either case (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). Although a greater percentage of the SOX cut sites occurred within 50 nt of start codons, this still only accounted for 15% of the cut sites. Furthermore, the 15&#x02013;20% of both SOX and GFP peaks near annotated transcription start sites may represent the beginning of full-length decapped mRNAs rather than endonuclease cleavage fragments. Collectively, these analyses indicate that SOX cut sites are not restricted to a particular region of the mRNA, although cleavage sites in both SOX and control GFP samples may be enriched in areas of the transcripts that are not covered by ribosomes. These findings are consistent with our previous reporter mRNA data [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Sequences around SOX cleavage sites in endogenous mRNAs contain SOX targeting elements</title><p>We next selected seven SOX cut sites for independent experimental validation (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>).

We inserted 200 nt surrounding the cleavage sites from the mRNA targets identified by PyDegradome into a GFP reporter (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). We then co-expressed these constructs with SOX in Xrn1-depleted cells and tested whether the inserted sequence caused a SOX-specific cut in the mRNA. The GFP reporter we used is normally cut by SOX at ~nt 140 of the coding region [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], generating a degradation intermediate that is ~ 250 nt shorter than the full length mRNA. We found that the insertion of the sequences from six out of seven of the candidate SOX cleavage sites resulted in the appearance of a second RNA fragment in SOX-expressing cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). Interestingly, the intensity of the additional cleavage products varied between the insertions, suggesting some sequences are better SOX targets than others. In particular, in the GFP reporters with insertions from the LIMD1 mRNA (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>), we found that the original cleavage site in the GFP coding region was almost completely abolished in favor of the new cleavage site, as evidenced by the disappearance of the longer degradation intermediate. Moreover, insertion of the LIMD1 200 nt sequence in a different position in the GFP mRNA also elicited SOX cleavage (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>), further demonstrating functionality of the targeting sequence regardless of its broader context.

The varying number of sequences used for the analyses in the different panels is a result of the requirement for sufficient flanking sequences in the same annotated exon, but as many sequences as possible were analyzed in each case.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1005305.g004"/></fig><p>We also computed the log likelihood for different nucleotides at positions around the SOX cleavage (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). Although no strong consensus sequence emerged, two features stood out from this analysis. First, the position right after the cut site (position 0) was preferentially C or T. When we computed the frequency of different nucleotides at the cut site for both SOX-specific and GFP-specific cleavages, we found that the pyrimidines C or T were found at 85% of the SOX cut sites, whereas C or A were the most frequent bases at position 0 in cuts specific to GFP control samples (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). This distribution is not due to a bias in library preparation, as A was the most frequent base at the beginning of both aligned (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A Fig</xref>) and total (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B Fig</xref>) reads.</p><p>We also found that there were more As and fewer Cs in the 10 nt 5&#x02019; to the cleavage site.

This was not a general feature of the sequences that produce RNA fragments, as only five of the cut sites found solely in the control samples were preceded by an A dimer and none by longer A stretches. These analyses suggest that although SOX cut sites are defined by a degenerate sequence pattern, this sequence is enriched for pyrimidines at a cut site adjacent to an unstructured stretch of A residues.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Experimental analysis of an endogenous SOX cleavage sequence confirms role of oligo A sequence and potential structural element</title><p>To probe the SOX targeting element further we examined more in detail the SOX targeting element in the validated endogenous mRNAs (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). The structure prediction program RNAfold [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] predicted that the 50&#x02013;54 nt surrounding the cut sites in six out of seven of the RNAs fold in hairpin structures with oligo-A stretches and the cleavage sites in unpaired loops (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1005305.g005" ref-type="fig">5A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005305.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A</xref>).

Similarly, we predicted the structures of all 50 nt sequences surrounding the SOX-specific cut sites in our dataset and determined how many of the sequences presented either the cut site, an A dimer or both the cut site and an A dimer in an unstructured region.

Fragments of different sizes may not be able to fold into the native structure equally well and the stability of the resulting structures may vary. Consistent with this idea, we found that changing the length of the inserted fragments for two different RNAs (LIMD1 and SRSF3) changed the efficiency of SOX cleavage, measured by the intensity of the degradation intermediate (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1005305.g005" ref-type="fig">5C, 5D</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005305.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B and S5C</xref>), although sequences of 33 nt were sufficient to elicit SOX cleavage. In particular, when we shortened the LIMD1 inserted sequence from 200 nt to 54 nt, 39 nt and 33 nt, the efficiency of cleavage progressively diminished (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>), consistent with LIMD1 sequences adopting a stem-loop structure that becomes destabilized upon sequential deletions of the putative stem region. Surprisingly, shortening the inserted sequence for SRSF3 had the opposite effect and increased the efficiency of the cleavage (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B and S5C Fig</xref>). Because the same sequences are present in the 200 nt and the 33 nt SRSF3 insertion, this observation cannot be explained by the presence of a targeting sequence alone. Instead, we hypothesize that the shorter insertion folds more stably into an autonomous element that is required for targeting by SOX.</p><p>We previously found that mutating a TGAAGT sequence 5 nt before the GFP cut site to TGAGTG could abolish the cleavage site in GFP (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A Fig</xref>). The LIMD1 site is also preceded by a similar TGAAAG sequence predicted to be in an unpaired loop. To test directly whether the A trimer in the LIMD1 sequence was required for the positioning of the cleavage, we mutated the TGAAAG sequence in our insertion reporter to TGCCCG, TGGGGG or TGTTTG. As predicted by our data analysis, we found that mutation of the A trimer prevented the LIMD1 sequence from eliciting SOX cleavage, indicating that the AAA is an integral part of the SOX recognition site (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). Moreover, deletion of one of the three As in the 39 nt insertion reduced the efficiency of cleavage dramatically (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>), while RNAfold structure prediction suggested that this deletion is unlikely to substantially alter the structure of the RNA (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B Fig</xref>). Similarly, mutating an A dimer just upstream of the cut site in a SRSF3 insertion construct reduces SOX-mediated cleavage (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref>). While the upstream A dimer likely contributes to SOX targeting, we note that it is not always required, as a similar mutation in a PGAM1 insertion construct did not abolish cleavage (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6C Fig</xref>). Overall, these data are consistent with the idea that the A-stretch is an important feature of the SOX cleavage specificity.</p><p>Lastly, our analysis indicated that the nucleotide G is under-represented at the position immediately following the SOX cut site (position 0, <xref rid="ppat.1005305.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B&#x02013;4D</xref>). We found that mutating the nucleotide at position 0 from an A to a G prevented SOX-mediated cleavage in two out of three of the RNA we tested (LIMD1 and SRSF3, but not the PGAM1) (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1005305.g005" ref-type="fig">5F, 5G</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005305.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6D</xref>). These data suggest that SOX activity is inhibited by the presence of a G nucleotide as the residue 3&#x02019; of the cleavage. Collectively these data experimentally validate our computational finding and strongly suggest that SOX cut sites are defined by a combination of sequence and structural features.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>A conserved sequence pattern is specific to SOX-dependent cut sites</title><p>Although sequences flanking the SOX cleavage sites lacked a strong consensus motif, our analysis showed that the frequency of the bases around the cut site diverged from the expected distribution for human RNA sequences (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). This suggested to us that there is a conserved sequence pattern among SOX target sequences. In order to be able to search RNA sequences for this variable motif, we derived a position weight matrix (PWM) for the positions -10 to +9 from the SOX cleavage site (0 being the nucleotide 3&#x02019; of the cut site, <xref rid="ppat.1005305.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). The PWM is a matrix that lists the probabilities (transformed into log likelihood to correct for the background frequencies of the nucleotides) for each of the four bases at each of the positions of the putative motif. The log likelihoods for our PWM were derived from 129 very high confidence SOX cut sites identified in both of our experimental repeats using a very stringent confidence level of 99.999% and located at least 50 nt away from a transcriptional start site. The logo in <xref rid="ppat.1005305.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7A Fig</xref> is a pictorial representation of the PWM. We then used the PWM to confirm that SOX cut sites specifically matched the motif by scoring several subsets of potential SOX target or control sequences using the PWM. The presence of preferred nucleotides in positions -10 to +9 from the cut site results in higher (positive) log likelihood scores, whereas a poorer match to the motif produces a lower (negative) log likelihood score. Indeed, the sequences flanking the set of reproducible SOX cut sites (identified with a confidence level of 99.99%) were a closer match to the motif compared to those surrounding GFP-specific fragment ends, as shown by the distribution of the log likelihood scores (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). A similar difference was seen when analyzing the sequences surrounding all potential SOX and control (GFP) cut sites from each of the two biological repeats. Sequences around SOX cut sites were a good match (positive log likelihood score) to the motif more frequently than control sequences (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). In both analyses (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>), we removed the sequences of the 129 high confidence cut sites used to derive the PWM from the analyzed sets. The results of these analyses indicate that although the precise sequence composition may vary, there is a specific element marking SOX cut sites that is not observed in control samples. Furthermore, our stringent analysis parameters have likely resulted in an underestimation of the number of true SOX targeting sites, because even sites detected in only one of our two replicates were generally a good match to the SOX targeting motif.</p><fig id="ppat.1005305.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1005305.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>A degenerate motif defines SOX cut sites.</title><p>A position weight matrix (PWM) for nucleotide likelihood in the 20 nt surrounding the SOX cut sites was generated from the 129 sequences that contained SOX-specific sites with a confidence level of 99.999%.

Human transcripts were classified as down-regulated by SOX or SOX escapees based on the data from an RNAseq experiment comparing human mRNA levels in cells overexpressing GFP-SOX or GFP alone [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The best motif score for each RNA detected in the RNAseq experiment was then computed using a 20-nt scanning window as described above. We found that the down-regulated RNAs (fold change &#x0003c; 0.75) had better motif scores than the escapee RNAs (<xref rid="ppat.1005305.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>). Similarly, when we plotted the fold change for each gene against the best motif score for that gene, we found that there was a modest but significant inverse correlation between the fold change in mRNA levels and the motif scores (Spearman&#x02019;s &#x003c1; = -0.21. <italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c; 0.0001, <xref rid="ppat.1005305.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7C Fig</xref>).</p><p>These analyses suggest that the level of down-regulation of mRNAs by SOX is in part determined by the degree to which their sequence is a good match for the SOX targeting motif.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec010"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have identified key sequence features of the targeting element that directs the RNA endonuclease SOX to cleave a significant fraction of the mRNA transcriptome. As we had hypothesized from the analysis of individual reporter mRNAs [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], SOX cleavages in endogenous mRNAs occur in a sequence-specific manner. Although surprisingly large, this element is not defined by strong sequence consensus, but instead contains a small number of conserved residues. Structural features may also contribute to motif-driven SOX targeting.</p><p>Our data resolve how a sequence-specific nuclease can target such a breadth of targets. SOX presents a model of RNA targeting in which cleavages are at the same time sequence specific and highly promiscuous. This is achieved through the use of a degenerate sequence/structure pattern that is anchored by key residues to define specific RNase targeting locations. Good matches for a loosely defined sequence pattern can be found in all viral and host RNAs, enabling cleavage to be simultaneously specific and widespread. Although this approach may be less efficient than the location-driven targeting of the cap-proximal region reported for other host shutoff factors that promote mRNA cleavage [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], such a mechanism may provide more regulatory opportunities. Also, it may explain why SOX has less dramatic effects on RNA than other viral RNases [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Many cellular endonucleases have few described targets and transcriptome-wide targeting analyses of other cellular and viral RNases are limited. It will thus be of interest to apply high-throughput sequencing approaches to isolate degradation fragments in other systems and investigate whether any other viral or cellular RNases use principles similar to those employed by SOX to achieve target specificity. Notably, recent studies of specificity of RNase L, a host RNase that is activated in response to viral infection and cleaves viral RNAs and host rRNAs, have also suggested that a combination of sequence and structure is important for targeting [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the requirements for RNase L targeting appear less stringent than those for SOX, as the preferred cleavages sites occur at UU/UA dinucleotides in unpaired regions of structured RNAs [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>The RNA motif underlying SOX cleavage specificity could be used for target selectivity, enabling a subset of viral and cellular mRNAs to escape cleavage. Our observation that the majority of both viral and cellular transcripts contain the SOX targeting motif is in agreement with the fact that in MHV68, viral mRNAs are broadly susceptible to degradation by the SOX homolog muSOX [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, subsets of viral and cellular transcripts are not susceptible to host shutoff [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and it is likely that at least some of these escape due to the absence of a robust targeting element. Indeed, the correlation between the scores of matches to the motif and the level of degradation of host mRNAs suggest that sequences within the motif can influence rates of degradation of different RNAs. This may result in a more nuanced effect of SOX-mediated degradation. We also note that the level of degradation seen by steady-state level measurements is likely influenced by additional variables that are unrelated to the efficiency of SOX cleavage, including the efficiency of removal of different sequences by Xrn1 and a reduction of transcriptional rate due to a feedback loop triggered by the RNA degradation [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore the relationship we see may be an underestimation of the contribution of targeting preference. An additional level of regulation for transcript selectivity is also provided by the presence of dominant protective elements like the SOX-resistance element we have identified in the 3&#x02019; UTR of the IL-6 gene [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which prevents cleavage of the GFP RNA despite the presence of a strong targeting sequence. We expect that both dominant and passive mechanisms of escape from SOX-mediated targeting ultimately shape the landscape of host gene expression during SOX-mediated host shutoff.</p><p>A limitation of our analyses is that we are unable to readily explore, both computationally and experimentally, the contribution of structural elements to the SOX cleavage site. Computational analysis of shared structures is difficult when the sequences involved are not evolutionarily related. Moreover, even in well-characterized examples of the same protein binding different RNAs, for example in the case of bacterial ribosomal proteins binding both ribosomal RNAs and their own 5&#x02019; UTRs, the features that are recognized are highly variable [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and the remainder of the structure may serve as a scaffold. Nonetheless, our identification of endogenous cut sites makes experimental analysis of a putative SOX target structure possible in the future.</p><p>A major outstanding question is how SOX recognizes the targeting motif. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies indicate that the binding affinity of SOX for RNA is much lower than its affinity for DNA [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which is also processed by SOX during viral genome replication in the nucleus. This suggests that SOX may not recognize RNA targets directly but may instead be recruited by a protein partner. This model is supported by the observation that point mutations that abolish SOX host shutoff activity in cells do not affect its RNase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], pointing at a likely protein-protein interaction. A SOX partner protein would have to be a fundamental factor in RNA metabolism and/or a RNA binding protein with promiscuous specificity, as it must bind a large portion of the cellular RNAs. Another possibility is that SOX directly recognizes its target sequence, and that the apparent low affinity for RNA <italic>in vitro</italic> is due to the fact that a non-cognate sequence was used for the binding assay. However, the fact that SOX cleaves the GFP RNA sequence when GFP is expressed from an RNA polymerase II promoter, but not when it is expressed from an RNA polymerase I or III promoter [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] argues against this scenario. How this motif potentiates SOX targeting, as well as whether it is used as a protein-binding scaffold for other purposes in the cell related to mRNA fate remain important questions for the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Cells and Xrn1 knockdown</title><p>HEK293T, HEK293T shXrn1 and KSHV-infected iSLK-219 [<xref rid="ppat.1005305.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and iSLK-219 shXrn1 cells were maintained in high-glucose DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). shXrn1 cells were generated using pTRIPZ-shXrn1 (Thermoscientific, clone V2THS_89028/RHS4696-99704634, targeting sequence: TATGGTGAGATATACTATG).
