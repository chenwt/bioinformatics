A potent histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), was used to understand the effects of assisted epigenetic modifications on transcriptional profiles of SCNT blastocysts and to identify specific or categories of genes affected.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>TSA improved the yield and quality of in vitro embryo development compared to control (CTR-NT). Significance analysis of microarray results revealed that of 37,238 targeted gene transcripts represented on the microarray slide, a relatively small number of genes were differentially expressed in CTR-NT (1592&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.3&#x000a0;%) and TSA-NT (1907&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.1&#x000a0;%) compared to IVF embryos. For both SCNT groups, the majority of downregulated and more than half of upregulated genes were common and as much as 15&#x000a0;% of all deregulated transcripts were located on chromosome X. Correspondence analysis clustered CTR-NT and IVF transcriptomes close together regardless of the embryo production method, whereas TSA changed SCNT transcriptome to a very clearly separated cluster. Ontological classification of deregulated genes using IPA uncovered a variety of functional categories similarly affected in both SCNT groups with a preponderance of genes required for biological processes. Examination of genes involved in different canonical pathways revealed that the WNT and FGF pathways were similarly affected in both SCNT groups. Although TSA markedly changed epigenetic reprogramming of donor cells (DNA-methylation, H3K9 acetylation), reconstituted oocytes (5mC, 5hmC), and blastocysts (DNA-methylation, H3K9 acetylation), these changes did not recapitulate parallel marked changes in chromatin remodeling, and nascent mRNA and OCT4-EGFP expression of TSA-NT vs. CRT-NT embryos.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results obtained suggest that despite the extensive reprogramming of donor cells that occurred by the blastocyst stage, SCNT-specific errors are of a non-random nature in bovine and are not responsive to epigenetic modifications by TSA.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-015-2264-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Somatic cell nuclear transfer</kwd><kwd>Trichostatin A</kwd><kwd>Transcriptome</kwd><kwd>Bovine</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Early embryonic development in mammals begins in transcriptional silence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] with an oocyte-mediated transcriptional reprogramming of parental gametes occurring during an across-the-board process of &#x0201c;erase-and-rebuild&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In this process, the parental transcription programs are erased long before (maternal) or soon after (paternal) fertilization to generate a relatively na&#x000ef;ve zygotic chromatin upon which the transcription program of a new life cycle is rebuilt de novo after activation of the zygotic genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Any perturbation in this process will result in ill or fatal transcriptional phenotypes of the resultant embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The very few viable clones obtained at the end of a typical cloning experiment underscore that substantial differences exist between transcriptional reprogramming of somatic cell nuclei and gametes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Six microarray studies have been carried out to explore the transcriptomic profiles of cloned (SCNT) vs. fertilized (IVF) bovine blastocysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and all reported extensive transcriptional reprogramming of the donor cells by the blastocyst stage with few genes, even as low as twenty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], being deregulated in SCNT embryos. Conversely, numerous studies have reported abnormal patterns of DNA-methylation and histone acetylation/methylation of bovine clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These studies concluded that bovine SCNT embryos suffer from genome-wide hypermethylation, associated with elevated heterochromatic histone methylation (H3K9me2) and H3K9 acetylation in the trophectoderm layer. Therefore, a typical SCNT embryo may be transcriptionally close to (euchromatin), but epigenetically far from (heterochromatin), normal embryos, demonstrating that epigenetic but not expression barriers limit reprogramming efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Accordingly, it would be interesting to determine how small transcriptional aberrations translate into broad epigenetic anomalies or vice versa.</p><p>Somatic cell chromatin is compact and static, due to the tight association of chromatin with heterochromatin binding proteins and of histones with chromatin. Proper erasure of these epigenotype markers is essential for chromatin remodeling and pluripotency, as restricting the exchange of these chromatin factors makes the chromatin inaccessible to oocyte reprogramming factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The short duration and compromised efficiency of the erasure process is considered to be the main cause of the transcriptomic and epigenomic anomalies of cloned embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To circumvent this problem, assisted epigenetic modification of somatic cells, before and/or soon after SCNT, with DNA-methyltransferase (DNMTi) and histone deacetylase (HDACi) inhibitors has been recently used to assist the endogenous epigenome-modifying machinery and enhance the speed and extent of nuclear reprogramming (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]). Among these, members of the hydroxamic acid-containing class of HDACi such as Trichostatin A (TSA) and Scriptaid are used more frequently due to their potent effects on global acetylation. Given the genome-wide effects of HDACi, increased acetylation results in the increased chromatin relaxation at locations that are associated with pluripotency, and this is expected to provide a chromatin conformation more permissive to transcriptional activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Treatment with TSA improved the development of SCNT bovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and pig [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] embryos to the blastocyst stage. In mice, TSA improved both nuclear remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and development to term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Treatment with TSA also induced a parallel increase in histone acetylation, chromosome decondensation and nuclear volume in SCNT mouse embryos similar to that observed in ICSI-derived embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Importantly, through analysis of chromatin remodeling and 5-bromouridine 5&#x02032;-triphosphate (BrUTP)-labeled RNA, Bui et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and VanThuan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] demonstrated a more effective formation of DNA replication complexes in TSA and Scriptaid treated embryos which was evident by enhanced levels of newly synthesized RNA and a significant reduction in asymmetric expression of nascent RNA. Notably, a positive correlation between the increase in nascent RNA synthesis and full-term development of cloned mice was observed. In cloned pig embryos, Whitworth et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] reported that Scriptaid treatment significantly affected the expression of 7 of the 14 transcripts evaluated and returned three of them to levels observed in in vivo-derived embryos. Even though a single defect in transcription reprogramming may cause a &#x0201c;ripple&#x0201d; effect resulting in the aberrant expression of entire networks of downstream target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], the analysis of a small number of transcripts is of limited value for the systematic study of the genetic interactions involved in a complex trait. Post genomic era approaches, including genome wide analyses and network investigations, are needed.</p><p>This is the first study that seeks to assess the effects of assisted epigenetic modifications on transcriptional profiles of bovine SCNT embryos with a complete embryo RNAseq-derived microarray which includes splice and 3&#x02032;UTR variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. To investigate the potential meaning of the alteration of specific genes or categories of genes, we also attempted to associate specific mechanisms or events that occur in somatic cells, reconstituted oocytes and developing embryos with the observed alterations. Since no study has examined the effects of HDAC inhibitors on transcriptome and associated events, our results will expand the knowledge in this enigmatic field.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>TSA treatment improves in vitro, but not in vivo, developmental competence of SCNT bovine embryos</title><p>The custom <italic>in vitro</italic> measure of cloning efficiency is the yield and quality of blastocyst formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In our results (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1A), cleavage rate was not significantly different between the groups. However, TSA treatment boosted blastocyst development to a rate that was significantly higher than CTR-NT, but not IVF (39.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.1 vs. 28.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.5 vs. 34.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.9&#x000a0;%, respectively).

Differential staining of blastocysts (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1B) revealed a comparable total cell number between the groups. However, TSA treatment, but not the embryo production method, changed the distribution of cells in blastocysts as the proportion of cells allocated to the ICM and ICM/TCN proportion, were both significantly higher in TSA-NT blastocysts compared to CTR-NT embryos.</p><p>The ultimate readout of cloning efficiency is the ability of SCNT embryos to develop into viable offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although numbers are low, the transfer of grade 1 &#x00026; 2 blastocysts resulted in comparable early (days 35&#x02013;40) pregnancy rates between the groups (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1C). However, total percentages of pregnancy loss between critical pregnancy days 60&#x02013;120 were high for both NT groups with no beneficial effect of TSA treatment when compared to no failure in IVF pregnancies. In addition, a number of pregnancies from SCNT in both groups were terminated at days 100&#x02013;235 due to excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid (hydrops) and other complications (CTR-NT: 33.3&#x000a0;%, TSA-NT: 50.0&#x000a0;%). Elective C-section was performed between days 286 to 290 of pregnancy resulted in the delivery of 6 CTR-NT and 2 TSA-NT calves. Four CTR-NT claves and one TSA-NT calve did not survive. The deceased calves suffered from placental abnormalities including placental hypertrophy and small numbers of larger placentomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>TSA treatment, not the SCNT process, is the greatest source of variation at the transcriptome level</title><p>Significance analysis of microarray (SAM) of blastocysts revealed that out of the 37,238 targeted gene transcripts represented on the microarray slide, a relatively small number of genes were differentially expressed (DEG) in CTR-NT (1592&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.3&#x000a0;%) and TSA-NT (1907&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.1&#x000a0;%) embryos compared to IVF (FDR 1.5, P&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05, FC &#x02265;1.5) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).

Treatment with TSA did not change the expression of OCT4 and SOX2 and resulted in further downregulation of NANOG (4-fold compared to the 1.7-fold decrease that was observed in CTR-NT compared to IVF). A reference diagram showing the interactions of five canonical pathways with OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cellsignal.com/">http://www.cellsignal.com/</ext-link>) was used to extrapolate the possible pathways that could lead to the observed expression patterns of the genes of the core pluripotency triad (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Examination of genes involved in different canonical pathways revealed that the transcripts for the cytoplasmic mediators of the FGF pathway: PI3K, MEK1/2, were not functionally expressed in the SCNT groups; whereas a few isotypes of the nuclear mediators AKT, ERK1/2, were upregulated. WNT appeared not functional at upstream regulators and destructive complexes of &#x003b2;-CATENIN: PP2A, AXIN, GSK3, APC, were not in an active state to trigger &#x003b2;-CATENIN cytoplasmic ubiquitination, and correspondingly, &#x003b2;-CATENIN transcripts were apparently free to be shuttled into the nucleus in an upregulated form.

Etiologically, most studies point towards an aberrant gene expression following errors in the erasure and/or rebuilding of epigenetic marks that can affect totipotency and proper differentiation and development of embryos (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]). Therefore, several studies have attempted to modify the epigenetic status of donor cells using variants of HDAC inhibitors either before or soon after SCNT. This study represents a collection of physiological, histological and genomic data of unprecedented completeness to understand the complex phenotype of SCNT bovine embryos.</p><p>In our study, treatment with TSA was quite beneficial for the <italic>in vitro</italic> development of SCNT embryos compared to control nuclear transfer (CTR-NT) and also IVF embryos. The effect of TSA treatment on <italic>in vitro</italic> development of SCNT embryos is controversial in different species (for review see Monteiro et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]). The initial (epi)genetic background of donor cells may be involved in the generation of different <italic>in vitro</italic> results. For example, while TSA increased cumulus cell-derived cloned mouse blastocysts by 5-fold, it had no effect on the developmental competence of ESC-derived embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Similarly, TSA treatment increased blastocyst development of SCNT bovine embryos produced from fetal fibroblasts but not bone marrow cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Notably, TSA treatment altered the allocation of cells in blastocysts as proportionally more cells were allocated to the ICM of treated embryos, suggesting that an overriding epigenetic modification of the genome before NT has a carryover effect on cell proliferation and differentiation in preimplantation embryos. Ikeda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] demonstrated a significant increase in ICM number in bovine embryos treated with TSA during IVF. These data convinced us that TSA treatment may provide better prognosis for in vivo development by preparing better quality embryos.</p><p>However, post-implantation developmental competence was equally compromised in both groups irrespective of TSA treatment. The majority of NT pregnancies were lost by the middle of gestation and only a few fetuses survived in either group. These results are substantially supported by the fact that even though hundreds of SCNT embryos were transferred since 1996s, the overall success rate in terms of live birth rate has not changed and remains quite low (1&#x02013;5&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Published in vivo studies on HDACis are both limited and controversial: while TSA was quite beneficial in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], it could not improve full-term development in rabbit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], pig [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and cow ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and the present study). The different cell lines used as well as species/strain-specific differences may be involved in the generation of different in vivo results. For example, Kishigami et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] observed a significant beneficial effect of TSA on the full-term development of B6D2F1, but not of inbred (C57BL/6, C3H/He, DBA/2, and 129/S) mouse clones. Moreover, while reconstituted pig embryos derived from fetal fibroblasts could support full term development irrespective of TSA treatment, bone marrow cells of adult sows could do so only after TSA treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This lends support for the different effects of TSA on <italic>in vitro</italic> and in vivo development depending on the nuclear donor cell type. Due to this important difference between <italic>in vitro</italic> and in vivo results of SCNT with TSA treatment, it became relevant to investigate the fundamental molecular pathways involved in pre-implantation SCNT embryo development.</p><p>The overall results of transcriptomic analysis indicated that substantial transcriptome reprogramming occurred at the blastocyst stage which is in agreement with all the previous studies in bovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Notably, TSA treatment could not dramatically change the profile of differentially regulated genes compared to CTR-NT. This lack of effect of TSA could be considered in the light of three facts: i) the epigenetic reprogramming mediated by oocyte reprogramming factors is much more efficient than TSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], ii) following epigenetic alteration by TSA, somatic cell nuclei are still refractory to the epigenetic reprogramming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and iii) SCNT-specific transcriptional errors are of a non-random nature and are responsive to neither oocyte- nor TSA-mediated reprogramming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>Whether specific loci in the genome are preferentially affected during SCNT (reprogramming error hotspots) or the SCNT errors have a stochastic nature is still an elusive controversial question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Consistent deregulation of a defined list of genes would support the hotspot scenario whereas a stochastic model of reprogramming would be suggested when an unpredictable list of genes would emerge from different SCNT runs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Our microarray data revealed consistent and predictable profiles of gene expression between the two SCNT groups irrespective of TSA treatment. Accordingly, almost all downregulated genes and a great portion of upregulated genes in either NT group were similarly expressed in the other NT group. Moreover, as much as 15&#x000a0;% of the genes consistently downregulated in both NT groups were located in chromosome X. This predictability of individual gene expression on a global background of multiple gene expression changes argues for a predominantly non-random, rather than stochastic, nature of reprogramming errors in bovine SCNT embryos which is in agreement with the study of Inoue et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] on mouse SCNT. Similarly, Maruotti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] observed a clear bias in the distribution of differentially expressed genes between IVF and NT-derived epiblast stem cells in mice with 30&#x000a0;% of DEGs being localized on chromosome 11. However, Somers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] observed different embryo to embryo expression profiles in bovine SCNT. Although we have used several pools of embryos for each contrast, a defined pattern of differences indicates, at least for our fibroblast line, non-random reprogramming errors. While this manuscript was being prepared for publication, a study appeared by Matoba et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] that identified genomic domains resistant to ZGA in mouse SCNT by using comparative transcriptome analysis. Because these so-called reprogramming resistant regions (RRRs) were enriched for H3K9me3 in somatic nuclei, and since mRNA injection of Kdm4d markedly improved SCNT blastocyst rate from 26.0 to 86.6&#x000a0;%, they introduced H3K9me3 as the critical epigenetic barrier in SCNT-mediated reprogramming in mouse. Importantly, combined treatment with Kdm4d mRNA and TSA improved cloning efficiency compared to alone treatment with TSA, but not Kdm4d. They suggested that TSA and Kdm4d have no synergic effect because their effects are modulated through a similar pathway. This study of Matoba et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] in mouse may support our hypothesis on non-random nature of oocyte-mediated reprogramming errors in bovine. Therefore, a clear understanding of RRRs in different differentiated/differentiating cells and whether RRRs are of a common or specific-specific nature in mammals will provide a promising approach for improving the efficiency of SCNT and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) technologies.</p><p>The great number of X-linked genes consistently deregulated in either group may highlight the importance of reprogramming difficulties on this chromosome. Among the deregulated genes, IGF2R was upregulated and NAP1L5 and XIST were downregulated in both NT groups compared to IVF. Although both X chromosomes are active in the female zygote, one X chromosome endures a dosage compensation mechanism of transcriptional silencing that proceeds through a complex sequence of events between hatching and implantation in bovine embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Reconstituted SCNT embryos, however, receive one active and one inactive X chromosome from the donor cell and hence compromising the natural pattern of imprinting reprogramming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Interestingly, while Eggan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] reported a normal pattern of X chromosome inactivation (XCI), Xue et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] reported aberrant expression of nine of ten X-linked genes and hypomethylation of XIST in organs of deceased cloned calves. Similarly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of XIST resulted in a drastic (&#x0003e;10-fold) increase in the birth rate of male clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In a subsequent study the same group showed that although XIST siRNA injection largely suppressed over-expression of XIST in female SCNT embryos, it could not improve survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. It is worth noting that after TSA treatment of female bovine embryos, Olivera et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] observed an 8-fold decrease in the percentage of blastocysts expressing detectable XIST, whereas the expression of G6PD remained unaltered, suggesting specific susceptibility of XIST to <italic>in vitro</italic> culture conditions.</p><p>The establishment of ESCs analogous to those derived from human and mice embryos has remained an elusive goal in ungulates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. A clear knowledge of the transcriptional regulation of pluripotency genes is fundamental to the understanding of the species-specific characteristics involved and might reveal clues to achieve stable ESCs in ungulates. Analysis of the mouse embryo has revealed that several of the genes that are implicated in the divergence of the ICM are identifiable within the context of five canonical pathways, namely TGF-&#x003b2;/activin-nodal, FGFR, WNT, BMP and Notch (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cellsignal.com/">http://www.cellsignal.com/</ext-link>). These gene regulatory networks provide the molecular foundation for the stabilization or destruction of the core pluripotency triad (OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG). Examination of genes involved in different canonical pathways revealed that a typical bovine SCNT blastocyst may possess functional WNT and to some extent FGF signaling pathways, but TGF-&#x003b2; and BMP pathways are not functional. Notably, while TSA had no apparent effect on WNT and FGF signal transduction pathways, it altered the expression of SMADs. Conversely, Denicol et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] demonstrated the expression of sixteen WNT genes and other genes involved in WNT signaling in Day 6 morulae, indicating a functional WNT signaling system. By applying WNT agonists and antagonists, they provided evidence suggesting that the WNT signaling pathway is conversely associated with preimplantation embryonic development in bovine. Despite similarities in the WNT and FGF pathways, CTR-NT and TSA-NT -derived blastocysts differed in the expression patterns of SMADs. While the contributions of SMADs to pluripotency and the downstream events that they may regulate are poorly understood, the observed bias in the expression profile of SMADs may be associated with the differences observed in the level of downregulation of NANOG in TSA-NT- and CTR-NT-derived blastocysts (4- and 1.7-fold, respectively). The homeobox NANOG is among the highly conserved transcription factors implicated in ESC identity, self-renewal and maintenance, in cooperation with OCT4 and SOX2. Therefore, the observed reduction in the expression of NANOG should have important implications in the development of cloned embryos. In contrast, Iager et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] reported increased expression of NANOG in SCNT bovine embryos treated with TSA. The transcription factor C-MYC is central to a module of highly connected binding sites that are related to different epigenetic modifications of the core pluripotency-associated network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. C-MYC is expressed in ESC and cancer cells and it was also upregulated in both SCNT groups in this study. However, C-MYC functions seem to be distinct from the pluripotency triad&#x02019;s functions and it may be more involved in the regulation of protein metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Double inhibition of MAPK2 and GSK3 in bovine blastocysts increased NANOG and SOX2, but not C-MYC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Taken together, the simultaneous expression of both stimulatory and inhibitory pathways may put the pluripotency of SCNT blastocysts in a precarious contradictory state compared to IVF counterparts.</p><p>Abnormal placental development has been deemed responsible for the majority of SCNT problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. It is believed that dysfunctional placentation in clones is the result of aberrant expression of several key transcription factors that are involved in proliferation (MASH2, ERG, CDX2, TBPG), differentiation (CDX2, ERG, LOC618696, PLET1, POU5F1, HAND1) and function (ERG, ERG, IFN-tau, TKDP1, PAG-9) of trophoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Importantly, expression of some of these transcripts is increasingly enhanced as the bovine trophoblast elongates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In our results, TKDP1, LOC618696 and TBPG were downregulated over 3-fold in SCNT blastocysts of both groups, IFN-tau was downregulated in both groups, and HAND1 was downregulated in the TSA-NT group. TKDP1 is responsible for trophoblastic Kunitz domain proteins which are is assumed to protect the developing conceptus against potentially damaging proteinases released by maternal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Therefore, one may argue that downregulation of these genes may be involved in the early pregnancy losses.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that assisted epigenetic modification improves reprogramming efficiency through improvement of nuclear organization and induction of synchrony between the blastomeres for the expression of nascent mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We therefore attempted to follow the dynamics of nuclear remodeling and nascent mRNA expression in association with the epigenetic alterations of the reconstituted oocytes and blastocysts. The most notable finding was that TSA treatment resulted in a very sharp drop in the level of 5mC (by 50&#x000a0;%) immediately after nuclear transfer coinciding with a parallel increase in the level of 5hmC (by 4-fold). Interestingly, the 5mC signal at 24 hpr was comparable to the level observed in early reconstituted oocytes. However, the 5hmC signal remained significantly higher in TSA-NT vs. CTR-NT embryos. Similarly, Antony et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] showed that although induction of jmjd2b in mice ESC substantially decreased total levels of H3K9me3 by 63&#x000a0;%, the level of H3K9me3 was returned to normal within minutes following fusion with an enucleated oocyte. Notably, this transient change in H3K9me3 resulted in a remarkable increase in <italic>in vitro</italic>, but not in vivo, development which is in agreement with our results. The second finding was that the global levels of DNA-methylation and H3K9 acetylation in TSA-NT blastocysts were modified to levels similar to IVF blastocysts and this is in agreement with all the other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It remains enigmatic how TSA could affect blastocyst formation but not post-implantation health.</p><p>These dramatic changes in initial (5mC, and 5hmC) and final (DNA-methylation and H3K9 acetylation) levels of these crucial epigenetic markers did not recapitulate the changes in chromatin remodeling and epigenetic genes expression. Notably, the time-window of nascent OCT4 and nascent mRNA expression was not altered by TSA treatment. In agreement, using GFP-expressing fibroblasts fused to oocytes reconstructed either before (metaphase) or after (telophase) activation, Bordignon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] could not detect GFP signals until the 8- to 16-cell stage regardless of the cytoplast used, suggesting equivalent functional remodeling of chromatin activity in embryos reconstructed with both types of cytoplasts. In contrast, Bui et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and VanThuan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] demonstrated a more effective formation of DNA replication complexes in TSA- and Scriptaid-treated mouse embryos which was evidenced by enhanced levels of newly synthesized RNA and significant reduction in asymmetric expression of nascent RNA. Based on our previous study on TSA treatment of early reconstituted embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], this controversy may not be related to TSA treatment of nuclei donor cells or early reconstituted oocytes but instead may be related to species-specific differences in the timing of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) (2-cell in mice and 8&#x02013;16-cell in bovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]). These differences provide an unwanted variability in the timing of assisted epigenetic modification in relation to the timing of maximum epigenetic alteration and ZGA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first comprehensive study on the effects of assisted epigenetic modifications on the transcriptome of bovine SCNT blastocysts studied with a microarray chip which covers the bovine preattachment transcriptome and hence allows the exploration of gene expression in bovine blastocysts obtained in different conditions. The results obtained demonstrated substantial reprogramming of the donor cell nuclei by the blastocyst stage with no overt effect of TSA on the number and identity of differentially regulated genes. Considering the limited number of genes deregulated in SCNT embryos, one may suggest that a simple defect in the expression of a few genes may translate into defective expression of a great number of genes in a ripple effect. This may also suggest a non-random nature of SCNT-specific errors that are not TSA-responsive. This also suggests that the miracle of cloning lies in the great capacity of the ooplasm to reprogram almost any type of differentiated cells; but the problems of cloning are due to unstable genes that escape/resist reprogramming and are not responsive to TSA. Therefore, future studies should focus on these potentially important deregulated genes involved in extra-embryonic tissue modelling to find strategies to correct their expression before the embryos are transferred to recipients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Methods</title><p>Unless otherwise specified, all chemicals and media were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and Gibco (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA), respectively.

To meet these objectives, an established fetal fibroblast cell line obtained from an approximately 60-day female fetus, was treated with a previously established concentration and duration of TSA (1.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M for 24&#x000a0;h, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]). At the end of each treatment, treated and untreated (control) cells were used for either SCNT or flow-cytometery assisted analyses of DNA-methylation and histone acetylation. Yield and quality of embryo development was recorded until day 7 when grade 1 &#x00026; 2 blastocysts were used for microarray analysis, embryo transfer to recipients and differential staining. Further, some of the SCNT and IVF embryos were collected at four intervals post SCNT/IVF (0, 4, 8, 12, 24&#x000a0;h) for immunostaining assessment of epigenetic marks and chromatin remodeling using immunostaining against 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and &#x003b2;-tubulin, respectively. Other embryos were also collected for the assessment of nascent mRNA expression using immunostaining against BrUTP. Also, fibroblasts were stably transfected with a construct of EGFP-OCT4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] for the detection of the time-window of the expression of genes for pluripotency in TSA-NT and CTR-NT embryos.

These molecules, called network-eligible molecules, were overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from information contained in Ingenuity&#x02019;s Knowledge Base. Networks of network-eligible molecules were then algorithmically generated based on their connectivity. Molecules are represented as nodes, and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as an edge (line). All edges are supported by at least one reference from the literature, from a textbook, or from canonical information stored in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. Human, mouse, and rat orthologs of a gene are stored as separate objects in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base, but are represented as a single node in the network. Nodes are displayed using various shapes that represent the functional class of the gene product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Canonical pathway analysis</title><p>Canonical pathway analysis identified the pathways from the IPA library of canonical pathways that were most significant to the data set. The significance of the association between the data set and the canonical pathway was measured in two ways: 1) a ratio of the number of molecules from the data set that map to the pathway divided by the total number of molecules that map to the canonical pathway was displayed; 2) Fisher exact test was used to calculate a <italic>P</italic> value to determine the probability that the association between the genes in the dataset and the canonical pathway would occur by chance alone. Green and red symbols represented genes respectively down and upregulated in treated embryos compared to controls. Gray symbols represented genes with significant expression in blastocysts but with no difference between conditions, whereas white symbols represented genes not present on microarray or with below-background intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><sec id="Sec28"><title>DNA-methylation and histone H3K9 acetylation in fibroblasts</title><p>As described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], quantitative assessment of DNA-methylation and histone H3K9 acetylation was conducted by incubating fibroblasts with 1:400 and 1:200 dilutions of mouse anti-5-methylcytosine and anti-H3K9 monoclonal antibodies, respectively. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobin was used as the secondary antibody at a 1:50 dilution. A corresponding control for each experiment was included. Cells were filtered through a 40-&#x003bc;m nylon mesh in order to exclude aggregated cells. Ten thousand cells were collected with the fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)-Caliber and were analyzed using CELL QUEST&#x000ae; 3.1 software (Becton Dickinson). Three replicates were conducted for each treatment with appropriate controls to eliminate the possible effects of auto fluorescence and non-specific binding by the secondary antibody.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>DNA-methylation and histone H3K9 acetylation of blastocysts</title><p>As described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], NT and IVF blastocysts were washed in PBS containing 1&#x000a0;mg/ml PVA and then fixed in 4&#x000a0;% paraformaldehyde (PF) in PBS for 30&#x000a0;min. Permeabilization was carried out in 0.5&#x000a0;% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15&#x000a0;min. For DNA-methylation, embryos were first pre-treated with 4&#x000a0;N HCl for 60&#x000a0;min at RT, and then washed with PBS. To preclude non-specific binding of the primary antibody, embryos were treated with 3&#x000a0;% BSA in PBS for 60&#x000a0;min at RT. These embryos were then incubated with the primary antibody: either mouse monoclonal anti-5-methylcytosine (for DNA-methylation) (Eurogentec&#x000ae;, BI-MECY-0100) or mouse monoclonal anti-H3K9 (for histone-acetylation), for 1&#x000a0;h at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, followed by three washes in PBS containing PVA. Embryos were then incubated with the secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG-TRITC conjugate) for 60&#x000a0;min at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Subsequently, embryos were re-fixed overnight in 4&#x000a0;% PF and treated with 0.1&#x000a0;mg/ml RNase-A for 1&#x000a0;h before being washed in PBS. The fixed and stained embryos were mounted and imaged as described for EGFP fluorescence using 557&#x000a0;nm excitation and 576&#x000a0;nm emission filters. The median pixel intensity of 10&#x02013;15 nuclei was detected in each NT and IVF blastocyst. Briefly, five different regions of each image that contained 10&#x02013;15 nuclei were randomly selected and the average pixel intensity of fluorescence emission in the nuclei located in these regions was detected using Image J. software (National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). The software was zeroed against background before use. Appropriate controls were also included to eliminate the possible effects of auto fluorescence of the first and second antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Chromatin remodeling dynamics</title><p>Stepwise assessment of chromatin remodeling was carried out as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].

Microtubules were immunostained with anti-&#x003b2;-tubulin monoclonal primary antibody (1:100) and FITC labeled anti-mouse-IgG secondary antibody (1:100). The chromosomes were counterstained with H333242 (2&#x000a0;mg/ml) and then samples were washed and mounted on glass slides in glycerol droplets to be observed with an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus, BX51) at 400X magnification.

Embryos were placed between two electrodes (0.5&#x000a0;mm apart) of an electro fusion chamber filled with 20-&#x003bc;L droplets of transcription buffer and BrUTP internalization was induced by two successive DC current pulses (250&#x000a0;V/cm, 80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;sec with 1&#x000a0;min interval). Embryos were transferred to mSOF medium two minutes after permeabilization and cultured for 1&#x000a0;h.
