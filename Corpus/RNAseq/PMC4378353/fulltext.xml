However, very little is known about the whole-genome molecular mechanisms contributing to thermotolerance. The objectives of this study were to analyzed genome-wide gene expression profiles in the leaves of two tall fescue genotypes, heat tolerant &#x02018;PI578718&#x02019; and heat sensitive &#x02018;PI234881&#x02019; using high-throughput RNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 262 million high-quality paired-end reads were generated and assembled into 31,803 unigenes with an average length of 1,840&#x000a0;bp. Of these, 12,974 unigenes showed different expression patterns in response to heat stress and were categorized into 49 Gene Ontology functional subcategories. In addition, the variance of enrichment degree in each functional subcategory between PI578718 and PI234881 increased with increasing treatment time. Cell division and cell cycle genes showed a massive increase in transcript abundance in heat-stressed plants and more activated genes were detected in PI 578718 by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways analysis. Low molecular weight heat shock protein (LMW-HSP, HSP20) showed activated in two stressed genotypes and high molecular weight HSP (HMW-HSP, HSP90) just in PI578718. Assimilation such as photosynthesis, carbon fixation, CH<sub>4</sub>, N, S metabolism decreased along with increased dissimilation such as oxidative phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The assembled transcriptome of tall fescue could serve as a global description of expressed genes and provide more molecular resources for future functional characterization analysis of genomics in cool-season turfgrass in response to high-temperature.

Temperatures 5&#x000b0;C above optimal growing conditions will induce heat shock or heat stress to plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Every year, there is substantial crop yield loss due to the elevated temperature and drought stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The development of genetically heat-resistant plants has been considered as a promising approach for alleviating the threats from high-temperature stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Heat tolerance of plants is a complex multigenic process with different regulatory mechanisms sets throughout the gene network during plant development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Larkindale <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] reported that each of 45 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants had different responses to high temperature, which were involved in signaling pathways [abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene (ET), salicylic acid (SA), calcium, oxidative burst] and reactive oxygen metabolism (ascorbic acid or glutathione production, catalase). Additionally, ABA, SA or active oxygen molecule may serve as one signal to regulate gene chain in heat tolerant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Although many researches on heat-stress tolerance have advanced considerably in recent years, genome-wide comparisons in plants have not yet been made using the next-generation high-throughput sequencing technologies. Determining the multigenic net regulatory mechanisms of plant response to high temperature, particularly at the transcriptomic level, will be helpful in the development of heat-tolerant species.</p><p>Tall fescue (<italic>Festuca arundinacea</italic> Schreb.) is a forage and cool-season turfgrass species grown widely in the temperate regions of the world such as in United States, China, Japan, Australia and many countries in Europe because of its agronomic importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, high temperature (30&#x02013;41&#x000b0;C) is one of the limiting factors affecting forage production and turf management of tall fescue in the south such as the Great Plains of the U.S. and south of the Yangtze Rive in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The genome size of tall fescue is approximately 6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>3</sup> Mbp and about 14 times larger than that of rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. To date, complete genome sequences of tall fescue are not achieved. Although 59, 578 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) had been deposited in the NCBI GenBank database as of June 2014, molecular resouces of tall fescue are still limited because of the lack of genomic and transcriptomic information. An accelerated effort to acquire transcriptomes of tall fescue in response to high-temperature stress will be helpful in the development of heat-tolerant tall fescue cultivars. In the current study, two tall fescue genotypes, heat tolerant PI578718 and heat sensitive PI234881 identified from 120 tall fescue genotypes in our previous study (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], were used to investigate responses to high temperature at a global transcriptional level using an high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) approach. The objectives of this study were (1) to provide an initial investigation of genome-wide transcriptomic analysis; (2) to reveal novel insights into the regulation pattern of certain candidate genes in the critical metabolic pathways response to heat stress in cool-season turfgrass species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Analyses of RNA-Seq data</title><p>Cool-season turfgrass and forage grass species are especially sensitive to heat stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

The results of this study described the gene-level transcriptome in response to heat stress conditions in two tall fescue genotypes differing in high-temperature tolerance. Using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system (Illumina Inc. San Diego, CA), a total of 262 million high-quality 100-bp paired-end reads were sequenced and assembled into a reference transcriptome of tall fescue (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which is also the first transcriptome library in the grass species to be reported.

The unigenes obtained from a recent whole-genome-wide transcriptional analysis in two tall fescue genotypes under stress could greatly enrich the gene expression library response to high temperature in the grass family, especially in turfgrass and forage grasses.

Genes encoding cellular process (1,549; 25.91%) and metabolic process (1,839; 30.76%) proteins were the most enriched in the biological process category.

Each reaction consisted of a 2&#x000a0;ng of total RNA, 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of each primer and 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L master mix. The PCRs were performed in thermocycler conditions starting with 3&#x000a0;min at 95&#x000b0;C, 40&#x000a0;cycles of 10&#x000a0;s at 94&#x000b0;C, 20&#x000a0;s at 55&#x000b0;C, and 20&#x000a0;s at 72&#x000b0;C, followed by 5&#x000a0;min at 72&#x000b0;C. To verify the presence of a specific product, the melting curve analysis of amplification products was performed at the end of each PCR reaction. In addition, the size of each amplified DNA fragment was verified on a 1.5% (w/v) agarose&#x02013;ethidium bromide gel at 100&#x000a0;V for 40&#x000a0;min in 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;TE buffer (10&#x000a0;mM Tris, 1&#x000a0;mM EDTA).
