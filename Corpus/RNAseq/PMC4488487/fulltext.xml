To this end, we created a transgenic &#x0201c;oncopig&#x0201d; line encoding Cre recombinase inducible porcine transgenes encoding KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and TP53<sup>R167H</sup>, which represent a commonly mutated oncogene and tumor suppressor in human cancers, respectively. Treatment of cells derived from these oncopigs with the adenovirus encoding Cre (AdCre) led to KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and TP53<sup>R167H</sup> expression, which rendered the cells transformed in culture and tumorigenic when engrafted into immunocompromised mice. Finally, injection of AdCre directly into these oncopigs led to the rapid and reproducible tumor development of mesenchymal origin. Transgenic animals receiving AdGFP (green fluorescent protein) did not have any tumor mass formation or altered histopathology. This oncopig line could thus serve as a genetically malleable model for potentially a wide spectrum of cancers, while controlling for temporal or spatial genesis, which should prove invaluable to studies previously hampered by the lack of a large animal model of cancer.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the following: China Scholarship Council (CSC): WH; Brazilian Scholarship Program "Science Without Borders" promoted by the National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iie.org/Programs/Brazil-Scientific-Mobility">http://www.iie.org/Programs/Brazil-Scientific-Mobility</ext-link>): FMR, TVC and FKS; American Cancer Society (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.org/research/applyforaresearchgrant/">http://www.cancer.org/research/applyforaresearchgrant/</ext-link>) (ACS178898): YL; American Cancer Society (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.org/research/applyforaresearchgrant/">http://www.cancer.org/research/applyforaresearchgrant/</ext-link>) (ACS178898): CMC; U.S. National Institutes of Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/oer.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/oer.htm</ext-link>) (CA123031) and the Edward Spiegel Fund of the Lymphoma Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lymphomafoundation.org/">http://www.lymphomafoundation.org/</ext-link>): CMC; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.csrees.usda.gov/">http://www.csrees.usda.gov/</ext-link>)(AG 58-5438-2-307), The U.S. National Institutes of Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/oer.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/oer.htm</ext-link>) (CA 153132), the Edward William &#x00026; Jane Marr Gutgsell Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://provost.illinois.edu/about/chairs.html">http://provost.illinois.edu/about/chairs.html</ext-link>), and the Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science &#x00026; Technology Development (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.csrees.usda.gov/">http://www.csrees.usda.gov/</ext-link>)(PJ009103); Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rda.go.kr/foreign/eng/">http://www.rda.go.kr/foreign/eng/</ext-link>): LBS; and U.S. National Institutes of Health (U42 OD011140): RSP.

In this regard, the pig is an ideal large animal platform to develop such a model. These are large mammals with similar anatomy to humans [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Both their basal metabolic rate and their xenosensor pregnane X receptor that regulates <italic>CYP3A</italic> expression, which is responsible for the metabolism of half of all prescription drugs [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], are also very similar to humans [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Like humans, pigs also require multiple genetic changes to develop cancer [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>To develop a porcine model of cancer, we chose to recapitulate those mutations most commonly found in human cancer. Previously, we had demonstrated that human mutations when provided in gene expression studies using autologous porcine fibroblasts resulted in oncogenes molecularly similar to that observed in humans and with similar pathology [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In this study, we have targeted the <italic>RAS</italic> gene which is mutated in one quarter of all human cancers, with the <italic>KRAS</italic> isoform being the most commonly mutated [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] yielding a constitutively active, oncogenic protein [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] that experimentally induces cancer in mice [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and human cells [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], in addition to underlying a number of hereditary cancer syndromes [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The gene <italic>TP53</italic> is mutated in a third of human cancers [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to silence this tumor suppressive pathway, which similarly is known to promote cancer in both mouse [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and porcine [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] genetic models as well as in human cells [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and is associated with the cancer predisposition Li-Fraumeni Syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Mutations in these two genes occur in concert in human cancers (COSMIC) [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, mice genetically engineered to undergo recombination to convert their wild-type <italic>Kras</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic> alleles to oncogenic and dominant-negative or null versions, respectively, rapidly develop aggressive cancers at the sites of recombination [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. With regards to pigs, both oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic> and dominant-negative <italic>p53</italic> help promote the tumorigenic conversion of normal porcine cells to a tumorigenic state [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and pigs engineered with a mutant TP53 allele are prone to develop lymphomas and osteogenic tumors [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Most recently, a conditionally activated oncogenic KRAS mutation in pigs has been reported [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As such, we chose to engineer pigs with inducible expression of these commonly mutated and potent oncogene and tumor suppressor genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Creation of oncopigs encoding inducible oncogenic KRAS and dominant-negative TP53</title><p>To create an inducible porcine model of cancer, which we term &#x0201c;oncopig&#x0201d;, we first cloned the porcine <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic> cDNAs from the Duroc pig (2&#x02013;14, TJ Tabasco) that was used to sequence the pig genome [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Site-directed mutagenesis was then used to introduce the oncogenic G12D mutation into the porcine <italic>KRAS</italic> cDNA. This mutation was chosen as an aspartic acid substitution accounts for over a third of the mutations at the G12 position in human cancers [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and introducing this mutation into the endogenous murine <italic>Kras</italic> gene promotes tumorigenesis [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Similarly, the R167H mutation was chosen as its human equivalent (R175H) is commonly found in human cancers [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] as well as the cancer predisposition Li-Fraumeni Syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and when introduced into the endogenous murine [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or porcine [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] <italic>TP53</italic> gene, induces tumors. These two cDNAs were then introduced into a Cre-inducible vector, yielding an expression construct containing the CAG promoter, followed by the aforementioned LSL sequence, <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic></sup>, an IRES sequence to allow for bicistronic expression, <italic>TP53</italic><sup><italic>R167H</italic></sup> and a poly A sequence (<xref rid="pone.0128864.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>).

A total of &#x0003e;100 such embryos were transferred to a surrogate sow, which yielded four male oncopig offspring (63&#x02013;1, 63&#x02013;2, 63&#x02013;3, 63&#x02013;4).

These individual cell lines from transgenic oncopigs were infected with either adenovirus encoding the marker green fluorescence protein (AdGFP) or adenovirus encoding Cre recombinase (AdCre), and the resultant matched pairs of infected cultures were assayed for transformed and tumorigenic phenotypes. As expected, only the AdCre exposed cells exhibited detectable levels of <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic></sup> and <italic>TP53</italic><sup><italic>R167H</italic></sup> mRNA, as assessed by RT-PCR (<xref rid="pone.0128864.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>). Additionally, there was a clear difference in the morphology of the AdCre cells compared to the control AdGFP cells. Specifically, the former lost the spindle morphology characteristic of either the same cells prior to AdCre infection or when infected with the AdGFP control virus, and instead were smaller, rounder much more loosely attached to the plate and would spontaneously form foci (<xref rid="pone.0128864.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). This difference foreshadowed other transformed phenotypes. Specifically, FACS analysis revealed mean cell cycle length of all four lines was shortened from 22 hours in the AdGFP control population to 13 hours in the AdCre population (<xref rid="pone.0128864.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>).

To this end, pig 63&#x02013;3 was used to produce a cohort of transgenic littermate oncopigs for this analysis. Pig 63&#x02013;3 was selected following DNA sequence analysis indicating that the transgene construct was inserted at a single location within intron 4 of the porcine CCDC-129 gene (coiled-coil domain containing 129) located on SSC18. Furthermore, the insertion was oriented in a 3&#x02019; to 5&#x02019; direction relative to the chromosome and there was no evidence of a concactomer. Thus, the oncogene construct (<xref rid="pone.0128864.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>) from boar 63&#x02013;3 would be inherited as a single autosomal gene.</p><p>The first of these, oncopig-1, was administered AdCre intramuscularly into the left hind leg.

Not only was this tumor rapidly established, but it also grew quickly, reaching a volume of 8 cm<sup>2</sup> within 20 days. Pathologic analysis of H&#x00026;E stained sections of the tumor revealed this tumor to be of mesenchymal origin (<xref rid="pone.0128864.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4g</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0128864.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Specifically, the tumor was microscopically characterized as a densely cellular, non-encapsulated and locally infiltrative neoplasm. The cells are arranged in bundles, streams and small sheets of supported by a fibrous stroma. Individual neoplastic cells were pleomorphic round to oval to polygonal with single to multiple nuclei. Areas of necrosis and chronic inflammation were scattered within the tumor (<xref rid="pone.0128864.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4<italic>g</italic></xref>). Neoplastic cells were stained positively with vimentin and smooth muscle markers (muscle specific actin and smooth muscle actin). This was a reproducible result, as intramuscular injection of AdCre into the other rear leg similarly yielded a tumor of mesenchymal origin at the site of injection (<xref rid="pone.0128864.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, tumorigenesis was induced in other littermate offspring, indicating this was not unique to a single animal tested.

Histopathology of this tumor revealed a poorly differentiated tumor likely of sex cord stromal origin. Similarly, the ear, abdomen and neck of oncopig-3 were injected subcutaneously with AdCre, which again led to tumor masses at all three sites with the pathology of sarcoma with regional smooth muscle differentiation (leiomyosarcoma) (<xref rid="pone.0128864.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4<italic>b</italic></xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128864.g004" ref-type="fig">4<italic>e</italic></xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128864.g004" ref-type="fig">4<italic>h</italic></xref> and <xref rid="pone.0128864.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

We now report the creation of a transgenic oncopig line encoding a Cre recombinase inducible transgene encoding <italic>KRAS</italic><sup><italic>G12D</italic></sup> and <italic>TP53</italic><sup><italic>R167H</italic></sup>, a commonly mutated oncogene [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and tumor suppressor [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], respectively, in human cancers. This study is an extension on our previous work [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] where we demonstrated that mutations in genes identified in human studies when inserted into porcine genes did result in oncogenesis and pathology that replicated tumors observed clinically.</p><p>In validating the porcine cancer animal model it is imperative that the resulting tumor masses are validated with what is observed in human medicine. This need has been clearly articulated by Cardiff [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] where the neoplastic progression using the mouse for breast cancer using human mutations failed to replicate tumors observed in the clinic. Thus, this study focused on demonstrating that genetically engineered porcine tumors result in histopathological phenotypes that span from signature phenotypes to mimicking human cancers [<xref rid="pone.0128864.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Thus, the porcine model was validated by the demonstration that derived fibroblasts from transgenic oncopigs treated with AdCre demonstrated activation of the transgene, leading to all the <italic>in vitro</italic> hallmarks of tumors, including a transformed cell morphology, increased proliferation and migration, and the ability to growth in an anchorage-independent fashion. In agreement, these cells were highly tumorigenic when explanted into immuno-compromised mice. This effect was highly reproducible, arguing against the acquisition of a unique genetic background predisposing a cell line to become transformed, as the same phenotypes were observed in fibroblasts derived from a total of four individual oncopigs. Taken together, these data support the conclusion that the derived oncopig fibroblasts are inducibly tumorigenic.</p><p>Consistent with the ability of the derived oncopig fibroblasts to be tumorigenic, an intramuscular injection of AdCre into transgenic oncopigs resulted in the development of a mesenchymal tumor suggestive of leiomyosarcoma at the site of injection. Again, this result was highly reproducible, being observed not only in a different site within the same pig, but also in different littermate oncopigs. As leiomyosarcoma are of smooth muscle origin, presumably these tumors arose from infection of this muscle type, perhaps in the vasculature or the piloerector muscles. AdCre injection into the testes gave rise to a differentiated tumor likely of sex cord stromal origin. In addition, neither the control non-transgenic pigs injected with AdCre nor the control oncopigs injected with AdGFP developed any tumor mass or pathological changes. Taken together, these data support the conclusion that activation of cells in vivo by AdCre induces tumorigenesis. Moreover, these data also suggest that induction of recombination in other tissues, <italic>vis-&#x000e0;-vis</italic> delivery of AdCre by different means than undertaken here or, in the future by tissue-restricted expression of a Cre transgene, may lead to a host of other cancers. As such, this &#x02018;oncopig&#x02019; line provides a genetically malleable model for potentially a wide spectrum of cancers, which should prove invaluable to studies previously hampered by the lack of a large animal model of cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All animal work was conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines.
