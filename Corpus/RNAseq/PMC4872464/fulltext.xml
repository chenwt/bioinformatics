However, as with many targeted therapies, clinical responses to angiogenesis inhibitors (AI) are typically limited, manifested as increased, but limited progression-free survival and variable (or no) overall survival (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Vasudev and Reynolds, 2014</xref>; and references therein). Concurrent with such clinical investigations, a number of preclinical studies of AI in various mouse models of human cancer have revealed multiple forms of adaptive resistance that enable tumors to evade the effects of AI therapy (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bergers and Hanahan, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Clarke and Hurwitz, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Welti et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">McIntyre and Harris, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rigamonti et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Rivera et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). One such model&#x02014;<italic>RIP1Tag2</italic> transgenic mice, which develop de novo pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNET) via a multistage pathway&#x02014;has been particularly instructive: tumorigenesis involves a discrete angiogenic switch (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Folkman et&#x000a0;al., 1989</xref>), which is necessary for initial tumor formation. AIs, in particular ones targeting the VEGF signaling pathway, show demonstrable efficacy in this model (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bergers et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>), the results of which motivated clinical trials that led to the approval of one such agent, sunitinib, in human PanNET (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Raymond et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, however, AIs are not curative in this mouse model, much as in human cancer patients. The basis for treatment failure lies in part in the development of multiple forms of adaptive resistance to AIs, including revascularization mediated by alternative pro-angiogenic signaling circuits (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Casanovas et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), recruitment of vascular-protective myeloid cells (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Shojaei and Ferrara, 2008</xref>), and cooption of normal tissue vessels via increased invasion and metastasis (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Sennino et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ebos and Kerbel, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ebos et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">P&#x000e0;ez-Ribes et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The RIP1Tag2 model has also been used to investigate other cancer hallmarks, including resistance to apoptosis and induction of invasiveness, which are variously regulated by signaling from receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, IGFR, IR, and ALK (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chun et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Nolan-Stevaux et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Ulanet et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>); these signals converge in part on the mTOR kinase, which orchestrates a broad program affecting cell survival and metabolism (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cornu et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). Notably, both preclinical (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chiu et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>) and clinical studies (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Yao et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>) have demonstrated the efficacy of targeting mTOR in PanNET.</p><p>We have continued to assess the effects on AI therapy in this PanNET model, including a comparative analysis of two multi-kinase inhibitors, sunitinib and axitinib, both of which target the VEGFR/PDGFR signaling pathways to inhibit new blood vessel growth and disrupt endothelial cells and pericytes of the preexisting tumor vasculature (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bergers et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>), reducing vascular density and functionality rather than producing the vascularization characteristic of less potent AI such as bevacizumab. Although both compounds have a similar target profile, axitinib exhibits fewer off target effects and toxicity (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Gunnarsson et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov" id="intref0010">http://www.accessdata.fda.gov</ext-link>). In the course of further characterizing cellular and histologic responses to the two drugs, in particular their effects on the aforementioned mTOR signaling pathway, we observed an intriguing switch in the pattern of mTOR activity, reflected by phosphorylation of its downstream effector S6. Specifically, the diffuse pattern seen in untreated tumors was replaced by one of focal clusters. This focal reorganization of mTOR signaling motivated the investigation reported below, where we implicate metabolic symbiosis as another mode of adaptive resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Sunitinib/Axitinib Treatment Affects mTOR Signaling in Mouse PanNET</title><p>Given that mTOR signaling is prominently involved in the PanNET phenotype (see above), we had asked whether it was affected by disruption of the tumor vasculature with sunitinib. Indeed, mTOR signaling was found to be elevated in a set of sunitinib-treated tumors, as reflected in the heightened levels of phospho-S6 kinase (p-S6). In contrast, sunitinib treatment of cultured mouse PanNET cells did not elicit this upregulation (data not shown). To substantiate this observation, molecular efficacy trials were performed with sunitinib, in which mice with late stage tumors were treated for 7&#x000a0;days followed by analysis of tumor lysates by western blotting. Sunitinib elicited an increase in p-S6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A, left), which was blocked by concomitant administration of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A, right), demonstrating that its upregulation is mTOR dependent. Axitinib-treated tumors produced a similar trend (data not shown).</p><p>The elevated mTOR signaling was surprising in that sunitinib- and axitinib-treated tumors become hypoxic in response to collapse of the tumor vasculature (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">P&#x000e0;ez-Ribes et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Sennino et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>), and observations presented below), and mTOR is typically downregulated in hypoxic conditions (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Brugarolas et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, a derivative PanNET cancer cell line (&#x003b2;TC4) downregulated p-S6 in hypoxic versus normoxic conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B). Intrigued by this apparent dichotomy, we further investigated mTOR signaling in tumors treated for 4&#x000a0;weeks using immunohistochemistry. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C, p-S6 was elevated in sunitinib-treated tumors, but its expression was relocalized from the diffuse pattern seen in control tumors into focal clusters. The specificity of the p-S6 staining in control and sunitinib-treated tumors was confirmed by treatment with rapamycin, which ablated p-S6 expression, even when dosed in combination with sunitinib.</p><p>Next, we assessed the relationship between p-S6 expression and hypoxia in treated tumors. Co-staining of sunitinib- and axitinib-treated tumors with antibodies to p-S6 and pimonidazole&#x02014;to reveal regions of hypoxia&#x02014;revealed an anti-correlation: p-S6 was predominantly expressed in the normoxic, and not hypoxic, regions of the treated tumors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D).</p><p>Eventually, as the vascular regression and inhibition of new growth continues, the normoxic regions seen in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D can coalesce into the focal clusters seen in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C. This is further illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>E, which shows a highly necrotic/hypoxic tumor (left); within the regions of fibrosis/necrosis, focal clusters of viable cancer cells can be seen (H&#x00026;E, middle left). These clusters are highly proliferative (Ki-67, middle right) and are cuffing blood vessels (CD31, right).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>AI Treatment of Mouse PanNETs Produces Upregulation of Glucose and Lactate Transporters in Patterns Suggestive of Metabolic Symbiosis</title><p>The clustering of viable cancer cells around the few remaining blood vessels inside long-term treated tumors is consistent with their need for oxygen, but also for blood-borne nutrients, in particular glucose. We performed short-term trials using sunitinib alone or in combination with rapamycin and then performed RNA-sequencing (seq) analysis on the treated and control tumors. We conducted enrichment analysis on the top 2,500 unregulated genes in the control versus treated tumors, and the top ten enriched hallmark pathways for sunitinib monotherapy are depicted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A, including hypoxia and glycolysis. The enrichment plot for the hallmark glycolysis signature (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A) includes <italic>Slc16a3</italic> (MCT 4) and <italic>Ldha</italic> (lactate dehydrogenase&#x000a0;A; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B), along with (to a lesser degree) <italic>Slc2a1</italic> (GLUT1, data not shown). Both sunitinib and axitinib produced marked reductions in tumor vasculature (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>A) with widespread hypoxia, consistent with the hypoxia signature. Motivated by the glycolysis signature and the known induction of glycolysis by hypoxia, we assessed expression by immunostaining for the lactate transporter MCT4 and the glucose transporter GLUT1, whose elevated co-expression is diagnostic of glycolysis (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ullah et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Concordantly, the striking upregulation of <italic>Slc16a3</italic>/MCT4 revealed by the RNA profiling of sunitinib-treated tumors was detected by immunohistochemistry in tissue sections from the majority of sunitinib- and axitinib-treated tumors and was very low/absent in control or rapamycin-treated tumors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C). In treated tumors, GLUT1 and MCT4 were upregulated in the hypoxic regions, as revealed by co-staining with pimonidazole (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D). Such upregulation in hypoxic conditions is consistent with previous reports that GLUT1 and MCT4 are regulated by the HIF hypoxia response system (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Ebert et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ullah et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Seagroves et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>). To confirm this interpretation, we evaluated compound mice carrying a tissue-specific gene knock out of HIF1&#x003b1; in the oncogene-expressing cancer cells. Indeed, sunitinib treatment failed to upregulate GLUT1 and MCT4 in the Hif1&#x003b1;-knockout (KO) tumors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>E), supporting the expectation that HIF1&#x003b1; drives their upregulation.</p><p>The compartmental expression of GLUT1/MCT4 was reminiscent of a phenomenon&#x02014;observed in certain tumors&#x02014;known as metabolic symbiosis, wherein hypoxic regions import and metabolize glucose (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Ebert et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>) and secrete lactate, while normoxic regions import and metabolize the lactate (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Sonveaux et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kennedy et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). We therefore assessed expression of the lactate transporter MCT1 and found that it was upregulated in a distinct compartment from the hypoxic, MCT4 positive region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>F), although a small minority of cells are MCT1<sup>+</sup>/MCT4<sup>+</sup> double positive (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>B).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Mouse PanNET Tumors and Cell Lines Consume and Catabolize Lactate to Establish Metabolic Symbiosis</title><p>The hypothesis of metabolic symbiosis demands that the secreted lactate is not merely &#x0201c;toxic acidic waste&#x0201d;, but rather a source of fuel that is imported and metabolized by the normoxic cancer cells. We assessed whether cultured &#x003b2;TC3 cells could recapitulate key aspects of the hypoxic response in culture and found that GLUT1 and MCT4 were upregulated under hypoxic conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A). We further assessed lactate utilization in cultured cancer cells and in tumor-bearing mice, by supplying isotopically labeled lactate or glucose, and assessing their catabolism into metabolites by NMR spectroscopy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and 3C). Thus, &#x003b2;TC3 cancer cells were cultured in hypoxic and normoxic conditions, in which they were supplied with <sup>1</sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>13</sup>C-glucose or with <sup>3</sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>13</sup>C-lactate in glucose-free media, in both cases similarly supplemented with glutamine and fetal calf serum (FCS); after 20&#x000a0;hr, the cells were harvested for NMR analysis. At this time point, cells cultured in <sup>1</sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>13</sup>C-glucose increased the levels of lactate in conditioned media both in hypoxia and normoxia, whereas cells cultured in <sup>3</sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>13</sup>C-lactate reduced the levels of lactate in conditioned media under normoxia and slightly increased lactate in hypoxic conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B, legend). The <sup>13</sup>C NMR analysis revealed that in aerobic conditions <sup>3</sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>13</sup>C-lactate was catabolized to C4-glutamate, C2- and C3-aspartate (Asp), and C3-alanine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B), consistent with previous studies on lactate metabolism by cancer cells and neurons (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kennedy et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Waagepetersen et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, lactate was imported,&#x000a0;but&#x000a0;not catabolized in hypoxic conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B). Notably,&#x000a0;the lactate catabolites coincide with those produced by <sup>1</sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>13</sup>C-glucose, indicating that both sets are likely produced through the same intermediate, pyruvate.</p><p>Next, tumor-bearing mice treated for 10&#x000a0;days with sunitinib, rapamycin+sunitinib, or vehicle control were infused with <sup>3</sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>13</sup>C-lactate and the tumors excised and evaluated by NMR. Both treated and control tumors metabolized lactate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C). Additionally, the branched metabolic pathways involved in lactate catabolism may be altered in activity. The prominent <sup>3</sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>13</sup>C-alanine band produced from <sup>3</sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>13</sup>C-lactate &#x02192; <sup>3</sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>13</sup>C-pyruvate&#x000a0;+ glutamate &#x02192; <sup>3</sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>13</sup>C-Ala&#x000a0;+ &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate is relatively undiminished versus the glutamate and Asp species in the sunitinib-treated tumors; notably, the pathway producing <sup>3</sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>13</sup>C-Ala&#x000a0;+ &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate is involved in sustaining tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates important both for energy production and biosynthesis of cellular building blocks, a process referred to as anaplerosis. Intriguingly, RNaseq and RT-quantitative (q)PCR analysis (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>) of sunitinib versus control tumors revealed upregulation of <italic>Gpt2</italic>, an aminotransferase catalyzing the transamination that produces alanine&#x000a0;+ &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate from pyruvate and glutamate. In addition, <italic>Gls</italic>2, which converts glutamine to glutamate in the first step of its metabolism, is also upregulated (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). In contrast, the rapamycin+sunitinib-treated tumors did not produce <sup>3</sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>13</sup>C-Ala. Rather, lactate-derived pyruvate evidently was converted to acetyl-CoA to enter the TCA cycle, producing C2- and C4-glutamate and C2- and C3-Asp (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C). Thus, the data suggest that glutamine-associated catabolism of lactate to alanine becomes favored in the context of sunitinib therapy, which in the combination-treated tumors is repressed&#x02014;directly or indirectly&#x02014;by mTOR inhibition. Collectively, these observations, along with previous studies indicating the link between glutamine metabolism and mTOR signaling (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Csibi et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dur&#x000e1;n et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>), led us to consider the possible involvement of glutamine and the observed metabolism of lactate in the induction of mTOR signaling.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>mTOR Signaling in Cultured Cancer Cells can Be Upregulated by Lactate and Glutamine Metabolism</title><p>Motivated by the observation that expression of <italic>Gls2</italic> was increased in sunitinib-treated tumors (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>), we asked whether it was expressed in the hypoxic or normoxic compartment. Analysis of sunitinib-treated and control untreated tumors by fluorescent staining with anti-glutaminase 2 (GLS2) and pimonidazole demonstrated elevated expression of glutaminase 2 in both cases, and it could be found in both normoxic and hypoxic compartments in sunitinib-treated tumors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A), a result that was substantiated via RT-qPCR analysis of &#x003b2;TC3s cultured under normoxic and hypoxic growth conditions (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>); we also analyzed additional metabolic genes for differential expression and found significant upregulation of <italic>Slc2a1</italic>, <italic>Slc16a3</italic>, and <italic>Ldha</italic> in hypoxic conditions, whereas <italic>Slc2a2</italic>, <italic>Ldhb</italic>, and <italic>Gpt2</italic> were elevated in normoxic growth conditions (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated possible links between glutamine, lactate metabolism, and mTOR signaling. First, we assessed the importance of glutamine for cell proliferation of &#x003b2;TC3 cells by EdU incorporation, which revealed minimal difference between the various culture conditions containing glutamine, with or without glucose and/or lactate; there was, however, a block in cell-cycle progression under glucose without glutamine conditions (w/wo lactate) (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>A), highlighting the dependence of these cells on glutamine. Then, we evaluated mTOR signaling in &#x003b2;TC3 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B) cultured in different combinations of lactate and glutamine. Cells were cultured in FCS and glutamine-supplemented, glucose-free media, with or without lactate. Net changes in lactate levels in conditioned media (CM) were assessed. Lactate levels in glutamine-supplemented, glucose-free cell media decreased reproducibly under aerobic conditions, consistent with its uptake by &#x003b2;TC3 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>B and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>B). Moreover, there was significant upregulation of p-S6 levels in cells cultured in lactate&#x000a0;+ glutamine versus glutamine alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B, top and bottom), correlating with a net reduction of lactate in CM. As expected, upregulation of p-S6 could be reversed by rapamycin. Notably, p-S6 upregulation could also be reversed by inhibiting lactate uptake with CHC or 7ACC2, two distinctive inhibitors of the MCT1 lactate transporter (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Sonveaux et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Draoui et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B, top and bottom). In addition, a glutaminase inhibitor, DON (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dur&#x000e1;n et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B, top and bottom), and an alanine aminotransferase inhibitor, AOA (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Lamonte et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B, top), also reversed p-S6 upregulation, whereas a glutaminase 1-specific inhibitor, BPTES, did not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B, bottom). We observed similar effects of lactate and glutamine on mTOR signaling in lactate-avid SiHa ovarian cancer cells (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>C), which have been extensively used to study metabolic symbiosis (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Sonveaux et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Collectively, the data support a mechanism whereby cancer cells take up and metabolize lactate in the context of bioavailable glutamine in normoxic, but not hypoxic conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and 3C), thereby upregulating mTOR signaling (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B).

Regression trials (depicted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>A) were initiated at 13&#x000a0;weeks, when the mice already had appreciable tumor burden, and continued to a defined endpoint 2&#x000a0;weeks later (15&#x000a0;weeks), when most untreated animals have succumbed to hypoglycemia attributable to increased insulin secretion from the multiple pancreatic tumors that develop. Reasoning that vascular collapse might affect the bioavailability of rapamycin in the tumor microenvironment, we tested a trial regimen in which R+S and R+A arms were dosed for an initial 2D with rapamycin alone, followed by continuous dosing in combination with the AI (called &#x0201c;stagger&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;St&#x0201d;). Another cohort of R+S was dosed simultaneously with both drugs from the beginning (&#x0201c;simultaneous&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Sim&#x0201d;). All three monotherapies (Mono-S, red triangles; Mono-R, yellow triangles; and Mono-A, green circles) showed anti-tumor activity, blocking further growth to produce tumor stasis compared to 13&#x000a0;week controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B, blue circles). In marked contrast, each of the combinations of rapamycin plus an AI (R+S-St, purple diamonds; R+S-Sim, purple triangles; and R+A-St, rose squares) produced significant tumor regression versus the 13&#x000a0;week starting time point (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B, blue circles). An additional 4-week-long intervention trial was performed with sunitinib, starting at 11&#x000a0;weeks, when the tumors were smaller, until the same defined 15&#x000a0;week endpoint (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C). Again, while Mono-S (red triangles) and Mono-R (yellow triangles) produced significantly smaller tumors than vehicle-treated controls (blue circles), their combination (R+S-St, purple diamonds and R+S-Sim, purple triangles) produced significantly lower tumor burden than either efficacious monotherapy. Other dosing strategies were also assessed, including a shift from Mono-R to Mono-S (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C, R-&#x0003e;S, green circles), which appeared indistinguishable from each monotherapy in regard to tumor burden (TB). There was also an efficacious response to the combination R+S when sunitinib was reduced by half (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C, R+1/2S, blue-gray circles). Thus, both experimental therapeutic trials demonstrated anti-tumoral efficacy for the combination of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and a potent AI.</p><p>In order to further characterize the therapeutic response, open endpoint survival trials were performed with the combinations, in comparison to monotherapy- and vehicle-treated controls. Cohorts of mice were treated starting at 13&#x000a0;weeks until they became moribund and were sacrificed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>D). All treatments, including the monotherapy arms, led to a significant survival advantage versus vehicle-treated mice. End stage tumors had progressed to a considerable size on rapamycin monotherapy, larger on average than untreated controls, indicating an adaptive resistance involving enhanced growth rates (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>A), as reported previously (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chiu et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Overall, TB at end stage was higher in regimens involving axitinib versus sunitinib (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>A). Interestingly, both AIs produced tumors that never revascularized (data not shown). Additionally, the combination therapies reduced the frequency of metastasis compared to both AI monotherapies, despite the significantly longer survival of mice in the dual therapy arms (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>B). It is unclear why the mice with only residual TB were dying, which is a topic worthy of future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>mTOR Inhibition Disrupts Metabolic Symbiosis</title><p>The combination of rapamycin plus sunitinib treatment for 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;weeks reproducibly elicited tumor regression, characterized by widespread necrosis and fibrosis, and markedly reduced proliferation, particularly in large tumors (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S4</xref>A, S4B, and S6). In contrast, while 8&#x000a0;weeks of Mono-S also produced tumors with pronounced necrosis and fibrosis, the remaining tumor cells were highly proliferative (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>E). When 13- to 15-week-treated tumors were analyzed comparatively for proliferation rates via Ki-67 staining, there was a significant reduction in proliferation in R+S-treated tumors versus controls and both monotherapies (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>B). Tumors treated with Mono-R had limited necrosis (data not shown), consistent with this and our previous study indicating it elicited heighted rates of apoptosis without appreciable necrosis (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chiu et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>) (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>C).</p><p>Seeking to understand the basis for this heightened necrosis, and having identified putative symbiotic clusters of cancer cells associated with remaining blood vessels in the Mono-S-treated tumors, we asked whether rapamycin was affecting symbiosis in the R+S-treated tumors. The clusters could still be detected, as revealed by co-staining with MCT1 and MCT4, but their morphology was altered. Surprisingly, we observed that cancer cells in the hypoxic GLUT1<sup>high</sup>, MCT4<sup>high</sup>, and mTOR<sup>low</sup> compartment were selectively depleted compared to those cells in the normoxic GLUT1<sup>low</sup>, MCT1<sup>high</sup>, and mTOR<sup>high</sup> regions where rapamycin was acting to suppress mTOR signaling. Only a rim of MCT4 cells could be detected, flanking regions of necrosis, in contrast to the multiple layers of such cells seen in the Mono-S-treated tumors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A). In contrast, rapamycin did not obviously disrupt the (previously p-S6<sup>high</sup>) MCT1<sup>high</sup> compartment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A). Thus, inhibition of mTOR signaling in the normoxic compartment was disrupting the symbiosis, but via an unexpected paracrine mechanism.</p><p>A tenant of the symbiosis hypothesis is that the normoxic cancer cells have not upregulated glucose transporters, in contrast to the hypoxic cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D), thereby sparing limited bioavailable glucose to diffuse from the nearest blood vessel to distal, but still viable hypoxic cancer cells. We wondered, therefore, if mTOR inhibition affected expression of glucose transporters? We first surveyed untreated tumors and observed heterogeneous expression of GLUT1 and a related transporter GLUT2, which is involved in glucose homeostasis in pancreatic islets (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Guillam et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>) (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>A). A third transporter, GLUT3, was not consistently expressed (data not shown). Mono-S- and R+S-treated tumors were stained with antibodies that recognized pimonidazole adducts, indicative of hypoxia, and anti-GLUT1 and anti-GLUT2 antibodies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>B). The analysis revealed appreciable upregulation of GLUT2 expression (red staining) in the normoxic regions of R+S, but not Mono-S-treated tumors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>B, bottom); the Mono-S tumors express very little GLUT2 (or GLUT1) in normoxic regions proximal to the vessels. In contrast to GLUT2, GLUT1 is not widely upregulated in the normoxic compartment of R+S-treated tumors. We also performed comparative IHC using automated staining with GLUT1 and GLUT2 and saw a similar upregulation of GLUT2 in the normoxic regions of R+S- versus Mono-S-treated tumors (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>B). Western blot analysis on tumors also confirmed GLUT2 upregulation in R+S-treated tumors versus Mono-S (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>C), as did qRT-PCR (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). There was also a modest upregulation of GLUT2 in &#x003b2;TC3 cells cultured in glutamine+lactate+rapamycin versus glutamine &#x000b1; lactate (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>D), conditions we believe may be a surrogate for those found in the oxidative cancer cells inside AI-treated tumors. Although consistent with the in&#x000a0;vivo results, further work is required to substantiate these findings and determine the molecular pathway that governs this regulation. Thus, we envision that the normoxic compartment of the putative symbiotic clusters switches, in the context of mTOR inhibition, to importing and metabolizing blood-borne glucose instead of sparing it to favor lactate. Consequently, the vascular non-proximal hypoxic cells would starve from glucose deprivation and die; likely exacerbated by lactic acidosis, since the normoxic cells are now net secretors of lactate as a consequence of aerobic glycolysis. Transmission electron microscopy (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S6</xref>) of cancer cells in the peri-necrotic region of a R+S-treated tumor reveals cells with granulated cytoplasm and grossly distended mitochondria, and abundant insulin granules, potentially indicative of the extreme conditions of insufficient oxygen and glucose, and an acidic microenvironment. To further substantiate these associations, <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S7</xref> shows images of additional Control, Mono-S-, and R+S-treated tumors on serial sections stained with anti-MCT1, anti-MCT4, and pimonidazole, matched with anti-phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (pS6), -GLUT1, and -GLUT2. These images further document the upregulation of MCT1/4 in Mono-S- and R+S-treated tumors versus untreated controls and abundant MCT1 staining in the R+S tumors. The pimonidazole/pS6 panels show strong and relatively homogenous staining of pS6&#x000a0;in non-hypoxic control tumors, and compartmentalized pS6 staining in the normoxic regions of Mono-S tumors, but no reactivity in the R+S-treated tumors. The TEM and immunostaining analysis both support the interpretation that the hypoxic compartment is being eliminated faster than the normoxic one in the R+S-treated tumors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this and the two companion reports in this issue of <italic>Cell Reports</italic> from <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Pisarsky et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref> and <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jim&#x000e9;nez-Valerio et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, we describe an unanticipated new mode of adaptive resistance&#x02014;metabolic symbiosis&#x02014;that is induced in response to potent anti-angiogenic therapies that cause vascular collapse and consequent hypoxia. We show that cancer cells compartmentalize themselves in the acute condition of vascular insufficiency into comparatively hypoxic and normoxic compartments, based on their relative proximity to the few remaining functional blood vessels. The hypoxic cancer cells induce expression of the glucose importer GLUT1 and the lactate exporter MCT4, which is dependent on HIF1&#x003b1;. The normoxic cells express the lactate transporter MCT1, and we show that both normoxic cancer cells in culture and tumors in&#x000a0;vivo import and catabolize lactate; thus lactate is not just toxic waste from glycolysis, but rather is being used for energy metabolism. Moreover, our data reveal that the metabolic branch of lactate catabolism involving glutamine metabolism is favored, and this branch is blocked in tumors treated with rapamycin and anti-angiogenic therapy. Moreover, PanNET cancer cells cultured in the presence of lactate and glutamine upregulate phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (p-S6); the proposition that glutamine metabolism upregulates mTOR activity is consistent with previous studies in other cell culture systems (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dur&#x000e1;n et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). The association of lactate and glutamine catabolism in the regulation of mTOR in these conditions of stressful vascular insufficiency is further substantiated by our results showing that mTOR upregulation can be suppressed by impairing lactate uptake with known inhibitors of MCT1, or by inhibiting enzymes involved in glutaminolysis, namely glutaminase 2 that converts glutamine to glutamate in the first step of its metabolism and an alanine aminotransferase that in turn catalyzes the production of alanine&#x000a0;+ &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate from (lactate-derived) pyruvate and glutamate. Other studies have reported that mTOR regulates glutamine flux and glutaminase levels (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Csibi et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The observed upregulation/segregation of mTOR activity into the normoxic cell compartment induced by two potent AIs, and the resultant putative metabolic symbiosis, can be disrupted by concomitant inhibition of mTOR signaling with rapamycin. Remarkably, the initial impact of inhibiting mTOR in normoxic cancer cells is the necrotic death of the hypoxic cells, which lack elevated levels of mTOR signaling. An explanation for this intercellular crosstalk is offered by the observation that another glucose importer, GLUT2, is upregulated in normoxic peri-vascular cancer cells in response to rapamycin. The data suggest that the normoxic cancer cells proximal to the few remaining vessels consume the available blood-borne glucose when mTOR is inhibited, thereby starving distal hypoxic cancer cells, leading to their demise. Additionally, our NMR analysis of tumors suggests that mTOR inhibition blocks lactate catabolism via the anaplerotic pathway, and this abrogation of lactate consumption may lead to the intra-cellular and peri-cellular accumulation of toxic levels of lactate. The regulatory pathways involved in GLUT2 induction and metabolic reprogramming when the normoxic compartment is subjected to mTOR inhibition warrant future investigation.</p><p>Remarkably, as summarized in the introduction, multiple modes of adaptive or evasive resistance to therapies targeting tumor angiogenesis have been reported (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Casanovas et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Shojaei and Ferrara, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bergers and Hanahan, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ebos et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">P&#x000e0;ez-Ribes et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Sennino et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>) in experimental therapeutic trials performed using conventional transplant and genetically engineered de novo mouse models of cancer. Of these, only heighted invasiveness has been clearly implicated as an adaptive resistance mechanism in a human cancer, namely glioblastoma (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Lu and Bergers, 2013</xref>; and references therein), although similar mechanisms can be envisioned to underlay the transitory clinical responses to AI therapy in virtually all tested forms of human cancer. Notably, the accompanying report by <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jim&#x000e9;nez-Valerio et&#x000a0;al. (2016</xref>, this issue of <italic>Cell Reports</italic>) documents the induction of MCT1/MCT4 lactate transporters in a pattern consistent with metabolic symbiosis in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patient-derived xenograph tumor (PDX) models treated with AI therapy. Moreover, analysis of biopsies of tumors from RCC patients treated with sunitinib produced histologic signatures of metabolic symbiosis that were exacerbated in relapsing/progressing (resistant) tumors from patients on anti-angiogenic therapy. Their data further show that this metabolic patterning is associated with TOR signaling, since its inhibition can evidently block this characteristic patterning. This study in human RCC, along with the accompanying article by <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Pisarsky et&#x000a0;al. (2016</xref>, this issue of <italic>Cell Reports</italic>) in a mouse model of breast cancer and the results presented herein collectively and compellingly add metabolic symbiosis to the roster of adaptive/evasive resistance mechanisms to anti-angiogenic therapy.</p><p>In a broader context, the existence of metabolic symbiosis in tumors has been previously reported by Dewhirst, Sonveaux, Feron, and colleagues to arise spontaneously in certain transplant tumor models (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kennedy et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Sonveaux et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Semenza, 2008</xref>). They have described in a series of publications a metabolic symbiosis that conveyed decreased reliance on bioavailable glucose that limited the collateral damage from secreted lactate and consequent lactic acidosis, achieved by symbiotic cells importing and utilizing the lactate produced by glycolysis (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kennedy et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Sonveaux et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Semenza, 2008</xref>). The concept of metabolic symbiosis in neoplasia has been extended to interactions between cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts endothelial cells, macrophages (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Nakajima and Van Houten, 2013</xref>; and references therein), and also documented in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Guillaumond et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). Its physiological basis lays in analogous symbiotic relationships operative in certain normal tissues, in particular brain and muscle (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Draoui and Feron, 2011</xref>; and references therein). The concept can now be extended further, with the demonstrations that metabolic symbiosis can be induced in response to a serious environmental stress&#x02014;angiogenesis inhibition, with consequent dropout and insufficiency of the tumor vasculature, and widespread hypoxia&#x02014;in models of pancreatic neuroendocrine, breast, and renal cancer and in human RCC (this report, and the accompanying reports by <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Pisarsky et&#x000a0;al. [2016]</xref> and <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jim&#x000e9;nez-Valerio et&#x000a0;al. [2016]</xref>).</p><p>The question arises as to whether disruption of this mode of resistance might have value in extending the duration of efficacious responses by anti-angiogenic therapies. We show that metabolic symbiosis induced by sunitinib/axitinib can be disrupted by concomitant inhibition of mTOR signaling, resulting in significant reductions in TB and viability, but with only modest (albeit significant) extension in survival. The limited survival benefit suggests that &#x0201c;rapalogs&#x0201d; may not prove to be ideal drugs to disrupt this form of adaptive resistance; moreover, combinations of sunitinib/axitinib with the rapalog everolimus have been tested clinically, with limited benefit and significant toxicity (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Molina et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). An alternative and potentially more attractive strategy may be to inhibit the MCT1 and/or MCT4 lactate transporters with highly selective drugs. Indeed, the preliminary studies reported herein and in the companion paper by Christofori et&#x000a0;al. (2016), in which expression of MCT4 was suppressed genetically, encourages further preclinical and then potentially clinical evaluation, given that a number of MCT1 and MCT4 inhibitors are in pharmacological development.</p><p>An important further consideration is that tumors faced with vascular dropout and insufficiency evoked by potent AIs may activate multiple modes of adaptive/evasive resistance, in different regions of the tumor microenvironment. For example, in the RIP1Tag2 mouse model of PanNET, sunitinib is apparently inducing two distinctive modes of adaptive resistance, namely, symbiosis in hypoxic regions of regressing tumors, and, as reported previously, increased invasion and metastasis (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">P&#x000e0;ez-Ribes et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>), in part by upregulating cMET signaling (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Sennino et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). It is presently unclear whether these invading cancer cells also induce symbiosis upon reaching a size/location where diffusion of oxygen and glucose from co-opted normal vessels is insufficient, evoking hypoxia and, in turn, symbiosis. In fact, others have postulated that tumor acidity may promote local invasion (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gatenby and Gillies, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Estrella et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that co-inhibiting angiogenesis and mTOR reduces the incidence of metastasis, but it is unclear whether this effect relates to disruption of symbiosis or some other physiological parameter. Future studies in preclinical and clinical trials may shed light on the interplay between adaptive resistance mechanisms and means to concomitantly disrupt them.</p><p>An interesting question, not fully answered by the current studies, is how these metabolic clusters are induced to form, and in particular, why the peri-vascular normoxic cancer cells choose to take up and metabolize lactate and spare the limited glucose for their hypoxic brethren. A plausible explanation for the formation and disruption of metabolic symbiosis is illustrated schematically in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>, and might transpire as follows: extensive vascular collapse elicited by the AIs results in hypoxia to trigger the HIF1&#x003b1; transcription factor; HIF1&#x003b1; induces GLUT1 and MCT4 and activates glycolysis in the hypoxic cancer cells, leading to high levels of lactate secretion; accumulating extracellular lactate induces expression of the MCT1 lactate transporter and, consequently, import of lactate into the normoxic cancer cells; in concert with serum-derived glutamine, lactate is catabolized in the normoxic cancer cells with consequent induction of mTOR signaling to promote tumor metabolism.</p><p>Notably, mTOR expression must be both cause and consequence, since its pharmacological inhibition results in the normoxic cancer cells upregulating a glucose transporter (GLUT2), and apparently switching to secrete rather than import lactate, resulting both in insufficient glucose for the hypoxic cells and likely toxic acidosis in the extracellular microenvironment. In addition, mTOR has been shown by others to be upregulated by (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dur&#x000e1;n et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>) and also to control glutamine metabolism (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Csibi et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). We extend these results by showing that its inhibition blocks the conversion of lactate-derived pyruvate/glutamate to alanine/&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate in R+S-treated tumors, disrupting the production of TCA cycle intermediates, potentially&#x000a0;contributing to increased levels of (toxic and non-catabolized) lactate. While plausible, this rationale for the assembly and disruption of symbiosis will require future experimental validation.</p><p>In conclusion, the induction of metabolic symbiosis in response to vascular insufficiency elicited by potent AIs further illustrates the remarkable propensity of cancer cells to circumvent barriers that arise during tumorigenesis, tumor progression, and in response to treatment. This symbiotic adaptation evidently constitutes another mechanism that enables tumors to overcome the damaging effects of targeted therapies, by co-opting cellular processes intended for important homeostatic purposes that instead serve the evolving cancer.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Therapeutic Agents</title><p>Sunitinib and axitinib were purchased from LC laboratories.

All samples were first normalized using a Bradford assay and a WB for actin. The blots were probed with p-S6 antibodies, and the relative values of Mono-S- (n&#x000a0;= 8, red) treated tumors were compared to controls (blue, n&#x000a0;= 7) by quantitation using the Fusion FX7 imaging system (see <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Information</xref>). A similar trend was seen for tumors treated with axitinib (data not shown). The protein lysates were prepared from PanNET tumors collected from RIP1Tag2 mice, following a 1-week trial from 14&#x02013;15&#x000a0;weeks of age.

In the R+S-treated tumors (bottom), MCT4-expressing regions (green) are reduced versus MCT1-expressing regions, which have expanded (red), in contrast, note relatively more expanded MCT4-positive regions in Mono-S-treated tumors (top: center and right: green).

Potent AIs targeting the VEGFR and PDGFR pathways elicit regression of the tumor vasculature with consequent regional hypoxia and tumor compartmentalization, marked by upregulation of MCT4 and GLUT1 in a hypoxic compartment and elevated levels of MCT1 and pS6 along with reduced levels of GLUT2 in a normoxic compartment. Combined inhibition of VEGFR/PDGFR and mTOR produces necrotic cell death in the hypoxic compartment, associated with GLUT2 upregulation and altered lactate metabolism in the normoxic compartment, followed by eventual necrosis.</p><p>(B) Extensive vascular collapse resulting from AI treatment results in hypoxia that induces HIF1&#x003b1;, which in turn upregulates the glycolytic targets GLUT1 and MCT4 in the hypoxic cancer cells, leading to high levels of lactate secretion. Accumulating extracellular lactate induces expression of the MCT1 at the cell surface and lactate import into the normoxic compartment. In concert with serum-derived glutamine, lactate is catabolized in normoxic cancer cells with consequent induction of mTOR signaling to promote tumor metabolism. The data imply that normoxic cancer cells spare glucose for the hypoxic cells and fuel themselves by importing the lactate byproduct of glycolysis operative in the hypoxic cells in conjunction with glutamine. The bottom image suggests that metabolic symbiosis is disrupted by inhibition of mTOR through (indirect) upregulation of GLUT2 in the normoxic cells within the putative symbiotic clusters. Additionally, NMR studies indicate that mTOR inhibition disrupts the conversion of lactate-derived pyruvate/glutamate to alanine/&#x003b1;-ketoglutarate (anaplerosis) in dual-treated tumors, thereby disrupting the production of TCA cycle intermediates and potentially further enhancing toxic lactate accumulation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr7"/></fig></floats-group></article>
