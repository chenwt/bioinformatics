With the exponential increase in the number of sequenced prokaryotic genomes afforded by advances in genome sequencing technologies over the last decade, present day prokaryotic genome annotation is essentially an automated high-throughput process that relies heavily on <italic>de novo </italic>gene prediction programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>While <italic>de novo </italic>gene prediction programs have significantly improved for prokaryotic genomes considerable challenges remain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], such as determining the precise start and stop site of a gene, accurately predicting short genes, and determining a stop codon that represents an alternative amino acid rather than a true stop site. As efforts to sequence more branches of the tree of life expand, the level of accuracy for current gene prediction programs trained on proteobacteria datasets will markedly decrease, leading to an increase in incorrect predictions of protein-coding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Compounding the issue is the lack of experimental evidence in support of predicted protein-coding regions for the overwhelming majority of annotated genomes. Where available, experimental evidence is typically based on expressed RNA sequences, such as from microarray or RNA Seq experiments. However, these genome-centric analyses do not independently and unequivocally determine whether a predicted protein-coding gene is translated into a protein or importantly provide any reliable information on post-translational processing.</p><p>Bottom-up proteomics offers the ability to directly measure peptides arising from expressed proteins representing the current best option for independently and unambiguously identifying at least an important subset of the protein-coding genes in a genome and can be used to experimentally validate gene annotations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In a bottom up approach, proteins within a complex mixture are typically digested with a protease, after which the resulting peptides are separated by chromatographic methods and then analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Each MS/MS spectrum is a measure of fragment masses, ideally from a single peptide sequence of ~ 6-50 amino acids. This set of mass values is analogous to a 'fingerprint' that identifies the peptide. Interpretation of MS/MS peptide spectra is accomplished 1) by using algorithms such as X!Tandem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], SEQUEST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], or Mascot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] to compare measured masses against a set of theoretical masses of possible protein sequences or 2) less commonly, by <italic>de novo </italic>analysis, which does not depend on any prior knowledge of the possible sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Similar to searching MS/MS spectra against a set of predicted protein sequences, it is also possible (and feasible for simple genomes) to identify the protein-coding genes in a genome by searching MS/MS spectra against a six-frame translation of the genomic DNA sequence, thereby precluding the inherent biases derived from gene prediction methods. We note that scaling up to an exponentially larger database, as a result of six-frame translation of a genomic DNA sequence, makes searches slower by potentially orders of magnitude. Additionally, it also results in increased possibility for false-positive identifications as the false discovery rate scales with the increasing database size, greatly decreasing sensitivity; twin challenges that can only be feasibly met with dedicated/sophisticated computing resources precluding routine use at present.</p><p>Bottom-up proteomics also provides an avenue for obtaining biologically relevant information about post-translational modifications. Even for relatively simple biological systems such as prokaryotes, post-translational modification (PTM) events are increasingly being recognized as important, but are poorly characterized with regard to sites or function. While PTM information gained from genome-scale MS/MS datasets stands to benefit biological understanding of bacterial organisms, significant technological challenges hamper the routine inclusion of this valuable information in primary annotations. This situation is exemplified by only a single report of genome-scale MS/MS datasets being used to comprehensively annotate post-translational modifications events in a genome sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, the low resolution of the MS/MS datasets makes assignment of modifications, including crucially the site of modification, less confident and ill suited for routine use. For example, the 0.036 Dalton mass difference between Gln (Q) and Lys (K) cannot be resolved in low resolution MS/MS spectra, which increases the number of possible peptide candidates to be matched and reduces confidence in assignments. On the other hand, the sequencing precision afforded by high resolution MS/MS spectra can resolve residues with small mass differences like Gln and Lys, which reduces the search space and thus the computational burden, and increases confidence in assignments.</p><p>In this study, we employed a bottom-up proteomics approach supplemented with a recently described <italic>de novo </italic>sequencing methodology using high resolution and high mass measurement accuracy MS/MS data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] to accurately uncover the translational landscape and post-translational features of the bacterial pathogen <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>serovar Typhimurium (STM) 14028. <italic>Salmonella </italic>Typhimurium is a leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis and is widely used as a model to investigate basic genetic mechanisms as well as the interaction between bacterial pathogens and mammalian hosts. In spite of the clinical and basic science relevance of <italic>Salmonella </italic>Typhimurium there has been no comprehensive analysis undertaken to provide experimental support of its <italic>in silico</italic>-based genome annotation to facilitate systems-level analysis. Our data provides protein-level experimental validation for approximately half of the predicted protein-coding genes in STM 14028 and suggests revisions to 47 genes assigned incorrect translational start sites, including a potential novel alternate start codon. Additionally, we uncovered 12 non-annotated genes missed by gene prediction programs, as well as evidence suggesting a role for one of these novel ORFs in <italic>Salmonella </italic>pathogenesis.

These data comprise STM 14028 samples from different cell culture conditions designed to mimic various aspects of the non-infectious and infectious environments experienced by <italic>Salmonella </italic>Typhimurium. Briefly, these included Luria-Bertani (LB) logarithmic and LB stationary phases, and two acidic minimal medium (AMM) conditions, AMM1 and AMM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The mass spectrometry datasets employed in this proteogenomic annotation study have been previously described, detailing the annotated <italic>Salmonella </italic>Typhimurium proteome response to the above growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Peptides with either one or two tryptic ends were filtered according to the parameters described in the Methods section. As an additional confidence metric we only retained those filter-passing peptides that mapped to unique locations (i.e. a unique ORF) in the six-frame translation. Peptides mapping to multiple locations (i.e. different ORFs) in the six-frame translation introduce a potential source of ambiguity making it difficult to confidently validate individual ORFs or correct annotation errors. A total of 23889 unique peptides that passed the above criteria were identified with a false discovery rate of &#x0003c; 1%. Of these, 23097 peptides were assigned as being generated by two tryptic ends and 791, with one tryptic end.</p><sec><title>Experimental validation of predicted genes at the protein level</title><p>For the majority of genes annotated as part of sequencing efforts there is no direct experimental evidence that the gene is translated into a protein. In cases where experimental evidence is available it is typically based on expressed RNA sequences, such as from microarray or RNASeq experiments. It is clear however that expressed RNA sequences cannot independently and unequivocally determine whether a predicted protein-coding gene is translated into a protein. Thus knowing that a gene or part of it in the relevant frame is being made (i.e. translated into protein) is useful information.</p><p>Multiple unique peptides mapping to a single gene provide compelling evidence for the expression of the product(s) encoded by that particular gene. As such, we matched the 23,889 identified unique peptides to the 4817 predicted chromosomal genes in the STM 14028 genome sequence to validate automated gene predictions at the protein level. The predicted genes covered most of the observed peptides (23,759 of the 23,889). Conservatively, a gene product was confirmed expressed at the protein level only when a minimum of two unique peptides mapped to the particular gene. Using this criterion, our proteomics data validated 2118 of the 4817 annotated chromosomal ORFs in the STM14028 genome sequence at the protein level (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Table S2), providing experimental evidence for the products of these genes. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows an example of a predicted gene whose length is covered by multiple identified peptides providing experimental evidence for its expression at the protein level. Given the limited number of possible tryptic peptides available for protein identification in small ORFs, the above criteria would presumably preclude the confident identification of novel small ORFs.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Validation of computationally predicted genes</bold>.

Typical coverage is in the 30% range for the annotated ORFs. However, multiple factors potentially prevent 100% coverage, including extensive post-transcriptional regulation that makes transcripts rather poor guides for protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Here we have used four differing growth conditions including typical laboratory conditions and an infection-like environment. However, not all possible growth conditions for <italic>Salmonella </italic>Typhimurium can be efficiently sampled and it is likely that certain ORFs require specific conditions for expression, such as intracellular growth in host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In addition, various technical aspects associated with our experiments may have precluded detection, such as incompatibility with buffers for soluble protein extraction. The two peptide criterion may also negatively impact coverage of small proteins present in low concentrations. However it is possible that application of additional protein and peptide separation methods could enable improved coverage of low abundance proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Refinement of predicted gene structures: Start sites</title><p>Determining the correct start position of a gene remains a challenge for current gene prediction algorithms. In a recent re-analysis of 143 annotated prokaryotic genomes, Nielsen and Krogh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] observed that in some genomes up to 60% of the genes may have been annotated with a wrong start codon, especially in GC-rich genomes. Accurate start site predictions better define intergenic spaces that may encode promoters and regulatory binding sites, which are critical elements in studies of transcriptional regulation. Cellular localization signals also are contained in start sites, which makes accurate start site predictions important for accurately determining the localization of proteins within a cell.</p><p>Peptides that map to genomic regions within 200 bp upstream of previously annotated genes and in the same translational reading frame represent evidence supporting extensions of their predicted start sites. We note that this approach has been described in detail in a number of recent publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Additionally peptides that span (i.e., partially overlap) the start site of previously annotated genes also represent evidence supporting extensions of their predicted start sites. To this end, we examined the identified peptides for experimental evidence supporting extension of start sites in each of the predicted genes, and where possible proposed a new start codon. 51 peptides spanned the start site of previously annotated genes, and 36 peptides mapped to genomic regions within 200bp upstream of previously annotated genes. Overall, 87 of the 23,889 peptides mapped to genomic regions that served as experimental evidence supporting extension of start sites. We restricted our correction of start sites to predicted genes confirmed at the protein level (see preceding section), which yielded a final candidate list of 75 peptides that correspond to 47 genes requiring N-terminal extension/start site correction (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Table S3A). New start sites were largely defined by the first Methionine amino acid and/or start codon encountered upstream of peptides mapped to the genomic region within 200 bp upstream of their previously annotated start sites.</p><p>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> highlight examples depicting the utility of proteomics data for start site correction. ORF0641 is a member of the universal stress protein (Usp) family of proteins with biological roles in motility, adhesion and coping with stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In our proteomics data we observed several peptides upstream of ORF00641 in the same reading frame and within 200 bp of the predicted start site, i.e., evidence supporting extension of the predicted start site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Furthermore, three of these peptides span the previously predicted start site, providing additional evidence in support of refining the start site. ORF01800 is the NADH-dependent enoyl reductase from the type II bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (FAS-II), as inferred from the primary <italic>in silico </italic>genome annotation, a validated but currently underexploited target for drug discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Similarly, we observed several peptides that overlap this ORF including one peptide that spanned the currently predicted gene start (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The accurate experimental delineation of the structure of this clinically relevant gene represents an important step in facilitating ongoing drug development efforts. While beyond the scope of this study, we remark that protein expression and purification coupled with Edman degradation represents a useful orthogonal avenue to validate at the protein level the corrected assignments proposed.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Correcting start site assignment for ORF00641</bold>.

In addition GTG and TTG are also used as alternative start codon. Studies in <italic>E. coli </italic>have estimated the frequency of start codon usage as ATG 83%, GTG 14% and TTG 3%. However a very small number of studies have also reported CTG, ATT, ATA, and ATC codons to function as rare non-canonical translation initiators. Interestingly our proteomics data showed multiple peptides that overlap ORF01417 (integration host factor alpha) including one peptide that spanned the currently predicted gene start, providing evidence in support of extending the start site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The peptide, GIEPMALTKAEMSEYLFDKLGLSKR, is immediately adjacent to a stop codon (TGA) with another stop codon (TAA) a further seven amino acids upstream making the possibility that the peptide results from a stop codon read through unlikely. Considering this, the first amino acid in the peptide sequence Glycine (G) would presumably be the translation initiator. Glycine is coded for by the triplet codon GGG. However, it is well known that even if an alternative start codon is used as the translation initiator, it gets translated as methionine. Thus we examined the possibility of a frame-shift involving the preceding ORF pheT, coded in a different frame, as a potential mechanism to explain this observation. However, the ORF pheT terminates with the "...ASLRD-stop" amino acid sequence conserved across several related <italic>Salmonella </italic>and <italic>E. coli </italic>strains. It is clear that further studies beyond the scope of the present work will be required to resolve and or confirm this interesting observation. The peptide GIEPMALTKAEMSEYLFDKLGLSKR is defined as fully tryptic, having a native N-terminus and a C-terminal arginine, and was observed in three independent LC-MS/MS analyses with minimum SEQUEST<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>peptide identification scores across the three independent LC-MS/MS analyses of Xcorr &#x02265; 3.47, &#x00394;CN &#x02265; 0.23, and PeptideProphet&#x02122; probability &#x02265; 0.99. A representative MS/MS spectrum of the peptide GIEPMALTKAEMSEYLFDKLGLSKR is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>.

Additionally the small fraction of protein-coding genes that comprise eukaryotic genomes (&#x0003c; 25% in worms and &#x0003c; 5% in humans) make the identification of coding sequences against the ubiquitous background of non-coding sequences difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In contrast, the usual absence of introns and the compact nature of prokaryotic genomes make the identification of all possible ORFs longer than a chosen threshold in a DNA sequence a relatively straightforward computational exercise. This view, in particular of bacterial genomes, has lead to the assumption that computationally derived coding sequences completely describe the entire coding capacity of a bacterial genome. However, structural annotation of prokaryotic genome sequences by predicting coding sequences is far from being a trivial matter. A number of recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] used proteomics data to identify novel protein-coding genes in prokaryotic genomes that had been missed by <italic>de-novo </italic>gene finding programs.</p><p>Peptides that map to genomic regions outside the boundaries of predicted genes are evidence suggestive of the presence of novel genes missed by gene finding programs. By matching the 23,889 identified peptides to the 4817 predicted chromosomal genes in the STM 14028 genome sequence, we detected 130 peptides mapped to regions falling outside the boundaries of known protein coding genes. We further refined the list of peptides by excluding the 36 peptides that mapped to genomic regions within 200 bp upstream of predicted genes, i.e., peptides that are indicative of N-terminal extensions (see previous section), which yielded a final candidate list of 92 peptides (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Table S4A). These peptides represent experimental evidence for the presence of novel genes missed by gene finding programs. Using the set of 92 intergenic peptides, we defined 12 novel genes that had been missed by gene prediction methods. Note that novel genes were confirmed as detected and expressed at the protein level only when a minimum of two peptides mapped to that particular novel gene.</p><p>Of particular interest was the novel ORF C1368_1:795109-795576 defined by five peptides that map to the genomic region 795142 to 795556 where no gene had been predicted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Protein BLAST analysis (BLASTP) of the genomic region where the five peptides mapped to against the non-redundant protein sequences database revealed a single significant hit to a phage protein in <italic>Salmonella </italic>Typhimurium strain D23580 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Interestingly, examination of our experimental MS/MS data showed that this novel ORF C1368_1:795109-795576 was highly expressed under growth in acidic minimal media (AMM) relative to growth under standard laboratory conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Growth in AMM has been shown to approximate the environment found within the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuoles (SCV) observed in infected host macrophages, and we among others have shown that this media induces the expression of the <italic>Salmonella </italic>pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2)-encoded type-III secretion system (TTSS), a system critical for virulence and intramacrophage survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

A version of the STM14028 genome annotated using a combination of computational methods and human annotators, i.e. refined annotation, released while this manuscript was in preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] allowed us to assess the performance of proteogenomic annotation.</p><p>A comparison of the new start sites for the 47 genes proposed by the proteomics data to the start sites for the same 47 genes in the refined STM14028 genome annotation revealed an overlap of 34 genes where start sites matched exactly (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> Table S3B). Of the remaining 13 genes, 10 had proteomics-suggested start sites that were downstream of those determined by refined annotation. While the proteomics data suggest a shorter ORF than indicated in the refined annotation, homology analysis (BLASTP) supports the refined annotation. Note that deeper proteome coverage may improve matches to the refined annotation. The remaining three genes had proteomics-suggested start sites that were upstream of start sites in the refined annotation, which is tangible experimental evidence that suggests a longer ORF than indicated in the refined annotation, i.e., correcting the refined annotation. In summary 44 of 47 start site corrections proposed by our proteogenomic analysis in the primary annotation reported in this study were in line with the refined annotation. The remaining three start site corrections suggested represent corrections to both the automated (this study) and refined annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Our proteogenomic analysis also identified 12 novel genes missed by gene prediction methods.

The measured mass of the UStag suffix sequence and the predicted mass have an apparent mass difference (dm) of -0.002 atomic mass units (u), revealing no modification on the suffix. The prefix had an apparent dm of 12.992 u from the database predicted sequence, a discrepancy that suggests a peptide modification. The mass shift of 12.992 u can be explained by several combinations of 2 modifications in various arrangements on the prefix sequence QKWR within a 10 parts per million (ppm) mass tolerance according to UNIMOD database as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>. Using an in-house scoring function (described in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) that takes into account sequencing precision and count of isotopically resolved b and y fragments among other parameters, the 12.992 u mass shift is best explained by a C-terminus amidation combined with tryptophan oxidation to oxolactone.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Post-translational chemical medication (PTCM) analysis using <italic>de novo</italic>-Ustag approach</bold>.

We estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) of PTCM analysis to be &#x0003c; 1% (see Methods). Utilizing in-house developed software and a list of 450 UNIMOD modifications, including SNP substitutions, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unimod.org">http://www.unimod.org</ext-link> (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> Table S5F) we inferred hypothetical explanations for observed mass shifts in ~92% of the spectra in which modifications were detected (i.e. 3826 MS/MS spectra), several of which had multiple potential chemical explanations (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> Table S5D). Where applicable observation of "differential" fragments were used to resolve ambiguity of assignments between SNPs and other modifications of similar mass defect as described below and in the Methods and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>. The remaining spectra (~8%, i.e. 318 MS/MS spectra) in which modifications were detected but where no plausible modification combination of up to two of the selected 450 UNIMOD modifications could explain observed mass shift for prefix or suffix sequence represent novel previously un-described PTCMs and are listed in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> Table S5E. To obtain lower limit estimates on the number of distinct PTCMs, we binned different mass shifts and inferred a total of 70 distinct modifications mass-shifts, each with multiple potential chemical explanations according to UNIMOD (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> Table S5A). This represents a much larger and complex repertoire of chemical modifications than previously thought existed in bacteria. Note that this only considered mass-shifts for which a potential chemical explanation was found in UNIMOD, thus most likely an underestimate. Nevertheless this estimate represents a much larger number of modification types than can be considered by commonly used, but often restrictive PTCM search algorithms such as Sequest, X!Tandem, and Mascot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The 3826 modification containing MS/MS spectra with hypothetical explanations for the observed mass shifts were ranked using a peptide identification scoring function (see Methods and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) and based on the identification scores we obtained unambiguous explanations, with regards to type, number and site of modification, for observed mass shifts in 1273 MS/MS spectra (i.e., ~31% of modification containing spectra, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> Table S5B). We also established confident assignment of number and type(s) of modification to explain observed mass shifts in an additional 239 MS/MS spectra (i.e., ~6% of modification-containing spectra); however site(s) of modification could not be unambiguously derived from spectral evidence (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> Table S5C).</p><p>Among the modification types observed were those known to result from sample preparation, including carbamylation and carbamidomethyl, as well as those that can occur both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>, such as methionine oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and asparagine deamidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. As no methods are currently available for distinguishing between <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>modifications, to identify PTCMs in STM that are biologically relevant we assumed such modifications would be conserved across closely related organisms. Using this approach we report a number of PTCMs of biological significance previously unappreciated in STM. Methylation of ribosomal proteins has been suggested to modulate the intra- or intermolecular interactions of the methylated ribosomal proteins or affects their affinity for RNA, and, thus, influences various cell processes, including ribosome assembly and translation accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Single methylation of the <italic>E. coli </italic>ribosomal protein L7/12 has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] and localized to K82 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], while the ribosomal protein L3 has been reported as being methylated at Q150 in <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. In the present study we observe methylation of the <italic>E. coli </italic>ribosomal protein L7/12 homolog in STM14028 ORF04348 at the same location, K82, and methylation of the ribosomal protein L3 ortholog in STM14028 ORF03631 at the exact same position, Q150, suggesting a similar regulatory and/or structural role in STM14028 as in <italic>E. coli </italic>(Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> Figure S1; 3 methylated residues shown in red). Methylation of the translation elongation factor Tu (tufB) at position K56 has been reported, and suggested as a mechanism for 'fine tuning' of tufB-tRNA inter-molecular interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].

However current high throughput genome annotation pipelines are blind to this information, any amount of which would clearly improve the quality of the genome annotation. The low throughput and labor-intensive nature of Edman degradation and two dimensional gel electrophoresis approaches make them incompatible with state of the art high throughput annotation pipelines. Using the high precision MS/MS data generated above, we highlight the use of proteomics data to identify a subset of post-translational proteolytic events in a high throughput label-free manner and include this additional layer of information to improve the quality of the genome annotation.</p><p>Data were searched against the predicted genes in the STM 14028 genome sequence using X!Tandem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and included 10336 unique fully tryptic peptides (i.e., two inferred tryptic ends), 1756 with one tryptic end (partially-tryptic), and 20 with no tryptic ends (non-tryptic), identified at &#x0003c; 1% FDR. In light of the high specificity of trypsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], it is likely that peptides with either one or no tryptic termini are representative of proteolytic events. We note that these peptides may also be generated by degradation of fully tryptic peptides due to hydrolysis during sample processing or to in-source decay during instrumental analysis, both of which introduce a potential source of ambiguity. To address this concern, we employed a two step filtering procedure. First, we only considered non- or partially-tryptic peptides that were not contained within a longer <italic>observed </italic>tryptic peptide, which reduced the non- or partially-tryptic peptide candidate list to 1656 peptides. Second, we removed non- or partially-tryptic peptides contained within any other peptide, which further reduced the candidate peptide list for examining proteolytic events to 754 peptides (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref> Table S6). While conservative, this two step filtering approach ensured we considered biologically generated non- and partially-tryptic peptides rather than experimental or analytical artifacts.</p><p>A potential drawback of this two-step approach is that identification of proteolytically processed proteins are typically made on the basis of single peptide identifications. However this concern was mitigated by using high resolution and high mass measurement accuracy LC-MS/MS data. If our hypothesis that non- or partially-tryptic peptides likely represent the results of possible proteolytic events were false, we would expect to see a relatively uniform distribution of non- or partially-tryptic peptides across the protein sequence. To the contrary, when the frequency of the occurrence of peptides and the residue start positions between 2 and 60 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) are plotted, two pronounced peaks are apparent, one representing residue start positions 1-5 and the other, representing residue start positions 21-25.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold><italic>In vivo </italic>proteolytic cleavage analysis</bold>.

This provides additional support for using this characteristic set of peptides for identifying signal peptide cleavages. Signal peptides are essential for proper cellular function in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, targeting proteins for secretion or for transportation to appropriate cellular locations. For example in pathogenic bacteria, secretion of effector molecules is a central hallmark of the host-pathogen interaction in establishing a successful infection. Although algorithms such as SignalP enable genome-based predictions of signal peptides, they almost always lack experimental verification.

Given its high osmolarity and nutrient-rich condition, LB broth partially reproduces the small intestine lumen environment, while AMM, providing a low pH, low magnesium, and nutrient-deficient condition, partially mimics the intracellular milieu within the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole (SCV).</p><p>The materials and methods used to prepare the protein samples for LC-MS/MS have already been described in full for similar samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Briefly, each sample was lysed, extracted into global, soluble, and insoluble fractions then trypsinized; and further fractionated by ion exchange chromatography.

Partially tryptic peptides were additionally filtered by charge state-dependent cross correlation cut-off (Xcorr) scores as follows: a minimum cross-correlation cut-off (<italic>Xcorr</italic>) of either 3.1, 3.8, or 4.5 for 1+, 2+, or 3+ charge states, respectively.

All identified peptides greater than six amino acids in length, were required to have a Log10 E-value &#x0003c; = -1.3, which corresponds to a 5% probability that the peptide sequence identified as the best hit from the X!Tandem process arose from a random match to a sequence.

Data were deisotoped using Decon2LS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>], which implements the THRASH algorithm to determine neutral monoisotopic masses of observed molecular species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>]. Note, Decon2LS is publically available at omics.pnl.gov [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>]. The UStags process used for inferring peptide sequences and its PTM mass shifts was described and discussed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Briefly, de-novo sequences were generated utilizing in-house developed recursive function using neutral monoisotopic fragment masses and sequencing precision of 0.005 a.m.u. and allowing no gaps in sequence tag. Sequence tags are matched in forward and reverse direction against computationally predicted proteins in the STM 14028 genome sequence. If sequence was found to be unique in predicted proteome it was declared a UStag and selected for more precise description from the precursor -fragment spectra pair. A UStag was first aligned within the protein sequence using observed precursor and first fragment mass, preferring tryptic cleavages where possible. If predicted theoretical masses matched observed masses within tolerance of 10 ppm peptide was considered to be non-modified and corresponding spectra explained. The cases where potentially more than one peptide was fragmented were not considered. The remaining spectra containing UStags were subjected for further processing to explain mass shifts with known PTMs. PTM searches are based on the USTag method which provides "near zero" FDR for the tryptic peptide identifications based on decoy database searches. We cannot claim zero FDR since palindromic sequences and sequencing gaps (like Gly-Gly-&#x0003e; Asn or Gly-Ala-&#x0003e; Gln) could occasionally produce false positive hits which are detectable from database inspection. Thus, using the decoy search method of determining FDR this "near zero" FDR would be propagated to modified peptides since the reverse sequence would not produce USTags except in rare cases described above. Thus the FDR of PTM analysis was estimated to be &#x0003c; 1%.</p><p>A list of 450 possible PTMs including SNP substitutions as used in this study was obtained from UNIMOD <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unimod.org">http://www.unimod.org</ext-link> with differential labels and unlikely chemical artifacts manually filtered out. All single and combinations of any two modifications from the list were explored together with the reported residual and terminus specificity of each PTM to produce all plausible explanations of mass shift from non-aligned prefix and suffix sequences with the mass tolerance of 10 ppm. It is important to emphasize that explanation for prefix and suffix mass shifts are completely independent from each other; therefore some modifications could be sufficiently explained even if the whole peptide is not assigned. Expected peptide monoisotopic mass was matched with observed precursor mass from the parent spectra within the 10 ppm. Making the clear numeric cut between two different modification options in an automated fashion is challenging by itself and a decision tree was implemented. Various heuristics and parsimony rules have been historically used to reduce mass ambiguities in order to characterize and estimate counts of modification sites. We argue that in the realm of high resolution mass spectrometry no plausible hypothesis should be rejected except by the strength of experimental evidence. Therefore we developed robust peptide identification scoring function in attempt to extract identification hypotheses which explain UStag containing spectra using the most evidence from observed fragments.
