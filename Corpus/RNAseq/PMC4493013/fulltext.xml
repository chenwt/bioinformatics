To investigate the transcriptomic basis of this ability, we used RNA-seq to quantify mRNA expression in the painted turtle ventricle and telencephalon after 24 hours of anoxia at 19&#x000b0;C. Reads were obtained from 22,174 different genes, 13,236 of which were compared statistically between treatments for each tissue. Total tissue RNA contents decreased by 16% in telencephalon and 53% in ventricle. The telencephalon and ventricle showed &#x02265; 2x expression (increased expression) in 19 and 23 genes, respectively, while only four genes in ventricle showed &#x02264; 0.5x changes (decreased expression). When treatment effects were compared between anoxic and normoxic conditions in the two tissue types, 31 genes were increased (&#x02265; 2x change) and 2 were decreased (&#x02264; 0.5x change). Most of the effected genes were immediate early genes and transcription factors that regulate cellular growth and development; changes that would seem to promote transcriptional, translational, and metabolic arrest. No genes related to ion channels, synaptic transmission, cardiac contractility or excitation-contraction coupling changed. The generalized expression pattern in telencephalon and across tissues, but not in ventricle, correlated with the predicted metabolic cost of transcription, with the shortest genes and those with the fewest exons showing the largest increases in expression.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by National Science Foundation (IOS 1253939) to DEW, and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to LTB.

Pond turtles, however, especially those in the family Emydidae, can survive for at least a day of anoxia at 20&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and one species, the western painted turtle, <italic>Chrysemys picta bellii</italic>, can survive for more than 30 hours at 22&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and for 177 days at 3&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], making this species the most anoxia-tolerant tetrapod known. The physiological adaptations that account for this ability include: 1) profound metabolic depression, 2) large tissue glycogen stores, and 3) large extracellular buffering capacity afforded by the shell and skeleton, the latter of which prevents lethal decreases in body fluid pH that occur with extreme lactic acidosis [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In most vertebrates, the most anoxia-sensitive organs are the brain and heart, principally because of their high metabolic rates [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In anoxic turtles, both organs show changes in physiological function that result in energy savings. In the cerebrocortex, anoxia leads to suppression of spontaneous electrical activity (i.e., spike arrest) [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131669.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], silencing of AMPA and NMDA receptors [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and large GABA releases during anoxia that activate an inhibitory postsynaptic shunt and prevent presynaptic glutamate release [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131669.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the heart, a reduction in energy consumption is achieved mainly by depressed heart rate and contractility [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Despite our knowledge of the metabolic and physiological response of these organs to anoxic or hypoxic conditions, little is known about their transcription-level responses in these organs, especially the heart [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. With the recent sequencing of the western painted turtle genome [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], an unprecedented degree of insight can now be gained into the transcriptomic response of turtle organs to anoxia. In the present study, we utilize this genomic data for three purposes: (1) to determine if there are any transcriptomic correlates with known physiological function during anoxia in the two best-functionally characterized organs in anoxic turtles, the brain and heart, (2) to identify new targets for future functional studies of cellular and organ function during anoxia, and (3) to test the hypothesis that the cost of transcription correlates with the pattern of gene expression observed during anoxia, when cells are energetically-starved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals</title><p>Ten western painted turtle adults (N = 10; mean 238 g, range 198&#x02013;274 g) of both sexes were purchased from a commercial vendor (Niles Biological Inc., Sacramento, CA), but were originally from Minnesota. Animals were held at 15&#x02013;20&#x000b0;C on a 12:12 photoperiod for at least two weeks prior to the experiments. Animal health was monitored daily through visual inspection of swimming, basking, and feeding behavior. Individuals were fed at least three times a week with commercially-available turtle feed (Tetra ReptoMin) and were held in large, flow-through tanks (183 cm x 91 cm x 61 cm) with 45 cm of water containing St. Louis, MO municipal tap water. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory animals of the National Institutes of Health. All animal husbandry and experimental protocols were approved by the Saint Louis University Institutional Care and Use of Animals Committee (IACUC, protocol number 2198).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Anoxia Experiments</title><p>Turtles were maintained at 19&#x000b0;C for 48 hours prior to experimentation. Five turtles were submerged in a 19&#x000b0;C aquarium (65 cm x 35 cm x 35 cm) filled with water that was previously bubbled with nitrogen to displace oxygen to undetectable levels when measured with a dissolved oxygen meter (YSI DO200). A plastic grate was placed at the surface of the tank to ensure continued submergence and to prevent access to the headspace above the aquarium. After 24 hours, their necks were quickly clamped underwater followed by rapid decapitation. The clamping was required to insure there was no change in the oxygenation state of the blood prior to tissue sampling. The plastron was immediately removed with a bone saw and blood samples were quickly obtained by cardiac puncture of the exposed ventricle and analyzed for blood gases, pH, and plasma lactate. The ventricle was removed from the turtle, blotted on sterile gauze to remove any blood, and freeze clamped with tongs precooled in liquid nitrogen. The brain case was opened with Rongeurs, and each half of the telencephalon removed, dissected of any visible white matter and meninges, and freeze-clamped. All tissues were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until used in RNA extractions. All dissections were carried out using aseptic technique.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Blood-gas and Lactate Analyses</title><p>Blood gases tensions (partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub> [Po<sub>2</sub>] and CO<sub>2</sub> [Pco<sub>2</sub>], as mmHg) were measured using a Radiometer blood-gas analysis system (BMS MKII, PHM73 meter) and a modified pH measurement system as used previously [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. All electrodes were thermostatted to 19&#x000b0;C. Blood was centrifuged at 9600 x g for 3 minutes and the plasma lactate analyzed using a commercially available kit (Trinity Biotech, Ireland). Blood parameters were statistically compared between tissues and treatments using unpaired t-tests or Mann-Whitney U-tests when data were non-parametric. Differences were significant when P &#x0003c; 0.05. All statistical computations were carried out using SigmaPlot 12.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Tissue Analysis</title><p>Samples (50&#x02013;100 mg) of frozen telencephalon and ventricle were ground to a fine powder in an autoclaved ceramic mortar and pestle that had been precooled with liquid nitrogen. The powder was transferred to dry-ice cooled, RNase-free, and sterile Eppendorf tubes. One milliliter of room-temperature TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) per 50&#x02013;100 mg of tissue powder was added, and the tubes were immediately vortexed. The remaining RNA isolation steps were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions and RNA concentration was measured with a spectrophotometer (Eppendorf BioPhotometer, Hamburg, Germany). The effects of anoxia on RNA contents within each tissue type were analyzed using Two-Way ANOVA and Student-Newman Keuls post-hoc tests. Statistical computations were carried out using SigmaPlot 12.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>mRNA Sequencing (mRNA-Seq)</title><p>The RNA pellets were resuspended in DEPC-treated water, treated with DNase I (Life Technologies) and RNA quality measured with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100). The four samples with the highest RIN (RNA integrity number) values for each tissue and treatment (16 total samples) were used for RNA-seq. All RIN values for these samples were greater than 7.4 [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. cDNA library construction and sequencing were carried out by the Washington University Genome Institute (St. Louis, MO), using previously described methods [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131669.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform with v3 chemistry. mRNA-Seq was carried out as described in Shaffer et al. [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In brief, paired-end 2x100 bp reads were generated from poly-A selected RNA-Seq libraries from 16 individually barcoded samples (8 telencephalon and 8 ventricle, 4 of each from anoxic and 4 from normoxic conditions). The sixteen samples were randomly distributed between two lanes in the flow cell. There was no significant difference between the number of paired-end reads between treatment groups or between tissue types (median total 2 x 100 bp reads per cDNA library = 50.4 million; Two Way ANOVA, F = 0.0818, P-value = 0.780, total df = 15). The painted turtle genome has a total of 241,320 exons averaging 298 bp in length (NCBI), resulting in an estimated exome size of 72 million base pairs (number of exons multiplied by their average length). Given a sampling depth of 50.4 million total reads (100 base pairs each), the dataset represents 70x coverage of the exome. Adapter sequences were screened with FLEXBAR v. 2.17.</p><p>To identify and quantify differentially expressed genes in response to anoxia in heart and brain, screened sequences were aligned to the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>p</italic>. <italic>bellii</italic> assembled reference sequence (version 3.0.1) using TopHat (version 1.4.0) [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. TopHat splits reads to align them across known and novel splice junctions. To estimate transcript and gene abundances, Cufflinks 1.3.0 [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] was used, generating normalized FPKMs (Fragments Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped fragments) for each annotated gene and which was guided by a GTF (Gene Transfer Format) file of OPTIC annotations for known splice junction locations provided by the Ponting Laboratory (Oxford University, UK). The Cufflinks parameter-G was used to exclude novel isoforms, in order to exclude large outliers (regions with extraordinarily high read-depth) that introduce a loss of sensitivity to the Cufflinks normalization method. In rare case where the OPTIC gene model did not identify a human ortholog (just N = 8 transcripts), discontiguous megablast was used to query the model gene sequence in question against the human genomic plus transcript database (BLAST, NCBI) and identify the most likely human ortholog. The per-gene FPKMs were log<sub>2</sub> transformed and compared across treatments and tissues using general linear model assuming a normal/Gaussian distribution [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] with FPR multiple testing correction using JMP Genomics 5.1 (ANOVA function within the software). Genes were excluded from the statistical analysis if the median FPKM equaled zero for three out of the four samples in each group under either treatment.</p><p>Mean FPKM and standard error of the mean (SEM) values were calculated for the four replicates from each tissue and treatment using FPKM values generated for each sample in Cufflinks. Sequence lengths and the number of exons for each differentially expressed gene were determined from the OPTIC-based annotation. Figures were generated using SigmaPlot 12. Change in FPKM reflects the difference between mean FPKM values under anoxic and normoxic conditions.

Using tissues from adult painted turtles, the most anoxia-tolerant tetrapod known, our goals were to evaluate transcriptomic changes in response to anoxia to identify transcriptomic correlates of known physiological function, and to test the hypothesis that the costs of transcription might influence gene expression. Previous work has demonstrated significant physiological changes during anoxia, including spike arrest, silencing of AMPA and NMDA receptors, and large GABA releases in the brain [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and reduced energy consumption in the heart. Based on the significant and diverse physiological responses to anoxia, genes directly correlating with known physiological traits were expected to be differentially expressed. However, the majority of the genes that changed were immediate early genes and related transcription factors, which are related genes known to upregulated in response to various forms of cellular stress, including hypoxia [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131669.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>While many of the changes in gene expression were observed in both the brain and heart, some were found exclusively in one tissue or the other.

Previous work has highlighted the connection between gene expression and intron length, with the most highly expressed genes tending to have the shortest introns [<xref rid="pone.0131669.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The costs of transcription are directly dependent on the number of nucleotides within the genes, as well as the number of splice events to produce the final translatable mRNA. Under anoxic conditions, where energy is limited, it would be expected that: 1) any genes that are upregulated are likely to be inexpensive to produce (i.e. short sequences with few exons), and 2) any upregulated genes that are either long or have many exons must have an importance directly related to some product of their expression cost and their copy number. In the present study, it was found that in telencephalon, specifically, and across tissues, generally, that the shortest genes show the largest increase in expression level during anoxia (<xref rid="pone.0131669.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A, 5C</xref>), with the exception of a single outlier, a gene coding for the overexpressed GLUT isoform. It is tempting to infer that the relative importance of the expression of the GLUT isoform for turtle survival during anoxia is high because of the metabolic cost of transcribing such a long gene. At this time, however, we cannot rule out the possibility that this is a simple outlier or the product of the new annotation. When the analysis is extended to the number of exons in the genes, the number of exons in downregulated genes is significantly higher than the number in upregulated genes (<xref rid="pone.0131669.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>; t-test, P-value = 0.007, t = 2.848, df = 46). In this analysis, all genes found to be significantly different were included, regardless of fold-change. Genes whose expression decreased had more exons than those that were increased. Based on these analyses, it may be that, in some tissues, genomic architecture (i.e. sequence length and intron/exon density) within a set of highly conserved &#x0201c;adaptive&#x0201d; genes could determine their own expression level due to the energetic cost of their transcription.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study demonstrates that adult painted turtles show loss of tissue RNA during anoxia, which points to ribosomal degradation as the most likely mechanism of translational arrest in telencephalon and, especially, ventricle. Despite a decrease in tissue RNA, there were large increases in gene expression levels in both tissues. However, none of these genes were involved in excitatory aspects of neuronal or muscle function. Instead, many have been previously implicated as immediate early genes and transcriptional, translational, or metabolic repressors. The upregulation of some genes associated with enhanced vascularization in epithelial tissue (e.g., <italic>Cyr61</italic>, <italic>Apold1</italic>) observed in both telencephalon and ventricle suggests that increasing gene transcripts directly related to vascular endothelial function may also be an adaptive feature for surviving anoxia. However, the similarity in overall transcriptomic landscape of samples derived from the same tissue, regardless of treatment conditions (<xref rid="pone.0131669.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) suggests that the response of the painted turtle that affords anoxia tolerance affects a narrow and adaptive set of genes. The function of these genes in painted turtles and the timing of transcript abundance changes during anoxia remain largely unknown.</p><p>Our finding that relatively few genes were decreased in the present study warrants further examination and might have resulted either from low sample size (N = 4 per group) or, more likely inadequate sequencing depth. Our conservative approach of excluding genes in which three of four samples had zero FPKM might have resulted in an underestimation of decreased gene expression. Large reductions in gene expression to undetectable levels would have yielded many genes with zero counts and, therefore, increase the likelihood they were excluded from the analysis. This reflects an inherent bias in RNAseq studies, which is to count only the most highly expressed transcripts.</p><p>Future RNA-seq studies of anoxia in turtles should be strand-specific to reveal non-coding RNAs from the anti-sense strand, and should sequence to a higher coverage depth to obtain a larger sampling of down-regulated genes. Additionally, as the organs examined in this study are composed of multiple cell types, the observed changes in transcript abundance are likely to provide an average organ-scale response. However, the changes in transcript abundance at the cellular level require further investigation, including whether expression changes are uniform between cells and within a single organ, because the potential for heterogeneous organ-scale response is high. This is supported by our observation that many of the upregulated genes in both organs are known to change in vascular endothelium, rather than the functional cell type normally associated with the function of that organ (eg, neuron or myocyte). To establish functional relevance, gene expression validation at the protein level is needed, along with ChIP-seq studies of the overexpressed transcription factors. Finally, additional analyses of the energetic costs of gene expression should be taken into consideration, as they may inform us of whether a change in gene expression is important in an energy-starved state.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0131669.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>(A) Functional and (B) process-based gene ontology network analyses of genes with increased expression under anoxic conditions from telencephalon.</title><p>Smaller, darker nodes correlate to the lowest P-values measured for the set of GO terms.
