Here we reveal that HCC progression via induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is closely associated with the expression of CD36/fatty acid translocase and elevated free fatty acid (FFA) levels. Although obesity is manifested as elevated FFA levels, the degree of EMT was not associated with the body mass index of the patients, highlighting the specific roles of CD36 and FFA uptake. Treatment of human liver cancer cell lines with FFAs exacerbated the EMT phenotype, whereas chemical inhibition of CD36 mitigated these effects. Furthermore, the Wnt and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathways were activated upon FFA treatment, potentially acting as upstream activators of the EMT program. These results provide the first direct evidence associating CD36 and elevated FFAs with HCC progression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Primary liver cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer related deaths worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The incidence rates of HCC have more than tripled in the United States over the past four decades with a steadily increasing mortality rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Surgical resection and liver transplantation are potentially curative treatment modalities available for HCC detected at early stages, however, most cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage at which radiotherapy and chemotherapy are either not feasible or are ineffective<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Advanced HCC tumors demonstrate high proclivity towards vascular invasion resulting in intrahepatic metastases, which are strongly associated with high post-resection recurrence rates and overall poor prognosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of HCC progression is important for developing new therapeutic approaches. Evidence from epidemiological studies suggested a link between obesity, manifested in the form of elevated fatty acids, and HCC tumorigenesis and increased mortality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Surprisingly, the influences of obesity and elevated fatty acid levels have not been evaluated with respect to the molecular pathogenesis of invasive HCC.</p><p>Cancer cells frequently exhibit alterations in fatty acid metabolism to sustain growth and proliferation, fulfill energy requirements and provide metabolites for anabolic processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Evidence shows that fatty acids are actively transported across cell membrane by specialized proteins instead of by passive diffusion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. In the liver, the major proteins involved in fatty acid transport and trafficking included the fatty acid transport proteins, FATP2 (SLC27A2) and FATP5 (SLC27A5) and the fatty acid binding proteins (FABP1, FABP4, and FABP5). The CD36 or fatty acid translocase protein mediates the uptake of fatty acids in a variety of cell types but is expressed at very low levels in normal liver cells, however, its expression is increased in hepatocytes from rodent models of diet-induced obesity, which also correlated with elevated fatty acid uptake<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Thus, alterations in CD36 expression could be involved in enhancing the uptake of FFA into the livers of obese HCC patients.</p><p>In a previous study exploring the lipotoxic pathways activated by saturated FFAs, we reported a synergistic association between abrogation of insulin signaling and loss of desmoplakin protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, an obligate component of the desmosomal cell adhesion complex. As desmosomes are lost during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, our study suggested a possible role of FFAs in this phenomenon. EMT can be described as a set of well-orchestrated changes, driven by the expression of key transcription factors including <italic>SNAIL</italic>, <italic>ZEB</italic> and <italic>TWIST</italic>, which allow epithelial cells to acquire a mesenchymal phenotype, resulting in enhanced migration, invasiveness, and resistance to apoptosis, thus facilitating progression to a metastatic phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Several clinical reports described enhanced expression of EMT-genes in advanced stage HCC, correlating with poor prognosis, increased rates of metastases and elevated mortality rates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Based on our findings, combined with the epidemiological observations, we hypothesized that elevated FFAs may play a role beyond lipotoxicity or activation of pro-inflammatory pathways, and promote the induction of EMT in HCC.</p><p>Here we investigated the association between obesity and elevated uptake of FFAs with the induction of EMT program in human HCC. We first probed the association using mRNA expression data derived from the TCGA liver cancer dataset and then confirmed the observations in human HCC tumor samples. Our data suggests that elevated expression of fatty acid uptake proteins including CD36, and not BMI, was associated with EMT progression. We further established that the saturated FFA palmitate induced EMT in HCC cells by activating the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathways. Additionally, inhibition of CD36 resulted in reduced migration in liver cancer cells, confirming a critical role of the fatty acid uptake protein in the progression of the EMT program.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>CD36 expression, and not BMI, is associated with degree of EMT</title><p>We investigated the association between patient BMI, expression levels of hepatic fatty acid uptake proteins and EMT progression in the TCGA liver cancer dataset. The TCGA samples were grouped according to the patient&#x02019;s BMI and an EMT score was assigned to each sample to assess the degree of EMT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Based on stratification of patients on BMI (low BMI&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;25, high BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;30), we observed that neither the EMT scores nor the expression levels of FA uptake genes were significantly different between the two BMI groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Similarly, the pair-wise correlations between BMI and EMT score and FA uptake genes were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). We further performed a multivariate regression analysis to verify the association between BMI, EMT score and FA uptake genes controlling for age at initial diagnosis, sex and pathological staging of the patients, and confirmed that the associations with BMI were not significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Next, we clustered the genes involved in FA uptake, epithelial and mesenchymal genes in the TCGA dataset with samples ordered according to EMT score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). As expected, the epithelial and mesenchymal genes clustered with other members of their respective groups. Intriguingly, the FA uptake genes clustered closer to the mesenchymal genes than the epithelial genes. Therefore, we next investigated the association between EMT score and the expression levels of the FA uptake genes. We found that the pair-wise correlations between EMT scores with <italic>CD36</italic> (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) and <italic>FABP4</italic> (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) were statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Further, multivariate regression analysis controlling for age, sex and staging confirmed the significance of association between EMT score with <italic>CD36</italic> (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002)<italic>, FABP1</italic> (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005) and <italic>FABP4</italic> (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.8&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that while BMI itself did not have an influence, the expression of FA uptake genes was strongly associated with the degree of EMT in HCC patients. Amongst the significant FA uptake genes, <italic>FABP</italic>s are constitutively expressed in liver cells and are involved in intracellular trafficking of FFAs, whereas <italic>CD36</italic> is not expressed in normal hepatocytes and is specifically involved in transporting exogenous FFAs across the cell membrane. Given its lack of expression in normal hepatocytes and significant association with EMT scores, <italic>CD36</italic> emerged as an ideal candidate for subsequent studies.</p><p>To verify the association between FA uptake gene expression and EMT observed in TCGA data, we further investigated the protein expression of CD36 and EMT genes in the human HCC tumor samples. The clinical samples were divided into two groups according to the patient&#x02019;s BMI information. Total cellular proteins were resolved and immunoblotted to detect the expression levels of various EMT markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Vimentin (VIM), a mesenchymal intermediate filament network protein, was measured along with E-cadherin (CDH) and desmoplakin (DSP), cell-adhesion molecules that served as indicators of epithelial characteristics. Expression levels of the mesenchymal marker VIM (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02) were significantly higher in high BMI tumor samples, but levels of epithelial markers CDH (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.32) or DSP (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.13) were not significantly altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). Next, we measured the expression levels of ZEB1, ZEB2 and SNAIL1 as transcriptional activation markers of EMT. While the expression levels of SNAIL1 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) were significantly higher in high BMI tumor samples, ZEB1 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.23) and ZEB2 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.43) did not differ significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). In addition to the EMT markers, we further measured expression levels of TGFB and PORCN as respective indicators of the activation of TGF-&#x003b2; and Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathways. In the high BMI patient group, the expression levels of TGFB (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) were significantly higher, but PORCN (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.27) levels did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). We next used a multivariate linear regression model to test the association between BMI and the expression levels of the protein markers controlling for sex and tumor grade. Interestingly, this analysis revealed that except TGFB (p=0.004), none of the EMT markers tested in this study were significantly associated with BMI in the human protein samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Next, we compared expression levels of the EMT markers with CD36 expression across all the samples, irrespective of BMI. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>, the expression of VIM (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01), SNAIL1 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.22), ZEB1 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>) and ZEB2 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) were positively correlated with CD36 expression. Additionally, the expression levels of TGFB (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.17) and PORCN (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04) also showed positive correlation with CD36 expression. We next performed the multivariate regression analysis controlling for sex and tumor grade and found that both ZEB1 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>) and ZEB2 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006) were significantly associated with the expression levels of CD36 in the human protein samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). While BMI of the patients did not influence the expression of EMT markers, the significant association of CD36 with ZEB1 and ZEB2 expression corroborates the observations made in the TCGA analysis - that elevated CD36 expression may be indicative of the activation of EMT program. Additionally, the expression levels of TGFB and PORCN also showed positive correlation with CD36 expression, suggesting that the TGF-&#x003b2; and Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathways may be the drivers of EMT program activation in the tumor samples with elevated CD36 levels. These results indicate that the elevated levels of CD36 and the consequently elevated uptake of FFAs may be involved in HCC progression via EMT.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>FFA treatment enhances migration and invasion</title><p>Having found an association between the fatty acid uptake protein CD36 and EMT regulators, we sought to study the effects of fatty acids themselves on the metastatic behavior of liver cancer cells. We hypothesized that elevated FFAs enhance EMT rates in liver cancer cells. To test this, we first evaluated the rates of migration in human liver cancer cell lines treated with various FFAs. Human HepG2 cells were cultured in media containing carrier control (BSA), the saturated FFA palmitate (PA), monounsaturated FFA oleate (OL), n-6 polyunsaturated FFA linoleic acid (LA), the combinations of PA&#x02009;+&#x02009;LA, or the combination of OL&#x02009;+&#x02009;LA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1A,B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1A,C</xref>, the percentage wound closure in BSA was not significant (Day 7 p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.39, Day 10 p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.16). In comparison, cells treated with PA and OL exhibited significant wound closure by day 7 (Day7, Day10 p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). However, the cells maintained in polyunsaturated LA also did not show a significant reduction in open-wound area (Day 7 p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.63) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1B,D</xref>). We further evaluated the behavior of cells maintained in media containing a combination of different FFAs observing that cells co-treated with PA and LA still showed significant migration (Day 7 p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02) but this effect was not seen in cells co-treated with OL and LA (Day 7 p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.16) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1B,D</xref>), suggesting that while saturated FFAs significantly enhanced migration rates, polyunsaturated FFAs did not enhance migration in liver cancer cells.</p><p>Given the strongest effect of PA amongst the different FFAs on cell migration, we further determined the minimum effective dose of PA required to induce migration of liver cancer cells. The subsequent experiments were performed over a shorter time frame (24&#x02013;48&#x02009;hours) after pre-treating the cells for 5 days. We evaluated the effects of varying PA concentrations on HepG2 and Hep3B cell migration and observed significantly higher migration with 0.3mM or 0.4mM PA treatment (24/48&#x02009;hours p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). Thus, the minimum effective dose of PA (0.3&#x02009;mM) capable of inducing migration was similar to the PA levels found in HCC patients and therefore was used for all subsequent experiments.</p><p>As expected in cells undergoing EMT, we noticed a distinct change in the morphology of PA treated HepG2 cells. The cells were immunostained for the cytoskeletal protein keratin 18 following 5 days of treatment with BSA or PA. Interestingly, while all BSA treated HepG2 cells appeared as round or polygonal shaped, some colonies within PA treated cells exhibited an elongated, spindle-shape, characteristic of mesenchymal cells, along with reduced keratin 18 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). This observation further provided evidence that PA treatment may be inducing EMT in the liver cancer cells.</p><p>The effects of palmitate on the migration and invasiveness of HepG2 and Hep3B cells were confirmed using the modified Boyden&#x02019;s chamber assay. These experiments were performed by seeding 5-day treated PA or BSA cells in cell culture inserts in the absence of serum. After 24&#x02009;hours, both HepG2 and Hep3B cells treated with PA exhibited enhanced migration and invasion compared to BSA treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p><p>EMT induction also decreases cell adhesion. To test if PA treatment resulted in loss of liver cancer cell adhesion, we performed a dispase-based cell dissociation assay. After the 5-day treatment with PA or BSA, cultured monolayers were released using the dispase enzyme and subjected to mechanical stress. We found that applying mechanical stress on PA treated HepG2 and Hep3B cells resulted in fragmentation of the monolayer into a large number of smaller-sized particles. In comparison, control cells resulted in fewer, larger-sized particles or sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E,F</xref>). Thus, we inferred that PA treatment promoted loss of cell adhesion in both HepG2 and Hep3B cells, thereby destabilizing the monolayer.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cytotoxicity vs. EMT in FFA treated cells</title><p>A number of previous studies have established that PA is in fact cytotoxic to liver cancer cells, and elevated levels may cause lipotoxicity. Indeed, when HepG2 and Hep3B cells were treated with PA at different concentrations, we noticed significant cytotoxicity at the concentrations corresponding to enhanced migration in cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Note this experiment was performed after the 48-hour serum-free treatment with PA or BSA and serum-starvation can also contribute to cytotoxicity. Next, we assessed the metabolic rates in the PA and BSA treated cells before and after serum starvation. While the metabolic activity rates were reduced in both serum-starved PA (HepG2 66%, Hep3B 71%) and BSA (HepG2 47%, Hep3B 80%) treated cells after 48&#x02009;hours, the basal metabolic rates were significantly higher in PA treated cells when compared to BSA at both 0 (HepG2 2.2 fold, Hep3B 2.7 fold) and 48&#x02009;hours (HepG2 3.1 fold, Hep3B 2.4 fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Thus, despite lipotoxicity, the PA treated cells were overall more metabolically active than the BSA treated cells. We further measured metabolic activity by staining for neutral lipids and fatty acids using Oil Red O dye. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>, both PA-treated HepG2 and Hep3B cells show enhanced staining with Oil Red O after 48&#x02009;hours of serum-starvation compared to BSA treated cells. Additionally, we quantified the relative levels of the dye eluted from stained cells and found significantly higher levels in PA treated cells (Hep3B p&#x0003c;0.05, HepG2 p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p><p>From these experiments, we hypothesized that while PA induced cell death in a proportion of the liver cancer cells, a distinct surviving population of cells remained metabolically active and acquired the ability to undergo EMT. To further confirm this point, we measured the changes in expression levels of various EMT markers in the PA treated liver cancer cells. We used flow cytometry to analyze the population distribution of cytotoxicity and EMT markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). We stained PA or BSA treated HepG2 cells with a cell death indicator dye (Zombie Violet) followed by formaldehyde fixation. The fixed cells were then permeabilized and immunophenotyped for CDH1, DSP (epithelial markers), and VIM (mesenchymal marker). After background subtraction from unstained cell populations, we analyzed the percentage of cells that were positively stained for each marker. As expected, we found that upon PA treatment, a larger percentage of cells stained positive for Zombie Violet as compared to BSA treatment (upper left quadrant, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Moreover, another separate population of cells stained positive for the epithelial and mesenchymal markers (lower right quadrant <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The percentage of cells that stained positive for CDH in BSA (45.42%) was significantly higher than PA (15.63%) (&#x003c7;<sup>2&#x02009;</sup>=&#x02009;21.43, df&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Similarly, a higher percentage of DSP staining was observed in BSA (75.67%) compared to PA (33.13%) (&#x003c7;<sup>2&#x02009;</sup>=&#x02009;26.7, df&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). In contrast, a larger number of PA cells (63.57%) showed positive staining for VIM, compared to BSA cells (50.6%) (&#x003c7;<sup>2&#x02009;</sup>=&#x02009;3.5, df&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03).</p><p>The expression of the EMT markers was further confirmed by observing the immunostaining using confocal fluorescence microscopy. HepG2 and Hep3B cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained to detect CDH and VIM expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). A distinct population of PA treated cells showed reduced CDH expression and increased VIM expression in both HepG2 and Hep3B cells. Within the population of PA treated Hep3B cells, a few cells show very high expression levels of VIM, further corroborating presence of distinct cell populations.</p><p>The mRNA expression levels of the EMT transcription factors <italic>SNAIL1</italic> (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), <italic>ZEB2</italic> (p&#x0003c;0.01) and <italic>TWIST1</italic> (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) were significantly higher in PA treated HepG2 cells and similarly <italic>ZEB1</italic> and <italic>FOXC2</italic> were expressed at higher levels in the PA treated cells (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.06) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). The lower fold-change observed in the qRT-PCR experiment reflects population average across all cells, including cytotoxic and EMT cells, within a treatment condition.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>FFA treatment activates Wnt and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling</title><p>With evidence to support that PA treatment activated the EMT program, we next sought to understand the driving mechanism behind EMT activation in the PA treated cells. We used the mRNA samples from BSA and PA treated HepG2 and Hep3B cells and profiled the expression levels of genes that were representative of known EMT-inducing signaling pathways using a PCR-based array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>). In this study, we ranked the genes obtained from the array according to the PA vs. BSA fold-change and analyzed the enrichment of KEGG-pathways in the top 20 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). While the hedgehog signaling pathway was enriched in the HepG2 cells, we did not find a significant increase in the sonic hedgehog ligand (<italic>SHH)</italic> and its downstream transcriptional activator <italic>GLI1</italic> mRNA levels in PA treated HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). We found that the TGF-beta and Wnt signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the set of top 20 genes from both HepG2 and Hep3B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Interestingly, a distinct set of genes within these pathways were upregulated in the two cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Recall that in the human HCC tumor samples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>, we found a positive correlation between CD36 with TGFB (TGF-beta signaling ligand) and PORCN (Wnt signaling mediator). Furthermore, known transcriptional targets of Wnt and TGF signaling pathways including <italic>CALD1, CDH1, CDH2, COL3A1, COL5A2, ESR1, FOXC2, GSK3B, TCF4, TGFB2, WNT5A, and WNT5B</italic> were among the top 20 genes upregulated in PA treated HepG2 or Hep3B cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). These results provide a point of convergence between the correlations observed in the human HCC studies and the experiments with PA treated liver cancer cells &#x02013; that TGF-beta and Wnt signaling pathways are activated in both cases and may be the drivers behind activation of EMT program.</p><p>The activation of TGF-beta and Wnt signaling pathways promote the subsequent activation of EMT transcription factors, driving the expression of several other anti-apoptotic and proliferative oncogenes. This requires the activation and nuclear translocation of downstream transcriptional effectors of TGF-beta and Wnt signaling pathways. Thus, to assess the activation of the two pathways, we investigated the intracellular localization of SMAD2/3 and &#x003b2;-catenin in BSA and PA treated cells. The overall expression levels of &#x003b2;-catenin were higher in both HepG2 and Hep3B cells after PA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C,D</xref>). Moreover, the expression of &#x003b2;-catenin was restricted to the cell membrane and cytoplasm in BSA treated cells, while in PA treated cells we clearly observed its increased localization to the nucleus, suggesting that the Wnt signaling pathway was activated upon PA treatment of both HepG2 and Hep3B cells. The expression levels of SMAD2/3 were higher in PA treated Hep3B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6E</xref>) but did not seem to change in PA treated HepG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6F</xref>) cells, corroborating the data from the array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Additionally, SMAD2/3 staining showed considerably higher nuclear localization in PA treated Hep3B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6E</xref>), but this change was not distinct in the PA treated HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6F</xref>). This indicated differing mechanisms of EMT induction in the two cell lines and a proclivity of the hepatoblastoma-derived HepG2 cells towards activation of the Wnt-signaling pathway.</p><p>We further investigated the mRNA expression profiles of the Wnt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref>) and TGF-beta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>) signaling genes in the TCGA dataset in context of <italic>CD36</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). The components of these two signaling pathways that share a similar expression pattern as <italic>CD36</italic> (marked clusters in dashed box) reveal possible mechanism by which these pathways may be associated with elevated FFA uptake. The BMP family ligands (<italic>GDF5</italic>, <italic>BMP4</italic>), <italic>NODAL</italic>, and the transcriptional effector (<italic>SMAD3</italic>) of TGF-beta signaling pathway show similar expression pattern as <italic>CD36</italic>. Similarly, the Wnt ligand (<italic>WNT7A)</italic> and the canonical Wnt signaling transcription factors <italic>CTNNB1</italic>, <italic>LEF1</italic> and <italic>TCF7</italic> clustered with <italic>CD36.</italic> Additionally, genes involved in non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways including planar polarity pathway (<italic>DAAM1, ROCK2)</italic> that regulates cytoskeletal rearrangement, and the Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway (<italic>PPP3R1, NFATC3</italic>) that regulates cell adhesion and migration, also exhibit similar expression patterns as <italic>CD36</italic>. Furthermore, we found that transcriptional targets of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling: <italic>COMP, ROCK2, THBS2, AXIN2, BTRC, CCND2, CSNK1A1, CTBP2, FRAT1, FZD4, NFAT5, NFATC3, NKD2, PPP2R5C, PRKACB, and PRKX,</italic> as well as, targets of WNT/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling: <italic>BMP4, ID2, AXIN2, LEF1, and MMP7</italic>, were significantly associated with <italic>CD36</italic> expression in TCGA HCC dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p><p>Next, we analyzed the expression patterns of transcription factors that are known to be activated by elevated free fatty acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7C</xref>). We found that the fatty-acid responsive transcription factors, <italic>PPARA</italic> and <italic>PPARD,</italic> that can transcriptionally upregulate <italic>CD36</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, show strong positive correlation with <italic>CD36</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Furthermore, a number of downstream transcriptional effectors of inflammatory pathways (TNF-&#x003b1;, Jak/Stat, IL1-signaling) activated by free fatty acids, including <italic>NFKB1</italic>, <italic>FOS</italic> and <italic>HIF1A</italic> show similar expression pattern as <italic>CD36</italic>. These transcription factors can upregulate the expression of Wnt and TGF-beta signaling pathway components, and also upregulate expression of EMT transcription factors. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7D</xref> provides an outline of the influence of elevated uptake of FFA on the various signaling pathways constructed using the results from our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with PA treated HCC cells, and the evidence from TCGA analysis. As shown in the schematic, the uptake of FFA via CD36 is a key event in the induction of EMT program in HCC cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of CD36 would result in abrogation of the EMT phenotype.</p><p>To verify the critical role of CD36 in mediating the effects of PA on the liver cancer cells, HepG2 cells were cultured in BSA or PA along with Sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO) &#x02013; a chemical that binds irreversibly to the CD36 receptor and inhibits fatty acid uptake<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. After the 5-day treatment period, we measured the protein expression levels of CDH and VIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8A</xref>). Note that the PA treatment expression levels reflect the population average across both cytotoxic and EMT cells. We found that inhibiting CD36 activity with SSO resulted in significant upregulation of CDH in not only PA treated cells, but also in BSA treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8B</xref>). In other words, the inhibition of CD36 was sufficient to recover the mild-EMT phenotype that was observed in BSA treated cells as well. Additionally, the expression levels of VIM were significantly reduced in PA treated cells when CD36 was chemically inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8C</xref>).</p><p>To assess the role of TGF-beta and Wnt signaling pathways in mediating the activation of EMT program, we measured the effect of inhibiting these pathways in PA treated HepG2 cells. We found that migration rates were significantly reduced in PA treated cells when they were co-treated with a &#x003b2;-catenin/Tcf inhibitor III inhibitor against the Wnt signaling pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> or TGF-&#x003b2;1 RI kinase inhibitor against the TGF-beta signaling pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8D</xref>). Additionally, the inhibition of the PORCN enzyme activity with LGK974<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> also resulted in significant reduction of migration rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8E</xref>). Finally, the inhibition of CD36 with SSO reduced migration rates in PA treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8E</xref>), confirming the importance of CD36 in mediating PA induced EMT in the liver cancer cells. These experiments confirm that the induction of EMT by PA is mediated by CD36 and requires activation of TGF-beta and Wnt signaling pathways.</p><p>Finally, we used the TCGA HCC dataset to assess the influence of stratification of tumor samples based on low or high CD36 expression clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>) and low (&#x0003c;25) or high BMI (&#x02265;30) groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). The analysis revealed that none of the 3395 chemical and genetic perturbation gene sets were enriched in either of low and high BMI groups (p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;25%). Additionally, no gene sets were enriched in low CD36 group; however 27 gene sets were enriched in the high CD36 group and 10 out of the 27 significant gene sets are liver cancer signatures, lending further support to the specific role of CD36 in liver cancer independent of BMI.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cancer cells frequently exhibit alterations in fatty acid metabolism to sustain growth and proliferation, fulfill energy requirements and provide metabolites for anabolic processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. It has been observed that FFA levels are significantly elevated in the plasma of HCC patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. However, the precise role of elevated FFA levels in tumorigenesis and cancer progression remains controversial. While a number of studies have shown that accumulation of FFAs, especially saturated FFA palmitate, leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and generation of reactive oxidative species (ROS) that contributes to loss of cellular homeostasis and cell death, a phenomenon termed as lipotoxicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> other studies have shown TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 cytokine-induced inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, aggravated insulin resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> and enhance endoplasmic reticulum stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> in hepatocytes. Although obesity has been strongly associated with progression and high mortality rates in HCC patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, the role of FFAs in HCC progression has remained undefined. Our results provide the first direct evidence that elevated FFA uptake via CD36 is associated with EMT induction in HCC. However, we also observed that BMI was not associated with the degree of EMT, highlighting the specific role of FFAs and their cellular uptake in this process. Note that BMI itself may not be an accurate indicator of the level of fatty acids in an individual, as athletic and fit individuals with higher bone density or muscle mass could have high BMI despite low fat levels. Further, BMI at the time of HCC diagnosis may not be fully reflective of the patients BMI during carcinogenesis due to the frequent occurrence of paraneoplastic weight loss once the cancer is established.</p><p>While the fundamental role of hepatic FFA pool is to provide energy and metabolites for other anabolic pathways, our results suggest a role of FFAs beyond cellular sustenance. We observed that Wnt and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathways were activated by palmitate and there could be several mechanisms involved. Oncogenic transcription factors, including NF-&#x003ba;B, AP-1 and STAT3, activated by inflammatory cytokines like TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 could connect the activation of Wnt and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathways with elevated FFA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. The activation of NF-&#x003ba;B in response to elevated FA levels was shown previously by our laboratory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, and may drive EMT via activation of WNT and TGF signaling. For instance, NF-&#x003ba;B was shown to upregulate Wnt signaling transcription factor <italic>LEF1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, and along with AP-1 co-regulated the expression of <italic>WNT10B</italic> ligand<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Moreover, previous studies have shown that the influence of unsaturated FFAs on the EMT phenotype in hepatocytes and other cell types was dependent on the mTOR/NF-&#x003ba;B pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> or PI3K/Akt- NF-&#x003ba;B pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. In addition, <italic>TGF&#x003b2;</italic>, <italic>ZEB1</italic> and <italic>ZEB2</italic> expression were shown to be regulated by AP-1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The STAT3 transcription factor was shown to mediate the induction of EMT by regulating <italic>SNAIL</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, <italic>ZEB1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, <italic>TWIST</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and the mesenchymal markers <italic>VIM</italic> and <italic>CDH12</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. A different mechanism of EMT induction could be the activation of the unfolded protein response or ER-stress pathway by FFA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. The involvement of downstream transcription factor of ER-stress, HIF1&#x003b1;, in promoting EMT is well documented in multiple cancers via the activation of Wnt signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> and the direct regulation of <italic>TWIST</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, <italic>TCF3</italic> and <italic>ZEB</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. In addition to fatty acid uptake, CD36 also mediates uptake of HDL (high density lipoproteins)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> and oxidized LDL (low density lipoproteins)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> in hepatocytes. A recent study suggests the uptake of oxidized LDL requires binding of fatty acids to CD36<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Elevated oxidized LDL accumulation has been associated with increased ROS accumulation, induction of ER-stress and activation inflammatory pathways in the liver<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, thereby potentially activating the pro-EMT signaling pathways. Thus, the CD36-mediated increase in hepatic FFA accumulation could facilitate the production of EMT-inducing factors.</p><p>The phenotypic effects that we observed in our studies may also be explained on the basis of the scavenger-receptor signaling pathway associated with FA binding with CD36. Previously it was shown that inhibition of CD36 activity by SSO inhibited FA uptake<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>, but could also inhibit CD36-dependent FA signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. CD36 is a multi-functional protein and exhibits a variety of different signaling functions upon binding with different ligands. CD36 crosstalk with TLR2/6 heterodimer results in activation of TLR-dependent cytokine production (NF-&#x003ba;B)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Its interaction with thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) also directly activates an apoptotic response via the kinases p38 and JNK<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. The complex of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and CD36 leads to increased activation of focal adhesion kinase 1 (FAK1) and RAC (via VAV1) which ultimately results in changes in cell morphology, such as loss of polarity and actin polymerization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. In addition, knockout experiments have identified that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and caspase-3 can be activated downstream of CD36 signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. In the context of EMT, the relationships of these pro-inflammatory pathways with CD36 point to a possibility that FFA may activate EMT via CD36 signaling, thereby explaining in part the strong influence of SSO treatment on the expression of EMT markers and migration rates. The creation of an environment promoting EMT would not only play a role in progression of HCC, but may also provide a conducive environment for liver metastases arising from other organs, such as colorectal cancers. The majority of colorectal cancer patients (&#x0003e;50%) develop liver metastases, and while surgical resection of the liver metastases facilitates long-term survival, only a small fraction of the patients are candidates for resection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. Given the need for new targets for both advanced colorectal cancers and HCC, future studies investigating the mechanism of EMT induction, and the role of elevated FFAs and FA uptake proteins are warranted.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Human HCC tumor samples, TCGA data and EMT score calculation</title><p>De-identified, IRB-approved frozen samples were obtained from the &#x0201c;International Registry of Patients with or at Risk for Hepatobiliary Cancers, Including Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Cholangiocarcinoma, and Gallbladder Adenocarcinoma, and those Patients with Normal Risk Factors&#x0201d;.
