We have characterized the role of the shorter isoform (REIIBP) in myeloma cells and identified a clear and novel interaction of REIIBP with members of the SMN (survival of motor neuron) complex that directly affects the assembly of the spliceosomal ribonucleic particles. Using RNA-seq we show that REIIBP influences the RNA splicing pattern of the cell.

Analysis of transcripts derived from these different breakpoints is consistent with the expression of different truncated protein variants depending upon the site of the break. However, the only consistently expressed variant across all samples is REIIBP, suggesting it may be of particular importance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099493-g001">Figure 1 A</xref>). In contrast to MMSET II, which is confined only to the nucleus, REIIBP is located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus <xref rid="pone.0099493-Brito1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099493-Keats2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, suggesting <italic>MMSET</italic> has additional functional roles, which have yet to be described.</p><p>The SMN complex is a multi-subunit protein complex, which catalyses the assembly of snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleic particles) that generate the RNA splicing machinery <xref rid="pone.0099493-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0099493-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

A point mutation (5% of cases) or a deletion (95%) of the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene, which encodes the SMN protein, results in the inherited neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy. The cytoplasmic SMN complex catalyses the binding of a hetero-heptameric ring of proteins, termed the Sm proteins, to the U-rich site in the splicing snRNAs (small nuclear RNA) <xref rid="pone.0099493-Pellizzoni1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0099493-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. After coupling to Sm proteins, the snRNA is hypermethylated at the 5&#x02032; end and then, while still attached to the SMN complex, is transported to the nucleus. In the nucleus these proteins localize to Cajal bodies where the snRNPs undergo maturation before being released from the SMN complex and exert their functional role as components of the spliceosome machinery.</p><p>Attempts to understand the functional role of REIIBP have been hindered by the lack of antibodies able to distinguish different <italic>MMSET</italic> isoforms together with the difficulty of knocking down REIIBP alone. In this work we have evaluated the role of REIIBP using a multi-tagged REIIBP construct artificially transduced into a MM cell line background. This work demonstrates that REIIBP binds to the SMN complex and that REIIBP methyl transferase activity alters snRNPs cellular abundance, affecting RNA splicing.

Similarly to these reports, we found that our system did not produce any change in the global histone methylation levels of H3K36me2 or H3K27me3 as would have been expected if MMSET II had been used in such an experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099493-g001">Figure 1 C</xref>). This lack of an effect on the methylation of nuclear histones possibly reflects the fact that REIIBP and MMSET II have different localization within the nucleus, with REIIBP being found only in the nucleolus consistent with having a distinct role from MMSET II.</p><p>In order to characterize the role of REIIBP, we carried out a series of biological assays on transduced cells. We could not detect any difference in the number of cells in apoptosis or proliferation rate as determined by a WST-1 assay in the transduced cells.

Co-IP of the SMN protein showed a similar result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099493-g002">Figure 2 D</xref>), confirming that endogenous REIIBP is bound to the whole SMN complex, and not only to certain members.</p><p>To support the Co-IP data we used confocal microscopy to analyse H929 cells immuno-stained with SMN and REIIBP antibodies.

Consistent with the data above we show that the SMN signal is present only in the cytoplasm and in the nuclear Cajal bodies, while the FLAG signal, derived from REIIBP, is detected in the nucleolus and cytoplasm. GEMIN5, as previously reported <xref rid="pone.0099493-Haole1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, was not only localized in the Cajal bodies, but was present also as a dispersed signal throughout the nucleoplasm. However, both SMN and GEMIN5 showed a signal consistent with extensive cytoplasmic co-localisation with REIIBP. Analyzing the pattern of the co-localization signals for GEMIN5 and REIIBP (bottom <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0099493.s003">Figure S3 B</xref>) we found a high degree of co-linearity in the cytoplasm, which was lower in the nucleus. We also looked specifically for the presence of REIIBP with the SMN complex in the nuclear Cajal body but could find no evidence for co-localization at this site. Furthermore, we did not observe differences in either the number or distribution of the Cajal bodies within the cell between the native HeLa and the transduced cells (Data not shown).</p><p>IF and confocal analysis of HeLa::&#x00394;SET also showed co-localization with GEMIN5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0099493.s004">Figure S4</xref>) suggesting that the methyltransferase activity of the SET domain is not responsible for mediating binding to the SMN complex.</p><p>We hypothesised that the REIIBP/SMN interaction could influence the formation of new splicing snRNPs. In order to address this question we immunoprecipitated cellular splicing snRNPs in HeLa::REIIBP, HeLa::&#x00394;SET and HeLa lines, using an antibody against the Sm protein SmB/B&#x02032;, we extracted total RNA from the immunoprecipitates and compared the level of snRNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U12) by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099493-g003">Figure 3 A</xref>). Results demonstrate that REIIBP overexpression causes a major reduction in the abundance of snRNPs in the cell, in both the major (U4) and minor (U12) splicing components. This observation is in contrast to what is seen in SMN protein knockdown <xref rid="pone.0099493-Lotti1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> where it is the U12 minor splicing components that are predominantly affected. This decrease was not observed in HeLa::&#x00394;SET, consistent with the methyltransferase activity of REIIBP being responsible for this effect. In order to exclude the possibility that snRNPs variation is not due to the loss of the SMN complex or to a decrease in the level of SmB/B&#x02032; proteins, immunoblot analysis of SmB/B&#x02032; and SMN complex components were carried out, showing no difference in the three lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099493-g003">Figure 3 B</xref>).

We focused on changes in splicing patterns looking for gene specific alternative isoforms as well as for the presence of new transcripts generated by exon skipping or intron retention. We found a wider variety of transfrags showing intron retention in HeLa::REIIBP, with a statistically significant difference between the proportion of unique transfrags corresponding to annotated exons and at least 10 bp of intron identified between the HeLa samples and HeLa::REIIBP samples (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.027, 2 tailed unpaired t-test).

The technical difficulty of knocking down REIIBP alone in myeloma cells, without affecting MMSET II expression, prevented us from analysing the effect of the interaction between REIIBP and the SMN complex in t(4;14) MM cells. We, therefore, addressed this issue using a dominant negative approach. We overexpressed a mutant SET domain REIIBP construct in H929 cells (H929::&#x00394;SET), this out competed endogenous REIIBP for gaining access to its natural methylation targets and therefore counteracting its function. Analysis of splicing snRNPs levels in H929::&#x00394;SET showed a significant increase compared to H929 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099493-g005">Figure 5 A</xref>). This observation confirms REIIBP's role as a regulator of the spliceosome machinery in MM cells. Moreover, the steric competition of the mutant versus the endogenous REIIBP slowed the proliferation of MM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099493-g005">Figure 5 B</xref>), suggesting that REIIBP increases t(4;14) MM cell proliferation by altering the level of splicing snRNPs.</p><fig id="pone-0099493-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0099493.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>REIIBP controls snRNPs assembly and proliferation in myeloma cells.</title><p>A) Cellular snRNPs abundance. snRNPs were immunoprecipitated and analysed as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099493-g003">Figure 3 A</xref>.

It has previously been shown that MMSET II enhances t(4;14) cell proliferation <xref rid="pone.0099493-Brito1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099493-Marango1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099493-Kuo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and we have now demonstrated that REIIBP has a similar function but acting via an independent biochemical pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099493-g005">Figure 5 B&#x02013;C</xref>). In this new role, the nucleo-cytoplasmic REIIBP protein mediates RNA splicing patterns via its methyltransferase activity. This is a novel mechanism in myeloma, but it is consistent with pathogenic events affecting gene splicing in other cancers <xref rid="pone.0099493-Puente1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0099493-Imielinski1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. It is known in other systems that mutations in genes such as <italic>U2AF1, SF3B1, U2AF2</italic> cause miss-annealing of snRNP at the correct 3&#x02032; splice site, leading to intron retention or exon skipping. Interestingly, in the context of the current report, knockdown of these factors leads to specific alterations in splicing patterns for only a subset of genes rather than causing global effects <xref rid="pone.0099493-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0099493-Pacheco1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In contrast to the mutational events affecting splicing in other cancers, we find that RNA splicing machinery defects in t(4;14) MM are caused by REIIBP overexpression which results in impairment of SMN complex activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099493-g005">Figure 5 A&#x02013;C</xref>).</p><p>Regulation of SMN complex activity has already been shown to be relevant during development and cellular differentiation <xref rid="pone.0099493-Gabanella1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Moreover, the maturation and abundance of specific snRNPs, especially U1 and U2 snRNPs, are thought to be fine-tune controllers of alternative splicing, premature mRNA termination, alternative isoform expression and intron retention <xref rid="pone.0099493-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099493-Berg1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0099493-Padgett1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. It is clear, therefore, that deregulation of such processes provide a credible pathogenic mechanism in carcinogenesis.</p><p>In this report focusing on the role of REIIBP, we show that as a result of its overexpression, there are significant changes in the pattern of RNA splice variants at a limited number of genes, mostly affected by intron retention rather than occurring as a result of alternative splicing. This is in agreement with observations in other systems where a reduction in the level of snRNPs does not necessarily correlate with shifts in the patterns of alternative splicing but rather can lead to an increase in aberrant splicing products. These changes are seen in a limited subset of genes <xref rid="pone.0099493-Lotti1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, and are often associated with tissue specific variation <xref rid="pone.0099493-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099493-Gabanella2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. It is therefore possible that the REIIBP induced defects in RNA splicing we demonstrate in HeLa cells would be different in a plasma cell background. In this regard we found that whilst REIIBP can influence snRNPs formation in different cellular contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099493-g003">Figure 3 A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099493-g005">Figure 5 A</xref>), it specifically deregulates proliferation in MM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099493-g005">Figure 5 B</xref>).</p><p>Intron retention is an important mechanism both in normal tissue regulation and in disease states. It is associated with granulocyte differentiation <xref rid="pone.0099493-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, spinal muscular atrophy onset <xref rid="pone.0099493-Lotti1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, and developmentally regulated intron retention can act as switch for gene expression <xref rid="pone.0099493-Yap1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. We suggest that analogous to these processes, intron retention plays a role in myeloma pathogenesis. We postulate that intron retention could produce mRNAs with frame shift-induced stop codons, which would then be degraded by cytoplasmic nonsense mediated decay or by the nuclear exosome. This would explain why intron retention is seen in only a limited set of genes. This hypothesis is supported by the large number of genes we found downregulated by REIIBP in our RNAseq data.</p><p>In terms of the sub-cellular location, we show that REIIBP co-localizes with the SMN complex in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0099493.s002">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0099493.s003">Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099493-g005">Figure 5 C</xref>). Within the nucleus REIIBP is found in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099493-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0099493.s001">Figure S1C&#x02013;D</xref>). In contrast, the SMN complex is predominantly located in the cytoplasm and in the Cajal bodies where it exerts its role on snRNPs. As a consequence of REIIBP overexpression we saw no change in the structure or number of the Cajal bodies, ruling those out as being involved in the potential mechanism. There are therefore two possible mechanisms: either REIIBP modifies the SMN complex and once modified, the continued interaction is no longer necessary or alternatively the binding of REIIBP to the SMN complex in the cytoplasm is important not only to modify the SMN complex but also in mediating the nuclear transport of the two entities, which then dissociate. Experimental insights into these potential mechanisms come from the mass spectrometry and confocal data which show that REIIBP has a higher affinity for GEMIN3, 4 and 5 compared to other components of the SMN complex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0099493-t001">Table 1</xref>). This trio of proteins interact strongly <xref rid="pone.0099493-Battle1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>: GEMIN5 is essential for binding and loading the snRNA <xref rid="pone.0099493-Battle2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, GEMIN3 acts as an RNA helicase giving access to the RNA, while the function of GEMIN4 is unknown. It is thus plausible that REIIBP catalytic activity could control the loading of snRNAs onto the complex, or alternatively it could diminish the number of functional SMN complex molecules. A different plausible mechanism is that REIIBP instead targets Sm proteins. Sm proteins, before being assembled into snRNP particles, are normally Arginine dimethylated. However, it has also been shown that Sm protein can be Lysine methylated <xref rid="pone.0099493-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. It is therefore possible that Lysine methylation by REIIBP could compete with canonical Arginine dimethylation, causing a reduction in the availability of functional Sm proteins. In order to prove this theory, further studies must be carried out to determine the precise REIIBP methylation target sites.</p><p>Further insight into the potential pathologic relevance of REIIBP overexpression comes from its localization within the nucleolus. <italic>ACA11</italic>, encoded within intron 18&#x02013;19 of the <italic>MMSET</italic> gene, has been suggested to modulate the control of oxidative stress and to downregulate ribosomal protein genes and is also found in the nucleolus <xref rid="pone.0099493-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. It is possible that REIIBP and <italic>ACA11</italic> could work in the same pathway, as it would be expected for a snoRNA and its host gene <xref rid="pone.0099493-Dieci1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that both <italic>ACA11</italic> and REIIBP interact with the nucleolar MYBP1A protein <xref rid="pone.0099493-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0099493-t001">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, the SMN complex also seems to interact with MYBP1A <xref rid="pone.0099493-Fuller1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p><p>In terms of defining the specific biological roles of different <italic>MMSET</italic> isoforms, we could not detect a change in histone methylation pattern when REIIBP was over-expressed. The MMSET II isoform is known to alter histone methylation patterns and the difference with REIIBP possibly reflects the fact that they have different nuclear localization and that REIIBP lacks the upstream PWWP and PHD domains which mediate DNA binding <xref rid="pone.0099493-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In contrast to REIIBP, MMSET II is dispersed throughout the nucleoplasm, where it has important roles in regulating H3K36me2 levels. Moreover, when MMSET II was knocked out in KMS11 myeloma cells, expression of REIIBP and <italic>ACA11</italic> were unaffected <xref rid="pone.0099493-Mirabella1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099493-Lauring1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> but the epigenome landscape was different compared to the parental cells <xref rid="pone.0099493-MartinezGarcia1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099493-Kuo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. These data are consistent with MMSET II having an important role in histone modification whereas REIIBP and <italic>ACA11</italic> seem to be important in RNA processing.</p><p>The observation that REIIBP does not mediate histone methylation suggests that the different patterns of gene expression we demonstrate as a result of REIIBP overexpression are the result of a different mechanism. Insight into this mechanism comes from analysis of the patterns of deregulated genes. We show that REIIBP overexpression increases the expression level of a number of developmental related genes and homeotic genes. In terms of this potential mechanism, it is reported that SF3B1 and U2 snRNP, both of which are components of the splicesomal machinery, interact with polycomb proteins in a splicing independent mechanism that mediates the repression of homeotic genes <xref rid="pone.0099493-Isono1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Thus it is possible that the REIIBP interaction with the SMN complex could influence repression of polycomb regulated homeotic genes by altering the equilibrium of U2 snRNPs. This could also explain the activation of non homeotic genes, like Xist, which are repressed by the polycomb complex.</p><p>Overall we describe a novel role for the REIIBP isoform of <italic>MMSET</italic> in modulating the function of the RNA splicing machinery via its interaction with the SMN complex. This could have an impact on downstream cellular functions such as homeotic gene expression and an important role in the pathogenesis of myeloma. We demonstrate that the SET domain is critical for the role of <italic>MMSET</italic> in RNA processing as well as its previously recognised role in modulating histone methylation patterns. <italic>MMSET</italic> overexpression is an important early event in myeloma that has multiple downstream effects and is associated with poor outcome. This could potentially be reversed by inhibiting its methyltransferase activity via the SET domain. Blocking the interaction between the SMN complex and REIIBP could also be investigated as a possible therapeutic target.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0099493.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Characterization of HeLa cells transduced with REIIBP constructs.</bold> A) Schematic Protein structure of the transduced tagged REIIBP.
