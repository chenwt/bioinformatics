id="P1">Emerging evidence suggests that cancer is populated and maintained by tumor initiating cells (TICs) with stem-like properties similar to that of adult tissue stem cells. Despite recent advances, the molecular regulatory mechanisms that may be shared between normal and malignant stem cells remain poorly understood. Here we show that the &#x00394;Np63 isoform of the Trp63 transcription factor promotes normal mammary stem cell (MaSC) activity by increasing the expression of the Wnt receptor Fzd7, thereby enhancing Wnt signaling. Importantly, Fzd7-dependent enhancement of Wnt signaling by &#x00394;Np63 also governs tumor initiating activity of the basal subtype of breast cancer. These findings establish &#x00394;Np63 as a key regulator of stem cells in both normal and malignant mammary tissues and provide direct evidence that breast cancer TICs and normal MaSCs share common regulatory mechanisms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The mechanisms and pathways regulating self-renewal and differentiation of MaSCs are of great interest for its potential application in prevention and treatment of breast cancer<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.

However, despite significant progress in recent years, the molecular basis underlying the putative link between TICs and normal tissue stem cells remains poorly characterized.</p><p id="P3">Recent studies have highlighted several transcription factors (TFs), such as Bmi-1, Oct1, p53, Snail, Gata3 and Elf5, as key regulators with multiple roles in mammary cell fate determination, stem cell activity, tumor initiation and progression<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Transformation-related protein 63 (Trp63, or p63) is a member of the p53/p63/p73 family TFs that is highly expressed in stratified epithelia such as cervix, skin, prostate and breast<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. p63 proteins include isoforms of two major groups: those possessing a full-length transactivation domain (referred to as the TA isoforms), and those lacking this domain (the &#x00394;N isoforms)<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The role of p63 in development and cancer has remained perplexing largely because of these multiple isoforms of p63. Both increased and reduced expression of p63 have been observed in human cancers<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Disparate results regarding the role of p63 in cancer have also been reported using different p63 mouse models<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that the TA isoforms are most similar to p53 in their tumor suppressive functions<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and the &#x00394;Np63 isoforms generally exhibit oncogenic functions, such as in skin and bladder<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. In the normal mammary gland, &#x00394;Np63 is shown to be expressed at much higher levels than TAp63<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Recent studies have also revealed a role of &#x00394;Np63 in maintaining basal lineage cell fate <italic>in vitro</italic> in mammary epithelia cells<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Despite these findings, rigorous functional studies of p63 isoforms in regulating MaSCs and TICs remain scarce and warrant further investigation.</p><p id="P4">The role of p63 in regulating epithelial homeostasis has been linked to its influence on several signaling pathways such as Notch, Wnt, and Shh<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, which have all been shown to be important regulators of normal and cancerous stem cells<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. The extent to which these pathways are involved in p63-dependent regulation of mammary epithelium remains unclear.

However, what regulates Wnt signaling in normal MaSCs and the highly aggressive basal subtype of breast cancer remains poorly understood. In general, oncogenic mutations in Wnt pathway components, such as &#x003b2;-catenin, APC and Axin, are relatively rare in breast cancer<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we dissect the role of different p63 isoforms in MaSCs and breast cancer TICs.

Global transcriptome analyses revealed 26 transcriptional regulators that have &#x0003e;3 fold higher expression in P4 versus P5 populations (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, upper panel, and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Among these, <italic>p63</italic> expression is most strongly elevated by more than 45 folds in the P4 population. Isoform-specific mRNA and protein analyses confirmed that &#x00394;Np63, but not TAp63, is the primary p63 isoform expressed in primary MECs and MaSC-enriched MECs in both mouse and human (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a&#x02013;d</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To explore the functional importance of &#x00394;Np63 in MaSCs, &#x00394;Np63 and TAp63 expressing lentiviral vectors were transduced into MECs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>), and robust ectopic overexpression of both genes was confirmed (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1d,e</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of &#x00394;Np63, but not TAp63, in P4 cells led to a significant increase in MaSC activity, as reflected by increased reconstitution and ductal outgrowth after transplantation into cleared fat pad (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1f,g</xref>). Importantly, &#x00394;Np63 overexpression also conferred stem cell activity to P5 cells, indicating that &#x00394;Np63 is able to induce luminal cells to enter a stem-like state (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1h,i</xref>).

Transplantation of &#x00394;Np63-dsRED<sup>+</sup> and control-GFP<sup>+</sup> P4 cells in equal ratio resulted in outgrowths that were predominantly dsRED<sup>+</sup>, suggesting that &#x00394;Np63-overexpressing MaSCs had competitive growth advantage over their normal counterparts (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h,i</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of TAp63 did not augment MaSC ability (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h,i</xref>). Collectively, these studies demonstrate that &#x00394;Np63, but not TAp63 promotes MaSC activity.</p><p id="P8">We next examined the function of &#x00394;Np63 in different subpopulation of luminal cells. CD61 has been described to be a luminal progenitor marker among luminal epithelial cells (P5)<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Overexpression of &#x00394;Np63 increased the repopulating frequency in both P5-CD61<sup>+</sup> and P5-CD61<sup>&#x02212;</sup> population (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>).

Interestingly, &#x00394;Np63 overexpression failed to significantly increase reconstitution in Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD24<sup>lo</sup> (P6) stromal-enriched cells (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2e,f</xref>), suggesting that its function is restricted to epithelial cells.</p><p id="P9">&#x00394;Np63-overexpressing outgrowths showed increased tertiary branching and increased percentage of Ki67 positive cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref> and <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>), suggesting that increased proliferation may in part account for the enhanced branching associated with &#x00394;Np63 overexpression. An increased presence of &#x00394;Np63 and K14 positive basal cells (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3c&#x02013;e</xref>) is consistent with FACS analysis of outgrowths showing a ~2-fold increase of P4 population in the &#x00394;Np63-overexpressing mammary epithelium (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3f,g</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We next investigated the effect of &#x00394;Np63 and TAp63 overexpression on colony-forming abilities.

Monochromatic colonies formed by mixed P4 cells from Actin-GFP and Actin-DsRed mammary glands confirmed that each colony originates from single cells instead of aggregates (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>). We next performed serial passage and transplantation assays both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo,</italic> which confirmed that &#x00394;Np63 can induce MaSC self-renewal activity (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1k,l</xref> and <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To further test whether the observed &#x00394;Np63 phenotype is dependent on its transcriptional activity, we tested a DNA binding mutant (MT) form of &#x00394;Np63 in P4 cells.

Since homozygous loss of &#x00394;Np63 leads to embryonic lethality, we performed all of our experiments using heterozygous &#x00394;Np63<sup>gfp/+</sup> animals with reduced expression of &#x00394;Np63 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). We observed a significant reduction of ductal elongation in &#x00394;Np63<sup>gfp/+</sup> mammary glands compared to those of WT counterparts at both 6 weeks and 9&#x02013;10 weeks (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5b&#x02013;d</xref>).

As expected, only &#x00394;Np63 KD led to significantly reduced mammosphere numbers, suggesting decreased stem cell activity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2j</xref>). Together, these results indicate that &#x00394;Np63 but not TAp63 is a crucial regulator of normal MaSCs.</p><p id="P14">To obtain a global view of the molecular events underlying the loss of &#x00394;Np63 phenotype, we next performed a microarray analysis of control and &#x00394;Np63<sup>gfp/+</sup> MECs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2k</xref>). Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that MaSC-enriched genes were significantly down-regulated in the transcriptome of &#x00394;Np63<sup>gfp/+</sup> MECs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2k</xref>), a finding consistent with the decreased MaSC activity of &#x00394;Np63<sup>gfp/+</sup> MECs.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Wnt receptor Fzd7 is a &#x00394;Np63 target that mediates its effect on MaSCs</title><p id="P15">Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Notch, Wnt and Shh signaling is important for stem cell activity in different tissues<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Therefore, we next investigated if any of these pathways were altered in &#x00394;Np63<sup>gfp/+</sup> MECs.

To directly test whether &#x00394;Np63-regulated Wnt signaling is important for MaSC function, we performed colony formation assays with and without Wnt signaling inhibitor Dickkoph 1 (Dkk1). Dkk1 inhibited &#x00394;Np63-mediated increase in colony formation of both primary cells and cells in subsequent serial passages (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5f&#x02013;h</xref>), suggesting that &#x00394;Np63-induced MaSC activity is indeed mediated by Wnt signaling. Moreover, Wnt reporter assay confirmed positive regulation of canonical Wnt signaling in MaSCs by &#x00394;Np63 but not TAp63 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We next sought to identify Wnt signaling genes regulated by &#x00394;Np63. Transcriptome profiling indicated that nine Wnt pathway genes, including several Wnt ligands and receptors, have reduced expression in &#x00394;Np63<sup>gfp/+</sup> P4 cells compared to WT (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis confirmed four out of these nine genes to be significantly down-regulated in &#x00394;Np63<sup>gfp/+</sup> MaSCs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Among these, only one receptor and one ligand gene, <italic>Fzd7</italic> and <italic>Wnt5a</italic>, have reduced expression after acute lentivirus-mediated KD of p63 in primary MECs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Notably, both <italic>Wnt5a</italic> and <italic>Fzd7</italic> belonged to the &#x0201c;enrichment cores&#x0201d; of two WNT gene signatures used in the GSEA study (<xref rid="SD7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that &#x00394;Np63 may regulate MaSCs <italic>via</italic> direct activation of either <italic>Fzd7</italic> or <italic>Wnt5a,</italic> or both. To further investigate this possibility, we next performed isoform-specific KD of p63. Reduced levels of <italic>Fzd7</italic> and not <italic>Wnt5a</italic> were observed with &#x00394;Np63 KDs but not TAp63 KDs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f,g</xref>). Conversely, enforced overexpression of &#x00394;Np63 but not TAp63 led to a significant increase in expression of both <italic>WNT5A</italic> and <italic>FZD7</italic> in the HMLE human mammary epithelial line (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>, right panel, and <xref rid="SD7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). Interestingly, only <italic>FZD7</italic> showed strong activation by &#x00394;Np63 within 48 hours post-infection, suggesting it to be a direct target of &#x00394;Np63 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>, left panel). Indeed, examination of ChIP-seq data of human keratinocytes<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> revealed p63 binding in a conserved active enhancer region ~40Kb upstream from <italic>FZD7</italic> gene (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref>, region highlighted in red). To confirm binding of p63 to this enhancer, we performed ChIP analysis of primary human MECs (HMEC) and primary mouse MMTV-Wnt1 tumor cells using anti-p63 antibodies, and observed strong enrichment of the <italic>FZD7</italic> enhancer in p63-bound chromatin (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3j,k</xref>). We next performed luciferase assays using a reporter driven by the <italic>FZD7</italic> enhancer, together with &#x00394;Np63, TAp63, or a DNA-binding mutant of &#x00394;Np63.

Normalized microarray expression data were rank-ordered by differential expression between cell populations and/or genetic background as indicated, using the provided ratio of classes (i.e., fold change) metric.

Both are defined by significantly upregulated genes (p &#x0003c; 0.05 and FC &#x0003e; 3) in MaSC-enriched subpopulations from MECs of wild type mice. Among which, the &#x0201c;MaSC signature from current study&#x0201d; is derived from the microarray data collected from our lab as described in this study (GSE47493). The genes qualify by showing &#x0003e;3 folds upregulation in P4 comparing to both P5 and P6 of wild type mice. The other MaSC signature is derived from published dataset GSE22446.

Using log<sub>2</sub>-transformed and median centered microarray data, we defined the &#x00394;Np63 signature as the gene expression values of all genes with &#x0003e; 1.5-fold changes between MECs and P4 cells compared their corresponding wild-type control cells. This corresponded to 125 genes up- or downregulated in both MECs and P4 cells compared to wild type. To reduce each gene to one expression value, we took the average of its expression in MECs and in P4 cells. We then applied this signature to log<sub>2</sub>-transformed and median centered microarray data from the EMC286 clinical breast cancer dataset<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>.

The Pearson correlation coefficient values were used as a given patient&#x02019;s &#x00394;Np63 signature score.
