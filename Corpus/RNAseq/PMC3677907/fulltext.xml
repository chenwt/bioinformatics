We previously showed that Gli1, a downstream effector of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, is expressed only in the insertion site of the mouse patellar tendon during its differentiation. To test for a functional role of Hh signaling, we targeted <italic>the Smoothened (Smo</italic>) gene <italic>in vivo</italic> using a Cre/Lox system. Constitutive activation of the Hh pathway in the mid-substance caused molecular markers of the insertion site, e.g. type II collagen, to be ectopically expressed or up-regulated in the midsubstance. This was confirmed using a novel organ culture method <italic>in vitro</italic>. Conversely, when <italic>Smo</italic> was excised in the scleraxis-positive cell population, the development of the fibrocartilaginous insertion site was affected. Whole transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of genes involved in chondrogenesis and mineralization was down-regulated in the insertion site, and expression of insertion site markers was decreased. Biomechanical testing of murine adult patellar tendon, which developed in the absence of Hh signaling, showed impairment of tendon structural properties (lower linear stiffness and greater displacement) and material properties (greater strain), although the linear modulus of the mutant group was not significantly lower than controls. These studies provide new insights into the role of Hh signaling during tendon development.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study is supported by the National Institute of Health (AR056943)(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov/">http://www.nih.gov/</ext-link>).

They transmit force from muscles to bones during body movements and bear huge tensile forces during exercise. As such, tendons are easily injured but difficult to repair. Their healing can be slow and complete recovery is rare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Sharma1">[1]</xref>. Thus, it is necessary to develop more efficient treatments for tendon injuries. However, the development of new therapies has been impeded due to limitations in our understanding of tendon development.</p><p>Insertion sites are the points at which tendons and ligaments attach to bone or cartilage, and are the regions of maximum stress concentration, which makes them prone to injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Benjamin1">[2]</xref>. Two primary types of insertion sites are present in mammals: fibrocartilaginous (direct) and fibrous (indirect). A recent study showed that the formation of fibrous insertions is regulated by Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Wang1">[3]</xref>. However, the mechanisms regulating the differentiation and formation of fibrocartilaginous insertion sites are still not clear.</p><p>In a previous study, we screened for active cell signaling pathways during development of the mouse patellar tendon. We showed that cells in the insertion site of the patellar tendon respond to Hedgehog (Hh) signaling during late fetal and early postnatal life, a period when cell proliferation is ending and tenocyte cell differentiation is beginning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Liu1">[4]</xref>. Cells in the midsubstance of the tendon were negative for the Hh reporter signal, suggesting that Hh signaling may be required for some aspects of insertion site differentiation.</p><p>Hh signaling is a key cell-signaling pathway that plays many essential roles in both embryonic and post-embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Ingham1">[5]</xref>. Two Hh ligands, sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Indian hedgehog (Ihh), have been shown to regulate the development of musculoskeletal system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Ehlen1">[6]</xref>. Both of these ligands bind to the membrane-bound receptor Patched1 (PTCH1) to elicit their functions. Binding of the Hh ligand to PTCH1 reverses the inhibition of the transmembrane protein, smoothened (SMO), which then activates a cascade of signals in the responding cells. SMO-mediated signal transduction regulates the activities of GLI-Kruppel family member (GLI) transcription factors. Therefore the activation of <italic>Gli</italic> expression, in particular <italic>Gli1</italic>, serves as a marker of active Hh signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Ahn1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Bai1">[8]</xref>.</p><p>The specific expression of <italic>Gli1</italic> in the insertion site suggests the hypothesis that Hh signaling pathway is involved in the differentiation of the fibrocartilaginous insertion site. To test this hypothesis, we used both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches to study the function of Hh signaling in the differentiation of the fibrocartilaginous insertion site of the mouse patellar tendon, with the goal of understanding which aspects of fibrocartilaginous insertion site differentiation are regulated by Hh signaling during the normal development. We show that the active ligand is Indian hedgehog, and present both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data that Ihh signaling is required for normal differentiation of the fibrocartilaginous insertion site.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Activation of Hedgehog Signaling Pathway in the Scx-positive Cells Altered the Expression Pattern of Insertion Site Markers</title><p>To understand the role of Hh signaling pathway in the development of the patellar tendon, we targeted Smoothened (Smo), a key receptor of Hh signaling pathway on the cell membrane. We first carried out gain-of-function assays <italic>in vivo</italic> by generating mice in which all tenocytes expressing Scleraxis (Scx) also expressed a constitutively active mutant of Smo (see materials and methods for details). In the insertion sites of control patellar tendons, the downstream Hh target <italic>GLI1</italic> was expressed only in the insertion sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065411-g001">Fig. 1A and C</xref>), but extended into the mid-substance of the constitutively active Smo (CA-Smo) patellar tendons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065411-g001">Fig. 1B and D</xref>, purple staining in the nuclus and insect in 1D).

An increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms of insertion site differentiation would provide useful information for future translational studies. Here we used mouse genetics and organ culture studies to study the role of Hh signaling during the differentiation of the fibrocartilaginous insertion site. We demonstrated that IHH was responsible for the activation of the Hh pathway in the tibial fibrocartilaginous insertion site. Activation of Hh signaling in whole tendon disrupted normal tendon development and caused up-regulated or ectopic appearance of insertion site markers in the midsubstance. Ablation of Hh signaling resulted in decreased expression of insertion site markers and affected chondrogenesis of the fibrocartilaginous insertion. Our data indicates that the Hh signaling pathway is required for normal differentiation of the patellar tendon fibrocartilaginous insertion site and may have implications in the development of other tendon-to-bone insertion sites. This study could also be important in developing strategies to improve treatment of insertional tendon injuries.</p><p>The maturation of insertion sites requires contributions from both tenocytes and chondrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Benjamin2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Berman1">[15]</xref>, as both of these cell populations produce and deposit essential extra cellular matrix constituents to form a proper attachment between tendon and bone. When we activated Hh pathway <italic>in vivo</italic> in the tenocyte population, the insertion site marker COL2 was ectopically expressed and TNC and BGN were up-regulated in the midsubstance of tendon at embryonic stage. In addition, in <italic>vitro</italic> organ culture treated with rIHH increased the expression of these insertion site makers in the mid-substance. These results demonstrate that Hh signaling controls the expression of insertion site components during tendon development. Studies have shown that TNC, BGN and COL2 are also associated with the development of cartilage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Pacifici1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Roughley1">[17]</xref>. Therefore, Hh signaling in the tenocyte may function to regulate chondrogenesis in tenocytes in the insertion site.</p><p>Hh signaling may not be the only signal controlling expression of TNC and BGN, however. In tendons cultured in the absence of rIHH, mRNAs for <italic>Bgn</italic> and <italic>Tnc</italic> can still be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065411-g004">Fig. 4D&#x02013;H</xref>). Although, Q-PCR analysis showed that both <italic>Bgn</italic> and <italic>Tnc</italic> mRNA were reduced in the Smo-targeted patellar insertion site <italic>in vivo, Bgn</italic> mRNA did not show statistically different between control and Smo tKO. Moreover, both <italic>Tnc</italic> and <italic>Bgn</italic> mRNA were not absent in Smo tKO. In addition, BGN and TNC proteins can still be seen by immunohistochemistry (data not shown). There are several possible explanations. First, Smo was only targeted in the tenocytes of the patellar tendon. Adjacent tissues, such as the tibial cartilage or connective tissue layers of the tendon itself, may also express these genes, since they are not uniquely expressed in tenocytes. Second, Gli1-positive cells were still seen, albeit in much reduced numbers, in the insertion sites of Smo-targeted patellar tendons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065411-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). These could be due to incomplete <italic>Smo</italic> excision in tenocytes. Third, studies using rat and human tissue models have shown that Bgn and Tnc are also present in the midsubstance of tendon at adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-ChiquetEhrismann1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Eliasson1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Waggett1">[20]</xref>. Therefore other signaling pathways besides IHH could also control expression of these markers. Without more data we cannot distinguish among these possibilities. What is clear from the data is that genes known to be involved in fibrillogenesis, chondrogenesis and mineralization (<italic>Runx2</italic>, <italic>Col2a1</italic> and <italic>Gpc3,</italic> for example) were down-regulated in the insertion sites from Smo tKO animals. Thus, it is clear that the Hh signaling pathway participates in regulating these cellular events at the insertion site. Moreover, loss of Hh signaling eliminates the characteristic tidemark in H&#x00026;E stained sections of the insertion sites.</p><p>Tendon biomechanical function relies on the proper composition and organization of extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibrillar collagens, e.g. COL1 and COL2, and proteoglycans, e.g. BGN. The evidence presented here shows decreased gene expression of insertion site-specific markers during early post-natal development of the Smo tKO animal. In addition, there were clearly disruptions in the organization of the insertion site relative to the formation of the tidemark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065411-g006">Fig. 6E&#x02013;F</xref>) and localization of cartilage-specific proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065411-g007">Fig. 7</xref>) that persisted into adult stages of maturation.</p><p>Biomechanical analysis demonstrated significantly lower linear stiffness in the Smo tKO tendon. This reduction was due to an increase in total tissue displacement rather than a decrease in failure load. As the normal tendon insertion is known to experience greater strain during failure than the tendon midsubstance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Butler1">[21]</xref>, alterations in the organization of the tendon insertion site suggest that the increased strains in the mutants could have been localized to the altered insertion site. However, a limitation of this study is that we did not specifically measure localized strain patterns and cannot therefore ensure that loss of Hh signaling does not also result in non-local (e.g. midsubstance) biomechanical abnormalities. Nevertheless, this alteration in tissue mechanics is likely due to lower production of type II collagen and other essential proteoglycans associated with the absence of the Hh signaling pathway. It will be important to further investigate how the Hh signaling pathway regulates collagen fibrillogenesis at the tendon insertion during postnatal stages.</p><p>We found that IHH protein was present in the insertion site in a pattern similar to that of Gli1-LacZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Liu1">[4]</xref>. This result indicates that IHH is the ligand responsible for regulating the expression of Gli1 in the insertion site. IHH signaling not only regulates chondrocyte proliferation in long bone development along with parathyroid-hormone-related protein (PTHrP) in the growth plate but also triggers the formation of the intramembranous bone collar near the diaphysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Koyama1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Vortkamp1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-StJacques1">[24]</xref>. Since the growth plate at the end of each long bone is essential for bone lengthening, it is possible that IHH from the growth plate or from the articular cartilage acts on tenocytes in the insertion site during the formation of the fibrocartilage insertion site. Although it has been shown that targeted deletion of IHH caused short-limb dwarfism with decreased chondrocyte number and extensive hypertrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Vortkamp1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Karp1">[25]</xref>, to our knowledge, there has been no description of the effects on tendon or ligament insertions in the <italic>Ihh</italic> mutant.</p><p>In the clinic surgical repair of injured tendons often fails because a functional insertion site is never regenerated. Interestingly, the new insertion site after surgical reattachment is initially a fibrous insertion, since there is no cartilage present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-PamelaK1">[26]</xref>. We observed that Hh signaling was decreased at the insertion site after P7, suggesting Hh signaling may not be present at the insertion in adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Liu1">[4]</xref>. Hh signaling is known to be associated with age-related joint diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Lin1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Dwyer1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Chang1">[29]</xref>. A recent study also showed that delivery of an Ihh gene can induce chondrogenesis in human mesenchymal stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Steinert1">[30]</xref>. Thus, our results and others suggest that it may be necessary to supply Hh signaling after surgical repair to regenerate a functional insertion, and IHH may serve as an antagonist of aging and its associated diseases. However, we must overcome the challenge of delivering Hh signaling locally at the insertion site without affecting the midsubstance after surgical repair. It is also necessary to learn how different regions of tendons respond to signals during normal development as well as during the healing process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Liu2">[31]</xref>. It is worth noting here that the source of IHH during differentiation of the insertion site, the tibial cartilage which has ossified by the adult stage, would no longer be a source of Hh signals during tendon repair or grafting. Furthermore, the tenocytes that are chondrifed in response to Hh signaling will be replaced by bone via the actions of osteoclast and osteoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Kronenberg1">[32]</xref>. Therefore, simply supplying Hh signaling after surgical repair of injured tendon may not be sufficient to generate a new insertion site. Further studies investigating the functions of the Hh signaling pathway in the insertion site maturation and evaluating the application of Hh signaling to improve the healing process of injured tendon will enhance our understanding of how to regenerate rather than simply repair tendon after injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All procedures described were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at CCHMC and were performed in accordance with the Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Animals, Breeding Scheme, and Mating</title><p>Scleraxis-Cre (ScxCre) mice were generously provided by Dr. Ronen Schweitzer and will be described elsewhere by his group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Blitz1">[33]</xref>. <italic>GT(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1(smo/EYFP)Amc</sup></italic>/J (SmoM2) mice, <italic>Smo<sup>tm2Amc</sup></italic>/J (<italic>Smo<sup>f/f</sup></italic>) and <italic>Gli1<sup>tm2Alj</sup>/J</italic> (Gli1-LacZ ) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (SmoM2, stock number: 005130; Gli1-LacZ, stock number: 008211).</p><p>Mice expressing a constitutively active form of the Smoothened (Smo) protein in tenocytes were generated by crossing ScxCre with a dominant active allele of Smo mouse (SmoM2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065411.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Jeong1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0065411-Xie1">[35]</xref>.
