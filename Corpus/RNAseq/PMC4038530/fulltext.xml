Analysis of TCGA datasets have mostly focused on somatic mutations and translocations, with less emphasis placed on gene amplifications. Here we describe a bioinformatics screening strategy to identify putative cancer driver genes amplified across TCGA datasets. We carried out GISTIC2 analysis of TCGA datasets spanning 14 cancer subtypes and identified 461 genes that were amplified in two or more datasets. The list was narrowed to 73 cancer-associated genes with potential &#x0201c;druggable&#x0201d; properties. The majority of the genes were localized to 14 amplicons spread across the genome. To identify potential cancer driver genes, we analyzed gene copy number and mRNA expression data from individual patient samples and identified 40 putative cancer driver genes linked to diverse oncogenic processes. Oncogenic activity was further validated by siRNA/shRNA knockdown and by referencing the Project Achilles datasets. The amplified genes represented a number of gene families, including epigenetic regulators, cell cycle-associated genes, DNA damage response/repair genes, metabolic regulators, and genes linked to the Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog, JAK/STAT, NF-KB and MAPK signaling pathways. Among the 40 putative driver genes were known driver genes, such as <italic>EGFR</italic>, <italic>ERBB2</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic>. Wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> was amplified in several cancer types, and <italic>KRAS</italic>-amplified cancer cell lines were most sensitive to <italic>KRAS</italic> shRNA, suggesting that <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification was an independent oncogenic event. A number of MAP kinase adapters were co-amplified with their receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the FGFR adapter <italic>FRS2</italic> and the EGFR family adapter <italic>GRB7</italic>. The ubiquitin-like ligase <italic>DCUN1D1</italic> and the histone methyltransferase <italic>NSD3</italic> were also identified as novel putative cancer driver genes. We discuss the patient tailoring implications for existing cancer drug targets and we further discuss potential novel opportunities for drug discovery efforts.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by Eli Lilly and Company.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) effort was set up to sequence and analyze several thousand individual cancers, giving a snapshot to disease-specific genetic backgrounds and cancer drivers <xref rid="pone.0098293-The1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098293-Kandoth1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Integrated analysis of TCGA datasets identified 127 significantly mutated cancer-associated genes representing distinct biological pathways and cellular processes <xref rid="pone.0098293-Kandoth1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The average number of driver mutations per tumor sample was two to six, suggesting that a small number of mutated driver genes could induce carcinogenesis <xref rid="pone.0098293-Kandoth1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In breast cancers, only three genes (<italic>GATA3</italic>, <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, and <italic>TP53</italic>) were found to be mutated at &#x0003e;10% incidence across all patient tumors. Further analysis revealed pathway-specific genetic driver mutations in breast cancer subtypes, such as <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> alterations and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> alterations in basal-like and luminal breast cancers, respectively <xref rid="pone.0098293-The4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In colorectal cancers, twenty-four genes were commonly mutated and most of the genes mapped to the Wnt, TGF-b, PI3K, p53 and RAS signaling pathways <xref rid="pone.0098293-The3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In lung cancers, eleven genes were commonly mutated, including <italic>TP53</italic>, oxidative stress response genes and squamous differentiation genes <xref rid="pone.0098293-The1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. These studies have shed light into the major genetic drivers of cancer subtypes and have also identified potentially druggable pathways linked to these subtypes. The advancements will accelerate drug development by offering novel patient tailoring strategies for pathway-specific inhibitors. However, the TCGA studies have mostly focused on mutations and rare translocations, with less attention placed on gene amplifications in cancers. Since gene amplification is an important mechanism of carcinogenesis, we sought to mine the TCGA datasets to identify novel targets and drivers amplified across cancer types.</p><p>Gene amplification in cancer cells provides a means for overexpression of cancer-promoting driver genes, such as <italic>EGFR</italic> and <italic>ERBB2</italic> on chromosomes 7 and 17, respectively. Gene amplification occurs somatically in a restricted region of the cancer genome through various mechanisms, such as breakage-fusion-bridges cycles <xref rid="pone.0098293-Santarius1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These amplified regions, known as amplicons, can span kilobases to tens of megabases and can include multiple oncogenic genes as well as passenger genes in the amplified regions <xref rid="pone.0098293-Albertson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The length of amplicons can vary substantially based on the genomic locus and cancer type. For example, single gene amplification of <italic>KIT</italic> on chromosome 4 can occur in testicular tumors <xref rid="pone.0098293-McIntyre1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, yet larger amplicons containing <italic>KIT</italic>, <italic>PDGFRA</italic>, and <italic>KDR</italic> are amplified in glioblastoma <xref rid="pone.0098293-Nobusawa1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Because amplicons often contain many genes, including passenger genes not related to oncogenesis, it is often difficult to identify the cancer driver gene(s) responsible for the amplification. Strategies to identify the cancer genes driving an amplicon include mapping the minimal region of amplification (MRA) across many tumor samples, identifying positive correlation between copy number and mRNA expression of genes, and experimental validation with siRNA/shRNA knockdown in cells. Such analyses have to date identified amplified genes with a demonstrated role in carcinogenesis <xref rid="pone.0098293-Santarius1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, most analyses to date have relied on small samples sizes, which result in large MRAs and potential false positive genes. The TCGA datasets offer a unique collection of tumor samples with large sample sizes to identify amplified cancer driver genes in distinct cancer types.</p><p>Here we describe a bioinformatics screening strategy to identify potentially druggable cancer driver genes amplified across TCGA datasets. We used GISTIC2 analysis of TCGA datasets (cBio portal) and identified 461 genes that were statistically amplified in two or more TCGA datasets comprising 14 cancer types. Genes with putative or verified roles in cancer were identified using Cancer Genes cBio database. We assigned a druggability score for each gene by integrating data from four external druggability indices. From the 461 genes, we identified 73 potentially druggable amplified genes with a known or putative role in carcinogenesis. We then used correlation analysis with copy number and mRNA expression data from several thousand TCGA patient samples to identify potential cancer driver genes among the list. This resulted in the identification of 40 putative cancer driver genes linked to diverse oncogenic processes, including epigenetic regulators, cell cycle-associated genes, DNA damage response/repair genes, metabolic regulators, and genes linked to the Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog, JAK/STAT, NF-KB and MAPK signaling pathways. The putative cancer driver activity was further validated by accessing the shRNA hairpin activity in cancer cell lines using the Project Achilles database <xref rid="pone.0098293-Cheung1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Additional validation was performed on a subset of the genes using siRNA/shRNA knockdown in cancer cell lines containing the gene amplification of interest. Among the 40 putative driver genes were known driver genes, such as <italic>EGFR</italic> and <italic>ERBB2</italic>, as well as novel targets, such as <italic>DCUN1D1</italic> and <italic>NSD3</italic>. <italic>KRAS</italic>, a prominent cancer driver with known activating mutation in cancer <xref rid="pone.0098293-Riely1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, was found to be amplified in a subset of ovarian, gastric, lung, and uterine cancers. We discuss the implications for drug discovery efforts and we identify novel patient tailoring strategies for existing therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><p>TCGA datasets from 14 cancer subtypes were analyzed for gene amplification using the GISTIC2 algorithm in the cBio portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org">http://www.cbioportal.org</ext-link>). The 14 cancer subtypes include BLCA - Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma, BRCA - Breast invasive carcinoma, CRC &#x02013; Colorectal Cancer (COAD and READ studies combined together), GBM - Glioblastoma multiforme, HNSC - Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma, KIRC - Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, LGG - Brain Lower Grade Glioma, LUAD - Lung adenocarcinoma, LUSC - Lung squamous cell carcinoma, OV - Ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, PRAD - Prostate adenocarcinoma, SKCM - Skin Cutaneous Melanoma, STAD - Stomach adenocarcinoma, and UCEC - Uterine Corpus Endometrioid Carcinoma. Genes that were amplified in two or more TCGA studies were pooled together to make a list of 461 genes. Level 3 SNP6 and RNAseq version 2 data were retrieved from TCGA website, and level 3 SNP6 data were further mapped to gene level using R package CNTools. Pearson correlation coefficients for gene copy number (SNP6) versus gene expression (RNASeq) were calculated for genes of interest using function cor() in R. The data analysis code in R and GAWK can be provided upon request. Each gene was assigned a druggability score based on data from the external databases Ensembl, InterPro-Blast, BioLT-Drugbank and Qiagen Druggability list. For each database, a gene was given a 0&#x02013;4 druggability score, with 0 being undruggable and 4 being an established drug target. A gene with a &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; druggability score in any of the four databases was considered &#x0201c;potentially druggable&#x0201d; and included in the final gene list.

We developed a method to score gene dependency in each cell line by weighting each hairpin according to the degree of consistency with other hairpins designed against the same gene, in a manner similar to that described by Shao et. al <xref rid="pone.0098293-Shao1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We reasoned that if tumor cell lines varied in their dependency on a particular driver gene, then hairpins effectively targeting that gene should give similar shRNA depletion scores in the dependent lines. We calculated pairwise correlations of depletion scores across the panel for all hairpins from the group of shRNA constructs designed to target a particular gene. Then each shRNA was weighted by the number of other shRNAs from the gene set that were highly correlated to it (Spearman correlation coefficient is larger than 0.35 with a p-value&#x0003c;0.01). A gene-level composite score (shRNA score) was then obtained by weighted summation of the shRNA depletion scores. These gene dependency profiles were used to calculate likelihood ratio scores for the association of gene mutation or copy number with shRNA sensitivity by comparing the gene mutation model to a &#x0201c;null model&#x0201d; (without any gene mutation).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Cells</title><p>Cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

A total of 461 genes were identified as potentially amplified genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098293.s005">Table S1</xref>). In some cases, several genes (e.g., <italic>CD274</italic> and <italic>NDUFC2</italic>) were amplified in two or more datasets that originated from a single cancer subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098293-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098293.s005">Table S1</xref>). The gene list was further narrowed by identifying the subset of genes with established or putative roles in oncogenesis as well as genes that were potentially druggable. First, the gene list was cross-referenced with the Cancer Genes database (cBio portal), which showed that less than 25% of the 461 genes were linked to oncogenesis.

The other three genes may also play potentially significant roles in carcinogenesis &#x02013; <italic>APH1A</italic> is a gamma secretase complex subunit in the Notch pathway, <italic>ARNT</italic> is a subunit in the HIF1 complex, and <italic>CHD1L</italic> is a DNA helicase in the DNA damage response pathway <xref rid="pone.0098293-Qin1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

The chromosome 3 cluster with 7 genes contained 2 genes with copy number versus expression correlation greater than 0.5 (<italic>DCUN1D1</italic> and <italic>PRKCI</italic>) and 4 genes with copy number versus expression less than 0.3 (<italic>TERC</italic>, <italic>SKIL</italic>, <italic>GNB4</italic>, and <italic>SOX2</italic>). <italic>PRKCI</italic> is a serine/threonine kinase in the NF-KB pathway and previous tissue microarray data validated this gene as a potential novel cancer driver gene <xref rid="pone.0098293-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. <italic>DCUN1D1</italic> is an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex subunit with potential cancer driver activity, which we further validated with shRNA knockdown (below). While <italic>PIK3CA</italic> displayed an overall correlation coefficient 0.4, it displayed high correlation in breast cancer (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.9), head and neck squamous cancer (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.8), and uterine/endometrial cancers (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098293-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The chromosome 11q cluster contained 5 genes, including <italic>CCND1</italic>, a well-established cell cycle regulator and oncogenic driver. While <italic>CCND1</italic> displayed high copy number versus expression correlations in liver cancer (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.0), bladder cancer (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.8), lung squamous cancer (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.7), head and neck caner (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.7) and breast cancer (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.7), the correlations were lower in other cancer types, suggesting that <italic>CCND1</italic> amplification is a disease-specific oncogenic driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098293-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Two other genes in the amplicon, <italic>FADD</italic>, and <italic>PPFIA1</italic>, displayed higher overall correlation across cancer types, implicating these genes as potential novel cancer drivers for further investigation. <italic>FADD</italic>, an apoptotic effector molecule, was previously identified as a novel cancer driver gene in a panel of 167 laryngeal/pharyngeal cancers, warranting further investigation into its mechanism of oncogenesis <xref rid="pone.0098293-Gibcus1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. It is important to note that correlation of mRNA expression to copy number is not essential in principle for a gene to be a cancer driver gene. Therefore, genes with low mRNA expression versus copy number correlation are not necessarily passenger genes. For example, the chromosome 1q cluster contained <italic>MCL1</italic>, a gene with a cancer driver signature based on Project Achilles (data not shown) but with a mean mRNA expression versus copy number correlation of 0.31.</p><p>To identify the amplified cancer genes with highest overall cancer driver activity, we ranked the genes in order of highest copy number versus mRNA expression correlation across all cancer types. We identified 40 genes with overall r greater than 0.3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0098293-t001">Table 1</xref>). The r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.3 cutoff was used because several genes demonstrated high r in a small number of cancer types. For example, <italic>FGFR3</italic> displayed r&#x0003e;0.7 in four cancers (bladder cancer, glioblastoma, lung squamous, and melanoma) but r&#x0003c;0.5 in other cancers. Similarly, <italic>CDK6</italic> demonstrated r&#x0003e;0.7 in only 4 cancers (glioblastoma, head and neck cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous cancer) while <italic>IGF1R</italic> had r&#x0003e;0.7 in only one cancer (breast cancer) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098293-g003">Figure 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098293-g004">4</xref>). Among the 40 genes with highest cancer driver activity, the top two most highly ranked genes were <italic>NSD3</italic>/<italic>WHSC1L1</italic> and <italic>SETDB1</italic>, two important histone methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0098293-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Two other chromatin regulators, the chromatin reader Brd4 and histone acetyltransferase <italic>YEATS4</italic>, were also highly ranked as putative cancer driver genes. Other gene families that were represented in the list include Notch pathway genes (<italic>NOTCH2</italic>, <italic>APH1A</italic>), metabolic regulatory genes (<italic>NDUFC2</italic>,

The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is another important metabolic sensor that regulates metabolic pathways, including fatty acid biosynthesis and glycolysis, and promotes cancer cell survival <xref rid="pone.0098293-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. <italic>PRKAB2</italic> is a regulatory subunit in the AMPK complex and is overexpressed in several cancers, including ovarian cancers <xref rid="pone.0098293-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Interestingly, it was recently suggested that the AMPK promotes tumor cell survival primarily through the regulation of NADPH homeostasis via fatty acid oxidation and inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylases <xref rid="pone.0098293-Jeon1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. This mechanism allows cancer cells to maintain NADPH levels under high stress conditions, such as hypoxia and anchorage-independent growth. Further work will be necessary to study the role of AMPK in <italic>PRKAB2</italic> amplified cancer cells and to characterize the role of <italic>PRKAB2</italic> as a putative cancer driver gene.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Epigenetic cancer amplified genes</title><p>A number of chromatin-modifying genes and chromatin reader genes were amplified in TCGA datasets, including the genes <italic>SETDB1</italic>, <italic>NSD3</italic>, <italic>YEATS4</italic>, and <italic>BRD4</italic>. Epigenetic regulatory genes comprise a large family of genes that add, modify or read modifications on DNA and histones. These modifications can lead to abnormal alterations in gene transcription, replication or repair, which can lead to the induction and maintenance of many cancers <xref rid="pone.0098293-Esteller1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. At least four distinct DNA modifications and 16 classes of histone modifications have been recognized <xref rid="pone.0098293-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. A large number of DNA/chromatin modifying enzymes directly conjugate these modifications to target DNA/histones, including <italic>SETDB1</italic> (a H3K9 methyltransferase), <italic>NSD3</italic> (a H3K4/H3K27 methyltransferase) and <italic>YEATS4</italic> (histone acetyltransferase). Other chromatin &#x0201c;reader&#x0201d; genes, such as <italic>BRD4</italic>, recognize these DNA/histone modifications and recruit additional chromatin modifier/remodeling enzymes to the sites <xref rid="pone.0098293-Dawson1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Together these epigenetic regulatory genes play important roles in cancer initiation/progression, with a number of cancers being driven by mutations in the gene families. This includes the histone methyltransferase <italic>MLL2</italic> and the histone demethylases <italic>UTX</italic>, which are mutated in a number of cancers <xref rid="pone.0098293-Morin1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. A number of chromatin regulatory genes have been implicated in cancer progression, specifically in the reprogramming of cancer metastases in distant organs <xref rid="pone.0098293-Franci1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Small molecule inhibitors have been developed for a number of these epigenetic regulatory genes and are currently under clinical development. Recently, small molecular inhibitors of <italic>BRD4</italic> have been identified and may hold promise for the treatment of cancer subtypes, including acute myeloid leukemia <xref rid="pone.0098293-Herrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098293-Vidler1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The cancer driver signatures for <italic>SETDB1</italic>, <italic>YEATS4</italic>, <italic>NSD3</italic>, and <italic>BRD4</italic> in TCGA datasets suggests that these genes are important cancer therapeutic targets and potential patient tailoring markers for epigenetics drug discovery efforts.</p><p>While the amplifications of <italic>SETDB1</italic> and <italic>BRD4</italic> have been previously identified and their roles in cancer have been well-studied <xref rid="pone.0098293-Ceol1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098293-RodriguezParedes1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, less is known about the functions of <italic>YEATS4</italic> and <italic>NSD3</italic> in cancer. The nuclear receptor binding SET domain (NSD) protein family is made of three histone methyltransferases &#x02013; <italic>NSD1</italic>, <italic>NSD2</italic>/<italic>MMSET</italic>/<italic>WHSC1</italic>, and <italic>NSD3</italic>/<italic>WHSC1L1</italic>. <italic>NSD1</italic> has been linked to several cancers, including multiple myeloma and lung cancer, and translocations involving <italic>NSD1</italic> and <italic>NUP98</italic> have been identified in childhood acute myeloid leukemia <xref rid="pone.0098293-Morishita1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The <italic>NUP98</italic>-<italic>NSD1</italic> fusion protein is an active H3K36 methylase, suggesting that <italic>NSD1</italic> enzymatic activity is a necessary oncogenic driver for this cancer. It has been suggested that overexpressed <italic>NSD1</italic> acts as an oncogene by activating genes that are normally silenced by H3K27 methylation <xref rid="pone.0098293-LucioEterovic1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. <italic>NSD2</italic> also has been linked to several cancers, such as prostate cancer and multiple myeloma, and it is also the target of translocations in multiple myeloma <xref rid="pone.0098293-Morishita1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. <italic>NSD3</italic> is overexpressed in a number of cancers, including breast cancer and lung cancer, but its role in oncogenesis has not been widely investigated. Among the 73 cancer amplified genes we identified in this study, <italic>NSD3</italic> was the most highly ranked gene in terms of putative cancer driver activity. It showed high copy number versus mRNA expression correlation in multiple cancer types, including bladder, breast, liver, lung, ovarian, head and neck, and colorectal cancers. <italic>NSD3</italic> knockdown by siRNA led to reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in <italic>NSD3</italic>- amplified cell lines. The mechanism of <italic>NSD3</italic>-siRNA-mediated cell death did not appear to involve cell cycle regulation, as reported previously, and further work will be necessary to define its precise role in oncogenesis <xref rid="pone.0098293-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Our data suggest that <italic>NSD3</italic> is a compelling drug target for cancer and that <italic>NSD1</italic>/<italic>NSD2</italic>/<italic>NSD3</italic> structural similarity should be used for structure-based drug design to develop a new class of histone methyltransferase inhibitors for cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Ubiquitin-like modifiers</title><p>Post-translational modifications of proteins by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins have emerged as important regulators of cancer cell signaling, survival, and homeostasis. Ubiquitylation of proteins was originally described as a &#x0201c;destruction tag&#x0201d; for defective proteins, but recent studies have identified important roles for ubiquitylation in many hallmarks of cancer, such as the cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0098293-Hoeller1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Other ubiquitin-like protein modifications exist and can similarly regulate oncogenesis, such as sumoylation (SUMO tag), neddylation (NEDD8 tag), ISGylation (ISG15 tag), and fatylation (FAT10 tag). Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like ligases are key regulators of these small protein modifications and they have emerged as important oncogenes and tumor suppressors in many cancer types <xref rid="pone.0098293-Hoeller1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. The ubiquitin ligases <italic>CBL</italic> and <italic>SKP2</italic> were identified as candidate oncogenes, while the ubiquitin ligase <italic>FBXW7</italic> is a bona fide tumor suppressor that is mutated frequently in breast and colorectal cancers <xref rid="pone.0098293-The3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. We have identified a number of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like ligases that are amplified in TCGA datasets and show evidence of cancer driver activity, including <italic>MDM2</italic>, <italic>DCUN1D1</italic> and <italic>PIAS3</italic>. Of these genes, the best characterized is <italic>MDM2</italic>, a E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates p53 polyubiquitylation and degradation, allowing for silencing of p53 in p53-wild type cancer cells <xref rid="pone.0098293-Wade1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Transgenic mouse model studies showed that <italic>MDM2</italic> overexpression was sufficient to induce carcinomas and lymphomas, an effect that depended on p53 inhibition <xref rid="pone.0098293-Wade1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. We also identified <italic>MDM4</italic> as a cancer amplified gene with potential cancer driver activity. Like <italic>MDM2</italic>, <italic>MDM4</italic> inhibits p53 but its mechanism relies on direct binding to the p53 transactivation domain (rather than ubiquitin-mediated degradation) and binding to <italic>MDM2</italic> to preventing its degradation <xref rid="pone.0098293-Gembarska1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Recently, small molecular inhibitors of <italic>MDM2</italic> and <italic>MDM4</italic> have been developed and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for several cancer types <xref rid="pone.0098293-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that ubiquitin-like modifiers play important roles in oncogenesis and tumor progression. A number of transcriptional cofactors and chromatin remodeling factors are targets of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO), and as a result a number of oncogenes and tumor suppressors are regulated by SUMOylation <xref rid="pone.0098293-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In breast cancer, the <italic>BRCA1</italic> DNA damage response protein is modified by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) in response to genotoxic stress, and several SUMO E3 ligases are required for the downstream DNA damage response <xref rid="pone.0098293-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. We identified the SUMO family member <italic>PIAS3</italic> as a putative cancer driver gene that is amplified in TCGA datasets. <italic>PIAS3</italic> is an E3 SUMO ligase that has been linked to regulation of <italic>STAT3</italic> and <italic>ERBB4</italic>, two important signaling pathways in oncogenesis <xref rid="pone.0098293-Sundvall1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098293-Dabir1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. In addition to SUMOylation, other ubiquitin-like modifications play important roles in oncogenesis, such as neddylation, ISGylation, and fatylation <xref rid="pone.0098293-Rabut1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. We identified the neddylation ligase <italic>DCUN1D1</italic> as a putative amplified cancer driver that was amplified in over 40% of lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cancers. We found that <italic>DCUN1D1</italic>-amplified cancer cell lines exhibited decreased cell proliferation/survival in response to <italic>DCUN1D1</italic> knockdown, consistent with earlier reports that <italic>DCUN1D1</italic> knockdown leads to apoptosis in cells <xref rid="pone.0098293-Sarkaria1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. <italic>DCUN1D1</italic> overexpression in cells is sufficient to induce carcinogenesis, suggesting that it may be a bona fide cancer driver gene <xref rid="pone.0098293-Sarkaria1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Further, <italic>DCUN1D1</italic> activity has been linked to regulation of <italic>GLI1</italic>, an important signaling molecule in the Hedgehog pathway. These data suggest that ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers are important regulators of oncogenesis that are amplified in the cancer genome, and further work will be necessary to evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting these enzymes for cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>MAP kinase pathway</title><p>Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are kinase modules that link extracellular signals to intracellular signaling cascades and regulate fundamental processes in oncogenesis, such as growth, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0098293-Dhillon1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Activating mutations can occur at multiple levels in the pathways to drive oncogenesis. The receptor tyrosine kinases <italic>EGFR</italic> and <italic>ERBB2</italic>, the GTPases <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>NRAS</italic>, and <italic>HRAS</italic>, and the kinase <italic>BRAF</italic> are frequently mutated in cancers and can drive tumor proliferation. Among the most important members of the family is <italic>KRAS</italic>, which is mutated in over 30% of colorectal cancers and predicts poor response to anti-EGFR therapy <xref rid="pone.0098293-The3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098293-Valtorta1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. The data here suggest that in addition to being mutated in cancers, <italic>KRAS</italic> is also amplified in ovarian, gastric, lung adenocarcinoma, and uterine cancers, with a copy number range 10&#x02013;40 in ovarian cancers. Interestingly, <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations and amplifications are largely mutually exclusive in these cancer types. <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification is currently not used as a diagnostic or clinical management marker, but its utilization may be warranted in specific cancer types. Recent studies suggest that <italic>KRAS</italic> gene amplification predicts resistance to anti-EGFR therapy and anti-Met therapy, suggesting that <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification may be a resistance mechanism to MAP kinase inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0098293-Valtorta1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098293-Cepero1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Interestingly, <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification was also found at higher frequency in endometrial cancer metastases versus primary tumors, suggesting that <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification may be a potential mechanism for metastasis formation and cancer progression <xref rid="pone.0098293-Birkeland1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Further work will be necessary to define the role of <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification in cancer metastases and in drug resistant tumors, especially in tumors that have acquired resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Other MAP kinase associated genes that were amplified in TCGA datasets include the MAP kinase adaptor genes <italic>FRS2</italic> and <italic>GRB7</italic>. <italic>GRB7</italic> and its associated receptor tyrosine kinase <italic>ERBB2</italic> were co-amplified in 15&#x02013;20% of breast and gastric cancers. In some cases, co-amplification of the adapter protein may be necessary for oncogenesis, while in other cases the amplification of the adapter protein may be an acquired resistance mechanism to anti-tyrosine kinase therapy <xref rid="pone.0098293-Walch1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098293-Nencioni1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Further work is necessary to define the utility of <italic>FRS2</italic> and <italic>GRB7</italic> amplification as clinical drug response markers.</p><p>In summary, we have carried out a genome-wide analysis of TCGA datasets to identify amplified genes with putative cancer driver activity. The analysis was based on patient tumor-derived gene copy number and mRNA expression, siRNA/shRNA gene knockdown and association with clinical parameters. We identified a number of amplified genes with a wide range of activity in oncogenesis, consistent with the various hallmarks of cancer <xref rid="pone.0098293-Hanahan1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. A number of genes are novel drug candidates for future drug development efforts, such as <italic>NSD3</italic>. Other genes may serve as potential diagnostic markers to predict drug response/resistance, such as <italic>GRB7</italic>. The TCGA efforts have advanced our understanding of cancer biology by identifying the primary genetic drivers of cancer and linking novel therapeutics to these genetic backgrounds. These advancements will help shape the future era of personalized medicine and usher in a new era of diagnosis and therapy for cancer patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0098293.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Copy number and mRNA expression values for cancer amplified genes on chromosome 1&#x02013;11.</bold> Copy number (x-axis) and mRNA expression (y-axis) are shown for each gene and the associated chromosomal location/cluster is shown at the top of each graph.
