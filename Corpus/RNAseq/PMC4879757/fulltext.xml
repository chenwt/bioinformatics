In a number of disease contexts, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), macrophage polarization influences the extent of pathogenesis, and efforts are underway to eliminate pathogenic subsets. However, previous studies have not distinguished whether the simultaneous presence of both classical and alternative activation signatures represents the admixture of differentially polarized macrophages or if they have adopted a unique state characterized by components of both classical and alternative activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We analyzed the gene expression profiles of individual monocyte-derived brain macrophages responding to TBI using single-cell RNA sequencing. RNA flow cytometry was used as another single-cell analysis technique to validate the single-cell RNA sequencing results.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The analysis of signature polarization genes by single-cell RNA sequencing revealed the presence of diverse activation states, including M(IL4), M(IL10), and M(LPS, IFN&#x003b3;). However, the expression of a given polarization marker was no more likely than at random to predict simultaneous expression or repression of markers of another polarization program within the same cell, suggesting a lack of exclusivity in macrophage polarization states in vivo in TBI. Also unexpectedly, individual TBI macrophages simultaneously expressed high levels of signature polarization genes across two or three different polarization states and in several distinct and seemingly incompatible combinations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Single-cell gene expression profiling demonstrated that monocytic macrophages in TBI are not comprised of distinctly polarized subsets but are uniquely and broadly activated. TBI macrophage activation in vivo is deeply complex, with individual cells concurrently adopting both inflammatory and reparative features with a lack of exclusivity. These data provide physiologically relevant evidence that the early macrophage response to TBI is comprised of novel activation states that are discordant with the current paradigm of macrophage polarization&#x02014;a key consideration for therapeutic modulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12974-016-0581-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Innate immunity</kwd><kwd>Macrophage</kwd><kwd>Monocyte</kwd><kwd>Traumatic brain injury</kwd><kwd>Single-cell RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>Neuroinflammation</kwd><kwd>RNA flow cytometry</kwd><kwd>Polarization</kwd><kwd>Neurotrauma</kwd><kwd>Myeloid cells</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I01 BX002690</award-id><award-id>Career Development Award-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hsieh</surname><given-names>Christine L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease</institution></funding-source><award-id>AI027763</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Charles C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK063720</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Charles C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Institute of Health</institution></funding-source><award-id>AG046282</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakamura</surname><given-names>Mary C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006260</institution-id><institution>Rheumatology Research Foundation </institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Russell/Engleman Rheumatology Research Center</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Immune responses are heterogeneous and comprised of a combination of antimicrobial, tissue reparative, and regulatory functions. In certain contexts, some of these processes are pathogenic; in particular, inflammation is associated with worse outcomes in diseases ranging from cardiovascular disease to neurodegeneration. In traumatic brain injury (TBI), which accounts for 30&#x000a0;% of deaths related to injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and impacts an estimated 2&#x000a0;% of the US population who live with persistent disabilities resulting from TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], neuroinflammation has been recognized as a pathogenic factor and has garnered significant attention as a potential target for therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Neuroinflammation develops within hours after TBI and can persist for months to years. Delivering early interventions during the first hours to days following injury may be critical for restraining lesion expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, therapeutic amelioration of neuroinflammation is complicated by the fact that it is dynamic, multifaceted, and also critical for wound repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For example, it was shown that inhibition of CCR2 during TBI can limit lesion size; however, the same receptor is also responsible for the protection from tau pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As such, identification of the precise molecular pathways and cellular subsets that impact pathology and/or cognitive recovery following TBI could lead to therapies that directly antagonize harmful mechanisms while preserving, or even enriching, beneficial mechanisms.</p><p>Monocyte-derived macrophages (hereafter referred to as &#x0201c;macrophages&#x0201d;) are early responders to infection and tissue injury. Macrophages can be activated to express a variety of divergent functional programs&#x02014;a process known as &#x0201c;polarization&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that with specific stimuli, human and mouse macrophages can polarize towards functionally divergent subsets, each possessing a distinct phenotype and gene expression profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Macrophage polarization and its importance for health are established in host defense, metabolism, and thermogenesis, and for pathology in obesity, cancer, allergy, and atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Historically, macrophages have been classified as classical (M1) macrophages, which promote inflammation, or as alternatively activated (M2) macrophages, which restrict inflammation and foster wound repair. The M1/M2 concept has evolved to better account for the complexity of states; as such, it has been suggested that the polarization state of activated macrophages be designated by the prototypical stimulus that can produce the state in vitro&#x02014;specifically, the proposed classes include M(lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN&#x003b3;)), M(IL4), M(immunocomplex (Ic)), M(IL10), and M(glucocorticoid (GC), transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF&#x003b2;)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, in contrast to the in vitro-derived classifications of macrophage programs, in vivo and combinatorial stimulation studies suggest that macrophages can differentiate along a spectrum of phenotypes and also exhibit plasticity in shifting from one phenotype to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, although the definition of in vitro polarization states continues to advance, our understanding of in vivo polarization remains understudied.</p><p>Studies of macrophage polarization following TBI, including one of our own, suggest that macrophages exhibit heterogeneous expression of both inflammatory M1 and wound healing M2 markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. To date, studies of macrophage activation following TBI have averaged the response by whole tissue or by bulk populations of leukocytes or macrophages. It is therefore unclear whether co-expression of M1 and M2 markers represents an admixture of differentially polarized macrophages (in the cases of whole tissue or bulk leukocyte analysis, gene expression could also be an average of microglia, macrophages, neutrophils, and other cells) or a more homogeneous, but uniquely polarized, state of macrophages. To distinguish between the above possibilities, we used RNA sequencing (RNAseq) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and RNA flow cytometry to analyze the polarization state of individual ipsilateral monocyte-derived brain macrophages 1&#x000a0;day after experimental injury. The 1-day time point was selected to understand early macrophage activation states at a time at which an immunomodulatory intervention could be delivered to minimize and/or alter the ensuing inflammatory response and associated damage. Within the TBI macrophage population, we detected gene expression signatures of M(IL4), M(LPS, IFN&#x003b3;), and M(IL10) polarization; however, within individual TBI macrophages, expression of signature markers, even the highest expression of signature genes, from distinct classes commonly co-occurred within the same cell. Moreover, the expression of a given class marker was no more likely than at random to predict expression or repression of markers of another class, suggesting a lack of exclusivity in macrophage activation states. Our findings highlight the complex nature of macrophage polarization in vivo and the utility of high dimensionality, single-cell assays for its interrogation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p>Twelve- to sixteen-week-old male C57BL/6 cage mate mice (Jackson Laboratories, Sacramento, CA) were housed at the San Francisco VA Medical Center. Controlled cortical impact (CCI) or sham surgery was performed as approved by the VA Animal Care Committee. Animals were anesthetized with 3&#x000a0;% isoflurane with oxygen and were administered bupivacaine s.c. above the skull. The scalp was incised. A 2-mm circular craniectomy with center coordinates of 1.5&#x000a0;mm lateral and 2.3&#x000a0;mm posterior to the bregma point was performed. Care was taken to not breach the dura by not drilling completely through the skull. No animals in this study showed signs of excessive bleeding or dural breach from the craniectomy procedure. TBI was induced by a sterile, pneumatic, circular, flat-tipped piston with impact parameters of 3&#x000a0;m/s velocity, 150&#x000a0;ms dwell time, and 1.5&#x000a0;mm depth (Amscien Instruments, Richmond, VA, with extensive modifications by H&#x00026;R Machine, Capay, CA). These CCI parameters led to bleeding, and pressure was gently applied with a cotton swab until bleeding had halted, and the skin was stapled shut.

To elucidate whether the mixed polarization of macrophages detected in TBI was due to the presence of a mixture of polarized subsets and/or whether novel states of macrophage activation existed, we employed two powerful assays for elucidating transcript levels at the resolution of single cells: single-cell RNAseq and RNA flow cytometry. Using these approaches, we showed that TBI macrophages not only express several signature genes of distinct polarization states (i.e., M(IL4), M(LPS, IFN&#x003b3;) and M(IL10)) but that signatures from distinct states are often expressed in combination with one another simultaneously in a single cell. Although demonstrating the functional relevance of these states will require further study, protein analysis by histology reported by others showed expression of Il1b and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) segregated and colocalized in macrophages in ischemic brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; in TBI, histological protein analysis revealed Arg1<sup>+</sup>iNOS<sup><italic>+</italic></sup> microglia/macrophages in the brain tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] as well as CD36 and MARCO co-expression on microglia/macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Future efforts should more deeply profile protein expression with a larger number of parameters and use perturbational approaches to determine the associated cellular functions of these understudied leukocyte subsets. Our data extend earlier work to demonstrate that TBI macrophages exhibit expression of signature genes from two or more polarization states in a broad range of unexpected gene combinations. Further, these findings provide evidence that the mixed macrophage response to TBI is an unusual activation state rather than admixture of differentially polarized macrophages. Importantly, our data highlight the complex nature of macrophage activation in vivo that is inadequately described by current nomenclature based on in vitro studies.</p><p>In fact, we did not detect any TBI macrophages that were distinctly polarized to a single state; all macrophages exhibited expression of markers associated with two or more known polarization states. Given that macrophages are known to have some limited plasticity to transition from one polarization state to another, we considered that TBI macrophages could be expressing mixed polarization markers due to being in a state of transition. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that TBI macrophages at this time point are transitioning to distinct polarization states, one would expect an assay of single cells to reveal a distribution of cells more strongly polarized to one or another state, with lower mean levels of gene expression of the associated genes during the transition. We did not observe this to be the case; many cells with the highest expression levels of a signature of one polarization state also exhibited the highest expression levels for a distinct polarization state. The determination of gene expression profiles at downstream time points is needed to better elucidate the full repertoire and dynamics of macrophage activation states over the course of TBI. Further studies to investigate and compare the pathways of activation for the tissue-resident macrophages in the brain, the microglia, may shed light on how cellular origin affects function and how to more precisely target therapeutics.</p><p>The above findings have important clinical implications. Several chemotaxis and complement-associated genes were expressed by all TBI macrophages, including <italic>Ccr2</italic>. These may be potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers. In fact, studies have identified <italic>Ccr2</italic> as a potential target to improve the functional outcomes of TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that individual <italic>Ccr2</italic>-dependent TBI macrophages are activated to become multi-dimensional, but that their net influence is debilitating. Most notably, our findings indicate that the same macrophages responsible for pathological neuroinflammation also express genes that promote immunoregulation and wound healing. By extension, it may be beneficial to focus therapeutic efforts on modulating myeloid cell activation rather than depleting these cells or completely blocking their infiltration. However, our studies show that efforts to shape TBI macrophages must address the challenge that the target cells are already broadly activated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health problem with no known effective pharmacological therapy. Primary goals of therapy are to preserve brain tissue and to promote wound healing, which might be possible through modulation of the neuroinflammatory response. Using single-cell gene expression methods, we show that monocyte-derived macrophages, a major population of innate immune cells responding to acute TBI, are not comprised of distinctly polarized pro-inflammatory or pro-reparative subsets. Instead, there is a deep complexity to acute TBI macrophage activation in vivo, with cells adopting unique activation states and concurrently adopting features associated with both inflammation and wound healing, thus shifting the paradigm of in vivo macrophage polarization. These data reveal important considerations for therapeutic approaches that aim to alter inflammation in vivo and shape macrophage activation.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>All animal studies were performed under a protocol approved by the San Francisco VA Medical Center Animal Care Committee.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Consent for publication</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The RNA sequencing data has been submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository and can be accessed through the following link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79510">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE79510</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec20"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12974_2016_581_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Figure S1.</label><caption><p>Quality of RNA sequencing data.
