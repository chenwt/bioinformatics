Repressor regulation is critical to the outcome of infection&#x02014;lysogenic or lytic growth&#x02014;as well as prophage induction into lytic replication. Mycobacteriophage BPs and its relatives use an unusual integration-dependent immunity system in which the phage attachment site (<italic>attP</italic>) is located within the repressor gene (<italic>33</italic>) such that site-specific integration leads to synthesis of a prophage-encoded product (gp33<sup>103</sup>) that is 33 residues shorter at its C-terminus than the virally-encoded protein (gp33<sup>136</sup>). However, the shorter form of the repressor (gp33<sup>103</sup>) is stable and active in repression of the early lytic promoter P<sub>R</sub>, whereas the longer virally-encoded form (gp33<sup>136</sup>) is inactive due to targeted degradation <italic>via</italic> a C-terminal ssrA-like tag. We show here that both forms of the repressor bind similarly to the <italic>33</italic>&#x02013;<italic>34</italic> intergenic regulatory region, and that BPs gp33<sup>103</sup> is a tetramer in solution. The BPs gp33<sup>103</sup> repressor binds to five regulatory regions spanning the BPs genome, and regulates four promoters including the early lytic promoter, P<sub>R</sub>. BPs gp33<sup>103</sup> has a complex pattern of DNA recognition in which a full operator binding site contains two half sites separated by a variable spacer, and BPs gp33<sup>103</sup> induces a DNA bend at the full operator site but not a half site. The operator site structure is unusual in that one half site corresponds to a 12 bp palindrome identified previously, but the other half site is a highly variable variant of the palindrome.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by NIH GM093901.

In the well-studied example of phage lambda, lysogenic maintenance is achieved by expression of a repressor (cI) that binds to tripartite operators (O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>R</sub>) at the early lytic promoters P<sub>L</sub> and P<sub>R</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Lambda cI autoregulates its synthesis by activation of its own transcription from the promoter for lysogenic maintenance (P<sub>RM</sub>) at moderate cI concentrations, and represses it when the cI concentration is high. During infection, establishment of lambda lysogeny occurs by expression of cI from the promoter for lysogenic establishment (P<sub>RE</sub>), which is independent of cI, but requires the activator, cII [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The decision as to the outcome of infection is determined by the overall level of cII, which is subject to degradation by host proteases including FtsH, and is modulated by lambda cIII protein [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Lambda cI binds as a dimer and can form DNA loops when bound at both O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>R</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The temperate life style is common among bacteriophages, although the genetic diversity of the phage population is considerable [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Repressors have been identified in many phage genomes, although relatively few have been genetically and biochemically characterized [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The organization of two divergently transcribed DNA-binding proteins&#x02014;typified by the <italic>cI</italic> and <italic>cro</italic> genes in lambda&#x02014;separated by a control region is common but not universal. For example, the repressor of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> phage &#x003d5;C31 is located downstream of the virion structural genes and is similarly transcribed rightwards [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137187.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and in mycobacteriophage L5 (and its relatives) the repressor is located within the right arm of the genome and transcribed leftwards along with other right arm genes [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137187.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These two systems are also unusual in that the phage genomes contain multiple (18&#x02013;30) repressor binding sites dispersed across the genomes, and the &#x003d5;C31 system is further complicated by the expression of three isoforms of the repressor [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The L5 repressor binds as a monomer at the asymmetric non-operator binding sites (referred to as &#x02018;stoperators&#x02019;) to block transcription elongation [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. There are few examples other than phage lambda and its relatives where the molecular basis of the decision between lytic and lysogenic outcomes is well understood [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137187.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Comparative genomic analysis of a large number of completely sequenced mycobacteriophages shows them to be highly diverse, and they can be grouped into &#x02018;clusters&#x02019; according to their nucleotide and gene content relationships [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137187.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A substantial portion of these phages (~40%), including L5, are grouped in Cluster A, and share the unusual stoperator system of immunity [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137187.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

In these systems the repressor and integrase genes (BPs <italic>32</italic> and <italic>33</italic> respectively) are transcribed leftwards, but the phage attachment site (<italic>attP</italic>) is oddly located within the repressor open reading frame (see <xref rid="pone.0137187.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). As a consequence, chromosomal integration in lysogenic establishment results in separation of the 3&#x02019; end of the repressor gene and expression of a truncated version of the repressor. However, it is this short form of the repressor (e.g. BPs gp33<sup>103</sup>) that is active in conferring immunity, whereas the virally-encoded longer form (e.g. BPs gp33<sup>136</sup>) is not. Inactivation of the virally-encoded form expressed during lytic growth occurs as a result of proteolytic degradation targeted at an ssrA-like tag at the extreme C-terminus [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Proteolysis of the virally-encoded form is a direct determinant of lysogenization frequency, as a mutant expressing a stabilized form of BPs gp33<sup>136</sup> establishes lysogeny at a considerably higher frequency than wild-type BPs. However, lysogenization frequency is also determined by the frequency of integration, and the integrase protein also contains a C-terminal signal for proteolysis [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0137187.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0137187.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>The BPs Immunity Cassette.</title><p>(A) Phage BPs has three genes involved in the lytic/lysogenic growth decision; <italic>gene 32</italic> encodes an integrase (gp32), <italic>gene 33</italic> encodes the repressor (gp33), and <italic>gene 34</italic> encodes a putative Cro-like protein (gp34).

This prophage form of the repressor (gp33<sup>103</sup>) is 33 residues shorter, is stably expressed, and is required to maintain lysogeny.

The gp33<sup>103</sup> active form of the repressor was shown previously to bind to a DNA substrate that includes a 12 bp palindromic sequence, which was presumed to be the operator (O<sub>R</sub>) regulating transcription from the early lytic promoter, P<sub>R</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This was supported by the mapping of two point mutations within this 12 bp sequence (<monospace>5&#x02019;-CGACATATGTCG</monospace>) that give rise to a repressor-insensitive phage phenotype (i.e. they can form plaques on a repressor-expressing strain) [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the requirements for DNA binding at O<sub>R</sub> and at related sequences elsewhere in the phage genome and the nature of the protein-DNA interactions are not understood. Here we show that the two forms of the repressor bind similarly to DNA, that the short active form of the repressor is a tetramer in solution, and that the previously reported 12 bp operator sequence represents one half of a full binding site.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>gp33<sup>136</sup> and gp33<sup>103</sup> bind similarly to BPs <italic>33&#x02013;34</italic> intergenic DNA</title><p>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) show that gp33<sup>103</sup> binds to DNA substrates containing the <italic>33</italic>&#x02013;<italic>34</italic> intergenic control region to form several distinct complexes as protein concentration increases (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>).

The C-terminal extension includes the ssrA tag that targets the protein for proteolysis, and stabilization of the protein by an A135E substitution gives higher levels of lysogeny. However, we noted previously that the gp33<sup>136</sup> A135E mutant appears to give a modest increase in activity of the P<sub>rep</sub> promoter in a reporter fusion assay [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], perhaps providing transcriptional activation that is dependent on the C-terminal 33 residues. We therefore compared the binding profiles of gp33<sup>103</sup> and gp33<sup>136</sup> for any differences in binding to the <italic>33</italic>&#x02013;<italic>34</italic> intergenic region that contains both P<sub>rep</sub> and P<sub>R</sub> (Figs <xref rid="pone.0137187.g001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0137187.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Both proteins give similar profiles and the additional 33 C-terminal residues in gp33<sup>136</sup> do not appear to substantially influence DNA binding. It is likely that any functional activation of P<sub>rep</sub> results from protein-protein interactions, perhaps reflecting direct contacts between BPs gp33<sup>136</sup> and RNA Polymerase.</p><p>The 185 bp DNA segment contains only a single copy of the 12 bp sequence <monospace>5&#x02019;-CGACATATGTCG</monospace> that was previously predicted to be recognized by gp33<sup>103</sup>, and yet the complexes formed are more varied than would be expected for a single protein-DNA interaction. Presumably, the protein binds to additional sites within this region, binds with varying protein-DNA stoichiometries, or imposes significant DNA distortions. We note that there is a related sequence (<monospace>5&#x02019;-CGACATACCGGC</monospace>) at the left end (<italic>33</italic>-proximal) of the intergenic region that overlaps the P<sub>rep</sub> transcription start site (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), although the similarity is restricted to the left half of the sequence motif. We therefore sought to dissect the various determinants of gp33<sup>103</sup> binding to this region, and to compare this to the binding of gp33<sup>103</sup> to the other sites located elsewhere in the BPs genome.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Solution multimeric state of BPs gp33<sup>103</sup></title><p>First, we determined the oligomeric state of gp33<sup>103</sup> in solution.

The monomeric mass of gp33<sup>103</sup> is 11.2 kDa, and the simple interpretation is that the major peak corresponds to a gp33<sup>103</sup> tetramer, although we cannot rule out the possibility that it is an alternative multimer shaped to give altered elution in the chromatography.

Putative promoter elements containing -10 and -35 hexameric motifs are predicted for P<sub>6</sub>, P<sub>55</sub>, and P<sub>61</sub>, but not confidently for the weaker P<sub>27</sub> (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). The promoter-reporter plasmids were also transformed into a BPs lysogen and the promoter activities determined (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). The P<sub>6</sub>, P<sub>27</sub>, and P<sub>55</sub> promoters are clearly down regulated in a lysogen, presumably by gp33<sup>103</sup> [few other phage-encoded proteins are expressed in a lysogen as indicated by RNAseq (LMO and GFH, unpublished observations)] as for the P<sub>R</sub> control [<xref rid="pone.0137187.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>, [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]]. No regulation for either P<sub>rep</sub> or P<sub>61</sub> was observed (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>).</p><p>Using native gel electrophoresis, gp33<sup>103</sup> was shown to bind to all four substrates (O<sub>6</sub>, O<sub>27</sub>, O<sub>55</sub> and O<sub>61</sub>) to generate a single prominent complex and a minor complex with intermediate mobility, with the exception of O<sub>6</sub> and O<sub>55</sub> for which additional complexes were observed (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D, 7G, 7J and 7M</xref>). Presumably, the relative simplicity of the binding patterns compared with the <italic>33&#x02013;34</italic> DNA is because of the lack of additional sites equivalent to O<sub>Rep</sub>. The overall affinities are similar to gp33<sup>103</sup> binding to the <italic>33</italic>&#x02013;<italic>34</italic> intergenic region (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137187.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), although binding is about 3-4-fold tighter to O<sub>27</sub>. To dissect out the contribution of the separate potential half sites, substrates were generated in which one half site was specifically ablated so as to leave just the 12 bp palindrome (O<sub>6-L</sub>, O<sub>27-R</sub>, O<sub>55-L</sub>, and for O<sub>61</sub>, O<sub>61-R</sub>, <xref rid="pone.0137187.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>), and tested for gp33<sup>103</sup> binding (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E, 7H, 7K and 7N</xref>). BPs gp33<sup>103</sup> binds to each of these to form a single complex, but with substantially reduced affinity (<xref rid="pone.0137187.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We then inserted the other half sites (O<sub>6-R</sub>, O<sub>27-L</sub>, O<sub>55-R</sub>, O<sub>61-L</sub>) individually into a common sequence context (<xref rid="pone.0137187.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) and tested gp33<sup>103</sup> binding (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F, 7I, 7L and 7O</xref>). All of these were bound only very weakly, although complexes were detected with the O<sub>27-L</sub> substrate (Figs <xref rid="pone.0137187.g006" ref-type="fig">6B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0137187.g007" ref-type="fig">7I</xref>). These binding data suggest that gp33<sup>103</sup> binds to DNA containing two half sites, presumably as a tetramer, and the reduced mobility of the complexes formed by gp33<sup>103</sup> and each full site is slower than for complexes with individual half sites. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that these complexes have different protein-DNA stoichiometries, it is plausible that these differences reflect a protein-induced bend when the full site is bound, as seen at O<sub>R</sub>.</p><fig id="pone.0137187.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0137187.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>BPs gp33<sup>103</sup> binding to full and partial operator sites.</title><p>Binding of gp33<sup>103</sup> to each of the intergenic regions where full and partial sites are found (see <xref rid="pone.0137187.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0137187.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137187.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) are shown in gels A, D, G, J, and M.

Although the affinities for the three substrates are similar, there is suggestion of cooperative binding to two adjacent sites, as no complex corresponding to single site occupancy is present.

The repressor is non-canonical in that it is encoded in two forms, a virally-encoded product 136-residues long (gp33<sup>136</sup>), and prophage-encoded version (gp33<sup>103</sup>) that is 33 residues shorter as a consequence of integrative recombination at the <italic>attP</italic> site situated within the gene <italic>33</italic> open reading frame. The two proteins bind similarly to a DNA substrate containing the regulatory region between genes <italic>33</italic> and <italic>34</italic>, but the binding pattern is complex with multiple protein-DNA complexes observed (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The binding affinity is surprisingly weak relative to other phage repressors, although the gp33<sup>103</sup> and gp33<sup>136</sup> binding affinities are similar to each other, and other preparations have similar affinities. The gp33 preparations retain five non-native residues at the N-terminus that we have not been able to remove without encountering insolubility, and these could influence the binding affinity. However, we also note that BPs lysogens have high levels of spontaneous lytic induction, which could reflect relatively weak binding of the repressor <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>BPs gp33<sup>103</sup> binds to a total of five loci within the BPs genome and three promoters (P<sub>6</sub>, P<sub>27</sub>, and P<sub>55</sub>) in addition to P<sub>R</sub>. Alignment of the six putative DNA binding sites (O<sub>6</sub>, O<sub>27</sub>, O<sub>Rep</sub>, O<sub>R</sub>, O<sub>55</sub>, and O<sub>61</sub>) shows the juxtaposition of the half sites within each operator (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A</xref>). In three of the sites (O<sub>6</sub>, O<sub>27</sub>, and O<sub>55</sub>), one half site contains the 12 bp palindrome (O<sub>6-L</sub>, O<sub>27-R</sub>, and O<sub>55-L</sub>) and is easily recognizable, and the other half sites (O<sub>6-R</sub>, O<sub>27-L</sub>, and O<sub>55-R</sub>) contain sequence departures at two or three positions (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A</xref>). At O<sub>61</sub>, both half sites have sequence departures from the consensus (two in O<sub>61-R</sub> and and four in O<sub>61-L</sub>) although gp33<sup>103</sup> binds with similar affinity as it does to O<sub>6</sub> and O<sub>55</sub> (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). O<sub>R</sub> is peculiar in that it contains the easily recognizable O<sub>R-R</sub>, but the other half site is only distantly related, although gp33<sup>103</sup> clearly binds to it, even in the absence of O<sub>R-R</sub> (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). We propose the sequence <monospace>5&#x02019;-GCGCATTTTCCA</monospace> for O<sub>R-L</sub> which has only five bases of the 12 bp palindrome (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A</xref>). However, this is spaced five bases away from O<sub>R-R</sub>, which is similar to the geometries of O<sub>6</sub>, O<sub>27</sub>, and O<sub>61</sub> and which appears to permit cooperative binding (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). We also note that position eight of this proposed O<sub>R-L</sub> is part of the P<sub>R</sub> -35 motif, and substitution with a G base both increases promoter activity, but also reduces the efficiency of repression [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], consistent with the role of O<sub>R-L</sub> in binding and regulation. The sequences of the O<sub>Rep</sub> half sites are the most divergent, and the best alignment suggests that O<sub>Rep-L</sub> and O<sub>Rep-R</sub> have eight and seven positions conserved respectively, spaced eight bases apart with a geometry similar to that of O<sub>55</sub>. DNase I footprinting is consistent with binding to these sites, and complexes are observed with the small substrate tested that contains the complete sequence (Mt10, <xref rid="pone.0137187.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). At least at higher protein concentrations, binding of gp33<sup>103</sup> to the <italic>33&#x02013;34</italic> intergenic regions is expected to involve occupancy of both O<sub>R</sub> and O<sub>Rep</sub>. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that gp33<sup>103</sup> forms a DNA loop by simultaneous occupancy of O<sub>R</sub> and O<sub>Rep</sub>, the 113 bp O<sub>R</sub>-O<sub>Rep</sub> intersite spacing is substantially below the persistence length of DNA, and DNA looping would likely require either phased A/T tracts to promote DNA bending or an accessory DNA bending protein such as HU.</p><fig id="pone.0137187.g010" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0137187.g010</object-id><label>Fig 10</label><caption><title>Site alignments and models of BPs gp33<sup>103</sup> binding.</title><p>(A) Alignment of all operators found in the BPs genome.

The previously identified 12 bp palindromic sequence <monospace>5&#x02019;-CGACATATGTCG</monospace> is typically associated with a related sequence spaced 5&#x02013;8 bp away, and surprisingly even though the O<sub>R-L</sub> site is a highly redundant version with only five of the 12 positions conserved (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A</xref>), there is good evidence that gp33<sup>103</sup> binds to it, even when O<sub>R-R</sub> is removed (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). One set of models includes binding of two protomers to each of the 12 bp sequences within an overall site (e.g. O<sub>R</sub> or O<sub>27</sub>) (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10B&#x02013;10E</xref>) with the stoichiometry reflecting either a dimer bound to each 12 bp half-site (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10B and 10C</xref>), or a tetramer bound to each 12 bp half site (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10D and 10E</xref>). The DNA could be relatively straight (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10B and 10D</xref>), or could include a modest DNA distortion (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10C and 10E</xref>), although we favor the bent DNA models (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10C and 10E</xref>) both because of the observed bends seen in <xref rid="pone.0137187.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> and the DNase I enhancement observed at the centers of both O<sub>R-L</sub> and O<sub>R-R</sub> (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). A second set of models proposes that a single protomer recognizes each 12 bp motif (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10F&#x02013;10I</xref>), with corresponding stoichiometries and bending considerations (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10F&#x02013;10I</xref>) as described for the two-protomer models (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10B&#x02013;10E</xref>). Although 12bp is a somewhat larger segment of DNA than usually recognized by a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif, it is not unprecedented, and we note that a protomer of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase recognizes a similarly-sized half site with contacts spanning both major and a minor grooves of the DNA [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137187.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The palindromic nature of many of the 12 bp half sites supports two-protomer/half-site models, although we note that the symmetry with the 12 bp sequences is not conserved in all sites.</p><p>There is evidence of cooperativity in the occupancy of two 12 bp half sites, but spacing between the sites plays an important role. Cooperative binding appears to be supported by a 5 bp inter-site spacing (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>) as in O<sub>R</sub>, but could occur between single protomers, dimers, or tetramers bound at each half site (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>). However, investment of binding energy into DNA bending and the DNase I hypersensitivity seen within O<sub>R</sub> and O<sub>Rep</sub> supports models that include an inter-site bend (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10C, 10E, 10G, and 10I</xref>). We note that although models in which a protein dimer (as in <xref rid="pone.0137187.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10G</xref>) binds to two differently spaced half sites (e.g. 5 and 8 bp) is somewhat unusual, it is observed in the binding of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase, where the two half sites within each of three binding sites are separated by 4, 10, and 1 bp respectively [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Despite the complexity of the binding profile of gp33<sup>103</sup> to the <italic>33&#x02013;34</italic> intergenic region, formation of properly configured complexes is necessary for normal repression in a lysogen.

Loss of normal repression does not closely correlate with large changes in binding affinity, and it is likely that relatively subtle sequence changes give rise to altered configurations that interfere with repression. This notwithstanding, some DNA substrates of the repressor-insensitive mutants have binding patterns that are more consistent with binding of monomers or dimers (e.g. 127b, <xref rid="pone.0137187.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B</xref>), and it is unclear what determines this behavior.</p><p>The system of integration-dependent immunity seen in BPs and other phages offers a quite different perspective on phage life style decision making than seen in phage lambda and its relatives, and may represent an ancestral state for temperate phages [<xref rid="pone.0137187.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is perhaps not surprising that the repressor has non-canonical binding properties including tetramerization and binding to dispersed sites in the phage genome (<xref rid="pone.0137187.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>). Because the repressor can be expressed in two forms that differ in their C-termini, this raises the possibility that the virally-encoded product gp33<sup>136</sup> forms mixed tetramers with the shorter protein (gp33<sup>103</sup>) and influences functionality even if not binding <italic>per se</italic>. Thus the observed tetramerization and DNA binding profiles may play roles in modulating the overall genetic switch in these phages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec014"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec015"><title>Expression and Purification of gp33<sup>103</sup> and gp33<sup>136</sup></title><p>The gp33<sup>103</sup> and gp33<sup>136</sup> genes were PCR amplified from a BPs lysate using primers <monospace>5&#x02019;-CAA TCG CCC ATA TGT CGC AAG CAT TCG -3&#x02019;</monospace> / <monospace>5&#x02019;- GAC TAC AAG CTT TCA GAA GGT TGG GGG TTC GA 3&#x02019;</monospace>and <monospace>5&#x02019;-CAA TCG CCC ATA TGT CGC AAG CAT TCG -3&#x02019;</monospace>/ <monospace>5&#x02019;- TGC CGG AAG AAG CTT TCA CGA CGC TTT ATC C -3&#x02019;</monospace> respectively, which amplified the genes with NdeI recognition sites at the 5&#x02019; end of the gene and HindIII recognition sites at the 3&#x02019; end.
