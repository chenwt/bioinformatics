Immune cell activation by IFN-&#x003b3; is entirely dependent on its activation of the transcription factor STAT1, which binds to and activates transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Direct and rapid activation of ISGs plays a key role in IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated functions<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. It has become clear that many IFN-&#x003b3; activities can not be explained by the direct effector functions of ISGs, and that important IFN-&#x003b3; functions are mediated by crossregulation of distinct signaling pathways or reprogramming of cell states to alter their responses to extracellular stimuli<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.

Selective translational regulation of mRNA transcripts typically occurs at the level of initiation and can be achieved by specific RNA-binding proteins, microRNAs, and by modulation of the activity of 5&#x02019; cap-binding eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Although eIF4E is a general translation initiation factor, changes in its activity do not globally regulate translation but instead selectively affect translation of a subset of transcripts, including inefficiently translated transcripts with long 5&#x02019; untranslated regions (UTRs)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. eIF4E activity is regulated by MNK kinases and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, and thus is responsive to upstream signals that activate MAPK signaling or mTORC1 activity.

To maximize physiological relevance for human inflammatory conditions, we used primary human monocytes and macrophages that play a key role in human inflammatory diseases. We found that IFN-&#x003b3; regulates TLR2 responses in human macrophages by suppressing MNKs and mTORC1 and modulating mRNA translation. A genome-wide ribosome profiling approach revealed that translational regulation selectively affected pathways important for cytokine expression, protein synthesis and cell metabolism.

We tested whether IFN-&#x003b3; could also repress induction of <italic>HES1</italic> mRNA by TLR2 in primary human macrophages. Stimulation with the TLR2 ligand Pam3CSK4 resulted in <italic>HES1</italic> mRNA expression within 1 h, and its abundance increased in a time-dependent manner (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref></bold>). In contrast to 10-fold repression of TLR4 (lipolysacharride, LPS)-induced <italic>HES1</italic> mRNA by IFN-&#x003b3; (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref></bold>), TLR2-induced <italic>HES1</italic> transcript amounts were minimally suppressed by IFN-&#x003b3; (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref></bold>). This observation was consistent among more than 20 human blood donors tested, and no statistically significant difference was apparent when we pooled data from 23 different donors (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref></bold>). In striking contrast to mRNA regulation, TLR2-induced HES1 protein expression was almost completely abrogated by IFN-&#x003b3; (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref></bold>; HES1 was suppressed by 85.5% in 6 independent experiments, p &#x0003c;0.0001). The inhibitory effect of IFN-&#x003b3; on TLR2-induced HES1 protein expression became apparent with 4 h of IFN-&#x003b3; pre-treatment and was clearly established after 6 h of priming (data not shown), which is consistent with previous studies of IFN-&#x003b3; priming<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The prominent discrepancy between HES1 mRNA and protein expression suggests that IFN-&#x003b3; negatively regulates HES1 expression at the protein level.</p><p id="P7">IFN-&#x003b3; could downregulate HES1 protein either by suppressing its synthesis or increasing its degradation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we first monitored HES1 protein half life in control and IFN-&#x003b3;-treated macrophages, and found that HES1 protein decay rates were comparable in both conditions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref></bold>). We also found that neither the proteasome inhibitor MG132 nor autophagosome-lysosome fusion inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 reversed the downregulation of HES1 protein amounts by IFN-&#x003b3; (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d-e</xref></bold>), implying that accelerated protein degradation was not responsible for the reduced HES1 protein abundance in IFN-&#x003b3;-treated cells. This suggested that IFN-&#x003b3; suppressed translation of HES1 mRNA. We directly tested this hypothesis by performing sucrose gradient centrifugation to track the ribosomal distribution of mRNAs in cytosolic extracts from control and IFN-&#x003b3;-treated macrophages. The frequency of ribosome binding to an mRNA corresponds to the translation efficiency of each mRNA molecule, and actively translated mRNAs are found in the polysome fractions. IFN-&#x003b3; had no effect on total mRNA amounts associated with heavy polysome fractions 9-12 and a minimal suppressive effect on light polysome fractions 6-8, indicating that IFN-&#x003b3; did not globally and nonspecifically suppress translation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>). However, IFN-&#x003b3; slightly reduced monomeric 80S ribosomes (fraction 5) and correspondingly increased mRNA amounts associated with individual ribosome 40S and 60S subunits (fractions 3 and 4) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>), implying that IFN-&#x003b3; might suppress translation initiation, which is associated with 80S ribosome assembly, of select mRNA transcripts.</p><p id="P8">A shift in individual mRNAs from heavy polysome to light polysome or monosome fractions indicates decreased translation efficiency. Polysome shift analysis of mRNAs encoded by specific genes showed that in control TLR2-stimulated macrophages a substantial fraction of HES1 mRNA resided in heavy polysome fractions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>, top panel, fractions 10-12), indicating efficient translation. In IFN-&#x003b3;-treated cells the HES1 mRNA peak shifted to light polysome fractions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>, top panel, fractions 6-8), indicating decreased translational efficiency. As a positive control for the polysome shift analysis, we found that mRNA encoded by <italic>PABPC1</italic>, which is known to be sensitive to translational regulation, was strongly shifted to the light polysome and monosome fractions in IFN-&#x003b3;-treated macrophages (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>, middle panel). Accordingly, IFN-&#x003b3; suppressed PABPC1 protein amounts without affecting mRNA levels (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref></bold>, representative data; PABPC1 was suppressed by 68.75% in pooled data from 4 independent experiments, p = 0.01). As a specificity control, we found that <italic>ACTB</italic> mRNA was present in the heavy polysome fractions, and thus actively translated, regardless of IFN-&#x003b3; treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>, bottom panel). Collectively, the results demonstrate that IFN-&#x003b3; exerts selective effects on translation efficiency of distinct mRNAs, and that IFN-&#x003b3; inhibits translation of PABPC1 and HES1 mRNA in primary human macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>IFN-&#x003b3; attenuates TLR2-induced MAPK-MNK-eIF4E signaling</title><p id="P9">We wished to test whether IFN-&#x003b3; inhibits translation by targeting the key regulator of translation initiation efficiency eIF4E, which is activated following phosphorylation by mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) interacting kinases (MNKs)<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref></bold>). TLR2 stimulation induced activating phosphorylation of MNK1 and eIF4E, which was substantially but not completely inhibited by IFN-&#x003b3; at all time points tested (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>) (p-eIF4E was suppressed by 69% in 6 independent experiments, p = 0.0009; p-MNK1 by 66% in 3 independent experiments, p = 0.02). These results show that IFN-&#x003b3; negatively regulates activation of TLR2-induced MNK-eIF4E signaling; the functional importance of this suppression was supported by IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated suppression of translation of the signaling inhibitor I-&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and the transcription factor IRF8, which was previously shown to be dependent on the MNK-eIF4E pathway<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b-d</xref></bold>). These results suggest that MNKs play a role in promoting translation of HES1. We tested this notion by inhibiting MNKs or knocking down their expression using siRNAs and measuring HES1 expression by immunoblot. The MNK inhibitor CGP57380 strongly suppressed HES1 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>) without affecting HES1 mRNA induction (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). Furthermore siRNA-mediated knockdown of MNKs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref></bold>) resulted in diminished phosphorylation of eIF4E and decreased expression of HES1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref></bold>) without decreasing HES1 mRNA expression (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref></bold>). These data indicate that efficient HES1 translation requires MNK-mediated phosphorlyation of eIF4E. To gain insight into how IFN-&#x003b3; suppresses TLR2-induced MNK phosphorylation, we examined upstream MAPK activation. IFN-&#x003b3; attenuated TLR2-induced phosphorylation of p38 and ERK MAPKs in primary human macrophages (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref></bold>), which is consistent with our previous results<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. These MAPKs are dephosphorylated and inactivated by dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs); accordingly IFN-&#x003b3; increased baseline and TLR2-induced expression of DUSP 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref></bold>). A role for phosphatases in attenuation of MAPK signaling was further supported by reversal of IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated dampening of p38 activation by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2g</xref></bold>). Taken together, our results suggest that optimal translation of HES1 mRNA requires phosphorylation of 5&#x02019; mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E, and that IFN-&#x003b3; suppresses HES1 translation in part by attenuating TLR2-induced activation of MAPK-MNK-eIF4E signaling.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>IFN-&#x003b3; suppresses mTORC1 activation and downstream function</title><p id="P10">Given the partial attenuation of MNK activation by IFN-&#x003b3;, but near-complete suppression of HES1, we hypothesized an involvement of additional signaling pathways in the process. A major positive regulator of translation is the mTORC1 complex, which phosphorylates eIF4E binding proteins (4E-BPs) to release them from eIF4E and thereby promote translation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref></bold>). Therefore, we tested whether IFN-&#x003b3; suppressed mTORC1 activity. mTORC1 activity is typically assessed by measuring phosphorylation of its downstream substrates 4E-BP and p70S6K. As expected, 4E-BP1 was phosphorylated on Thr37 and/or Thr46 in cultured macrophages, consistent with mTORC1 activity maintained by serum growth factors (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref></bold>). IFN-&#x003b3; suppressed basal 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref></bold>, lane 6 vs. lane 1; 52% mean suppression in 7 independent experiments, p = 0.0036) and diminished 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was maintained throughout the time course of TLR2 stimulation in IFN-&#x003b3;-treated macrophages (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref></bold>). IFN-&#x003b3; also suppressed 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in TLR-stimulated human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref></bold>). In macrophages IFN-&#x003b3; suppressed 4E-BP1 phosphorylation comparably or slightly more strongly than the well established allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1 rapamycin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref></bold>), which only partially inhibits mTORC1 but has strong biological effects related to suppression of mTORC1 function<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. The ATP-competitive inhibitors of mTOR kinase activity, Torin1 and PP242, more strongly suppressed 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, as expected. IFN-&#x003b3; also suppressed phosphorylation of p70S6K, another substrate of mTORC1 that is involved in translation regulation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref></bold>, lane 6 vs. lane 1; 50.5% mean suppression in 4 independent experiments, p=0.0031). These data show that IFN-&#x003b3; suppresses phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates important in regulation of translation, and support a role for IFN-&#x003b3; in repressing mTORC1 activity.</p><p id="P11">mTORC1 suppresses autophagy, a critical cellular process that degrades cytoplasmic proteins and organelles under conditions of nutrient deprivation<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Autophagy is characterized by autophagosome formation and generation of the proteolyzed form of autophagosome markers LC3A and LC3B<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. IFN-&#x003b3; induced comparable generation of the proteolyzed isoforms LC3A-II and LC3B-II as did rapamycin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref></bold>). These results further support that IFN-&#x003b3; inhibits mTORC1 activity and suggest that one functional outcome of such inhibition is increased autophagy, which promotes microbial killing and antigen presentation<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Inhibition of mTORC1 resulted in increased inflammatory cytokine production (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref></bold>), supporting the notion that attenuation of mTORC1 activity by IFN-&#x003b3; contributes to its activating functions. mTORC1 activation occurs on lysosomal membranes and requires recruitment of mTORC1 to late endosomes and lysosomes by the Ragulator-Rag complex<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. We used immunofluorescence microscopy to test whether IFN-&#x003b3; affected localization of mTOR to lysosomes. Control macrophages exhibited prominent colocalization of staining for mTOR and the lysosome and late endosome marker LAMP1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref></bold>, upper panels). In contrast, IFN-&#x003b3;-treated macrophages exhibited a clear dissociation of mTOR and LAMP1 staining (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref></bold>, lower panels; p = 0.0001). Collectively, reduced 4E-BP1 and p70S6K phosphorylation, enhanced autophagy, and disruption of mTOR lysosomal localization converge to the same conclusion that IFN-&#x003b3; suppresses mTORC1 activity in human macrophages.</p><p id="P12">The results that IFN-&#x003b3; suppressed mTORC1 activity and in parallel suppressed HES1 translation suggested that translation and expression of HES1 protein might depend on mTORC1 signaling. We tested this prediction using rapamycin to inhibit mTORC1 and measured HES1 by immunoblot.

Thus, mTORC1 activity is required for translation of HES1 mRNA into protein. These results link the inhibition of mTORC1 activity by IFN-&#x003b3; with IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated suppression of HES1 translation and provide an additional functional outcome of suppression of mTORC1 by IFN-&#x003b3;.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>IFN-&#x003b3; suppresses localization of mTORC1 to lysosomes</title><p id="P13">Next we sought to identify mechanisms by which IFN-&#x003b3; inhibits mTORC1 in human macrophages. mTORC1 activation requires dual inputs, one from the extracellular environment, typically mediated by growth factor-PI3K-Akt-TSC1/2-Rheb signaling, and a second from intracellular nutrient availability, typically conveyed by amino acid-mediated activation of the Ragulator-Rag complex that recruits mTORC1 to lysosomal membranes, where mTOR is activated by GTP-binding protein Rheb (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref></bold>). We wished to elucidate how IFN-&#x003b3; suppressed the localization of mTORC1 to lysosomes, as was observed above. We thus investigated whether IFN-&#x003b3; regulates the amino acid pathway of mTORC1 activation. The most potent amino acid activator of mTORC1 recruitment is leucine<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, but mTORC1 activation is also partially dependent on tryptophan and certain additional amino acids<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Measurement of intracellular amino acid concentrations using ninhydrin reaction-based colorimetric detection analysis showed that intracellular concentrations of most amino acids, including leucine, were not notably diminished, although this technique does not detect tryptophan in our system (data not shown). IFN-&#x003b3; is a strong inducer of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which catalyzes tryptophan degradation and has been shown to deplete extracellular tryptophan and thus suppress lymphocyte proliferation<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. We reasoned that IFN-&#x003b3; might induce sufficient IDO expression in human macrophages to deplete intracellular tryptophan and thereby suppress mTORC1 activity. We observed that IFN-&#x003b3; strongly induces IDO expression with sustained kinetics in our system (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref></bold>). Direct measurement of intracellular tryptophan and its catabolites by HPLC followed by mass spectrometry revealed striking depletion of tryptophan (70% decrease after IFN-&#x003b3; priming) with parallel accumulation of its catabolites in the IDO-mediated degradation pathway (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3e-f</xref></bold>). To test whether this IDO-mediated depletion of intracellular tryptophan contributes to reduced mTORC1 activity we treated cells with IDO inhibitor 1-D-MT and performing immunofluorescence microscopy (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref></bold>). 1-D-MT restored the colocalization of mTOR and LAMP1 in IFN-&#x003b3;-treated macrophages (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref></bold>, lower panels; p = 0.0008). Furthermore, addition of exogenous tryptophan to IFN-&#x003b3;-treated cells also partially recovered the lysosomal distribution of mTOR (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref></bold>), supporting that IDO-mediated depletion of tryptophan was responsible for IFN-&#x003b3;-induced mTOR subcellular redistribution, although it is possible that tryptophan metabolites could also contribute to modulation of mTORC1 activity. To further establish the role of IDO in regulating mTORC1 activity, we used mTORC1-dependent HES1 protein expression as a downstream readout of mTORC1 signaling. Consistent with its reversal of IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated suppression of mTORC1 lysosomal localization (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref></bold>), 1-D-MT reversed IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated suppression of HES1 protein expression (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref></bold> lanes 5-8, p = 0.0003). Consistent with this and with restoration of lysosomal localization of mTOR (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref></bold>), supplementation of tryptophan partially restored HES1 expression in IFN-&#x003b3;-treated macrophages in a dose-dependent manner (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref></bold>). Taken together, these data implicate depletion of intracellular tryptophan by IDO in IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated suppression of mTORC1 localization to lysosomes and thus suppression of mTORC1 activity.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>IFN-&#x003b3; suppresses mTORC1 activation by extracellular cues</title><p id="P14">Inhibition of lysosomal localization of mTOR by IFN-&#x003b3; was not complete (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref></bold>) and was only partially reversed by 1-D-MT or Trp (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref></bold>), suggesting IFN-&#x003b3; also inhibits another pathway required for mTORC1 activity. Thus we considered the possibility that IFN-&#x003b3; also suppresses PI3K-Akt-TSC signaling (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref></bold>). PI3K-Akt-TSC signaling is a major regulator of mTOR activity in response to extracellular factors, such as growth factors, and is also activated by inflammatory stimuli such as TLR ligands<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. We found that TLR2-induced Akt phosphorylation was attenuated by IFN-&#x003b3; (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>). The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abrogated Akt phosphorylation, confirming this inducible phosphorylation was due to PI3K activation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>). To corroborate suppression of Akt signaling by IFN-&#x003b3;, we measured downstream induction of &#x003b2;-catenin, which is dependent on Akt-GSK3 signaling. The accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin induced by TLR2 signaling was effectively inhibited by IFN-&#x003b3;, further supporting that IFN-&#x003b3; inhibits Akt signaling (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref></bold>). Akt activates mTORC1 by phosphorylating and thereby deactivating the negative regulator TSC2. Consistent with suppression of Akt signaling, IFN-&#x003b3; also suppressed TSC2 phosphorylation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref></bold>). These results indicate that IFN-&#x003b3; attenuates TLR2-activated signals that lead to Rheb-mediated activation of mTORC1 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref></bold>). We also tested whether IFN-&#x003b3; could inhibit signaling by growth factors that maintain basal mTORC1 activity in macrophages by stimulating Akt activity. First, we confirmed that serum components and M-CSF (macrophage colony stimulating factor) were key factors for maintaining basal mTORC1 activity in human macrophages (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a, b</xref></bold>). M-CSF promotes Akt signaling; although basal Akt phosphorylation was difficult to detect secondary to limited sensitivity of immunoblotting, we found that IFN-&#x003b3; effectively blocked M-CSF-induced Akt phosphorylation in macrophages that had been serum- and M-CSF-starved for 4 hours (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref></bold>).

IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated suppression of TLR2-induced Akt activation was mediated by an okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2g</xref></bold>) but was not associated with changes in phosphatases SHIP or PTEN that regulate this pathway (data not shown); future work will address how IFN-&#x003b3; suppresses TLR2-induced Akt phosphorylation. To investigate mechanisms by which IFN-&#x003b3; suppresses M-CSFR expression, we tested the role of Myc, which has been previously shown to promote mTORC1 activity in lymphocytes, although underlying mechanisms have not been fully clarified. We found that Myc and M-CSFR expression were induced during culture of cells with M-CSF (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f and 5g</xref></bold>), and inhibition of Myc with the compound 10058-F4 suppressed induction of M-CSFR expression (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref></bold>), suggesting that Myc is required for M-CSFR expression and mTORC1 activity in macrophages. Consistent with this notion, inhibition of Myc effectively suppressed 4E-BP phosphorylation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref></bold>), and also the downstream induction of mTORC1-dependent HES1 protein expression (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref></bold>); similar results were obtained when Myc expression was knocked down using siRNA (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4e</xref></bold>).

This attenuation of signaling, working cooperatively with decreased recruitment of mTORC1 to lysosomal membranes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref></bold>), can explain strong inhibition mTORC1 activity by IFN-&#x003b3;.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Genome-wide analysis of translational regulation by IFN-&#x003b3;</title><p id="P16">The MNK-eIF4E and 4EBP-eIF4E pathways that were suppressed by IFN-&#x003b3; selectively regulate translation<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, and translational regulation is important for inflammatory responses<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. To address the broad functional role of IFN-&#x003b3;-regulated translation in inflammatory responses in primary human macrophages, we used a genome-wide approach combining high throughput RNA sequencing with ribosome profiling. Ribosome profiling provides a snapshot of the translatome by quantifying ribosome-protected RNA fragments (RPF), the frequency of which on each transcript reflects the translation rate of the corresponding mRNA<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. We quantified and compared the abundance of mRNA (counts per million reads (cpm)) and actively translated mRNA (RPF (cpm)) in TLR2-activated macrophages that had been treated with or without IFN-&#x003b3; in two biological replicates (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a-b</xref></bold> and <bold>Online Methods</bold>). For each of 9290 genes that passed stringency cut-offs (<bold>Online Methods</bold>), we calculated the translational efficiency (TE) by dividing the change in RPF reads by the change in cpm; this identifies changes that are solely attributable to changes in translation rate. As expected, IFN-&#x003b3; treatment altered the abundance of multiple mRNA transcripts (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref></bold>, x axis, 2976 mRNAs changed by &#x0003e; 2-fold).

The patterns of pathway enrichment were consistent among biological replicates and the combined dataset (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref></bold>). These results are in accord with a feed forward loop described in other systems whereby proteins important for translation are themselves regulated at the translational level<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.

This included leucyl-tRNA-synthetase (LARS), recently described as a direct amino acid sensor that recruits mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface and mediates its leucine-dependent activation<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>.

We analyzed the relationship between changes in TE and changes in RPF reads (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref></bold>). Overall, the correlation between these two values was low (Pearson correlation coefficient R = 0.27, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.072), suggesting that at the genome-wide level regulation of translation modulates and fine tunes the transcriptional response to IFN-&#x003b3;. Consistent with this notion, of the genes with decreased RPF reads and significant changes in TE, 37% had a discordant increase in TE (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref></bold>, left two quadrants). In contrast, of genes with increased RPF reads, the majority (77%) had a concordant increase in TE (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref></bold>, right two quadrants, compare red and pink dots). Thus, IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated increases in TE tend to reinforce and augment upregulation of gene expression. To analyze the function of genes regulated at the level of TE, we selected highly regulated genes (z-score=&#x000b1;1.5 in pooled data set) and stratified them into functional subcategories based on Gene Ontology (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7a, 7b</xref></bold>).

Strikingly, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-6, TNF, LTA, LTB, CXCL2 and CXCL3 were included in the immune gene group with increased TE (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref></bold>, left panel). This suggests that translational regulation contributes to the previously described<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> augmentation of TLR-induced inflammatory responses by IFN-&#x003b3;. Pathway analysis showed that metabolic process genes whose translation was increased were significantly associated with oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial pathways, genes whose translation was decreased were associated with stress pathways, and both sets of genes were associated with growth factor pathways (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref></bold>).

Full inflammatory activation of macrophages by TLR ligands requires IFN-&#x003b3;<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>, and our signaling results and genome-wide analysis of translational regulation suggest that extensive metabolic reprogramming contributes to IFN-&#x003b3; -mediated polarization of macrophages, which will impact on how macrophages respond to subsequent environmental challenges.</p><p id="P23">IFN-&#x003b3; suppressed mTORC1 in a physiological cell culture model using primary human macrophages that models the well known &#x0201c;priming&#x0201d; effects of IFN-&#x003b3; that enhance responses to inflammatory factors and increase microbial killing<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Physiological regulation of mTORC1 by IFN-&#x003b3; in human macrophages was partial, but comparable to that achieved by the allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. The level of mTORC1 inhibition achieved by rapamycin, and thus IFN-&#x003b3;, has potent effects on immune responses and has been shown to augment innate responses in vitro and in vivo in mice and humans<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>, in part by augmenting inflammatory cytokine production and M1 polarization. Furthermore, partial mTORC1 suppression has been shown to enhance host defense against <italic>L. pneumophila</italic><sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and pathogenic Shigella, in the latter case by augmenting autophagic clearance mechanisms<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. This work supports the biological importance of the newly described regulation of mTORC1 by IFN-&#x003b3; and helps link our findings with canonical IFN-&#x003b3; functions. Overall, our results are in accord with the literature suggesting a suppressive role for mTORC1 in innate immunity<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. However, as a negative feedback loop induced by constitutive mTORC1 activity in TSC1 knock out mice can augment cytokine production<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>, and mTOR has been linked to trained innate immunity<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, the function of mTORC1 in innate immunity is context dependent and likely determined by the absence or presence of an IFN-&#x003b3; response and concomitant ISG expression.</p><p id="P24">Investigation of translational regulation by interferons has predominantly focused on type I IFNs, which globally suppress translation by suppressing eIF2&#x003b1; and by direct effects of ISGs<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Regulation of translation by IFN-&#x003b3; has been primarily investigated in cell line models of cellular transformation<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in transformed cells IFN-&#x003b3;, and also type I IFNs, directly but transiently activate Akt-mTORC1 and MNK-eIF4E signaling, resulting in increased ISG mRNA translation and thus augmentation of the early phase of the IFN response<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. In contrast, we have not observed the early phase of Akt or MNK activation by IFN-&#x003b3; in primary human macrophages; instead, IFN-&#x003b3; suppresses Akt-mTORC1 and MNK-eIF4E at later time points by indirect mechanisms such as inhibition of M-CSFR expression. Thus, the effects of IFN-&#x003b3; on Akt-mTORC1 and MNK-eIF4E signaling are dependent on cell context and increase with duration of IFN-&#x003b3; exposure. A striking contrast between translational effects of IFN-&#x003b3; and type I IFNs is the selective regulation of translation of only a subset of expressed mRNAs by IFN-&#x003b3;, which may be explained by selective regulation of translation by eIF4E<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. In contrast, suppression of eIF2&#x003b1; by type I IFNs has more global effects<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. A modest increase in eIF2&#x003b1; activity by IFN-&#x003b3; may contribute to enhanced translation of specific transcripts, as could downregulation of miRNAs that suppress translation. Overall our work establishes mechanisms by which IFN-&#x003b3; downregulates translation and provides insights into mechanisms by which IFN-&#x003b3; could augment translation of select mRNAs.</p><p id="P25">This study describes the first, to our knowledge, comprehensive genome-wide translational profiling analysis in primary immune cells and in terminally differentiated nonproliferating cells. Analysis of genome-wide data revealed several functions for IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated translational regulation in macrophages. First, IFN-&#x003b3;-induced changes in translational efficiency (TE) were superimposed on changes in mRNA abundance to selectively modulate expression of different gene sets. Second, regulation of translational efficiency potentiated inflammatory activation by augmenting production of inflammatory proteins (TNF, IL-6, lymphotoxins) while decreasing production of anti-inflammatory feedback inhibitors (IL-10, HES1). Third, by suppressing expression of components of the translational machinery, IFN-&#x003b3; could potentiate previously proposed &#x02018;translational skewing&#x02019; towards highly expressed transcripts that favors host defense<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, although our genome-wide analysis showing selective translational regulation suggests the translational skewing model<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> may need to be refined to take into account properties of specific transcripts. Fourth, translational regulation by IFN-&#x003b3; broadly impacted on proteins in metabolic pathways. Fifth, IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated translational downregulation of multiple tRNA synthases by may have important consequences for macrophage activation as these proteins have various noncanonical functions independent of their aminoacyl transferase activity<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">In summary, the present study reveals that IFN-&#x003b3; regulates mTORC1 and mRNA translation in an integrated manner in human macrophages. This regulation and associated changes in intracellular metabolism are linked with key IFN-&#x003b3; functions such as potentiation of inflammatory activation and autophagy, which is related to microbial killing. These findings extend our understanding of the role of metabolic regulation in innate immune cell activation, identify new functions for translational regulation by IFN-&#x003b3;, and suggest approaches to targeting metabolic pathways and translation factors to modulate macrophage activation and function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S9" specific-use="web-only"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cell Culture</title><p id="P27">Primary human CD14+ monocytes were isolated from buffy coats purchased from the New York Blood Center using anti-CD14 magnetic beads (MiltenyiBiotec) as previously described<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, using a protocol approved by the Hospital for Special Surgery Institutional Review Board.
