The patients underwent clinical and metabolic profiling including assessment of HOMA-IR. Explants of adipose tissue were assayed <italic>ex vivo</italic> for lipolysis and ceramide levels. Patients with acromegaly had higher glucose, higher insulin levels and higher HOMA-IR score. We observed several previously reported transcriptional changes (<italic>IGF1</italic>, <italic>IGFBP3</italic>, <italic>CISH</italic>, <italic>SOCS2)</italic> that are known to be induced by GH/IGF-1 in liver but are also induced in adipose tissue. We also identified several novel transcriptional changes, some of which may be important for GH/IGF responses (<italic>PTPN3</italic> and <italic>PTPN4</italic>) and the effects of acromegaly on growth and proliferation. Several differentially expressed transcripts may be important in GH/IGF-1-induced metabolic changes. Specifically, induction of <italic>LPL</italic>, <italic>ABHD5</italic>, and <italic>NRIP1</italic> can contribute to enhanced lipolysis and may explain the elevated adipose tissue lipolysis in acromegalic patients. Higher expression of <italic>TCF7L2</italic> and the fatty acid desaturases <italic>FADS1</italic>, <italic>FADS2</italic> and <italic>SCD</italic> could contribute to insulin resistance. Ceramides were not different between the two groups. In summary, we have identified the acromegaly gene expression signature in human adipose tissue. The significance of altered expression of specific transcripts will enhance our understanding of the metabolic and proliferative changes associated with acromegaly.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Motor City Golf Classic (MCGC) Grant # G010640.

The excess GH has important metabolic effects; the two most significant effects of GH on metabolism in adipose tissue are insulin resistance and lipolysis [<xref rid="pone.0129359.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Insulin resistance, presenting as diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, is found in most acromegalic patients [<xref rid="pone.0129359.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and contributes to the enhanced morbidity [<xref rid="pone.0129359.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Growth hormone induces the expression and secretion of IGF-1, so phenotypes associated with acromegaly may be due to either GH signaling, IGF-1 signaling or a combination of both [<xref rid="pone.0129359.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129359.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>There are few studies addressing the effect of GH specifically on the subcutanous adipose tissue. Induction of STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and IGF1 mRNA expression has been detected in human subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies taken after acute GH administration [<xref rid="pone.0129359.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Subcutaneous adipocytes extracted from acromegalic patients are insulin resistant <italic>ex vivo</italic>, and after a glucose tolerance test there was 50% less insulin binding to its receptor and markedly decreased insulin-related anti-lipolytic activity [<xref rid="pone.0129359.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> measurement in humans detected GH-induced lipolysis in subcutanous adipose tissue [<xref rid="pone.0129359.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Pharmacologic inhibition of lipolysis reduced GH-induced insulin resistance, suggesting that some of this resistance is dependent on higher abundance of free fatty acids [<xref rid="pone.0129359.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Microarray of gene expression has been published for subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies before and after one year of GH treatment in GH deficient patients [<xref rid="pone.0129359.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>To study the effects of chronic excess GH, we used unbiased RNA sequencing in adipose tissue from acromegaly patients and controls. We found a distinctive pattern of changes in many transcripts that are highly associated with acromegaly. Many of these alterations may contribute to the metabolic effect of GH and reveal novel mechanisms of GH-induced insulin resistance and lipolysis in adipose tissue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Patient Recruitment</title><p>The study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Michigan Medical System. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Patients were recruited consecutively from a cohort undergoing transsphenoidal adenomectomy at the University of Michigan Medical Center for acromegaly or non-functioning pituitary adenoma over a 12 month period. All but one patient were newly diagnosed, none had previous surgery and only one previously diagnosed patient was treated with a somatostatin analog but IGF1 was still high without remission. None of the patients were on insulin, but one patient from each group was treated with metformin. Two patients with non-secreting adenomas were treated with beta blockers. Exclusion criteria were age &#x0003c;18 years old, current hormone treatment including glucocorticoids, malignancy, inflammatory disease, diabetes type 1 and established pituitary hormone deficiencies. For each patient, a data sheet was completed including, age, sex, anthropometric measurements, diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, results of blood tests and medications. Fasting blood samples were assayed for glucose (Siemens Advia 1800) and insulin (Life Technologies) as instructed by the manufacturers.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Subcutaneous Fat Biopsy</title><p>During the course of pituitary surgery a routine subcutaneous fat graft is utilized to seal the surgical field upon completion of the procedure.

Briefly, frozen tissue samples were pulverized under liquid nitrogen, then 20 mg portions were extracted using 1.6 mL of a 2:1:0.8 mixture of chloroform:methanol:water containing internal standards (50 ng each of C17 and C25 ceramide and C12 glucosylceramide per sample) [<xref rid="pone.0129359.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The organic layer of the extract was dried under nitrogen gas and reconstituted in 100 uL of 60:40 acetonitrile: isopropanol. The re-constituted extract was analyzed by electrospray ionization LC-MS/MS on an Agilent (Santa Clara, CA) 6410 triple quadrupole instrument operating in positive ion multiple reaction monitoring mode. The LC column used was a Waters (Milford, MA) Xbridge C18 2.5 &#x003bc;, 50 mm x 2.1 mm i.d. Mobile phase A was 5mM ammonium acetate, adjusted to pH 9.9 with ammonium hydroxide; mobile phase B was 60:40 acetonitrile:isopropanol. The gradient consisted of a linear ramp from 50 to 100%B over 5 minutes, a 20 minute hold at 100%B, and re-equilibration at 50%B for 10 minutes. Injection volume was 25 &#x003bc;L. Ceramides and glucosylceramides were identified by retention time and by MS/MS fragmentation parameters, and were quantitated by peak area relative to the closest-matching internal standard using Agilent MassHunter Quantitative Analysis software.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Transcriptomic Analysis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from adipose tissue using the RNEasy kit (Qiagen) and its quality was verified using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). At the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core, cDNA libraries from polyA mRNA were prepared using TruSeq cDNA synthesis kit and sequenced using a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina). Samples were run on 2 lanes of a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) generating 8 612 682 to 16 469 501 single-ended 50 bp reads per sample.

We identified 418 adipose tissue genes altered in acromegaly patients. Some of these genes may be direct targets of increased GH or IGF-1 signaling in adipose tissue, whereas others may be secondary adaptations to this condition.</p><p>Interestingly, we observed more modest gene expression changes in general for older acromegalic patients than for younger patients. We are unable to determine from our study how long patients were acromegalic prior to our study, so one possibility is that the older patients have had longer to adapt to elevated GH levels. Alternatively, elevated GH/IGF-1 signaling may play a stronger role in younger patients. It should be noted, however that this exploratory finding was limited since we only had 2 acromegalic patients over 60 in our study, so these age-dependent findings will need to be reproduced in a larger cohort.</p><p>The fact that the patients consistently had a relatively uniform change of expression of these genes suggests that we are able to draw valid conclusions about adipose tissue in acromegalic patients even from this small cohort. Furthermore, as mentioned throughout, our data agree with several previous studies in animal models and patients. The confirmation of these previously reported GH-dependent transcriptional changes strengthens our interpretation of other transcriptional changes. One potential caveat to our approach is the use of patients with a non-secreting adenoma as the control group. To avoid the possible effects of hypopituitarism on adipose tissue we excluded patients with pituitary hormone deficiencies. We chose to include this as the control group as these samples not only collected in an identical manner from the same surgeons and processed identically, but also controls for potential non-secreting effects of pituitary tumor growths in the acromegaly subjects.</p><p>A potential caveat is the potential confounding effect of anti-diabetic or anti-growth hormone medications. Only one acromegalic patient was on somatostatin, and his IGF-1 levels were non-responsive. Our exclusion criteria included any glucocorticoid treatment. One patient in each group was on metformin as an antidiabetic medication, so we do not feel that this affected our overall conclusions. Another potential limitation was our inability to reanalyze the samples by a secondary method for gene expression or to validate our findings at the protein level, due to a lack of sample. We could not analyze a second cohort due to the rarity of this disease.</p><p>These data provide a variety of novel transcriptional changes that may be causative of the co-morbidities associated with acromegaly. Further studies in animals and cells using knockout or overexpression of specific transcripts may verify which of the changes is crucial in metabolic effects of GH in adipose tissue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0129359.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Principal component analysis of normalized transcript levels.</title><p>Normalized counts were transformed via a regularized log transformation then principal components were calculated.
