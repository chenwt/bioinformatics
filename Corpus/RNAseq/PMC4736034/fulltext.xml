Our findings show that regeneration of the head, sensory organs and brain result in the restoration of directed navigation behavior, suggesting a tight coordination in the regeneration of certain sensory organs with that of their underlying neural circuits.

However, the capacity of their regeneration varies extensively between different animal species. While some invertebrate animal species, such as the planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> or the cnidarian polyp <italic>Hydra,</italic> show astonishing whole-body regeneration from small tissue pieces, the regenerative capacity of other animal species, including humans, is rather limited (<xref rid="BIO014266C15" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="BIO014266C29" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka and Reddien, 2011</xref>). This difference in the regenerative capacity becomes particularly apparent in view of injuries of the central nervous system. For instance, surgical removal of brain tissue in humans (e.g. due to treatment of brain tumors) often severely impacts brain function and subsequent neurological recovery is rather due to a high degree of neuronal plasticity and rewiring than to the regeneration of brain tissue (<xref rid="BIO014266C14" ref-type="bibr">Lepousez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="BIO014266C25" ref-type="bibr">Silver et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, animals with high regenerative potential often show the striking ability to also regenerate their brain. In vertebrates, brain regeneration is well described in zebrafish, which shows the capacity to regenerate different regions of the brains, including the forebrain. While postnatal and adult neurogenesis has been described in many mammals only limited compensatory regeneration has been reported (<xref rid="BIO014266C8" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez-Hernandez and Rhiner, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="BIO014266C9" ref-type="bibr">Grandel and Brand, 2013</xref>). Notably, certain species of planarian and acoel worms are able to regenerate their head and brain after amputation. For example, it was recently reported that the acoel <italic>Symsagittifera roscoffensis</italic> is able to regrow its head and regenerate its brain within about 3-4&#x02005;weeks after experimental decapitation (<xref rid="BIO014266C3" ref-type="bibr">Bailly et al., 2014</xref>). Within the first few days after amputation a blastema forms at the site of injury. Subsequently head tissue starts to regrow and after a month the regenerated head is virtually indistinguishable from the one of intact animals. To what extent the regenerated brain acquires its original functionality however remains unknown.</p><p>While the organization of the nervous system of acoelomorphs appears to vary between different clades, it is typically composed of an orthogon with variable numbers of nerve cords and circular nerves, as well as an anterior brain defined by a condensed bilaterally symmetric neuropil associated with a high-density of neuronal cell bodies. Similar to plathyhelminth flatworms, the acoel orthogon is composed of a network of longitudinal bundles and interconnecting commissures (<xref rid="BIO014266C1" ref-type="bibr">Achatz and Martinez, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="BIO014266C4" ref-type="bibr">Bery et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="BIO014266C19" ref-type="bibr">Raikova et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="BIO014266C21" ref-type="bibr">Reuter et al., 1998</xref><xref rid="BIO014266C22" ref-type="bibr">, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="BIO014266C23" ref-type="bibr">Semmler et al., 2010</xref>). The orthogon of <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> contains three pairs of nerve cords that extend posteriorly from the brain and span the entire length of the body. By means of serial electron microscopy of an early juvenile specimen it was shown that <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> at this stage comprises a centralized anterior brain made up of about 700 neurons (<xref rid="BIO014266C4" ref-type="bibr">Bery et al., 2010</xref>). Associated with the brain are several sensory organs including a statocyst and a pair of eyes.</p><p>While the behavioral repertoire of most acoels remains poorly explored, <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> has been reported to display strong and stereotypic responses to visual cues and gravity (<xref rid="BIO014266C3" ref-type="bibr">Bailly et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="BIO014266C12" ref-type="bibr">Keeble, 1910</xref>; <xref rid="BIO014266C16" ref-type="bibr">Nissen et al., 2015</xref>). When exposed to a dark-light gradient or a directional light-scape <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> shows a strong attraction to light. Similarly, when put on a tilted surface or in a water column <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> crawls or swims downwards along the field of gravity. The sensory organ for light-perception is the eye, while gravity-sensing is presumably achieved by the statocyst.</p><p>Here we study the functional and neuroanatomical capacity of brain regeneration in <italic>S. roscoffensis.</italic> Since a detailed anatomical description of the adult <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> brain is lacking we first established a neuroanatomical map of the neuropil domains of the mature brain. Our study indicates that the brain of the adult <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> is comprised of defined commissural and longitudinal neuropil domains comparable to its organization as juvenile. The established neuropil map of the <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> brain provides the possibility to assess the neuroanatomical organization of the brain after regeneration and further provides a reference for future studies that involve mapping distinct neuron types for instance marked by neurotransmitter expression.</p><p>To probe the degree of functional nervous system regeneration, we assessed different behaviors after decapitation and at different time points during head regeneration. We first demonstrated that the animal displays a robust and stereotypic body contraction behavior to mechanical vibration stimulation. Interestingly this behavior remained unchanged after decapitation, showing that it does not require a brain but is likely mediated by local sensory perception and processing within the orthogon. We further assessed phototaxis and geotaxis. Interestingly, phototaxis was restored within 3-5&#x02005;weeks after decapitation suggesting that the eyes and visual system brain circuits fully regenerate (<xref rid="BIO014266C32" ref-type="bibr">Yamasu, 1991</xref>). However, no recovery of geotactic behavior was observed within 7&#x02005;weeks after decapitation, even though the statocyst itself had regenerated. This finding suggests that while superficially this sensory organ and the brain recover, the underlying neural circuits may either not be functionally reestablished, or alternatively, the regeneration of these may require a longer period to fully recover. Taken together, the regenerative capacity of the <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> head, sensory organs and brain shows that complex behaviors can be recovered within weeks after decapitation providing an interesting system to study the recovery of functional brain circuits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Anatomical organization of the nervous system and brain</title><p>In order to study brain regeneration in <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> we first set out to establish an anatomical map of the neuropil domains of the adult. To establish anatomical markers for the neuropil we tested commercially available antibodies against synaptic proteins. We focused on antibodies of synaptic proteins since these highlight synapse dense regions of the brain and thus have been shown in many instances to provide essential landmarks to recognize and define the neuropil in more detail (<xref rid="BIO014266C5" ref-type="bibr">Bressan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="BIO014266C6" ref-type="bibr">Dreyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="BIO014266C7" ref-type="bibr">El Jundi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="BIO014266C11" ref-type="bibr">Heinze and Reppert, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="BIO014266C18" ref-type="bibr">Perea-Atienza et al., 2015</xref>).

The boundaries between dlc or vlc and brain were defined as the point where they merge into large neuropil domains. Neuropil domains of the brain were annotated according to their relative location along the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral body axis. Three major neuropil domains span the midline forming commissures connecting the right and left hemispheres of the brain. These domains are the dorsal posterior commissural neuropil (dpc), the dorsal anterior commissural neuropil (dac) and the ventral anterior commissural neuropil (vac) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO014266F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B,C,E,F).

To investigate this, we decapitated animals and allowed them to regenerate for a period of up to 50&#x02005;days. Decapitation was performed manually using a pair of sharpened minutien pins cutting the head posterior to the statocyst and anterior to the mouth opening. In this manner the entire head containing the brain, both eyes and the statocyst was surgically removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO014266F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>A). Decapitation is an impacting procedure and a fraction of animals do not initiate head regeneration; these animals were isolated and excluded from further investigations. Of 50 decapitated animals 44 survived the first day; 42 initiated head regeneration. Most animals started to regenerate their head already at 5&#x02005;days post amputation (dpa) in agreement with previously published observations (<xref rid="BIO014266C3" ref-type="bibr">Bailly et al., 2014</xref>).

The first of these was a vibration response to mechanical stimuli. For this we used a simple vibration assay, in which the animals were placed in a Petri dish under a stereoscope to visually score the behavioral response. A weak vibration, induced by tapping the walls of the Petri dish using a pipette tip, elicits a robust startle response in control animals, i.e. specimens which were not decapitated. The response includes a sequence of behaviors during which animals first stop moving and then contract their body along the anterior-posterior axis (see Materials and Methods). An image sequence of this behavior is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO014266F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>A-E (the red arrowhead points to the tail, the yellow arrowhead points to the head). We scored the presence or absence of the vibration response. The behavior is highly robust and stereotypic; 100% of the animals tested showed a vibration response. Typically animals initiate forward locomotion within seconds after the body contraction. A repeated vibration only seconds later is sufficient to elicit the next vibration induced body contraction. We did not further assess if habituation or sensory adaptation occurs, however, if it is the case it appears only to have a minor effect on the performance of the animal.

Strikingly, we found that again 100% of the animals that recovered showed the same vibration response as before decapitation (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/bio.014266/-/DC1">Table&#x000a0;S1</uri>). It appears unlikely that in 5&#x02005;days a primordial brain has regenerated, suggesting that vibration induced body contraction is a somatosensory reflex processed by the orthogon. To test this, we repeated the experiment and tested the vibration response immediately after head amputation. Again we observed the same vibration response even immediately after amputation (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/bio.014266/-/DC1">Table&#x000a0;S1</uri>). Thus indeed the animal does not require a head or brain to display a body contraction behavior in response to external mechanical stimuli. These results suggest that the sensory stimulus leading to the vibration response is perceived by mechanosensory neurons along the body. To further test if even shorter parts of the posterior body can display the vibration induced body contraction we performed a second experiment, in which we cut animals in the middle. Similar to the previous experiments we found that the posterior half, only containing parts of the orthogon and severed nerve cords, showed 100% response to vibration (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/bio.014266/-/DC1">Table&#x000a0;S1</uri>).

This experiment shows that even shorter sections of the body, where only local circuitry of the orthogon remains, are sufficient to mediate a vibration induced body contraction.</p><p>Taken together, our data suggest that vibration induced body contraction does not require a functional brain and likely requires only local circuitry. In contrast, more complex behaviors such as directed navigation are likely to depend on sensory structures in the head as well as on sensory processing occurring in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Phototaxis but not geotaxis is restored during head regeneration</title><p>While the sensory repertoire of acoels remains largely unexplored, two well-known head sensory system based behaviors in <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> are phototaxis and geotaxis (<xref rid="BIO014266C12" ref-type="bibr">Keeble, 1910</xref>). Here we developed a light-gradient assay to measure phototaxis. Animals were put in the middle of a Petri dish with 6&#x02005;cm in diameter illuminated by a white light gradient ranging from 1100 lux to 400 lux. A group of about 20-30 animals was placed in the middle of the gradient at about 840 lux and they were allowed to freely move around for 5&#x02005;min. At this point the position of the worms within the light gradient was recorded.

At 20&#x02005;dpa a not significant increase of phototaxis was observed when compared to 5&#x02005;dpa with an average positive phototactic displacement of 0.9&#x02005;cm (s.e.m.=0.31&#x02005;cm; <italic>P</italic>=0.016, <italic>N</italic>=31).

Within the first hours after head amputation most animals show slow forward movement, generally displaying large circular motions, indicating that forward movement can occur in the absence of a brain. To quantify the level of locomotor recovery after decapitation we recorded the speed of control animals and compared it to the speed of animals 1&#x02005;day after decapitation (see material and methods). The average speed of control animals was 1.63&#x02005;mm/s (s.e.m.=0.048; <italic>N</italic>=77), while the average speed of animals at 1&#x02005;day after decapitation was 1.37&#x02005;mm/s (s.e.m.=0.061; <italic>N</italic>=89) significantly lower than before amputation (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/bio.014266/-/DC1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</uri>). In both groups however, there were also animals moving at more than 2.2&#x02005;mm/s suggesting that there is no general locomotion defect (data not shown). Thus, while the average speed one day after decapitation is reduced to 84% as compared to before decapitation the defect in navigation cannot be attributed to an insufficient locomotion behavior.</p><p>Since <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> lives on sand within the upper tidal zone the ability to move into the substrate and hide may be an important feature for survival. Indeed in nature animals are often found in aggregates on the surface of wet sand and mechanical disturbance (e.g. pressure by hand to sand surrounding an aggregate of animals) leads to a rapid disappearance of animals from the surrounding sand surface (<xref rid="BIO014266C12" ref-type="bibr">Keeble, 1910</xref>). Also in the laboratory when put on a tilted surface the animal crawls downwards towards the bottom of a vessel. We therefore tested geotactic behavior of <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> before and after decapitation. We used a simple geotaxis assay in which the animal was sucked into a pipette tip that was kept at approximately a 45&#x000b0; angle; after the animal settled in the pipette tip we marked the time that the animals needed to reach the bottom from a 1.7&#x02005;cm mark (A maximum observation time of 2&#x02005;min (120&#x02005;s) was set in case the animal did not geotax). We first tested animals before head amputation and found that they required on average 8.6&#x02005;s (s.e.m.=0.23&#x02005;s, <italic>N</italic>=69) to reach the bottom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO014266F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>B). At 5&#x02005;dpa we did not observe geotaxis with an average time of 112.3&#x02005;s, since the observation time was stopped at 120&#x02005;s only 2-3 animals reached the bottom (s.e.m.=3.8&#x02005;s; <italic>P</italic>=2.20&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>, <italic>N</italic>=42). To further test if geotaxis can be restored we tested animals at 20&#x02005;dpa, 30&#x02005;dpa and 50&#x02005;dpa. The time to perform the task was 109&#x02005;s at 20&#x02005;dpa (s.e.m.=5.03&#x02005;s, <italic>N</italic>=39), 104&#x02005;s at 30&#x02005;dpa (s.e.m.=7.85&#x02005;s, <italic>N</italic>=21) and 109&#x02005;s 50&#x02005;dpa (s.e.m.=7.78&#x02005;s, <italic>N</italic>=19), all significantly different from before head amputation (***<italic>P</italic>=2.20&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>; ***<italic>P</italic>=1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup>; ***<italic>P</italic>=5.19&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup>) and not significantly different from each other (5&#x02005;dpa vs 20&#x02005;dpa: <italic>P</italic>=0.60; 5&#x02005;dpa vs 30&#x02005;dpa: <italic>P</italic>=0.28; 5&#x02005;dpa vs 50&#x02005;dpa: <italic>P</italic>=0.82; 20&#x02005;dpa vs 30&#x02005;dpa: <italic>P</italic>=0.57; 20&#x02005;dpa vs 50&#x02005;dpa: <italic>P</italic>=0.85; 30&#x02005;dpa vs 50&#x02005;dpa: <italic>P</italic>=0.53). These experiments show that while phototactic behavior has partially recovered at 20&#x02005;days after decapitation geotactic behavior does not become restored within 50&#x02005;days after decapitation. Since animals were sacrificed at 50&#x02005;dpa, geotaxis beyond this time point was not recorded. Interestingly, while geotaxis could not be behaviorally restored we found that even in extreme cases of abnormal head regeneration the statocyst was regenerated (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Behavioral repertoire of <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic></title><p>The behavioral repertoire of Xenacoelomorpha remains largely unexplored.

Already then it was noted that phototaxis and geotaxis are key behaviors in navigation. The two sensory organs providing input for these behaviors, eyes and statocyst, are characteristic features of the <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> head. If eye and statocyst provide additional sensory information required for additional types of behavior other than directed navigation remains unknown. While it is reasonable to assume that phototactic behavior allows the animal to find light-exposed areas to improve the photosynthetic activity of its symbiont, it was recently shown that red light, which would be optimal for the photosynthetic activity of the algae, is not attractive to the animal (<xref rid="BIO014266C16" ref-type="bibr">Nissen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Sensory receptor neurons are found distributed everywhere along the epidermis of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>roscoffensis</italic>, they appear highly concentrated around the opening of the frontal gland (<xref rid="BIO014266C4" ref-type="bibr">Bery et al., 2010</xref>). What cues these sensory neurons perceive remain unknown, but it appears likely that they also include chemosensory neurons since <italic>S</italic>. <italic>roscoffensis</italic> are also able to navigate in response to chemosensory cues (S.G.S and M.B., unpublished). It will be interesting to further probe for the spectrum of chemosensory behaviors, to identify attractive and repulsive cues and to test if these behaviors are dependent on the head and if they can be recovered after decapitation. Sensory neurons in acoels have been distinguished by ultrastructural features, such as the rootlet apparatus and specializations of the apical membrane (<xref rid="BIO014266C4" ref-type="bibr">Bery et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="BIO014266C30" ref-type="bibr">Todt and Tyler, 2007</xref>). However, how many molecularly distinct sensory neurons exist and what sensory cues they perceive remains unexplored. The existence of a vibration induced body contraction behavior shows that the animal perceives mechanical stimuli. Since this behavior is independent of the head, it is likely perceived by specialized mechanosensory receptor neurons associated with the nerve cords.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Capacity of head and brain regeneration</title><p>Certain acoel species display a rather striking regenerative potential similar to planarians. However not all acoels show the same regenerative capacity and the ability to restore lost tissues varies largely between different species. Some acoel species can reproduce asexually by budding and subsequently regenerating the remaining body parts (<xref rid="BIO014266C24" ref-type="bibr">Sikes and Bely, 2010</xref>). For instance, <italic>Isodiametra pulchra</italic> is well able to regenerate the posterior part of the body within 10&#x02005;days, though it is not capable of regenerating its head (<xref rid="BIO014266C17" ref-type="bibr">Perea-Atienza et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, <italic>Hofstenia miamia</italic> is capable to regenerate its head as well as its tail (<xref rid="BIO014266C28" ref-type="bibr">Srivastava et al., 2014</xref>). RNAi experiments in <italic>Hofstenia</italic> show that bmp and wnt signaling are required for whole-body regeneration similarly to what has previously been found in planarians. The ability of <italic>Hofstenia</italic> to regenerate its head suggests that also the brain can be restored, however, brain anatomy and the behavior of <italic>Hofstenia</italic> remains largely unexplored. In principle, <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> shows the capacity to regenerate the head as well as the tail after amputation at different body levels. Ablation studies of the eyes in <italic>Praesagittifera naikaiensis</italic> showed that these structures can regenerate and suggest that photoreceptive capacity of the new eyes are restored as shown by behavioral assays (<xref rid="BIO014266C32" ref-type="bibr">Yamasu, 1991</xref>). While we did not specifically ablate the eyes in <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> our results show that both eyes and brain can regenerate and that visual behavior is restored. However the recovery of light attraction does not reach the same degree as before decapitation. It will be interesting to investigate if the trend of increasing phototaxis recovery continues after 50&#x02005;dpa and if the original performance might be reached. Another intriguing question arising from our findings is that the animals do not recover geotaxis, while the statocyst regenerates. It is possible that the neural circuits required for geotaxis do not recover after decapitation or, alternatively, that a longer time period for functional recovery is required. Further analysis of brain regenerations using additional markers, such as neurotransmitters might provide answers to this question. We found that the dSap47 antibody from <italic>Drosophila</italic> cross-reacts in <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> and <italic>Isodiametra pulchra</italic> (S.G.S and M.B., unpublished), therefore may also cross-react with the Sap47 homolog in other animal species. From RNAseq experiments we have identified the <italic>S. roscoffensis Sap47</italic> transcript, highlighting several conserved domains which in turn may be recognized by the anti-dSap47 antibody (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/bio.014266/-/DC1">Fig.&#x000a0;S2</uri>). It will be interesting to test this antibody in animals of other phyla. Moreover, the cellular processes that act during brain regeneration remain unknown. It will be of great interest to assess the temporal processes of brain regeneration and the molecular mechanisms involved. In particular the application of new emerging genetic techniques such as the Cas9/CRISPR system in combination with RNAi or genome sequencing data may provide the necessary tools to study the cellular, genetic and molecular mechanisms acting in the regeneration of a functional brain.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animal culture and handling</title><p>Adult <italic>S. roscoffensis</italic> specimen were collected near the Station Biologique de Roscoff in Brittany (France) and transported in falcon tubes to the Department of Biology at the University of Fribourg.
