It represents an ancient lineage of teleosts: the Osteoglossomorpha. Here, we provide a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome of a female golden-variety arowana using a combination of deep shotgun sequencing and high-resolution linkage mapping. In addition, we have also generated two draft genome assemblies for the red and green varieties. Phylogenomic analysis supports a sister group relationship between Osteoglossomorpha (bonytongues) and Elopomorpha (eels and relatives), with the two clades together forming a sister group of Clupeocephala which includes all the remaining teleosts. The arowana genome retains the full complement of eight Hox clusters unlike the African butterfly fish (<italic>Pantodon buchholzi</italic>), another bonytongue fish, which possess only five Hox clusters. Differential gene expression among three varieties provides insights into the genetic basis of colour variation. A potential heterogametic sex chromosome is identified in the female arowana karyotype, suggesting that the sex is determined by a ZW/ZZ sex chromosomal system. The high-quality reference genome of the golden arowana and the draft assemblies of the red and green varieties are valuable resources for understanding the biology, adaptation and behaviour of Asian arowanas.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>With over 30,000 extant species, ray-finned fishes (Class: Actinopterygii) are the largest group of extant vertebrates. The species-richness of this group is in fact largely due to a single monophyletic group of fishes, the teleosts, which account for more than 99% of present day ray-finned fishes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Teleosts are also the most diverse group of vertebrates that exhibit a wide diversity in their morphology, colouration, behaviour and adaptations. The evolution of this group of ray-finned fishes was accompanied by emergence of several novel characters which were crucial to their success<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. These include replacement of bony plates and denticles with overlapping disc-like scales which reduced the weight and increased flexibility, the use of a swim bladder to maintain buoyancy, replacement of heavy toothed jaws with more flexible and protractile ones for efficient prey capture, shift from a heterocercal to homocercal tail for faster speed and change in the position of the paired fins for better maneuverability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Sequencing and analysis of whole-genomes from fugu and other teleosts have revealed that the common ancestor of teleosts experienced a whole-genome duplication event, known as the teleost-specific genome duplication (TGD), about 350 million years ago<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The TGD has been proposed to have provided the additional raw genetic material that was used for evolving genes with novel functions resulting in novel phenotypes thereby spurring the diversity of teleosts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Thus, genome sequences of ancient groups of teleosts that emerged soon after the TGD are crucial for understanding the genetic basis of the origin and diversity of teleosts. Teleosts are classified into three broad groups: the Osteoglossomorpha (bonytongues and mooneyes), Elopomorpha (eels and relatives) and Clupeocephala (the remaining teleosts). Among them, Osteoglossomorpha is considered as one of the ancient groups, with fossil records dating back to the late Jurassic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. However, the phylogenetic relationships of the three groups are controversial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Earlier mitogenome-based phylogenetic analysis had placed Osteoglossomorpha as the ancestral teleost group, with Elopomorpha and Clupeocephala forming a monophyletic group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. However, recent studies based on nuclear genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and ultraconserved elements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> have suggested Elopomorpha as the most ancestral teleost group. Recently, a study based on phylogenetic analysis of &#x02018;question-specific&#x02019; genes showed a sister relationship of Osteoglossomorpha with Elopomorpha<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>The Asian arowana or dragonfish (Scleropages formosus; Order Osteoglossiformes; hereafter referred to as arowana) is a member of the superorder Osteoglossomorpha and also one of the most expensive cultured ornamental fishes. Currently it is listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I, the only commercially cultured species included in the list<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Three major colour varieties of arowana occur naturally: the green, golden and red varieties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these colour variations remain largely elusive. In order to reduce the pressure on natural populations, farms have started culturing different varieties of arowana. One of the bottlenecks in the cultivation of arowana is the lack of a reliable and easy sex-determining method. Since the sex of even mature brooders is not obvious, broodstock selection and management often become skewed towards selection by desired phenotype, like colour and body shape. Thus, there is a need to understand the sex determination mechanism in arowana and develop a viable sexing method that can be used at an early developmental stage of the fish.</p><p>In this study, we have generated a high quality, chromosome-level reference genome of a golden female arowana (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>), in addition to draft genome sequences of red and green arowana varieties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B,C</xref>). Based on a stringent, genome-scale set of one-to-one orthologues from various teleosts, we report a robust phylogenomic analysis which resolves the branching order of the three major lineages of teleosts. Our study also identifies differentially expressed genes potentially involved in the colour variations, and provides the first indication for the likely presence of a ZW/ZZ sex chromosomal system in the species.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reference genome assembly and annotation</title><p>Recently, a draft assembly of an Asian arowana (colour variety unknown) with an N50 scaffold length of 59&#x02009;kb has been generated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. We sequenced the genomes of golden, red and green varieties of arowana to &#x0003e;100-fold coverage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">2</xref>) using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. Sequence reads from the three varieties were assembled separately (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) using SOAPdenovo2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> resulting in N50 scaffold sizes of 5.96, 1.63 and 1.85 million bases (Mb), and genome assemblies spanning approximately 779, 753 and 759&#x02009;Mb for the golden, red and green varieties, respectively, in agreement with their estimated genome sizes based on k-mer analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Evaluation using CEGMA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and de novo-assembled transcripts showed that the three assemblies covered over 98% of core eukaryotic genes and 95% of gene regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">5</xref>), confirming their high level of completeness and accuracy. We then indentified 829,293, 1,168,314 and 1,684,422 heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and detected the following heterozygosity levels: 1.01%, 1.23% and 1.88% in the golden, red and green arowana genomes, respectively. To further improve the quality of the golden variety genome assembly, we developed a high-density genetic map by restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) using 94 F2 individuals that originated from red grade 1 and Malaysian golden arowana grandparents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Subsequently, we identified 22,881 SNPs using the golden assembly as the reference, of which 5,617 refined SNPs and their corresponding scaffolds were clustered and embedded into 25 linkage groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) spanning approximately 3,240&#x02009;cM and 683&#x02009;Mb (87.7% of the golden variety assembly; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). The high-quality linkage group-anchored assembly of the golden variety of Asian arowana can be used as a reference genome, whereas the draft genomes of green and red varieties are suitable for comparative studies.</p><p>Transposable elements (TEs) account for 27&#x02013;28% of the three genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>), with the TcMar DNA transposon being the most predominant type (approximately 8%).

We generated Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) trees using 2,463 one-to-one orthologues from nine species including one elopomorph, one osteoglossomorph, five clupeocephalans and two outgroups (spotted gar and coelacanth). Both ML and BI methods gave identical topologies with strong ML bootstrap (BS) and Bayesian posterior probability (PP) support values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Both trees showed an &#x0201c;Elopomorpha sister to Osteoglossomorpha&#x0201d; topology with maximal support (BS 100, PP 1.0) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).

To evaluate the likelihoods of alternate tree topologies, we performed topology testing using CONSEL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). Indeed, the &#x02018;Elopomorpha sister to Osteglossomorpha&#x02019; arrangement appeared as the most likely topology (approximately unbiased test, AU: 1.00; bootstrap probability, NP: 1.000). The other two topologies, i.e. &#x02018;Osteoglossomorpha sister to remaining teleosts&#x02019; and &#x02018;Elopomorpha sister to remaining teleosts&#x02019; were rejected significantly (p-values&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.00003 for all tests; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). Thus, phylogenomic analysis and topology testing strongly supported the monophyletic clade of Elopomorpha and Osteoglossomorpha.</p><p>To further verify this relationship, we obtained transcriptome data from an additional elopomorph (<italic>Megalops cyprinoides</italic>, Indo-Pacific tarpon) and two osteoglossomorphs (<italic>Pantodon buchholzi</italic>, African butterflyfish; <italic>Papyrocranus afer</italic>, reticulate knifefish). We then generated ML and BI trees using 418 one-to-one orthologues from 12 species.

Divergence events that occur during such short time spans result in reduced phylogenetic signal as there is not sufficient time for accumulation of a large number of synapomorphies. This is possibly why conflicting topologies have been obtained in previous molecular phylogenetic studies using smaller datasets. Since we used a genome-scale dataset, our data contains substantially larger number of phylogenetically informative characters. This might have helped in inferring the correct relationships. We note that previous studies have not identified any morphological synapomorphies between Osteoglossomorpha and Elopomorpha groups. Thus, there is a need to look for additional morphological characters that can be used to define these major teleost clades as well as to generate phylogenetic trees using independent data sets such as intron changes and other genomic markers.</p><p>We estimated the divergence times of spotted gar, arowanas and other teleosts using MCMCTree<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> on 1,669,048 four-folds-degenerated sites extracted from 2,346 one-to-one orthologues together with three fossil calibration points.

Interestingly, our analysis also showed that the three colour varieties of arowanas diverged around 1 to 4 million years ago and have since been evolving as independent lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Hox gene clusters</title><p>Hox genes are attractive candidates for understanding the genetic basis of morphological diversity in animals as they play critical roles in defining identity of body segments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Several studies have highlighted the crucial roles of Hox genes in establishing the body plan of teleosts. For example, duplication of Hox clusters and the resultant divergence of Hox gene expression pattern in the pufferfish are associated with the lack of ribs and pelvic fins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In the Japanese flounder, it was proposed that <italic>hoxb5</italic> functions in the regional identification of gill arch 5, which in most teleosts has gained a masticatory function and is morphologically distinct from gill arches 1&#x02013;4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Previous analysis of Hox clusters in an osteoglossomorph, the African butterfly fish (<italic>Pantodon buchholzi</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, had shown that it contains only five Hox clusters (with 45 Hox genes), thus indicating that its lineage has lost three Hox clusters post-TGD. However, analysis of the whole-genome of the arowana indicated that it has retained all the eight Hox clusters following TGD similar to the European eel, a member of Elopomorpha<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The eight Hox clusters of arowana contain 59 Hox genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 13</xref>), compared to 73 Hox genes in the European eel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. This finding suggests that the common ancestor of osteoglossomorphs contained a complete post-TGD set of eight Hox clusters and the African butterfly fish lineage subsequently lost three duplicate Hox clusters after splitting from the arowana lineage. Interestingly, although the arowana possesses more clusters than the African butterfly fish, it has lost some Hox genes that are retained in the butterfly fish. For example, the butterfly fish possesses duplicate copies of <italic>hoxb4</italic> (<italic>hoxb4x</italic> and <italic>hoxb4y</italic>), whereas the arowana retains only <italic>hoxb4b</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Additionally, the arowana has lost both copies of <italic>hoxd13</italic> whereas the single HoxD cluster in butterfly fish has retained a <italic>hoxd13</italic> gene (<italic>hoxd13x</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). These findings indicate that the complement of Hox genes can vary dramatically even between closely related lineages of vertebrates. Such variation in gene complement is characteristic of teleosts which have experienced an additional round of genome duplication followed by rapid differential loss of duplicate genes in different lineages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The contribution of this Hox gene complement variation to the phenotypic differences between arowana and African butterfly fish remain to be determined.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Analysis of differentially expressed genes in the three arowana colour varieties</title><p>In order to detect the potential molecular mechanisms underlying colour variation, we analyzed gene expression patterns in the combined scale and skin samples of the three arowana varieties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). After comparing the normalized expression values of 18,178 &#x0201c;1:1:1&#x0201d; orthologous genes in the three arowana colour varieties, we identified 260 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 2-folds, P-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), which were then clustered into 10 groups according to their expression trends (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 14</xref>). Intriguingly, we found that the golden and green varieties clustered together in a common branch based on their similar expression trends as compared to the red variety. This suggests that the genetic pathways of golden and green colorations share more genes and genetic networks than the pathway leading to red colouration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Specifically, we observed that the a- and b-paralogs of the four and a half LIM domains protein 2 (<italic>fhl2a</italic> and <italic>fhl2b)</italic> were significantly over-expressed (over 8-folds and P-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) in the golden variety compared to the other two varieties (in group 7 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 14</xref>).

When the female karyotypes were compared to those of males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>), a large acrocentric chromosome with a substantial heterochromatic block in the pericentromeric region was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>) that showed the presence of a GC-rich region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). This extra chromosome was present in all six females, but absent from the six males. The golden arowana reference genome was constructed in 25 linkage groups based on the RAD map (this study), which showed an apparent discrepancy with that of our earlier publication<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> that reported 2&#x02009;n&#x02009;=&#x02009;48 as the male karyotype.

When the diploid copy number of the above two rDNA genes was examined by qPCR, the results indicated multiple copies of 5&#x02009;S and 18&#x02009;S rDNA loci, with the former being higher than the latter. Moreover, there was a difference between the 5&#x02009;S rDNA copy numbers between the two sexes with the females showing a higher value (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). The identification of a potential heterogametic sex chromosome in the female arowana karyotype suggests a ZW/ZZ sex chromosomal system.</p><p>We then used probes to identify the putative heterogametic sex chromosome and obtained five chromosomal fragments from the arowana karyotype through laser&#x02013;based microdissection: two from the large, putative female-specific chromosome (AroW1 &#x00026; AroW3), and three from autosomes (AroA1, AroA2 &#x00026; AroA4) to be used as controls. The microdissected fragments were validated by hybridizing to female metaphase chromosomes using FISH. The results confirmed their origin, although signs of potential cross-hybridization on other chromosomes were seen for both putative W-specific probes and the autosomal ones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 14A&#x02013;C</xref>). MiSeq-based sequencing of the amplified microdissected chromosome fragments yielded the following number of clean reads: AroW1-291,124; AroW3-259,076; AroA1-377,429; AroA2-223,848 and AroA4-320,948. Sequences from these five read sets were mapped onto the 25 chromosomes of golden arowana reference genome. From every set, the majority of reads mapped to one or two chromosomes (designated as &#x02018;source chromosomes&#x02019;) and the rest were dispersed to several other chromosomes of the reference genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 23</xref>). Reads from the female-specific probes (AroW1 and AroW3) predominantly favoured Chromosome 4 (Chr4; 46.3%) followed by Chr2 and Chr17 (22.5% and 6.6%, respectively). The majority of autosomal fragment reads from AroA2 (78.6%) mapped to Chr 12, whereas those for AroA1 and AroA4, mapped to two (Chr23 &#x02013; 36% and Chr9-33.3%) and three (Chr3-30.8%, Chr1-20.6% and Chr22-12.7%) chromosomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 23</xref>). The mapping of reads to multiple chromosomes was in agreement with the cross-hybridizations observed in the FISH analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>).</p><p>Next, all the successfully mapped reads were chained together across gaps less than 30&#x02009;kb to form pseudo-scaffolds.

Unfortunately, comparative analysis of the repeat content and gene density on the four pseudo-scaffold sets did not yield additional indications towards the identity of the sex chromosome(s) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 24</xref>).</p><p>We have also performed a cross-species comparison by mapping the Z and W chromosome-derived scaffold sequences from the tongue sole (which has a ZW/ZZ sex determination system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) to the 25 golden arowana chromosomes. The results showed that Chr17 the same chromosome that was among the three preferred targets of the putative sex-chromosome sequences earlier - had the largest aligned region (89% and 40%) in both cases, with Chr6-the biggest chromosome in the assembly-being the second and third largest region (53% [Z] and 19% [W], respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>). According to the evolution of the arowana karyotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>) Chr2&#x00026;4 and Chr6&#x00026;17 both originated from a single ancestral chromosome, &#x02018;c&#x02019; and &#x02018;i&#x02019;, respectively. Our knowledge about the evolution of sex determining (SD) systems and sex chromosomes in teleosts is quite limited, as the number of species with known SD is less than 20 and those with sequenced genome is less than 50 (Sridatta, P.S.R., personal communication) with limited overlap between the two sets. The data indicate high level of variation, as cross-species conservation of the SD could only be observed within the salmonids (13/15 species tested)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> and medakas (three species out of 14 tested from the <italic>Oryzias</italic> genus)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. As the tongue sole and the Asian arowana are evolutionarily distantly related, the potential functional overlap of the implicated homologous chromosomes would need to be investigated further.</p><p>Genetic and morphological degeneration followed by shrinking of the heterogametic sex chromosome (Y or W) has been observed in mammals, birds and snakes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. According to the universally accepted &#x02018;addition-attrition hypothesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> during the course of evolution, the heterogametic sex chromosome gradually loses its ability to recombine with its homogametic partner and starts to accumulate mutations resulting in a higher proportion of heterochromatin and fewer genes on the long term. In mammals (or birds) the size of the Y (or W) will typically shrink due to the above reasons. However, in the current study, an elongated W chromosome was observed in the karyotype of arowana females. A similar phenomenon was reported earlier in other fish species and plants, including tongue sole<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, <italic>Leporinus reinhardti</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> and papaya<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. The apparent size increase of these W chromosomes could either be due to early accumulation of repeats that was shown to precede the transposon-driven decrease of size in heterogametic sex chromosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> or to a higher proportion of insertion to deletions or to a recent translocation of an autosomal fragment onto the proto-W chromosome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. In order to answer this question, genomes from both sexes need to be re-sequenced, and compared to the reference genome reported here (female; ZW).</p><p>A comparative analysis of the testis and ovary transcriptome was performed by using RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 25</xref>).

Using phylogenomic analyses, we show that Osteoglossomorpha and Elopomorpha are a monophyletic group and thus resolve a long-standing controversy regarding phylogenetic relationships of the early branching lineages of teleosts. An unexpected finding is that arowana possesses all the eight post-TGD Hox clusters in contrast to another osteoglossomorph, the African butterfly fish, which has retained only five Hox clusters. This is a typical example of a whole-genome duplication event followed by extensive evolutionary changes to the gene complement in different teleost lineages. Such changes not only affect the gene number but can also alter the associated regulatory network and therefore have potential for giving rise to extensive phenotypic differences between closely related species. Comparative analysis of genes expressed in the skin and scales of three colour varieties provided insights into the genetic basis of colour variation, and methylation sequencing and gene knock-down experiments can further confirm the effect of these genetic variations. The genomic sequence combined with karyotype analysis identified putative sex chromosomes and suggest a ZW/ZZ sex determination system in Asian arowana.</p><p>Currently, the important unresolved problems of Asian arowana research include: 1) the lack of knowledge about the genetic diversity of most natural populations; 2) the relationship of color variants and new isolates that show morphological differences (see e.g. ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>); and 3) lack of understanding of the breeding biology of the species, especially partner selection and the mouth-brooding process.

C.B. performed the genome assemblies and annotations of three arowana varieties. N.M.T. and A.S.K. completed downstream analyses of data related to sex under the supervision of L.O. and S.O&#x02019;B., B.V., V.R., C.B. and J.L. constructed the phylogenetic trees and ancestral chromosomes. B.V., V.R. and B.H.T. analysed the Hox gene families. C.B., X.M., Y.H., W.L., Q.Y. and Z.X. analyzed the colour variants. I.S.K and X.S. collected the samples for karyotype and sex chromosome analysis. X.S. contributed to the identification of sexes and their genomic analysis. I.S.K. performed the karyotype analysis, whereas V.T., M.K., A.T. and I.S.K. isolated and sequenced the laser-dissected fragments.
