Compared with the human and cow genomes, the reference annotation level of the sheep genome is still low. An investigation of new transcripts in sheep skeletal muscle will improve our understanding of muscle development. Therefore, applying high-throughput sequencing, two cDNA libraries from the biceps brachii of small-tailed Han sheep and Dorper sheep were constructed, and whole-transcriptome analysis was performed to determine the unknown transcript catalogue of this tissue. In this study, 40,129 transcripts were finally mapped to the sheep genome. Among them, 3,467 transcripts were determined to be unannotated in the current reference sheep genome and were defined as new transcripts. Based on protein-coding capacity prediction and comparative analysis of sequence similarity, 246 transcripts were classified as portions of unannotated genes or incompletely annotated genes. Another 1,520 transcripts were predicted with high confidence to be long non-coding RNAs. Our analysis also revealed 334 new transcripts that displayed specific expression in ruminants and uncovered a number of new transcripts without intergenus homology but with specific expression in sheep skeletal muscle. The results confirmed a complex transcript pattern of coding and non-coding RNA in sheep skeletal muscle. This study provided important information concerning the sheep genome and transcriptome annotation, which could provide a basis for further study.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Shandong Provincial Modern Agriculture Industry Technology System</institution></funding-source><award-id>SDAIT-0901101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jianmin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>National Key Technology Support Program</institution></funding-source><award-id>2015BAD03B05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jianmin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was financially supported by the Shandong Provincial Modern Agriculture Industry Technology System (no.

Therefore, enhancing the understanding of the regulatory mechanism of muscle growth in sheep and identifying genes that regulate the growth of skeletal muscle are of great significance. However, compared to the more comprehensively studied human [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], mouse [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], maize [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and cow [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] transcriptomes, sheep transcriptomic research remains at a low level. Recently, with the development of whole-transcriptome sequencing, several studies have been undertaken to research the regulation in various specific sheep tissues in diverse researches [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, most of these high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNAseq) studies have neglected to explore the unannotated transcripts in sheep.</p><p>RNAseq makes it possible to reveal the expression profiles underlying phenotype, metabolic and physiological changes and different stages of development and environmental impacts at single-base resolution [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Another important capacity of RNAseq is the revelation of unannotated transcriptional activity. By identifying massive novel transcripts, we can find new gene loci (protein coding and noncoding) and can complement the structure of the known genes [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In our previous study, to obtain an accurate map of annotated transcripts together with their expression in sheep skeletal muscle, high-throughput sequencing was applied to construct two cDNA libraries from the biceps brachii of small-tailed Han (SH) sheep and Dorper (DP) sheep, and whole-transcriptome analysis was performed to describe the comprehensive transcript catalogue of this tissue [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Dorper sheep are a South Africa breed with good muscle conformation to produce a desirable carcass. They have a flat back and wide waist, and their legs are short and thin. While the small-tailed Han sheep, with long, strong limbs and an elliptical fanshaped tail, are indigenous breed in China that provide good flavored meat and are rich in fat. Dorper sheep are famous as a meat-producing breed for their rapid muscle growth, while small-tailed Han sheep have a higher mean litter size (2.61) [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] than Dorper sheep (1.45 to 1.60) [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The results of our previous study were analyzed to report differentially expressed genes, alternative splicing, coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) and new transcription units [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the dataset of unannotated new transcripts still lacks accurate identification and annotation. Furthermore, recent updates to the sheep genome and gene annotation have reduced the reference value of the results of the original new transcript analysis, which not only led to wasted data but also hindered the in-depth understanding of the regulation of skeletal muscle. Accordingly, we decided to reanalyze the sequencing data to find new transcripts. The functions of these transcripts are largely unknown, although there is increasing evidence that new transcripts play key roles across diverse biological processes, with an emerging theme of interfacing with epigenetic regulatory pathways [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0159638.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, the sheer number and increasing pace of discovery of new transcripts are accompanied by the growing challenge of their definition and annotation [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We believe that these newly identified transcripts lacking annotation information in the reference sheep genome might play important roles in the complex regulatory processes of sheep skeletal muscle.</p><p>In this study, to describe the comprehensive transcript catalogue of sheep skeletal muscle, we focused on the identification of new transcripts expressed in this tissue, including protein-coding RNA and non-coding RNA. Using RNAseq and bioinformatics analyses, a group of new transcripts was identified and underwent detailed classification. This study of new transcripts will provide important information concerning the sheep genome and transcriptome annotation and will provide a basis for our future work on sheep skeletal muscle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Ethics Committee of Shandong Agricultural University (Permit Number:2004006) and performed in accordance with the &#x0201c;Guidelines for Experimental Animals&#x0201d; of the Ministry of Science and Technology (Beijing, China).

However, without detailed annotation and classification, we could not conduct further study of the new transcripts. Moreover, due to the frequent updates of the sheep reference genome and gene annotation data, our past results have been unable to serve as a reference for further research. For these reasons, we decided to reanalyze the sequencing data based on the latest genome annotation to reveal the new transcripts.</p><p>Consistently with transcriptome-wide studies in other species [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the results of our research have also revealed a large number of new transcripts. Ultimately, 40,129 unique primary muscle transcripts were assigned to the sheep genome. Among them, 3,467 transcripts (8.64%) were not annotated in the reference sheep genome, a slightly lower proportion than in our previous report [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and in similar research on sheep skin [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This result is believed to be due to the continuous improvement of the genome information, the complementarity of known gene structure and the annotation of new gene loci. In addition, the new transcripts were distributed evenly among the chromosomes. These distribution characteristics indicate that the new transcripts are not a product of transcriptional noise.</p><p>Of the 3,467 new transcripts, a total of 246 have been clearly identified by comparative sequence analysis. Such results could be an effective supplement to reference genome annotation. It is worth noting that among the 246 identified transcripts, 11 protein-coding transcripts were determined to be unknown proteins because they did not match up with any functional annotated genes. This result indicates that there are still many proteins of unknown function that play roles in skeletal muscle growth. The functions of these unknown proteins require further study.</p><p>Our analysis identified a number of reliable potential lncRNAs. This dataset of 1,520 lncRNAs should be useful for sheep skeletal muscle regulation research or in the study of possible functional differences among sheep varieties. Interestingly, using the same method as Li and Eichten [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], we found no transcripts containing homologous sequences to miRNAs, even though miRNA precursors should be important components of putative lncRNAs [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This result might be due to the poor annotation level of sheep miRNA compared to other species, such as human and cow; that is, the total number of annotated sheep miRNAs (153) supported by miRBase is far less than the numbers in human (2,588) and cow (793). Using the same method as described above, a small amount of acceptable alignment results were detected during the comparison with human (18 hits) and cow (60 hits), which could be an evidence for our hypothesis. This result also means that a group of small RNA precursors should be included in our dataset of high confidence lncRNAs. Compared to protein-coding genes, lncRNAs are more likely to show interspecific specificity [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The recognition of lncRNAs with specific expression characteristics should be useful to help explain the regulation of gene expression and to improve the reference genome annotation. To the best of our knowledge, no transcriptome-wide lncRNA recognition had previously been executed in sheep skeletal muscle. Supported by EST data on several species, 334 lncRNA transcripts were specifically expressed in ruminants. Moreover, among them, 3 lncRNA transcripts were found to be specifically expressed in sheep skeletal muscle, which indicates they might play important roles in the regulatory processes of sheep skeletal muscle. Further research will be performed to confirm the specific functions of these transcripts.</p><p>A total of 2199 new transcripts were identified as differentially expressed transcripts, of which 1115 were eventually got the classification results. Compared to our previous report [<xref rid="pone.0159638.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], these transcripts revealed the unknown portion of the difference between the two transcriptome, which greatly improved our understanding of the sheep skeletal muscle transcriptome complexity. However, only 90 of them received comparative sequence analysis result. As for the other 1025 differentially expressed transcripts which were classified as high-confidence lncRNA, it is still unable to confirm their physiological function. To identify the small RNA precursors and competitive endogenous RNA from high-confidence lncRNA, a sufficient credible sheep small RNA dataset should be greatly helpful, and this should also be the focus of our future research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, a catalogue of new transcripts for sheep skeletal muscle was generated based on a whole-transcriptome RNAseq approach. A complex transcript pattern in sheep skeletal muscle, including protein-coding and non-coding RNA, was verified. A total of 3,467 transcripts were not annotated in the reference sheep genome and were defined as new transcripts. A total of 246 new transcripts were classified as portions of unannotated or incompletely annotated genes, and 1,520 transcripts were predicted with high confidence to be lncRNAs. Furthermore, our analysis revealed 334 new lncRNA transcripts that displayed specific expression in ruminants. The expression of 20 selected new transcripts was confirmed in several sheep tissues by RT-PCR, 3 lncRNA transcripts without intergenus homology but with specific expression in sheep skeletal muscle were also been discovered. The results suggest that new transcripts without annotations still occupied a considerable proportion of the sheep transcriptome. These novel transcripts should not be ignored in transcriptome and genomic studies, as they might play important roles in regulation. Collectively, our results complement the current sheep reference genome annotation and constitute a valuable resource for the identification of new transcripts underlying the muscle growth of sheep, which might aid future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0159638.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Transcriptome annotation level comparison.</title><p>(A) Total reads mapping rate comparison.
