The roles of T cell receptor crosslinking, intracellular signaling, and transcription factor activation are well described, but the importance of post-transcriptional regulation by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) has not been considered in depth. We describe a new model expanding and activating primary human CD4 T cells and applied this to characterizing activation-induced assembly of splicing factors centered on U2AF2. We immunoprecipitated U2AF2 to identify what mRNA transcripts were bound as a function of activation by TCR crosslinking and costimulation. In parallel, mass spectrometry revealed the proteins incorporated into the U2AF2-centered RNA/protein interactome. Molecules that retained interaction with the U2AF2 complex after RNAse treatment were designated as &#x0201c;central&#x0201d; interactome members (CIMs). Mass spectrometry also identified a second class of activation-induced proteins, &#x0201c;peripheral&#x0201d; interactome members (PIMs), that bound to the same transcripts but were not in physical association with U2AF2 or its partners. siRNA knockdown of two CIMs and two PIMs caused changes in activation marker expression, cytokine secretion, and gene expression that were unique to each protein and mapped to pathways associated with key aspects of T cell activation. While knocking down the PIM, SYNCRIP, impacts a limited but immunologically important set of U2AF2-bound transcripts, knockdown of U2AF1 significantly impairs assembly of the majority of protein and mRNA components in the activation-induced interactome. These results demonstrated that CIMs and PIMs, either directly or indirectly through RNA, assembled into activation-induced U2AF2 complexes and play roles in post-transcriptional regulation of genes related to cytokine secretion. These data suggest an additional layer of regulation mediated by the activation-induced assembly of RNA splicing interactomes that is important for understanding T cell activation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Institute of Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov">www.nih.gov</ext-link>)&#x02014;U01 GM094653 to TCW, ERP, LDA, NJG, JRW, and DRS, with additional funding from National Institute of Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov">www.nih.gov</ext-link>)&#x02014;U19 A1063603 to SRH, PO, and DRS.

Beginning with detection of antigen by the T cell receptor (TCR), the ensuing activation response is mediated by initiation of signaling cascades, transcription factor activation and translocation to the nucleus, immune-related gene expression changes, receptor display at the cell surface and cytokine secretion [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The gene expression changes that occur as a result of transcription factor activation and binding are recognized as critical to the downstream immune response and lineage specification of the T helper effector subsets such as Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Albeit less well characterized, post-transcriptional regulation, a term collectively representing pre-mRNA splicing, alternative splicing, polyadenylation, nonsense-mediated decay, nuclear export, mRNA transcript stability, ribosomal loading, and mRNA degradation, is also likely to be important in the context of immunity and T cell activation [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Global mRNA detection technologies have been used to measure expression and alternative splicing in various models of the immune response. Utilizing exon level microarrays, splicing has been measured in activation of human primary T cells [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and primary T and B cells [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Alternative splicing has been extensively characterized using RNAseq in both a T cell line (JSL1) and primary CD4 peripheral T cells [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, in a survey of 60 immune-related genes that undergo alternative splicing during activation of CD4 T cells, 7 different RNA binding proteins were linked to specific alternative splicing events [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A recent paper identified the role of the splicing factor, CELF2, in regulating alternative splicing after PMA activation of the JSL1 leukemic CD4 T cell line and employed several similar approaches to our present work including sequencing after CELF2 knockdown to identify splicing changes [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A granular gene-level bottom-up approach is crucial to understanding the detailed mechanism of regulation of splicing of individual genes in T cell activation. Alternatively, a top-down approach involves examining the global changes in mRNA splicing that are regulated by activation-induced RNA-binding protein complexes and is going to produce different kinds of data from the current rigorous bottom-up approaches focused on the RNA biology of specific protein-protein and RNA-protein interactions. As such, we will explore the value contributed by top-down studies in the context of the role in CD4 T cell activation-induced gene expression that includes changes in both canonical and alternative splicing.</p><p>T-cell activation involves upregulating a very large suite of gene expression patterns, which in turn necessitates a general increase in splicing. Therefore, it is important to look at post-transcriptional regulation in addition to the upstream processes of signaling and transcription factor activation that initiate gene expression changes. Recently, post-transcriptional regulation of the immune response has been studied in the context microRNA-mediated modulation of molecular networks responsible for T-cell activation and differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144409.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The premise of the present work is that post-transcriptional regulation by specific RNA binding proteins serves as another layer of regulation that is required due to the complexity and importance of the immune response. We began with investigating the essential splicing factor, U2AF2, during the activation of primary human CD4 T cells.</p><p>The U2AF heterodimer is composed of 35 kDa U2AF1 and 65 kDa U2AF2 subunits [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and the interaction occurs via the U2AF Ligand Motif (ULM) on U2AF2 and the U2AF Homology Motif (UHM) on U2AF1 [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Canonically, the U2AF heterodimer recruits the components of the spliceosome to the 3&#x02019; splice site (3&#x02019; SS), where U2AF2 binds to the polypyrimidine tract, and U2AF1 binds to the dinucleotide AG motif at the 3&#x02019; end of the intron [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144409.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A recent publication that applied the high throughput techniques RNAseq and CLIPseq, demonstrated the importance of the U2AF heterodimer in defining the 3&#x02019;SS via binding to the polypyrimidine tract and subsequently regulating alternative splicing [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As a result, the U2AF heterodimer is involved in most splicing events of canonical and alternative exons. In T cells, very little is known about its protein-protein interactome, the function associated with these interactions, or the process that leads to their assembly with the U2AF heterodimer on RNA transcripts. Mutations in the 3&#x02019; SS can lead to exon skipping and has been associated with Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS) and other genetic diseases [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144409.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, altered splicing caused by somatic mutations in U2AF1 has been linked to various cancers [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Impairing exon definition at the 3&#x02019;SS by mutating either the splice site or the RNA-binding protein has important biological and health ramifications.</p><p>Another level of regulation involves recruitment of U2AF2 to the 3&#x02019; splice site via interactions with a class of RNA-binding proteins called splicing factors that act as enhancers or suppressors for splicing of exons proximal to their binding site [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It is through either binding to the U2AF heterodimer or blocking access to the 3&#x02019; splice site that many alternative splice mRNA variants are generated [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Functionally, U2AF2 has also been shown to bind spliced mRNAs [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and play a role in 3&#x02019; end processing [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Here we use the central role of U2AF2 in 3&#x02019;SS definition as an avenue to understand the regulation of changes in gene expression during CD4 T cell activation. First, we present a primary CD4 T cell culture protocol that combines the expandability of a T cell line with the ability to model primary T cell activation by measuring cytokine secretion and activation markers. RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing (RIPseq) was used to identify the activation-induced mRNA interactome bound by U2AF2. We then mapped these transcripts to specific immune pathways. Next, we used mass spectrometry proteomics to identify the activation-induced assembly of a unique protein interactome centered on U2AF2. The biological significance of the interactome was demonstrated by knocking down 4 selected members. The impact of these knockdowns on cytokine production and gene expression, including canonical and alternative splicing, revealed some of the crucial roles for activation-induced assembly of the U2AF2 interactome in important and different immune gene pathways. Our work provides a list of candidates and a foundation for future study into: 1) understanding how T cell activation drives the composition of the different splicing complexes and, 2) discovering the rules involved in T cell activation that initiate and guide the function of these complexes to regulate canonical and alternative splicing of specific genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics, consent and permissions</title><p>All the studies in this manuscript were covered by Human Subjects Research Protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of The Scripps Research Institute.

To address this issue, a human CD4 T cell culture derived from primary cells was developed that preserves the changes in gene expression and cytokine secretion characteristic of T cell activation that are not observed in the commonly used model, cultured Jurkat T cells. Briefly, human primary CD4 T cells are stimulated with &#x003b1;-CD3/&#x003b1;-CD28 beads for 48 hours at the time of isolation. This is followed by a 7 day expansion, where the cells are cultured in the presence of IL2, then frozen and stored as reusable aliquots. An additional post-thaw 7 day expansion of the cells establishes a functional &#x0201c;resting&#x0201d; state from which they can be re-stimulated with &#x003b1;-CD3/&#x003b1;-CD28 beads to measure changes associated with re-&#x0201c;activation&#x0201d;.</p><p>Various T cell specific cytokines were measured using culture media collected from &#x0201c;Resting&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Activated&#x0201d; cells.

Moreover, our RNAseq data confirmed the specific splicing events listed for 27 of 60 (45%) genes previously reported, and identified an additional set of alternative splice variants in 16 members of that set of genes. These results expand the current literature catalog of 60 validated alternative splicing events in CD4 T cells described previously [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Annotation of the differential splicing events by type is shown in <xref rid="pone.0144409.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>.

Changes in the 5&#x02019; splice site (5&#x02019;SS) and 3&#x02019; splice site (3&#x02019;SS) are the next most common events, resulting in changes in the exon&#x02019;s length. While many observed splicing events couldn&#x02019;t be linked to a specific isoform change (unassignable), <xref rid="pone.0144409.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref> also shows the types of isoform switching that are detected. Of the assignable events, more than 43% represent increased or decreased splicing of regions at the N- or C-termini suggesting selection of alternative translational start and stop sites creating different protein isoforms. We used sashimi plots to bioinformatically validate these findings (<xref rid="pone.0144409.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0144409.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>, respectively). Many alternatively spliced genes vacillate between two isoforms where a single splicing event correlates with a single isoform switch. Over 50% of genes have more than a single alternative splicing event. Unfortunately, the limitations of isoform annotations at this time make it difficult to assign all the splicing events detected by RNAseq to specific isoforms, exemplified by the 38% unassignable isoform changes. While these different classes of splicing events have been documented in other cell types, this work represents a significant addition to the current knowledge of alternative splicing in a primary CD4 T cell culture.</p><p>In our previous study of activation-induced alternative splicing in primary CD4 and CD8 T cells, we identified three classes of gene expression changes: differentially expressed, alternatively spliced and both differentially expressed and alternatively spliced [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In mapping the members of these three classes to functional pathways, it was shown that the class of genes that is both differentially expressed and alternatively spliced has an important role in various aspects of T cell activation including signal transduction, cytokine signaling, cell adhesion and cell cycle progression. In the present analysis, these same three classes were identified in the primary CD4 T cell cultures (<xref rid="pone.0144409.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>) and two different mapping tools were used to confirm a similar enrichment for immune/inflammatory gene pathways in the class of differentially expressed/alternatively spliced genes.

These data support the conclusion that the phenotype of CD4 T cell activation is accompanied by profound changes in the transcriptome brought about by differential gene expression and alternative splicing, while confirming that our method of culturing primary cells is a relevant model for studying CD4 T cell activation.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Changes in the activation-inducted transcriptome are reflected in transcript association with the splicing factor U2AF2</title><p>Activation-induced expression and changes in alternative splicing are mediated by splicing factors and components of the spliceosome, and to begin to characterize these changes, we sought to characterize the mRNAs and proteins associated with the major splicing factor U2AF2 in the context of T cell activation. The U2 Auxillary Factor (U2AF) heterodimer is comprised of a 35KDa protein, U2AF1 or U2AF35, and a larger 65KDa protein, U2AF2 or U2AF65. The U2AF heterodimer is responsible for binding the 3&#x02019;SS and the adjacent 5&#x02019; region known as the polypyrimidine tract and then guiding the assembly of a series of protein complexes required for splicing [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Only recently has there been a genome-wide test of the generality of U2AF2s role in splicing using Cross-linking and ImmunoPrecipitation followed by deep sequencing (CLIPseq), where U2AF heterodimers were localized to 88% of known 3&#x02019; SS in a static system of the HeLa cell line [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our objective was to determine if changes in expression profile and alternative splicing upon activation of CD4 T cells in culture, were reflected in U2AF2 bound transcripts, and to determine if those transcripts were overrepresented in immunologically relevant networks.</p><p>The first step was to determine the RNA targets of U2AF2 using RNA Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation (RIP) followed by next generation sequencing, RIPseq (n = 6, <xref rid="pone.0144409.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig</xref>). CLIPseq is a protocol that was developed to identify peaks around the sequences bound by an RNA-binding protein and reveal the consensus RNA binding motif targeted by the RBP under study. In contrast, we have employed a RIPseq protocol with no crosslinking and a simple IP purification of the mRNA transcripts bound by our target RBPs. Our protocol allows us to map reads with increased coverage of each transcript, thus increasing confidence in identified transcripts associated with U2AF2 and suitable for mapping to functions and pathways. To eliminate non-specific binding of RNA and protein to the U2AF2 antibody, we pre-absorbed the cell lysate with affinity purified isotype control antibody (mouse IgG). In parallel experiments, RIPseq done with the mouse IgG control pulled down no detectable RNA. Comparing the U2AF2 RIPseq to the RNAseq done on whole cells, there is a slight reduction in the total number of genes detected, reflected by the compaction seen in the lower fpkm range (<xref rid="pone.0144409.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>).

Next, the changes in U2AF2-bound transcripts with activation were compared.

The heatmap profile of up and down regulated transcripts is very similar to that obtained with RNAseq (<xref rid="pone.0144409.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>). For validation, we chose 10 genes that were either at the top of the list in terms of significance by FDR-adjusted p-value and/or significant genes that were also immunologically interesting. RT-qPCR validated these genes with varying expression patterns (<xref rid="pone.0144409.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). The full network of genes that were both differentially bound and differentially expressed with activation and found in significantly enriched immune pathways is shown in <xref rid="pone.0144409.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>, where nearly two-thirds increase upon activation. These 100 genes are connected to 33 ImmuneMap pathways with the most densely connected being MAPK, NFKB, and JAK/STAT signaling, T cell subset-specific and chemokine pathways.</p><p>Next, we further compared the activation-induced differentially U2AF2-bound genes with the differential expression and alternative splicing data obtained with RNAseq (<xref rid="pone.0144409.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). For the genes that either decrease or increase their binding to U2AF2 upon activation in the RIPseq data, ~80% are differentially expressed in the same direction in the RNAseq data; moreover, 11&#x02013;12% of these genes are also alternatively spliced in the RNAseq data. An additional 6% are alternatively spliced but not differentially expressed in the RNAseq data. Similar to the class of differentially expressed/alternatively spliced genes found to be immunologically important in the RNAseq data, we found 5 significantly enriched ImmuneMap pathways for the class of genes that were both differentially bound in the RIPseq data and alternatively spliced in the RNAseq data (<xref rid="pone.0144409.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). The relatively small number of genes in the network belies the critical role that U2AF2 plays in regulating the alternative splicing of genes during important T cell activation processes: TCR, IL21, MAPK and NLR signaling and costimulation. These results confirm that the expression and alternative splicing changes generally observed during activation are reflected in the U2AF2 associated transcripts that are undergoing splicing.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>The activation-dependent U2AF2 interactome</title><p>The alternative splicing of particular mRNAs upon T cell activation is expected to involve association of specific regulatory factors with those transcripts. In order to identify these factors that differentially bind critical genes during T cell activation, we used mass spectrometry to identify the protein interactome of the U2AF heterodimer in resting and activated T cells. The protein component of the immunoprecipitate from the U2AF2 RIP experiment was purified, trypsin-digested, and analyzed using proteomic mass spectrometry (<xref rid="pone.0144409.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A Fig</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144409.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). Using the same protocol as for RIPseq, the samples for all mass spectrometry experiments were pre-absorbed with an isotype control mouse IgG. Moreover, we initially performed a series of control IgG pull-downs with mass spectrometry to create a list of background proteins that were combined with published list of contaminant proteins and subsequently subtracted from the proteomic datasets [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

Of these, 35 proteins were unique to the activated state, 10 were unique to the resting state and 194 were shared in both states. Given the large number of shared proteins, quantitative mass spectrometry was performed using Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC) to quantify the differences in protein levels upon activation (n = 3/group). The SILAC experiment identified 122 (out of the original 239 total proteins) that had significantly different abundance between resting and activated cells and all but one of the proteins increased abundance upon activation (<xref rid="pone.0144409.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144409.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>).

The core U2AF2 interactome is comprised of 68 total proteins: 35 proteins are only seen in activated cells, 5 are only seen in resting cells, and 28 are shared by both states. The PIMs represented the remaining 171 proteins which is based on our previous analysis of the whole interactome.</p><p>What are the changes underlying an activation-induced interactome? While simply increasing the protein levels of U2AF2 and U2AF1 would be logical, these actually do not change with activation based on quantitative Westerns (<xref rid="pone.0144409.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Activation-induced changes in the U2AF-centered protein interactome could also be due to increases in gene expression for the other interacting proteins. However, when the differential gene expression data was mined for the 122 U2AF2 whole interactome proteins detected by SILAC as significantly changed with activation, only 47 showed differential gene expression and 75 did not (<xref rid="pone.0144409.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B Fig</xref>). Post-translational modifications are another possible activation-induced mechanism for driving interactome assembly. Using ProteinPilot software to analyze the triple TOF mass spectrometry data obtained by U2AF2 RIP and then validating with the PhosphoSite database, 123 post-translational modifications of four types (PhosphoT, PhosphoS, Acetyl [K,R], Methyl [K,R]) were mapped to 41 proteins with the majority detected being phosphorylations (<xref rid="pone.0144409.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6C Fig</xref>). This approach will not detect tyrosine phosphorylation. These results reveal a large number of post-translational changes with activation and that many of these changes may involve the loss of specific modifications. Another observation was that 7 of the 10 proteins with 3 or more modifications were RS domain-containing proteins (SRRM2, U2AF2, SFRS10, SFRS7, SFRS1, SFRS3, TRA2A; <xref rid="pone.0144409.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>) consistent with the known importance of RS domain phosphorylation in determining protein-protein interactions with U2AF2 [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In sum, these results reveal that cell activation creates a new U2AF interactome that is not only the consequence of increased gene expression, but could also result from post translational changes to the proteins.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Biological effects of selectively knocking down U2AF2-interactome members</title><p>We hypothesized that the knockdown of specific U2AF2 interactome proteins would impact the phenotypes of activated cells by affecting activation-dependent cell surface markers, cell proliferation and/or inflammatory cytokine secretion. siRNA knockdowns were done with U2AF1 and three proteins which demonstrated significantly increased binding by SILAC upon activation (<xref rid="pone.0144409.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>).

Interestingly, knocking down the CIM SRRM2 increased secretion of IL6, IL13, and IFNg and decreased TNFa. The magnitude of impact on the cytokines is greater for CIMs as compared to PIMs which supports the hypothesis that proteins directly associated with U2AF2 are likely to have a larger role in determining cellular phenotype. These results, however, reveal that both core and peripheral U2AF2-interactome members can have significant, specific and different impacts on critical biological pathways associated with cytokine secretion following CD4 T cell activation.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Changes in post-transcriptional landscapes after selectively knocking down U2AF2-interactome members</title><p>Given these significant immune phenotype changes, gene expression profiling was done after the same siRNA knockdowns.

Transcriptional changes due to U2AF1 knockdown revealed enrichment of 23 different immune pathways and SRRM2 knockdown was associated with 38 significantly enriched pathways. 18 of the pathways were unique to SRRM2, including interleukins, chemokines and multiple signaling pathways, while 20 were shared with U2AF1, including interleukins, costimulation, and different signaling pathways. U2AF1 knockdown affected the expression and splicing of 214 genes in enriched immunological pathways, the majority of which were downregulated (143/214; 67%; <xref rid="pone.0144409.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8B Fig</xref>). In sharp contrast, the same analysis for SRRM2 knockdown revealed 159 immune genes, the majority of which demonstrated significantly increased expression (131/159; 82%). These results support the novel conclusion that, in comparison to U2AF1, SRRM2 functions for many genes as a post-transcriptional inhibitor during T cell activation. That conclusion is consistent with the marked increase in cytokine secretion observed with SRRM2 knockdown discussed above.</p><p>We also compared genes affected by U2AF1 knockdown to those differentially expressed with knockdown of the PIMs, ILF2 or SYNCRIP (<xref rid="pone.0144409.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). Knocking down SYNCRIP or ILF2 influenced the activation-induced expression of far fewer genes (123 and 308, respectively) though these were still fundamentally important genes to CD4 T cell functions. Specifically, expression of critical cytokines and secreted molecules (IL17, IL21, IL8, IL10, CCL4, TNFSF11) decreased with SYNCRIP knockdown. ILF2 knockdown decreased expression of IL3, IL9, mTOR, and CCNB1 but increased expression of IL17 and SKAP1. In sum, we observed three classes of organizational topology with knockdown of U2AF2 interactome members: one protein can impact more genes but fewer pathways (U2AF1), fewer genes but more pathways (SRRM2), or relatively few genes and pathways (ILF2 and SYNCRIP) but ones with great biological significance for T cell activation.</p><p>The same microarray data was used to analyze the changes in alternative splicing created by knockdowns of these 4 RNA-binding proteins using the program Alt-Analyze.

Differential splicing of mutually exclusive exons is the second most common impact of U2AF1 knockdown. Importantly, this class of splicing event is not seen in RNAseq data for untreated CD4 T cells, resting vs. activated. At the isoform level, the two most common assignable switching events after U2AF1 knockdown are alternative C-terminal (29%) and N-terminal (28%) variants.

RIPchip using exon/junction microarrays provides the identity of the bound transcripts, measures expression levels and reveals distinct isoforms resulting from alternative splicing following knockdowns of one CIM (U2AF1) and one PIM (SYNCRIP). The U2AF2 RIPchip at 24 hours identified 1814 unique genes whose expression changed after T cell activation when U2AF1 is knocked down (906 up-regulated, 604 down-regulated and 379 alternatively spliced; <xref rid="pone.0144409.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>).

The number of genes differentially bound to U2AF2 following the knockdowns compared to siRNA controls is more than two orders of magnitude greater for the CIM as compared to the PIM.

Thus, using RIPchip to identify U2AF2 bound genes affected by U2AF1 and SYNCRIP knockdown exemplifies the class of network topology in which regulation of a few genes is linked to a small but critically important set of immune pathways. A PIM like SYNCRIP has a limited effect on U2AF2&#x02019;s ability to bind transcripts compared to U2AF1, yet the transcripts affected by SYNCRIP in the context of their interaction with U2AF2 still map to immune pathways that are important for T cell activation. These results support the hypothesis that both CIMs and PIMs function to determine the activation-induced T cell transcriptome, but do so within a relative hierarchy to differentially regulate assembly of the RNA and protein components of the U2AF2 interactome.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec029"><title>Discussion</title><p>Understanding the complexities of T cell activation in human health and disease requires studies of primary human cells though significant advances have been made using cell lines.

The presence of a class of genes that were both differentially expressed and alternatively spliced was also confirmed and these genes are important for the proliferation and differentiation of the cells as well as key immune functions.</p><p>We hypothesized that splicing complexes are critical post-transcriptional regulators of activation-induced differential gene expression and alternative splicing. The RNA interactome of the central splicing complex member U2AF2 was identified in human CD4 T cells using RIPseq and revealed that the U2AF2-bound mRNA transcripts detected represent 82% of the transcripts expressed at the total RNA level. The genes differentially bound to U2AF2 were associated with a large network of immune pathways and the subset of differentially bound, alternatively spliced genes was significantly enriched for immune pathways such as CD28 costimulation, T cell receptor, MAPK, and IL21 signaling. Thus, the RIPseq data provides evidence for the critical role of U2AF2 in regulating the transcriptome of activated human primary CD4 T cells.</p><p>The next goal was to identify the protein interactome of U2AF2 to address the regulation of CD4 T cell activation by assembly of RNA binding protein complexes. One definition of an interactome is all the proteins that directly bind and interact with the target protein. For our studies, this is determined by RNAse-resistant interactions that imply the identified protein is associated with the U2AF2 multi-protein complex. However, because we are working with RNA-binding proteins, there is another layer of biologically significant information that can be captured by analyzing all the proteins that indirectly associate with U2AF2 through the larger context of the RNA scaffold. This is also consistent with the idea that there is a high level of three-dimensional RNA structure that could facilitate the functional regulation of the U2AF complex by RNA binding proteins that are RNAse-sensitive and located some distance away [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144409.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Specifically, RNA binding proteins that are located at some distance from the U2AF complexes assembled might function to block U2AF recruitment to their binding sites. For example, one of the RNAse sensitive proteins identified by our mass spectrometry proteomics is hnRNPA1 which has been shown to bind RNA at specific regions to suppress splicing [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, we refer to RNase-resistant U2AF2 interacting proteins as the Core Interactome Members (CIMs) while also referring to a second layer of interactome proteins that are assembled on the same transcripts but different locations as Peripheral Interactome Members (PIMs). Using RIP without RNAse treatment followed by mass spectrometry showed that U2AF2 associates with 239 proteins in resting or activated cells. The CIM subset comprised 68 proteins and we classified the additional 171 proteins as PIMs. These PIMs have their own direct interacting proteins that are being assembled in an activation-dependent manner in CD4 T cells and our results demonstrate that knocking down PIMs have significant impacts on gene expression and cytokine secretion. Moreover, when we knock down the PIM SYNCRIP prior to U2AF2 RIPchip, we demonstrate a small but important number of changes in U2AF2&#x02019;s ability to bind transcripts, consistent with the argument that PIMs regulate the transcriptome in a U2AF2-dependent manner.</p><p>Quantitative experiments using U2AF2 RIP followed by SILAC mass spectrometry showed that nearly all of the detectable interactome member proteins shared between activated and resting states significantly increase in the activated cells despite a minimal activation-induced change in the level of U2AF2 protein. These increased associations are not completely explained by activation-induced changes in transcript expression of the interactome proteins because only 38.5% of the proteins with observed SILAC differences (47/122) had correlated changes at the RNA level based on the RNAseq data. One potential mechanism to explain the increased association of PIMs with U2AF2 would be through activation-dependent changes in transcript abundance on which both proteins were bound. Finally, post-translational modifications are another canonical mechanism of regulating the assembly of protein complexes. Indeed, we identified 41 proteins in the complete interactome (17%) with differential post-translational modifications upon activation. RS domain-containing proteins (including U2AF2) comprised 7 of the top 10 post-translationally modified proteins and phosphorylation was the most common modification. Supporting these results in our RNAseq data is the activation-induced increase of the transcript for SR Protein Kinase 1 (SRPK1, <xref rid="pone.0144409.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>), which is known to phosphorylate the RS domains of SR proteins [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144409.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. It has also been shown that phosphorylation of SR proteins by SRPKs is critical for their translocation to the nucleus and spliceosome assembly at defined exons [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The activation-induced reorganization of the U2AF2 interactome studied specifically in CD4 T cells is consistent with our premise that an understanding of the dynamics of RNA-binding protein interactome assembly is critical to understanding T cell biology.</p><p>After compiling the U2AF2 interactome, we used siRNA knockdown of both core and peripheral U2AF2 interactome members to assess the biological impacts on T cell activation. The first step was to knock down U2AF1 (CIM). Significant phenotypic effects on the T cells included reduced cell proliferation at rest, changes in expression of activation markers, and significantly diminished secretion of 7 highly immunologically relevant cytokines. We expected a significant impact of knocking down U2AF1 because it is the U2AF2&#x02019;s binding heterodimeric partner; furthermore, these results provided a benchmark for our approach to study the differential impacts of additional interactome members.</p><p>Knockdown of SRRM2 (CIM), SYNCRIP (PIM), and ILF2 (PIM) did not impact cell proliferation or activation marker expression but still significantly changed the secretion of multiple cytokines. Knockdown of SYNCRIP or ILF2 reduced IL21 secretion and are examples of target specificity and the potentially overlapping and coordinated roles of these splicing factors in an important T cell specific pathway. IL21, a hallmark of activated CD4 T cells and the defining cytokine for T follicular helper cells (Tfh), has a role in proliferation and its excessive production has been implicated in chronic inflammatory disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis as well as graft rejection following organ transplantation [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Unexpectedly, the knockdown of SRRM2 resulted in increased secretion of 3 pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL6, IL13, IFNg) suggesting it may play an inhibitory role in post-transcriptional regulation of these critical factors. These data documenting specific changes in secreted, T cell activation-induced cytokine levels after knockdown of splicing interactome partners are the first direct demonstrations of the connection between RNA-binding proteins and immunologically significant cellular changes downstream of changes in mRNA expression and splicing. Moreover, many of the impacted cytokines are well established signals driving and/or associated with CD4 T cell subset differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>The next step to investigating the biological significance of the U2AF2 interactome was to assess the transcriptional effects of knocking down the same set of interactome members. In the first series of experiments, total RNA was profiled by exon/junction microarrays at 24 hours to reveal the cumulative impact of these interacting proteins over this critical early time period in CD4 T cell activation. At the global level, given the limited cellular phenotypic impacts of SRRM2 knockdown on cell proliferation and surface activation markers, it was surprising that the differential expression of thousands of genes was affected, a similar number of genes to U2AF1. A subsequent functional enrichment analysis of these lists of differentially expressed genes identified markedly different profiles of significant immune pathways and associated genes. The network of significantly enriched immune pathways with associated genes affected by SRRM2 siRNA (<xref rid="pone.0144409.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A Fig</xref>) has fewer genes than U2AF1 (159 vs. 214) but is connected to a larger number of categories and pathways (38 vs. 23). SRRM2 targets more networks but fewer genes, consistent with the conclusion that it has evolved to regulate members common to multiple pathways. Both CIMs tested have a discrete and definable set of targeted genes that they regulate during T cell activation.</p><p>Relative to the CIMs, far fewer transcriptional changes were detected following knockdown of the PIMs, ILF2 and SYNCRIP. This, however, does not diminish the importance of the affected genes. Specifically, we observed SYNCRIP and/or ILF2 impacted expression of IL17, IL21, and FOXP3, important genes that define three of the canonical CD4 T cells subsets that emerge from T cell activation: Th17, Tfh, and Tregs, respectively. Interestingly, ILF2 knockdown decreased secretion of IL21, IL22 and TNFa at the protein level but that was not evident at the transcript level. These results are consistent with additional functions known for RNA binding proteins that do not involve direct mRNA splicing events such as regulating ribosomal entry and translation. In fact, ILF2 has been shown to regulate translation as an IRES-dependent trans-activator [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144409.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>U2AF2 RIP after knockdown of U2AF1 allows us to study the direct effects of preventing assembly of the U2AF heterodimer. At the protein level, we used western blots to confirm the critical role of U2AF1 in assembling activation-dependent protein complexes centered on U2AF2. This effect was not observed with knockdown of any other U2AF2 interactome member. While U2AF1 knockdown had a substantial global impact on the RNA interactome of U2AF2, the immune pathways containing genes affected by U2AF1 knockdown were specifically associated with various aspects of T cell activation (<xref rid="pone.0144409.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). SYNCRIP knockdown impacted IL21, IL5 and IL10 cytokine secretion and specifically reduced binding of U2AF2 to IL21 transcripts as well as changed binding to 14 other target genes. Clearly, the number of transcripts that are impacted by knocking down a CIM like U2AF1 is much larger than the impact of a PIM like SYNCRIP. However, knocking down a PIM, that is by definition a protein not directly bound to the U2AF2 protein complex, still impacts localization of U2AF2 to a number of important transcripts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec030"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Many current paradigms in immunology for transcriptional regulation and understanding the construction of a T cell&#x02019;s transcriptome have focused on the upstream roles of TCR and costimulatory signaling to activate the function of various transcription factors and their partners (<xref rid="pone.0144409.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>). This work has been critically important to defining the nature of T cell immunity. While transcription determines and drives the original set of pre-mRNAs (<xref rid="pone.0144409.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>), our work underlines the importance of another level of regulation between transcription and translation that involves both canonical and alternative splicing and is equally critical for understanding the CD4 T cell immune response in molecular terms. Indeed, this mechanism of regulating T cell activation can be considered in the context of the growing appreciation of regulating cellular responses by epigenetic modifications, miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs. We propose that T cell activation drives assembly of RNA-protein-protein complexes on individual transcripts and these complexes regulate the splicing events and ultimately the expression of these genes at both the transcript and protein levels (<xref rid="pone.0144409.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C</xref>). There are only a few examples of the intersection of the immunology and splicing fields that are really well studied at the molecular level; for example, CD45 splicing is regulated by specific RNA binding proteins such as hnRNPL, hnRNPLL, hnRNPA1 and SFPQ that cooperate in aligning intron/exon junctions or regulate the recruitment of the spliceosome [<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144409.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].
