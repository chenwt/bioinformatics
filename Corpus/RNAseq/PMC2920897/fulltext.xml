Genomic diversity is evident within <italic>Burkholderia </italic>species as well. Individual isolates of <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei </italic>and <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>, for example, carry a variety of strain-specific genomic islands (GIs), including putative pathogenicity and metabolic islands, prophage-like islands, and prophages. These GIs may provide some strains with a competitive advantage in the environment and/or in the host relative to other strains.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we present the results of analysis of 37 prophages, putative prophages, and prophage-like elements from six different <italic>Burkholderia </italic>species. Five of these were spontaneously induced to form bacteriophage particles from <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>and <italic>B. thailandensis </italic>strains and were isolated and fully sequenced; 24 were computationally predicted in sequenced <italic>Burkholderia </italic>genomes; and eight are previously characterized prophages or prophage-like elements. The results reveal numerous differences in both genome structure and gene content among elements derived from different species as well as from strains within species, due in part to the incorporation of additional DNA, or 'morons' into the prophage genomes. Implications for pathogenicity are also discussed. Lastly, RNAseq analysis of gene expression showed that many of the genes in &#x003d5;1026b that appear to contribute to phage and lysogen fitness were expressed independently of the phage structural and replication genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides the first estimate of the relative contribution of prophages to the vast phenotypic diversity found among the <italic>Burkholderiae</italic>.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p><italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic>, causal agent of the potentially fatal disease melioidosis, is a metabolically versatile soil organism that has been classified as a Category B biological threat by the CDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Relatively little is known about its pathogenesis, virulence factors, the extent of diversity in natural populations, and host response. <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>genome plasticity has been associated with genomic island variation. The genome of <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>K96243 (7.3 Mb), for example, features 16 genomic islands, at least three of which appear to be prophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It is unclear whether all of these putative prophages are active, although one (&#x003a6;K96243) was shown to be a productive bacteriophage. <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>isolates are genetically quite diverse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and this heterogeneity may be due at least in part to the highly variable distribution of bacteriophages among strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Such differences may provide certain strains survival advantages in the environment and the host, as well as explain the variable clinical presentation of melioidosis.</p><p>Also raising concern as a potential biological weapon is the very closely related <italic>B. mallei</italic>, causal agent of the primarily equine disease known as glanders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In contrast to <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, <italic>B. mallei </italic>is a highly specialized pathogen, not found outside of a mammalian host in nature. <italic>B. mallei </italic>is a host-adapted clone of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, and all of the <italic>B. mallei </italic>genome is nearly identical to a set of genes within <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>core genome. However, in addition to its core genome <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>contains numerous contiguous gene clusters that were deleted from <italic>B. mallei </italic>during its evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p><italic>B. thailandensis </italic>is another closely related organism often found in the same environmental samples (soil and water of endemic melioidosis regions) as <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Unlike <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>and <italic>B. mallei</italic>, <italic>B. thailandensis </italic>has very low virulence in most animal hosts, including humans. The ability to metabolize arabinose, and the corresponding loss of the arabinose assimilation operon from <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, phenotypically distinguishes <italic>B. thailandensis </italic>from <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The genes encoding arabinose assimilation may be considered as antivirulent, and their absence from <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>(and <italic>B. mallei</italic>) may have allowed the development of the latter as pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. <italic>Burkholderia multivorans</italic>, a member of the <italic>Burkholderia cepacia </italic>complex, is an opportunistic pathogen associated with infection in cystic fibrosis patients that is also found in soil environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The presence of prophages among bacterial isolates and their possible contribution to bacterial diversity is widespread. By carrying various elements contributing to virulence, prophages can contribute to the genetic individuality of a bacterial strain. This phenomenon has been reported in <italic>Salmonella </italic>spp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and <italic>Lactobacillus </italic>spp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], among others. Prophage-associated chromosomal rearrangements and deletions have been found to be largely responsible for strain-specific differences in <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and <italic>Xylella fastidiosa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, temperate phages carrying foreign DNA can play a role in the emergence of pathogenic variants. Lateral gene transfer between phage and host genomes, and phage lysogenic conversion genes, can alter host phenotype through production of phage-encoded toxins and disease-modifying factors that affect virulence of the bacterial strain. Examples of such phage-encoded virulence factors abound in the literature, and include proteins associated with toxicity, antigenicity, invasion, intracellular survival, serum resistance, and adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Many of these factors are encoded by morons that are present variably across phage genomes and are thought to be regulated independently of the phage genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>To estimate the contribution of prophages to genetic and phenotypic diversity of the species, we have isolated and sequenced five temperate bacgteriophages from <italic>Burkholderia</italic>, three from <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>and two from <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>, and used bioinformatics techniques to search for putative prophage regions in the genomes of nine sequenced <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>strains, six <italic>B. mallei </italic>strains, one <italic>B. thailandensis </italic>strain, three <italic>B. multivorans </italic>strains, and one <italic>Burkholderia xenovorans </italic>strain. While no prophages were detected in any of the <italic>B. mallei </italic>strains, a total of 24 putative prophages or prophage-like islands (PI) were identified in the other species. Sequences from the isolated phages and inferred prophages were compared with each other and with the 8 published phage sequences from <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, <italic>B. thailandensis</italic>, <italic>B. cenocepacia</italic>, and <italic>B. cepacia</italic>. As seen in other genera, the prophages among the <italic>Burkholderiae </italic>contribute to the genomic variability of the species and carry genes that could provide advantages in the environment and host adaptation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Spontaneous bacteriophage production by lysogenic B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis strains, host range studies, and UV induction experiments</title><p>Five bacteriophages were isolated and fully sequenced (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1A</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Sources and descriptions of bacteriophage and putative prophage islands (PI) used in this study.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><italic>A.

First, the protein set of each genome was searched against a non-redundant database of viral proteins using BLASTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] with a cutoff of e<sup>-10</sup>. Secondly, the annotation of each strain was searched for several virus-related keywords such as integrase, tail, capsid, portal, terminase, etc. Clustering of such proteins with proteins containing similarity to known phage proteins as identified by BLASTP, as well as the orientation of proteins within clusters was considered strong evidence for prophage presence. Finally, tRNA genes and attachment sites were examined. A tRNA sequence immediately flanking an integrase was considered to be a potential <italic>att </italic>site, particularly if an exact repeat of least a 10 bp of the tRNA was present within several thousand bp. Regions containing all of these factors (i.e., viral-like proteins clustered and in a specific orientation, and flanked by a tRNA/integrase on one end and an exact repeat of at least 10 bp of the tRNA on the other end) were considered putative prophage. Regions containing many of these characteristics but lacking one or more, usually an integrase or repeat sequence, were considered prophage-like. Some <italic>att </italic>sites are less than 10 bp and are difficult to spot so it is possible that some of the prophage-like elements may actually be true prophages.

Reciprocal BLASTP comparisons of the translated protein sets were performed for each prophage/PI against all others. BLASTP distances between each pair were calculated according to the formula: 1-(number of significant hits between both genomes/total number of genes in both genomes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].

Furthermore, the genomic structure of each of these are arranged in multigene "modules" that encode proteins involved in a common function, such as DNA packaging, head biosynthesis, tail biosynthesis, host lysis, lysogeny or DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

However, the region encoding for lysogeny and DNA replication contained abundant genetic variability. Some of the genes within this region were present exclusively in either of the subgroups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This suggests that the mechanism of integration, regulation of excision, and/or replication of episomal bacteriophage DNA could be distinct for subgroup A and B Myoviridae. For example, subgroup A bacteriophage genomes encode DNA primase proteins which catalyze the synthesis of short RNA primers required for DNA replication by DNA polymerases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> B). Subgroup B bacteriophages, on the other hand, encode for ParA-like partitioning proteins which are ATPases involved in chromosome partitioning. In addition, subgroup B genomes encode replication gene A protein-like sequences. Members of this family of proteins are endonucleases which introduce single-strand nicks at or near the origin of replication (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><p>Among the conserved regions, some segments are variably present in the bacteriophages and PIs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). It is likely that these regions were acquired by recombination with unrelated bacteriophages (or prophages), and that these segments might be considered 'morons' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This is supported by the fact that these regions exhibit a lower % GC content relative to the rest of the bacteriophage genomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), which suggests horizontal transfer of genetic information. Most of these novel genes encode conserved hypothetical proteins which have no defined functional activities, but share similarity with proteins in other bacteriophages. No obvious virulence factor genes are encoded by these bacteriophage genomes, which is consistent with a previous report on this topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Interestingly, &#x003d5;E12-2 gp6 and gp7 appear to encode a type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) addiction module (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> - see below) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Other novel proteins are encoded by the &#x003d5;52237, &#x003d5;E202, and &#x003d5;E12-2 genomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), but no functions can be assigned to these gene products at this time.</p><p>The phage attachment sites (<italic>attP</italic>) of &#x003d5;52237 and &#x003d5;E202 are found at the 3' ends of putative site-specific integrase genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and are identical to each other.

This <italic>attP </italic>site is also utilized by &#x003d5;K96243 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The integrase genes of these three subgroup A Myoviridae terminate with the tRNA (Phe) gene when integrated as prophages, but not when the bacteriophage genomes are episomal. Thus, following integration the integrase gene is partitioned into two fragments.</p><p>The &#x003d5;E12-2 <italic>attP </italic>site is located between gp24 and gp25 (5'-AATTTGACATAAGGTAAA-3') (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and is identical to the sequence at both ends of GI15 in <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>K96243 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This integration site is present in an intergenic region on the <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>genome and does not disrupt any obvious ORFs.

PI-E264-2 is also flanked by a similar sequence (5'-ATTTGACATAACGTAAA-3') in <italic>B. thailandensis </italic>E264, suggesting that it also uses this <italic>attP</italic>. No obvious integrase genes are encoded by &#x003d5;E12-2, GI15, or PI-E264-2, which suggests these subgroup B Myoviridae use a different mechanism of integration.</p></sec><sec><title>Mu-like phages</title><p>The &#x003d5;E255 genome shares ~ 90% nucleotide sequence identity with the genome of BcepMu, a Mu-like bacteriophage spontaneously produced by <italic>Burkholderia cenocepacia </italic>strain J2315 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Similar to BcepMu, the &#x003d5;E255 genome can be divided into functional clusters from the left end to the right end of the linear phage genome: replication and regulation, host lysis, head assembly, and tail assembly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). &#x003d5;E255 encodes a transposase with a Rve integrase domain (gp40, PFAM PF00665) that allows transposition as a mechanism of replication. Following replicative transposition, DNA is packaged into the bacteriophage heads using a <italic>pac </italic>site at the left end of the bacteriophage genome which allows 200-2,000 bp of flanking host DNA to also be packaged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The genomic sequence of &#x003d5;E255 (accession number NC_009237) contains 467 bp of host DNA sequence (Bm ATCC23344). The left and right ends of the linear &#x003d5;E255 genome contain 23-bp imperfect direct repeats that could be recognized by gp40 during replicative transposition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). These repeats are similar to those found at the ends of the BcepMu genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and the nucleotide differences are underlined in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>.</p><p>Three regions of the &#x003d5;E255 genome are not present in the BcepMu genome and appear to be &#x003d5;E255-specific (gray shading in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The unique regions are found at the left and right ends of the &#x003d5;E255 genome, which is consistent with the location of unique sequences in BcepMu and other BcepMu-like prophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The two unique genes on the left side of the bacteriophage genome, gene<italic>41 </italic>and gene<italic>46</italic>, encode a conserved hypothetical protein and a lambda C1 repressor-like transcriptional regulator, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). These proteins are presumably involved in &#x003d5;E255 activation and/or replication. Five unique genes are encoded on the extreme right end of the &#x003d5;E255 genome, including genes <italic>26</italic>-<italic>30 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Gp26 encodes a putative tail fiber protein which presumably is required for attachment and probably provides host receptor specificity to this bacteriophage. It is interesting that this gene, and the downstream tail assembly chaperone protein (gp27), are the only tail assembly genes that are not conserved in BcepMu. This suggests that the BcepMu receptor(s) on <italic>B. cenocepacia </italic>is distinct from the &#x003d5;E255 receptor(s) on <italic>B. thailandensis </italic>and <italic>B. mallei</italic>. Furthermore, it suggests that the unique tail fiber protein and a tail assembly chaperone protein (gp27) were either acquired by &#x003d5;E255 via horizontal transfer or lost by BcepMu. Gp28 is a hypothetical protein with no functional prediction, but gp29 is a putative ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). It is possible that &#x003d5;E255 gp29 is involved in the import of a nutrient or export of toxic metabolites that confers a selective advantage on the lysogen harboring it. On the other hand, <italic>Lactococcus lactis </italic>bacteriophage P335 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes </italic>bacteriophage &#x003d5;NIH1.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] also encode ABC transporters and these molecules may play an undefined role in the bacteriophage lifecycle. Finally, gp30 is a putative formyl transferase domain protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), a family of proteins involved in a variety of biochemical pathways, including <italic>de novo </italic>purine biosynthesis, methionyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and formate biosynthesis. None of these &#x003d5;E255 genes have homologs in any of the other phage/PI or <italic>Burkholderia </italic>genomes reported here or elsewhere.</p></sec><sec><title>Siphoviridae</title><p>The gene order and modular organization of the &#x003d5;644-2 genome is reminiscent of lambdoid bacteriophages, including &#x003d5;1026b and &#x003d5;E125 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The &#x003d5;644-2 genome harbors five regions that are specific to &#x003d5;644-2 and contain a lower GC content than the rest of the &#x003d5;644-2 genome, suggesting they may have been acquired horizontally from a novel source (gray shading in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The thirteen novel genes present in these regions encode hypothetical proteins with no known function (gp22, gp23, gp24, gp33, gp34, gp35, gp46, gp47, gp48, gp49, gp55, gp66, and gp67). The genome also contains several interesting features, including a putative phosphoadenosine phosphosulphate (PAPS) reductase (gp56), a putative type II toxin-antitoxin module (gp69 and gp70), and a putative HNH endonuclease (gp71) that might be advantageous to the phage or its lysogen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>; discussed further below).</p><p>The &#x003d5;644-2 genome contains ten base 3' single-stranded extensions on the left (3'-GCGGGCGAAG-5') and right (5'-CGCCCGCTTC-3') (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In &#x003d5;E125, this sequence serves as a cohesive (<italic>cos</italic>) site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], suggesting that &#x003d5;644-2 uses the same <italic>cos </italic>site as &#x003d5;E125. The nucleotide sequence immediately downstream of gene<italic>36</italic>, which encodes a putative site-specific integrase, contained the candidate <italic>attP </italic>site of &#x003d5;644-2. It is characterized by a 30-bp sequence that was identical to the 3' end of a 90-bp serine tRNA (GGA) gene on the <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>K96243 small chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Interestingly, a 19-kb prophage-like island (GI13) is also integrated at this location in the <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>K96243 genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], although there is no sequence similarity between the two elements.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Inferred prophage islands</title><p>Twenty-four putative prophage or prophage-like regions were identified in 11 of the 20 <italic>Burkholderia </italic>strains (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1B</xref>). In addition, two GIs from K96243 (GI3 and GI15) were included in subsequent analysis since these also classify as putative prophage by our definition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We call these regions prophage islands (PI) defined as regions of the genome that were found to contain most if not all of the elements characteristic of prophages (see Materials and Methods), but have not been isolated and experimentally characterized. Most <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>and all <italic>B. multivorans </italic>strains were found to contain PIs; three were identified in <italic>B. thailandensis </italic>E264, one in <italic>B. xenovorans </italic>LB400, and none in any of the <italic>B. mallei </italic>strains. The three <italic>B. thailandensis </italic>E264 PIs, PI-E264-1, -2, and -3, correspond to <italic>B. thailandensis </italic>GI1, Bt GI13, and Bt GI12, respectively, as described by Yu et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], although the range of genes in the PIs described here differ slightly due to our criteria for inclusion. Similarly, PI-668-1 corresponds to GI15c from <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>MSHR668 in Tuanyok et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. As mentioned above, no PIs were detected in <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>1106a/b, although phage-like remnants were found in these strains. Overall, seventeen of the 24 identified regions were located on chromosome I of the respective bacterial strain, and all but five were putative prophages (i.e., most likely to be active prophages containing all of the prophage-like elements described in the Materials and Methods). Of the seven regions located on chromosome II, one (PI-E264-3) was classified as a putative prophage, while the remaining six were designated prophage-like.</p></sec><sec><title>Paired strains B. pseudomallei 1710a/b and B. pseudomallei 1106a/b</title><p>The two pairs <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>1710a/b and <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>1106a/b represent two bacterial strains isolated at different time points from the same two infected patients, isolated from the primary infection (a) and the relapse (b). We hypothesized that difference/s in sequence relating to the relapse or host selection would be detected, either in the form of SNPs/indels or as variation in the phage harbored within each strain. Three PIs were identified in each of the <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>1710 strains. PI-1710a/b-1 is immediately followed by PI-1710a/b-2 on chromosome I, separated by a tRNA pseudogene in each strain. This region is described as GI6b in Tuanyok et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. PI-1710a/b-3 is located further downstream on chromosome I. All three regions are nearly identical, averaging 98.4, 97.7, and 96.6% identity over 98.2, 97.1, and 96.2% of length (for -1, -2, and -3, respectively). PI-1710a-1 and PI-1710b-1 are 41.3 and 41.4 kb in length, respectively, and both are bounded by tRNA-Pseudo-2 and a 23 bp exact repeat of the 3' end of this tRNA. Both PI-1710a-2 and PI-1710b-2 are 60.6 kb in size and are bounded by tRNA-Pro-2 and a 49 bp exact repeat. The prophage-like regions in both strains (PI-1710a-3, PI-1710b-3) are defined by the presence of a phage integrase at the 3' end by tRNA-Thr-3, with several viral-like proteins immediately upstream, but no repeat region could be identified to define the 5' end. Both are 62.8 kb. Since the three prophage islands are nearly identical between <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>1710a and <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>1710b, from here on we will only refer to <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>1710b and associated prophage islands. These results indicate that the prophage in Bp 1710a/b were not excised and did not experience any significant changes even after passage through a host.</p><p>By the definitions set forth for prophage islands given in this work, no PIs were identified in either of the <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>1106 strains. Tuanyok et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] described 16 genomic islands in 1106a, one of which was identified as a putative prophage (GI10.2; BURPS1106A_3666 - 3701). However, this region also contains three transposases, and so was not considered in the analysis reported here.</p></sec><sec><title>Bacteriophage clusters</title><p>Results from the Dotter analysis allowed a preliminary clustering of prophages and prophage-like regions. These groups were further refined by examination of BLASTP protein distance data, resulting in the clustering of 32 of the 37 PIs and prophages into each of four groups (data not shown). Cluster composition was very similar between the three BLASTP-distance FITCH trees and agreed with DOTTER results, although branch positions varied slightly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Seven prophages/PIs clustered into the Siphoviridae-like group, so named because of the inclusion of the previously published bacteriophages &#x003d5;1026b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and &#x003d5;E125 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Bacteriophage &#x003d5;644-2, described in this study, is also a member of this group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Prophages in this group have long non-contractile tails and termini with cohesive ends. The <italic>cos </italic>site, present in &#x003d5;1026b and &#x003d5;E125, was identified in all other members of this group.</p><p>The Myoviridae-like group consists of 15 prophages/PIs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Phages in this group, identified by the inclusion of &#x003d5;K96243 (GI2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and &#x003d5;52237, typically have contractile tails and terminal repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Three subgroups were identified within the Myoviridae-like class (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Subgroup A contains &#x003d5;K96243, &#x003d5;52237, &#x003d5;E202, and four other prophages/PIs. Bacteriophage &#x003d5;E12-2 and five prophages/PIs clustered to form subgroup B, including two (PI-406E-2 and PI-S13-2) which appear to be more distantly related. The Mu-like Myoviridae group contains only two prophages: BcepMu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and &#x003d5;E255. Both left and right phage ends at the host/phage junction in BcepMu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] were located at the ends of &#x003d5;E255, with 95% and 91% identity, respectively. No significant identity was found between either of the two Mu-like prophages and any of the other prophages or prophage-like sequences.</p><p>Two undefined groups were also identified: undefined-1 contains four PIs, and undefined-2 has five (Fig.2). Interestingly, undefined-2 contains five of the eight PIs identified in the three <italic>B. multivorans </italic>strains. Finally, six sequences had no significant similarity to any other sequence and were thus considered unclustered, including PI-668-1, PI-406E-1, PI-LB400-1, GI3, Bcep22 and Bcep781.</p></sec><sec><title>Burkholderia bacteriophages are populated by morons</title><p>Genomic comparisons of all the phages in each class revealed that the genomes are arranged in mosaic structures. Each of the phylogenetic classes of phages contains distinct local collinear blocks (LCB), also called synteny blocks, which are differentially present among the phages in that group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Within each group, the synteny blocks are shuffled among the genomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), suggesting that several of the phages have undergone dramatic genomic rearrangements. In several instances, synteny blocks were either abruptly cut off at one end, or a predicted ORF appeared within the block in one genome, but was absent in other phages (see white areas within LCB in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). We hypothesized that these randomly occurring ORFs could be morons, i.e. genetic elements that integrate between adjacent phage genes, which may confer some additional fitness to the bacteriophage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Aside from being inserted among phage genes, morons usually (i) have their own transcriptional control system (a promoter, operator, and/or terminator), (ii) have a different GC content than the rest of the phage, and (iii) may be found in more than one class of phage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Comparative alignment of <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>phage and prophage-like regions</bold>.

For example, two different morons containing toxin-antitoxin modules were found among the Myoviridae and Siphoviridae groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Interestingly, the T-A module in the Myoviridae phages is similar to two modules present in other <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>and even <italic>B. mallei </italic>strains in regions containing phage remnants (data not shown), suggesting that this moron can persist even after the phage has been excised from the genome.</p><p>Several of the morons appeared to enhance the metabolic versatility of the host: aromatic compound degradation, iron transport and acquisition, and sulfate assimilation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). For example, it has been suggested that the PAPS reductase gene, which functions in the assimilatory sulfate reduction pathway, could serve as a fitness factor under conditions of iron limitation for the lysogens that harbor prophages encoding this enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. PAPS reductase genes were identified in three members of the Siphoviridae-like group, &#x003d5;E125, &#x003d5;644-2 and PI-E264-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), and in the Myoviridae-like B subgroup member PI-E264-2. The PAPS reductase moron incorporated between two highly conserved phage genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) at a location that appears to be an insertion hotspot, since the other members of this group contain different morons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and rectangles in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>Other morons appear to be associated with enhanced host or bacteriophage competitiveness. For example, morons within the Myoviridae, Undefined-1, Undefined-2, and Siphoviridae encode for the production of toxins that inhibit the growth of competing bacterial strains (bacteriocins) and/or their associated translocation mechanisms (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Other morons could prevent infection of their host by other phage, these include morons that encode for site-specific endonucleases, DNA methylases, restriction-modification systems, phage abortive infection resistance, and phage-growth limiting genes. Although we could not confirm that GI3 from K96243 contains morons (since LCB analysis was limited to those PIs that formed clusters), two separate reverse-transcriptase (RT) modules are encoded in this PI. Many phage-encoded RT described to date also function in phage resistance by directly targeting other phage DNA.</p><p>Lastly, some of the morons encode for proteins associated with bacterial virulence (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Two different morons encode patatin-like phospholipases (PTP), which in <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>can act as cytotoxins necessary for virulence in amoeba and contribute to lung injury in a mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Moreover, a prophage-encoded phosholipase in group A <italic>Streptococcus </italic>also appears to enhance virulence and its expression results in more severe disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Two other morons encode for a proteophosphoglycan and a lytic transglycosylase, both of which have been associated with virulence in other pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Thus, some phages in <italic>Burkholderia </italic>spp. might also be implicated in enhanced virulence.</p></sec><sec><title>Moron and phage genes are differentially expressed in Bp DD503</title><p>We performed transcription analysis using RNAseq to determine to what extent phage genes and morons are expressed in &#x003d5;1026b. The results demonstrate that most phage genes are normally not expressed in rich laboratory growth conditions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), and allowed us to determine at least one putative repressor that maintains such regulation. For &#x003d5;1026b, the candidate repressor gene (<italic>phi1026bp79</italic>) had a very high expression value which was 4-times higher than any of the phage structural or replication genes, (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The protein (gp78) contains a divergent AAA domain involved in ATP-binding and has similarities to other proteins annotated as transcriptional factors, such as YP_002500546 from <italic>Methylobacterium nodulans </italic>ORS 2060. Most of the phage morphogenesis and replication genes are only expressed at low levels, with many genes (54 of 89 genes) not having any detectable expression (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). In many phages, gene expression and lysogenic conversion occur only when the levels of the repressor protein drop below a certain threshold. None of the other phages identified in this study had proteins with homology to this putative repressor suggesting that their mechanisms of regulation are different.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>RNASeq analysis of gene expression of phage genes in Bp DD503.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Gene</th><th align="left">Annotation</th><th align="right">Expression value (RPKM)*</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp03</td><td align="left">putative portal protein</td><td align="right">3,601</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp05</td><td align="left">putative major capsid protein</td><td align="right">4,743</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp14</td><td align="left">putative tail length tape measure protein</td><td align="right">1,038</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp16</td><td align="left">hypothetical protein</td><td align="right">3,986</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>phi1026bp27</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>putative DNA adenine methylase</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>21,563</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>phi1026bp28</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>hypothetical protein</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>199,000</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>phi1026bp29</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>PAAR repeat-containing protein</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>186,000</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>phi1026bp30</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>VRR-NUC domain protein</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>132,500</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp31</td><td align="left">hypothetical protein</td><td align="right">77,624</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp32</td><td align="left">hypothetical protein</td><td align="right">8,751</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp33</td><td align="left">hypothetical protein</td><td align="right">17,084</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp34</td><td align="left">putative site-specific integrase</td><td align="right">5,746</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp36</td><td align="left">hypothetical protein</td><td align="right">23,220</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp37</td><td align="left">hypothetical protein</td><td align="right">80,994</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp38</td><td align="left">hypothetical protein</td><td align="right">16,224</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp44</td><td align="left">hypothetical protein</td><td align="right">2,494</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp48</td><td align="left">hypothetical protein</td><td align="right">2,501</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp51</td><td align="left">hypothetical protein</td><td align="right">26,846</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp59</td><td align="left">putative LysR family transcriptional regulator</td><td align="right">18,809</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp60</td><td align="left">putative major facilitator family permease</td><td align="right">29,669</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp61</td><td align="left">hypothetical protein</td><td align="right">33,472</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp62</td><td align="left">hypothetical protein</td><td align="right">46,783</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp63</td><td align="left">hypothetical protein</td><td align="right">10,273</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp64</td><td align="left">hypothetical protein</td><td align="right">219,500</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp65</td><td align="left">hypothetical protein</td><td align="right">220,000</td></tr><tr><td align="left">phi1026bp78</td><td align="left">hypothetical protein</td><td align="right">4,184</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>phi1026bp79**</italic></td><td align="left"><italic>putative transcriptional regulator</italic></td><td align="right"><italic>59,976</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>phi1026bp81</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>XRE familiy putative transcriptional regulator</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>53,561</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>phi1026bp82</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>addiction module toxin, RelE/StbE family</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>92,307</bold></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*Genes in <bold>bold </bold>belong to morons.

In this report we have characterized and classified 37 prophages, putative prophages, and prophage-like elements identified from several <italic>Burkholderia </italic>species and strains within species. Five spontaneously produced bacteriophages of lysogenic <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>and <italic>B. thailandensis </italic>were isolated and characterized, including their host range, genome structure, and gene content. Using bioinformatic techniques, 24 putative prophages and prophage-like elements were identified within whole genome sequences of various <italic>Burkholderia </italic>species. Interestingly, while putative prophages were found in all but one of the <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>strains none were detected in any of the <italic>B. mallei </italic>strains searched. The <italic>B. mallei </italic>genome is nearly identical to that of <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>, differing by several contiguous gene clusters in <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>that appear to have been deleted from <italic>B. mallei</italic>, and it is hypothesized that <italic>B. mallei </italic>evolved from a single <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. If true, it is likely that this <italic>B. pseudomallei </italic>strain had at least one prophage within its genome that was excised from <italic>B. mallei </italic>leaving behind a toxin-antitoxin module. The prophage excision was part of a major host adaptation in <italic>B. mallei </italic>that also removed ~1200 other genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, <italic>B. mallei </italic>is largely confined to a mammalian host in nature and is less likely to be exposed to new bacteriophages in this niche relative to other <italic>Burkholderia </italic>species that are commonly found in the soil/plant rhizosphere. Taken together, prophage elimination and limited prophage acquisition probably account for the lack of functional prophages in the <italic>B. mallei </italic>genome.</p><p>Sequences of the five isolated and sequenced bacteriophages, the 24 inferred prophages, and eight previously published <italic>Burkholderia </italic>prophages or putative prophages were classified based on nucleotide and protein sequence similarity, and an unrooted radial tree was constructed to estimate genetic relatedness between them. Several sequences could be classified as Siphoviridae-like, Myoviridae-like, or Mu-like Myoviridae based on similarity to phages known to be members of these groups. Additionally, two novel groups were detected, and five prophages/PIs could not be grouped with other phages. For the most part the phage groups were represented across all species and strains, with the notable exception of the undefined-2 group, which is composed primarily of <italic>B. multivorans</italic>-derived PIs (five from <italic>B. multivorans</italic>, one from <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>), albeit loosely related. Further work that includes prophages derived from environmental and clinical isolates from other <italic>Burkholderia </italic>species as well as from other microbes is needed to refine these relationships.</p><p><italic>Burkholderia </italic>spp. are responsible for a number of potentially devastating infectious diseases for which no vaccines currently exist. The presence of a wide variety of bacteriophages within these bacteria opens the possibility that phage therapy may be developed to augment present antibiotic treatments. We present here a detailed comparative analysis of gene content within and between groups of bacteriophages, putative prophages, and prophage-like regions in various <italic>Burkholderia </italic>species and strains. Several interesting genes and gene groups associated with pathogenicity and various metabolic functions were identified within specific groups. This study provides the first estimate of the relative contribution of prophages to the vast phenotypic diversity found among the <italic>Burkholderiae</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CMR and LL conducted data analyses, comparative genomics, and wrote manuscript.
