However, since single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within a linkage disequilibrium (LD) region are statistically indistinguishable from each other, these studies essentially reveal LD blocks that are associated with a gene expression but do not reveal the potential causative regulatory SNPs, which limits the utility of these studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.

However, to prioritize eQTL SNPs, these methods have utilized the regulatory information either retrospectively or to estimate an empirical prior probability for the SNPs. Such approaches are prone to missing regulatory SNPs with small effects due to the severe multiple testing correction (or sparsity constraints)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Furthermore, these approaches ignore interaction between the region harbouring the SNP and the target gene, which is useful in identifying regulators specific to a gene. Multiple SNPs are known to regulate single genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, yet many current methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> limit the number of causal SNPs per gene to a single SNP. In this paper, we introduce a new method, expression quantitative trait enhancer loci (eQTeL), which addresses these limitations. It identifies combination of regulatory SNPs&#x02014;including SNPs with small effect sizes&#x02014;that jointly determine expression variance.</p><p>eQTeL is a fully Bayesian approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), which infers cis regulatory polymorphisms underlying gene expression variability by integrating: (i) genotype and gene-expression variance across individuals; (ii) epigenetic data in appropriate cell types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>; (iii) DNAse I hypersensitivity (DHS) variance of SNPs and promoters across cell types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>; (iv) expression variance of genes across multiple cell types; (v) LD blocks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>; and (vi) imputed haplotypes inferred from the 1,000 Genomes Project<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Our approach addresses a number of key methodological challenges. First, it systematically integrates three characteristics of a causal regulatory eQTL, that is, correlation with the target genes expression across individuals, the regulatory properties of the harbouring region, and interaction with the target gene. Second, it can account for heterogeneity of regulatory regions in terms of different combinations of epigenetic marks. Third, to learn the regulatory model, eQTeL leverages regulatory polymorphisms that are not associated with gene expression in addition to expression-regulators. Fourth, it interrogates the LD structure to find the optimal combination of explanatory SNPs. Fifth, it implements a hierarchical scheme to select a sparse set of SNPs, while simultaneously explaining a maximal fraction of gene expression variance. Finally, eQTeL is scalable to large datasets.</p><p>We statistically validated our method using human heart data as well as realistic simulated data and demonstrated that it can predict an individual's expression from the genotype more accurately compared to other methods. SNPs identified by our method include regulatory SNPs with small effect sizes. Further assessment of functional relevance of identified SNPs suggest that they tend to (i) overlap a high resolution DNAse footprint, (ii) have an allele-specific DNAse footprint, (iii) preferentially disrupt putative binding of core cardiac regulators and (iv) be spatially proximal to their putative target gene. We also estimate that 58&#x00025; of SNPs identified by eQTeL (which we call eeSNPs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>) are likely to be causal. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that eeSNPs have functional role.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Quantitative Trait enhancer Loci (eQTeL) model</title><p>We first provide a broad overview of the eQTeL model and further details can be found in Methods. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, eQTeL is composed of two Bayesian regression models, an expression model and a regulatory model, which are coupled through message passing. The expression model is a Bayesian variable selection model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> which explains the gene expression variance among samples as a linear function of SNP alleles. A distinct feature of the expression model is that it uses informative prior for each SNP, which depends on the SNPs regulatory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and interaction potential. The regulatory model, which is common for all genes, uses a Bayesian logistic regression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> to estimate that informative prior as a probabilistic function of epigenetic and interaction features. Known expression regulators can be used to train the regulatory model, while an accurate model of regulatory and interaction potential can help to identify expression regulators. The expression model then passes current estimates of expression regulators to the regulatory model, which in passes current estimates of regulatory and interaction priors for each SNP back to the expression model. eQTeL starts with estimating expression regulators assuming equal priors for each SNP and then, using current estimates of expression-regulators, trains the regulatory-model. In turn, current estimates of regulatory and interaction potential are used as informative priors to re-estimate expression regulators. This iterative process continues until convergence. Thus, our eQTeL model gradually improves estimation accuracy by joint learning.</p><p>In our approach (see equations below and Methods for details), expression <italic>Y</italic> relates to candidate SNPs <italic>X</italic> via a standard normal linear model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> with noise <italic>&#x003c3;</italic><sup>2</sup>. However, for each SNP <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, its effect size is non-zero only if its regulatory-interaction indicator <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> is 1, which depends on a function <italic>&#x003d5;</italic>&#x02032;<italic>(&#x003b8;)</italic> of regulatory-interaction potential <italic>&#x003b8;</italic> (Methods). The potential <italic>&#x003b8;</italic> of a SNP is modelled as a combination of (i) features for regulatory potential and (ii) features for SNP-gene interaction P, via a logistic function. Vector <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> represents feature weights that are shared across all genes, thus we learn a single genome-wide model of regulators. This choice of modelling <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> obviates the need to explicitly scale genetic and epigenetic factors.</p><p><disp-formula id="eq1"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e433" xlink:href="ncomms9555-m1.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>We use Markov chain Monte Carlo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> to infer all model parameters jointly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). At each iteration of the sampler, the decision whether a region is a regulator (that is, <italic>&#x003b8;</italic>=1) depends not only on correlation between corresponding SNP and gene but also on the regulatory and interaction features, as well as the current estimates of feature weights. This leads to a semi-supervised<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> clustering of SNPs into regulators and non-regulators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). Our Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation explicitly uses LD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> block information to judiciously choose combination of regulatory SNPs by sampling over the model space hierarchically<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> at the top level it explores combinations of LD blocks and at the lower level it explores the sparse set of SNPs within each LD block that optimally explain the expression-variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). This approach results in a superior exploration of the model space relative to approaches that disregard the LD structure. eQTeL uses a Rao&#x02013;Blackwell estimate of <italic>&#x003b8;</italic> that improves the mixing rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) of the sampler and leads to robust competition between SNPs within a LD block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Further, the overall sparsity constraint (equivalent to a multiple testing correction in non-Bayesian approaches) of eQTeL is controlled by two factors: (i) the fraction of SNPs that are interacting-regulators and (ii) the fraction of interacting-regulators that are expression-regulators. This allows for a less conservative sparsity constraint and makes it possible to identify SNPs with small effect sizes which are typically missed by alternative approaches because of severe multiple testing correction. eQTeL assumes Normal priors on <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>. Finally, eQTeL implementation allows an option to select a subset of epigenetic factors important for estimating regulatory potential through Bayesian variable selection model.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>eQTeL detects expression regulatory SNP in MAGNet</title><p>We applied eQTeL to genotype and gene expression data for 313 human hearts (procured by MAGNet consortium (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.med.upenn.edu/magnet/">www.med.upenn.edu/magnet/</ext-link>)) and compared with the performance of other eQTL methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Notes 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">3</xref>). To determine regulatory and interaction potentials, we used 95 epigenetic and interaction features (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) for primary tissues and cell lines of heart from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome project<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. For expediency we selected 1,880 genes with expression deemed to have a significant genetic component according to the univariate eQTL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>Consistent with its ability to explain a greater expression variance, eQTeL also predicts expression of genes much more accurately compared with other methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The mean (cross-validated) Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and actual expression is 0.176&#x000b1;0.065 (in contrast with 0.025 for eqtnminer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and 0.088 for LASSO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). The bimodality of distribution of correlation coefficient implies that for a subset of genes, the expressions are highly predictable by eQTeL.</p><p>Because of its ability to discriminate among multiple SNPs based on regulatory and interaction potentials, eQTeL is expected to be much more advantageous on imputed data, which has a substantially greater number of linked SNPs. To confirm this, we imputed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> &#x0223c;6.5 million SNPs using the 1,000 Genome Project data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Note that each imputed SNP is derived from the reference SNPs using the linkage information, and cannot be any more associated (in a statistical sense) with the gene expression than the reference SNPs, and therefore are not expected to increase the explained variance (as evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). However, eQTeL with imputation is expected to improve detection of causal functional SNPs compared with the genotyped SNPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Therefore, restricting our search to potentially functional SNPs, imputed SNPs should explain the expression better. Restricting our analysis only to SNPs mapped to a DNAse footprint (as a proxy for putative functional SNPs), the relative advantage of imputation with eQTeL becomes evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Indeed, with imputed data, there is no significant improvement in detection of likely causal SNPs if standard eQTL approaches are used. Therefore it becomes imperative to use an integrative approach, such as eQTeL, in the presence of a large number of linked SNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p>To validate eeSNPs in an independent cohort, we analysed expression and genotype of 85 left ventricle samples from GTEx<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). We note that compared to an exhaustive eQTL, eQTeL cannot identify novel associated loci, but instead is designed to identify putatively causal SNPs within an associated locus. We found that 18.9&#x00025; of eGenes detected in MAGNet replicates in GTEx (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). To assess the relative generalizablity of eQTeL in independent cohort, using the eeSNPs identified by eQTeL in MAGNet, we estimated the explained variance in GTEx. We repeated this for other methods while controlling for the number of eeSNPs as well as other regularization procedures. While, as expected due to the differences in the datasets, the cross-cohort explained variance is lower than that within MAGNet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref> versus 2d), relative to other methods, eQTeL exhibits substantially and significantly greater (in both cases Wilcoxon test <italic>P</italic> value between eQTeL and other methods is &#x0003c;1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>) cross-data set generalizability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>eQTeL detects causal SNPs in semi-synthetic data</title><p>To demonstrate that eQTeL can accurately identify putatively causal SNPs, we use a synthetic data evaluation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) (for additional details refer to Methods). We used 174,800 SNP probes along with their genotypes from 313 MAGNet samples that were within 1&#x02009;MB from transcription start of 200 genes (Methods). Since regulatory region may have no effect on genes included in our analyses and yet can contribute to learning the regulatory-model, eQTeL makes a distinction between a regulator and a gene-specific expression-regulator. This distinction was made explicitly in our simulation by designating 1&#x00025; of all SNPs as regulators (as an approximation of previous estimation in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). We then used a frequency distribution of expression regulators per gene inferred from MAGNet data to randomly choose gene-specific expression-regulators for 200 genes. Using allele status of 313 samples for expression-regulators, we generated gene expression and added random noise such that expected explained variance from simulated data matched MAGNets explained variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We generated the epigenetic features for each SNP using ENCODE epigenetic data and validated heart-enhancers from VISTA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Thus our simulated data closely parallels the experimental data.</p><p>Next we applied eQTeL to the simulated data. The precision-recall plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>) shows that eQTeL significantly outperforms other methods. In fact, the performance of full-eQTeL is close to the theoretically best eQTeL model that uses the original feature weights (see Methods). The previous integrative method eqtnminer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, the only other current method that uses epigenetic data in eQTL, shows only a modest increase in precision compared to methods that do not use epigenetic data.</p><p>The immediate effect of increase in precision of detecting expression regulators, especially for SNPs with high regulatory potential, is that eQTeL explains a significantly greater proportion of expression variability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). There is also significant improvement in correlation between predicted expression and actual gene expression; mean correlation for eQTeL was 0.298 &#x02212;&#x0002b;0.02 (compared with 0.18 for eqtnminer and 0.23 for LASSO regression, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Note that for this analysis we controlled for the number of SNPs that were selected for each method, using the most explanatory respective SNPs for each method. Overall, eQTeL can accurately identify around 75&#x00025; of putative causal SNPs (at 40&#x00025; recall) reinforcing the fact that our method can identify substantial fraction of likely causal genetic determinants of transcriptomic variance.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>eQTeL detects SNPs with small effect sizes</title><p>The statistical power to detect SNPs associated with expression variance (that is, the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis that the SNP is not associated with gene expression) depends on various factors such as sample size, noise to signal ratio, number of hypothesis tested (number of SNPs) and effect size of SNP. The effect size, in turn, depends on the allele frequency of SNP, thus low allele frequency limits statistical power to detect regulatory SNPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Another advantage of eQTeL model is that it can detect SNPs with small effect sizes by distributing sparsity between: (a) sparsity in the number of regulators and, (b) sparsity in expression regulators among all regulators. eQTeL employs relatively relaxed sparsity constraints for SNPs that have high regulatory potential and therefore the model has higher statistical power to retrieve a greater fraction of SNPs with low minor allele frequency (small effect sizes) compared to eqtnminer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Furthermore, eQTeLs statistical power to identify low minor allele frequency SNPs is greater among SNPs with high regulatory-interacting potential (labelled as eQTeL-high in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). This trend of differential statistical power is also observed in simulated data, where we know the exact effect size of regulatory SNPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>eQTeL leverages LD information to judiciously choose combinations of SNPs (per gene) which explains a much greater proportion of expression variance (details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). The power to detect SNPs with low allele frequency is the primary reason that eQTeL captures substantial proportion of causal genetic determinants underlying transcriptomic variance. However, it should be noted that SNPs with small effect sizes are only detected by eQTeL if they have a high regulatory potential.</p><p>eQTeLs performance gain is potentially due to two factors: (i) integration of epigenetic data, (ii) allowing multiple causal variants per gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.

However, in the absence of epigenomic data, that is, when using standard LASSO, we do not see a performance gain, and in general, the performance is substantially worse than the performance of eQTeL.

First, eQTeL can only detect cis-eQTL and not trans-eQTL. Second, like other model-based association methods, eQTeL's computational speed is a bottleneck; however, using parallel cores and certain reasonable compromises in parameter estimation procedure, the computational burden can be substantially reduced. Third, eQTeL assumes normality of expression data, therefore the expression data needs to be pre-processed accordingly,which can be particularly problematic for certain kinds of high throughput data. Fourth, eQTeL can only detect SNPs with small effect size if they have high regulatory potential.

For all other SNPs epigenetic features were generated from random SNP background.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Motif binding score differential</title><p>For each of the 981 vertebrate TF motif from TRANSFAC database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, we scanned the 50&#x02009;bps flanking eeSNPs (and for 10,000 control SNPs randomly sampled from 300,000 SNPs) for the presence of motif using pwmscan tool<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, separately for the major and the minor allele. Only the cases where at one of the two alleles had a motif hits (<italic>P</italic> value&#x0003c;0.0002) were further considered. For each such case, the difference in the binding score for the two alleles was computed, as the difference in log(<italic>P</italic> value). For each motif, the binding differential score for eeSNPs and the control SNPs were compared using Wilcoxon test and the motifs which had at least 1.5-fold greater differential among eSNPs and a <italic>P</italic> value&#x0003c;0.05 were identified.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>DNAse footprint enrichment</title><p>From<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> we obtained a list of genomic locations, for 41 different cell-types, where significant evidence of <italic>in vitro</italic> protein binding event were detected using DNAse-footprint.

Heterozygousity at each SNP locus was ascertained by the presence of multiple alleles among the reads mapping to the SNP location. For each such locus, the allelic imbalance was calculated as the difference in the number of reads mapped to each allele. The allelic imbalance was plotted against the overall signal intensity rank.</p><p>ChIA-pet assay identified spatially proximal genomic regions where at least one of the region is bound by PolII. Because ChiA-pet data is unavailable for heart-related cell types, we pooled multiple ChiA-pet data from <italic>K562, Hela, Nb4 and MCF7</italic>. For each 50&#x02009;bps flanking an eeSNP (or control SNP) and the target promoter pair, number of ChIA-pet reads supporting the spatial proximity of the two loci were recorded. The ChiA-pet support for each SNP-gene pair was then compared for different methods after controlling for the genomic distance between the SNP and its target gene.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figs 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">7</xref>, median &#x02018;white' lines represent LOESS (local regression) for each method.

It outputs regulatory SNPs and their target genes, their effect sizes and regulatory-interaction potentials, as well as estimated feature importance of each epigenetic and interaction feature. (<bold>b</bold>) eQTeL is composed of two coupled regression models (i) a Bayesian variable selection with informative priors models expression as a linear combination of SNPs. Given the regulatory and interaction priors, this hierarchical model first identifies LD blocks and then combinations of SNPs that explains expression variance and that also have high regulatory and interaction potentials. (ii) A Bayesian logistic regression specifies the regulatory and interaction potential as linear model of epigenetic and interaction features in semi-supervised manner. The logistic regression passes the regulatory and interaction potentials to the variable selection model, while the variable selection model passes expression-regulators to the logistic regression model.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ncomms9555-f1"/></fig><fig id="f2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Comparative performance of different methods applied to human heart data (MAGNet).</title><p>The analysis is based on 2428 SNPs identified by eQTeL for which posterior probability of selection &#x0003e;0.5.
