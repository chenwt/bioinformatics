The contribution of regulation of mRNA translation during myogenesis has not been studied so far. We monitored translation during myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, using a simplified protocol for ribosome footprint profiling. Comparison of ribosome footprints to total RNA showed that gene expression is mostly regulated at the transcriptional level. However, a subset of transcripts, enriched for mRNAs encoding for ribosomal proteins, was regulated at the level of translation. Enrichment was also found for specific pathways known to regulate muscle biology. We developed a dedicated pipeline to identify translation initiation sites (TISs) and discovered 5333 unannotated TISs, providing a catalog of upstream and alternative open reading frames used during myogenesis. We identified 298 transcripts with a significant switch in TIS usage during myogenesis, which was not explained by alternative promoter usage, as profiled by DeepCAGE. Also these transcripts were enriched for ribosomal protein genes. This study demonstrates that differential mRNA translation controls protein expression of specific subsets of genes during myogenesis. Experimental protocols, analytical workflows, tools and data are available through public repositories&#x000a0;(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lumc.github.io/ribosome-profiling-analysis-framework/">http://lumc.github.io/ribosome-profiling-analysis-framework/</ext-link>).</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="21"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>19 May 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Myogenesis, the formation and maintenance of skeletal muscles, occurs during embryogenesis and muscle regeneration. During embryonic development, muscle progenitor cells are committed to the myogenic program and become myoblasts. Myoblasts fuse to form multinucleated myotubes, which will give rise to muscle fibers. During muscle regeneration, the process is similar. Satellite cells are differentiated into myoblasts, which can fuse with existing myotubes to repair the adult muscle tissue (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanisms controlling myogenesis at the transcriptional level are well characterized. Several myogenic transcription factors, including MYF5, MYOD1, MYOG, MEF2 and MYF6, are expressed at different stages of myogenesis to tightly control the transcription of numerous muscle-specific genes encoding contractile proteins and to reorganize cell metabolism (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Less is known about the control of myogenesis at the level of mRNA translation. Several mechanisms enhance or repress translation through RNA binding proteins or <named-content content-type="no-hyphen">miRNAs</named-content> (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The presence of translational enhancers able to interact with translation initiation complexes and increase protein synthesis have been reported also in the context of skeletal muscle differentiation, where they target crucial differentiation factors (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, a genome wide overview of translational regulation, as it exists for transcription (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), is missing. Therefore we set out to investigate control of mRNA translation during myogenesis, with a focus on translation initiation.</p><p>Regulation at the translational level defines not only the abundance of a protein, but also the identity through the use of alternative translation initiation sites (TISs). Translation can initiate upstream or downstream of the primary open reading frame (pORF). TISs located in the 5&#x02032; untranslated region (5&#x02032;-UTR) of a transcript may give rise to upstream open reading frames (uORFs) or protein isoforms with extended N-termini (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Translation of the uORF may have various consequences for the translation of the pORF: uORFs may repress translation, induce translation of protein isoforms truncated at their N-termini or even enhance translation of the pORF (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). TISs located in the coding region of the pORF may give rise to N-terminal truncated isoforms, with possibly different biological functions (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The complexity of the translatome is further increased by the presence of dual coding regions, nucleotide sequences that can be translated in more than one reading frame (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Recent studies based on ribosome footprint profiling have reported extensive regulation of protein expression at the translational level, in particular as a part of stress responses, but also under normal physiological conditions (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Translational regulation is mostly exerted at the level of translation initiation, whereas translational elongation rates are more constant across conditions (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In mammals, between 50 and 65% of transcripts have been reported to contain at least two TISs (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), more than 50% of which are located upstream of the pORF. Nonetheless, to what extent gene expression is regulated at translational level is still being debated. A major role for translational regulation was hinted by studies that found a poor correlation between total mRNA and protein levels (20% (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) or no more than 40% (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>)). However, other studies reported a much higher correlation (up to 80% (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>)) and suggested that previously observed discrepancies between mRNA and protein levels were mainly of technical nature. Nevertheless, there is a role for translational regulation, at least for subsets of (functionally linked) proteins (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>To explore how and to what extent myogenesis is regulated at translational level in mammalian skeletal muscles, we monitored translation at nucleotide resolution in a genome-wide high-throughput manner, using ribosome profiling on the murine C2C12 cell line, a model for skeletal muscle differentiation. Ribosome profiling (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) is a method based on deep-sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments that are recovered from mRNAs engaged by ribosomes, after digestion of non-protected regions of the mRNAs. Even though the ribosome profiling technique has been standardized and used in several studies (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), the isolation and sequencing of the ribosome footprints is laborious and the analysis represents a challenge due to short read length and noise surrounding genuine TISs. We simplified the existing protocol and developed a data analysis pipeline to characterize translation initiation during differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes, to detect switches in the use of alternative TISs, as well as to quantify translation. We further investigated the extent of translational control over transcriptional control by comparing ribosome profiling data with RNAseq, miRNA-seq and DeepCAGE data. miRNA-seq data was used to investigate the contribution of miRNAs in the regulation of gene expression at translational level. DeepCAGE data was used to identify transcription start sites (TSSs) and detect switches in the use of alternative promoters; this allowed us to discriminate between switches in TISs usage due to changes in the transcriptome and switches purely controlled during translation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Mouse myoblasts C2C12 were grown on collagen-coated plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% glucose and 2% glutamax (Invitrogen).

First strand cDNA was generated using random primers. Second strand was generated using dUTP instead of dTTP to tag the second strand. Subsequent steps to generate the sequencing libraries were performed with the NebNext kit for Illumina sequencing with the following modifications: after adapter ligation to the dsDNA fragments, libraries were treated with USER enzyme (NEB M5505L) in order to digest the second strand derived fragments. Amplified libraries were pooled and sequenced in one single lane. Paired-end (2 &#x000d7; 100 bps) sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2000. miRNAseq libraries were prepared starting from purified small RNAs isolated with mirVana miRNA Isolation kit (Ambion) according to manufacturer's instructions.

Peak calling was then performed after combining footprints from three independent biological replicates. Each position with a coverage of at least 20 reads was analysed and called if the following conditions were met: the peak had higher coverage compared to any peak located 3, 6, 9, 12 or 15 bases upstream; the peak showed a triplet periodicity pattern (the two nucleotides following the peak had a summed coverage 40% or lower than the total coverage of that codon); the five codons downstream should not contain a base with a coverage higher than that of the peak analysed; the five downstream codons, when having a coverage of at least 10% of the peak analysed, should show a triplet periodicity pattern. Once a peak was called, the analysis continued at the next nucleotide, allowing the detection of TISs in different frames. For each gene, the TIS with the highest coverage was kept as reference, and any other TISs which had a coverage lower than 10% of the reference TIS was discarded for further analysis. For each called TIS, the coverage of that peak in each individual sample was reported. TISs were then classified into six categories: annotated TIS, 5&#x02032;-UTR (or unannotated 5&#x02032;-UTR) TIS, coding TIS, 3&#x02032;-UTR TIS and multiple TIS. TISs mapping in position &#x02212;12, &#x02212;11 and &#x02212;10 nt relative to the start codon were reported as annotated TISs. TISs mapping upstream of position &#x02212;12 were annotated as 5&#x02032;-UTR TISs (or unannotated 5&#x02032;-UTR TISs if the TIS was not located in the 5&#x02032;-UTR sequence present in the transcript's reference sequence), TISs located between position &#x02212;10 and the stop codon were annotated as coding TISs, TISs located after the stop codon were annotated as 3&#x02032;-UTR TISs, TISs which fell in more than one category were annotated as multiple (unless one of the categories was annotated TIS, which was then the only one reported). Peaks located 5 kb downstream of the annotated start codon (counted as transcript positions, not genome) were not considered for downstream analysis. The background noise in these regions was higher, likely because the ribosomes were not allowed sufficient time to finish the translation of transcripts on which they had already engaged in the elongation phase at the start of the harringtonin treatment.

The conversion is usually accomplished by ligation of single stranded adapters to the 3&#x02032; ends of the RNA footprints, followed by reverse transcription and circularization. The circular template is then used for polymerase chain reaction amplification (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Each of these steps may be subject to certain biases. We simplified the existing method by converting the ribosome footprints into sequencing libraries with a standard small RNA sample preparation protocol, which avoids the multistep circularization procedure. Double stranded RNA adapters were ligated to the small RNA footprints, reverse transcribed and directly amplified for sequencing. This resulted in high quality ribosome footprints, as evidenced from the analyses described below. The complete protocol is available in the extended experimental procedures.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Generation and quality control of the ribosome profiling datasets.

In case of initiating ribosomes, the first nucleotide of each read is usually 12 nt upstream of the start of the codon that is being translated (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). These characteristics are commonly used as metrics for the quality of ribosome profiling data. We developed a custom script to analyze the triplet periodicity pattern by converting the first position of the aligned reads to transcript coordinates and relating those coordinates to annotated TISs and the reading frame downstream of the annotated TIS. The script reports the number of reads mapping to the first, second and third nucleotide of each codon for all detected coding transcripts and the number of reads in each position relative to the annotated TIS. The results of this procedure clearly show in our data that &#x0223c;80% of reads mapped to the first nucleotide of each codon, as expected from previous studies (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> top, 1C, Supplementary Table S1). For all samples, a major peak was observed at &#x02212;12 nt from the annotated TIS, which is in accordance with previously reported data on the size and the position of the fragment protected by the ribosome (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). A higher percentage of 5&#x02032; end reads mapping &#x02212;12 nt from the annotated TIS was also observed for footprints generated by halting initiation of translation (harringtonin treated cells) compared to footprints generated by halting translation elongation (cycloheximide treated cells), as expected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><p>The alignment of short (28&#x02013;29 nt (Supplementary Figure S1)) ribosome footprints represents a challenge because footprints often span splice junctions, with short overhangs on either side of the junction. We calculated that 5421 murine transcripts (Supplementary Table S2) contain a TIS that is not mappable by standard genome alignment, because the TIS is located within a splice junction or it is located &#x0003c;15 nt upstream or downstream an exon&#x02013;exon junction. Common procedures to avoid loss of reads crossing exon&#x02013;exon junctions use splicing-aware short-read alignment programs such as TopHat v1 (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Alternatively, reads were mapped to the genome reference using a standard short read aligner, followed by the mapping of unaligned reads to known splice junctions using TopHat v1 (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Both analyses are potentially flawed by the suboptimal performance of TopHat v1 on reads that are as short as 30 nt. Even though the upgraded TopHat2 performs better in the alignment of exon&#x02013;exon junction reads that extend 10 nt or less into one of the exons (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), its performance has been optimized for long paired-end reads. Another problem in the genomic mapping of short RNA-derived reads is the presence of pseudogenes. The alternative of mapping exclusively to the transcriptome is also not ideal because it may miss hits in unannotated transcripts or in unannotated parts of transcripts, such as alternative first exons (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>).</p><p>To overcome these limitations, we performed a combination of transcriptome and genome alignment. Footprint reads were aligned to a transcriptome reference, and only reads that did not map to the transcriptome were aligned to the genome (Supplementary Table S3). Mapping first to the transcriptome and then to the genome slightly reduced the number of reads mapping to pseudogenes (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). The coordinates from the reads mapping to the transcriptome were converted to genomic coordinates and then combined with the mappings from the genome alignment. The improvements obtained by the combined alignment can be appreciated by the recovery of &#x0223c;30% of otherwise unmappable reads. These reads are likely genuine ribosome footprints as they show a triplet periodicity identical to the reads that do not span exon&#x02013;exon junctions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, bottom).</p><p>A dynamic local peak calling algorithm was then developed to identify TISs in the ribosome footprint data from harringtonin treated cells. The developed algorithm evaluates the signal in the region surrounding each peak, takes into account the triplet periodicity in the nearby codons and is able to report start codons in different frames.

Footprints mapping to protein-coding genes were preferentially 29 nt long, whereas footprints from non-coding genes did not show this preference in length.

For 8 out of 9 analyzed myomiRrs, the correlation in fold change of their targets was not significantly different from the general correlation (Supplementary Table S11, Figure S3). These data suggest that miRNA regulation does not contribute strongly to the observed translational regulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>We continued our comparison of transcriptome and translatome by performing a pathway enrichment analysis (Supplementary Table S12) on the subsets of genes showing discordant regulation. mRNAs coding for ribosomal proteins displayed the highest enrichment in the subset of genes showing opposite regulation between transcription and translation (these genes were downregulated at translational level but upregulated at transcriptional level, <italic>P</italic>-value 2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>), and in the subset of genes downregulated only at translational level (<italic>P</italic>-value 3.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;13</sup>). mRNAs involved in the proteasome pathway showed a moderate enrichment in the subset of oppositely regulated genes (<italic>P</italic>-value 3.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>), followed by mRNAs involved in focal adhesion (<italic>P</italic>-value 3.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>), regulation of actin cytoskeleton (<italic>P</italic>-value 7.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) and calcium signaling (<italic>P</italic>-value 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>).

Similar high correlations were observed for all the other pathways, except for ribosomal protein genes.

The above described dynamic local peak calling algorithm was used to discriminate between noise and genuine initiation sites in the surrounding region of each peak. We detected a total of 6823 TISs in myoblasts (Supplementary Table S13) and 2371 TISs in myotubes (Supplementary Table S14), corresponding to 4106 and 1561 coding genes, respectively. Our analysis showed that &#x0223c;45% of the detected genes in myoblasts had two or more TISs, whereas in myotubes the percentage was slightly lower (&#x0223c;30%) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

A considerable amount of footprints (&#x0223c;30%) were found within coding regions, &#x0223c;5% of which led to in-frame ORFs, hinting at alternative start codons for protein isoforms with truncated N-termini for 107 genes in myoblasts and 50 genes in myotubes. No general shift in the localization of TISs was observed during myogenic differentiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Around 55% of the footprints in the detected TISs contained the canonical AUG codon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Notably, footprints of TISs located in the 5&#x02032;-UTRs were enriched for alternative codons, primarily CUG and GUG, in accordance with the notion that uORFs frequently use weaker, non-canonical start codons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Footprints of TISs located in the unannotated 5&#x02032;-UTRs were also mainly mapping to the non-canonical codons CUG and GUG (Supplementary Tables S15 and S16), except in myoblasts where the percentage of footprints with a canonical AUG codon was higher (32 against 16% in myotubes). This discrepancy mainly originated from footprints mapping to two TISs, corresponding to the highly expressed splicing factor <italic>Sf3b6</italic> and mitochondrial gene <italic>Prelid1</italic> (Supplementary Figure S4). These two detected TISs were followed by a stop codon upstream of the pORFs, according to the genomic sequence, but no TISs were detected at the annotated start codons, which may be due to the sort distance between uORF and annotated TIS. Since the unannotated 5&#x02032;-UTR sequence may contain intronic sequences, it is impossible to determine whether these TISs represent uORFs or genuine start codons from wrongly annotated genes.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Alternative translation initiation sites used during myogenesis.

Sixty percent of the detected TISs located in the 5&#x02032;-UTRs were leading to stop codons prior the start of the pORFs (corresponding to 1274 TISs and 380 TISs in myoblasts and myotubes, respectively) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The length of these uORFs ranged from 1 to more 100 amino acids (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>), but the majority (&#x0223c;85%) were between 1&#x02013;30 amino acids (50% was shorter than 10 amino acids). The remaining 40% of the TISs located in 5&#x02032;-UTRs were not leading to stop codons prior the start of the pORF, but &#x0223c;72% of these uORFs was in a different reading frame than the pORFs, leading to overlapping uORFs, whereas the remaining 28% was in-frame with the pORF, suggesting the presence of isoforms with extended N-termini (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). The length of the overlapping uORFs was longer than the one of the non-overlapping uORFs, reaching up to 400 amino acids and with only &#x0223c;40% being shorter than 30 amino acids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). We then investigated whether the usage of TISs in the 5&#x02032;-UTRs sequences was associated with the presence of known regulatory elements, such as Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRESs) and Terminal Oligopyrimidine Tracts (5&#x02032; TOP). A significant enrichment of predicted IRES was found in transcripts with TISs in the 5&#x02032;-UTRs, compared to transcripts for which we detected TISs only in the annotated start codon and in the coding region. 36% of the transcripts containing TISs in the 5&#x02032;-UTR had IRESs (Supplementary Table S17), whereas the percentage dropped to 24 for transcript without TISs in their 5&#x02032;-UTRs in myoblasts (27 against 20% in myotubes, respectively). No significant enrichment was found for predicted 5&#x02032; TOPs (Supplementary Table S18), and overall the percentage of transcripts with a TIS in the 5&#x02032;-UTR and the presence of a predicted 5&#x02032; TOP was lower compared to the percentage of transcripts containing predicted IRES (&#x0223c;4% for both myoblasts and myotubes). These results suggest that for these genes uORFs do not play an important role in the regulation of mRNAs starting with a 5&#x02032; TOP in myogenesis, whereas they may favor the use of IRESs in a subset of genes.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Potential uORFs used during myogenesis.

Alternatively, a switch in TIS usage may occur in the same transcript and arise from regulation at the translational level, because of differential recognition of upstream or alternative ORFs due to altered activity of translation initiation factors or RNA binding proteins. Regulation at the translational level can also occur through different efficiency in the translation of transcript variants. An example of a gene with a combination of both scenarios is <italic>Tpm3</italic>, a cytoskeletal protein involved in the calcium dependent regulation of muscle contraction. Two different TISs were detected in <italic>Tpm3</italic>: one TIS arising from a shorter transcript was predominantly used in myoblasts, another TIS arising from a longer transcript with alternative first exons was predominantly used in myotubes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). This results in the formation of proteins with two distinct N-termini, a longer isoform of 285 aa (UniProt P21107&#x02013;1, also known as skeletal muscle isoform) and a shorter isoform of 248 aa (P21107-2, also known as cytoskeletal isoform). In addition to the nature of the transcribed protein, the efficiency of translation seems to be tightly controlled. As a measure for translational efficiency and to assess the effects of changes in TSSs, we analysed DeepCAGE data to detect 5&#x02032;-ends of transcripts. DeepCAGE data for the same gene in the same cells showed three different TSSs. The most distal (3&#x02032;) TSS does not appear to code for a protein. The other two code for the short (cytoplasmic) and long (skeletal muscle) transcript variants and were transcribed at similar levels in myotubes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). However, the short variant was not translated in myotubes, but only in myoblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Interestingly, tropomyosin proteins have already been shown to be regulated at translational level in slow-twitch and fast-twitch muscles (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>).</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Alternative transcription and translation in <italic>Tpm3</italic>.

From 4219 genes for which we could identify TISs, 1729 genes contained at least two TISs. Out of those, 312 genes (18%) (Supplementary Table S19) showed a significant difference (<italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05, after multiple testing correction) in alternative TIS usage between myoblasts and myotubes. To account for changes derived from regulation at transcriptional level, we performed the same analysis to detect changes in TSS usage as detected by DeepCAGE. Out of 6426 detected genes, 635 genes contained two or more TSSs, and 28% (180) of those showed a significant change (<italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05, after multiple testing correction) in TSS usage between myoblasts and myotubes (Supplementary Table S20). The overlap between genes with both changes in TISs and TSSs usage was small (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>), indicating that the majority of switches in TIS are occurring in transcripts with the same start site. Even transcripts with a switch in both TIS and TSS usage appeared to be at least partly regulated at the translational level. <italic>Cryab</italic> is an example of such a transcript. Two major TSSs were detected in myoblasts, whereas in myotubes only one of the two TSS was detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). Ribosome footprints from myoblasts showed (i) a TIS in the 5&#x02032;-UTR, which represents an uORF with an harringtonin peak corresponding to an AUG start codon in a Kozak consensus sequence, and cycloheximide footprints on the entire 35 amino acids uORF, in addition to (ii) a TIS representing the pORF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>). In myotubes, however, only the TIS corresponding to the annotated start codon was detected. Ribosome profiling footprints of cycloheximide treated cells showed a significant upregulation of Cryab in myotubes compared to myoblasts (Supplementary Table S8). This indicates a negative effect of the uORF on translation in myoblasts. The short distance between the uORF and the pORF, plus the relatively long uORF (35 amino acids) suggest that translation re-initiation in myoblasts is impaired. In agreement with our finding, a previous study has shown upregulation of Cryab at protein level in myotubes (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>).</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Switches in TISs usage during myogenesis.

None of the 27 genes with switches involving uORFs was listed in the set of genes belonging to these two pathways, indicating that the observed switches identified in ribosomal protein genes and calcium signaling genes were mainly occurring between an annotated TIS and a TIS in the coding region, or between different TISs in the coding region. Another plausible explanation is the imperfect annotation of KEGG pathway, as seen for <italic>Tmbim6</italic>, a gene involved in calcium signaling (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>) but not listed in the calcium signaling pathway (mmu4020).</p><p>Switches between alternative TISs which were observed in ribosomal genes were indeed mainly occurring between the annotated TISs and alternative TISs located downstream in the coding region. These switches were not due to alternative TSS usage as generally only one TSS was found. An example of such a ribosomal protein gene is <italic>Rpl7</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The TIS detected in the coding region may lead to translation of a shorter novel protein, containing a methionine at its start codon and translated in a different frame compared to the pORF. This aORF may therefore represent a dual coding region. <italic>Rpl7</italic> was downregulated at total RNA level, but the downregulation did not reach significanctly in both ribosome profiling datasets. We determined RPL7 protein level by western blot analysis, and detected similar protein expression levels between myoblasts and myotubes (Supplementary Figure S5), suggesting that the alternative out-of-frame TIS does not affect the translation of the pORF and that the downregulation observed at total RNA level is buffered during translation. Western blot was also performed for two other ribosomal proteins, RPL34 and RPS15, where the detected alternative TISs in the coding regions were in-frame with the pORFs. <italic>Rpl34</italic> was shown to be significantly upregulated at total RNA level, whereas it was downregulated in harringtonin footprints (the downregulation did not reach significance in cycloheximide footprints). <italic>Rps15</italic> was not differentially expressed at total RNA levels but, similarly to <italic>Rpl34</italic>, harringtonin footprints showed a downregulation in myotubes (which did not reach significance in cycloheximide footprints). For both RPL34 and RPS15 no significant change was detected at protein level with western blot analysis, neither the presence of truncated isoforms (Supplementary Figure S5). We attempted to validate the presence of dually decoded regions, N-terminally truncated or extended isoforms and small ORFs derived from uORFs, in a genome wide scale, by screening publicly available raw LC-MS/MS proteomic datasets, including two C2C12-specific datasets (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>) and a HiRIEF LC-MS/MS deep proteome dataset from N2A mouse cell (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>).

Whereas regulation of gene expression at transcriptional level is extensively studied at genome-wide level, control of mRNA translation has mostly been studied on individual genes. Polyribosomal mRNAs profiling has been used in the past to obtain a global overview of translation efficiency. However, the novel approach of ribosome footprint profiling enables translatome analysis at the same level as transcriptome analysis. Nonetheless, the existing protocol for ribosome profiling is laborious and, to date, there are no dedicated pipelines for the analysis of the short ribosome footprints.</p><p>Here we describe a simplified protocol for ribosome profiling and a novel data analysis pipeline, which includes a combined mapping procedure for short reads, the analysis of the triplet periodicity and a dynamic peak calling algorithm to detect annotated and/or novel TISs, including aORFs and uORFs in frame or out-of-frame compared to the annotated ORF. We used our simplified protocol and custom pipeline to investigate the extent of translational control during the formation of mammalian skeletal muscles, based on the analysis of the translatome, promoterome and transcriptome of proliferating myoblasts and differentiated myotubes in the murine C2C12 cell model. We integrated ribosome profiling data, DeepCAGE data, RNAseq and miRNAseq data to assess the contribution of translational regulation to the changes in protein expression during myogenic differentiation.</p><sec id="SEC4-1"><title>Detection of TISs</title><p>To investigate the impact of alternative translation initiation, we used our custom dynamic peak calling algorithm to detect and quantify alternative TIS usage during differentiation in harringtonin treated myoblasts and myotubes. Our algorithm detected 5333 not yet annotated TISs, providing an extensive catalog of alternative TISs leading to uORFs, aORF and potentially dual coding regions, specifically used during myogenesis.</p><p>We report only a high confidence set of TISs. Not all peaks called from the harringtonin footprints may represent genuine TISs. False positive peaks may arise in the distal part of the coding regions, when the harringtonin treatment is too short for elongating ribosomes to finish the translation of the C-terminal part of the protein. For this reason we developed a dynamic peak calling algorithm which considers not only the triplet periodicity pattern, but also the coverage and the relative position of each candidate TIS. Alternative TISs detected in the 5&#x02032;-UTRs (corresponding to &#x0223c;20% of mapped reads) showed a codon distribution similar to previously reported studies (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), with CUG and GUG codons being the most abundant non-AUG codons, whereas 50% of the footprints mapped to annotated start codons. Overall, these findings give confidence in our data.</p><p>Likely, many more TIS are used during myogenesis, but they were not abundant enough to be detected in our experiments. We detected a lower number of TISs in myotubes compared to myoblasts, which may relate to lower numbers of footprints prior to peak calling. Nevertheless, it does not exclude the possibility that the lower percentage of alternative TISs in myotubes reflects a true biological phenomenon, considering that differentiated cells become more specialized and therefore require a smaller protein repertoire. We may also have lost alternative TIS due to our stringent thresholds: alternative TIS were only called when their abundance was at least 10% of the full length isoform, where previous reports demonstrated that N-terminally truncated protein isoforms present at only 5% of the full length isoform can exert biologically significant effects (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). However, we preferred to not decrease this threshold and avoid false positives.</p><p>In our study &#x0223c;30% of the reads mapped within the coding regions of pORFs. Only &#x0223c;6% of the TISs located in coding regions were in-frame with their pORFs (&#x0223c;4% in case of TISs detected in myotubes), representing potential protein isoforms with truncated N-termini. We were not able to confirm the presence of alternative truncated protein isoforms for RPL34 and RPS15 at western blot level. An explanation could be pausing of ribosomes during the harringtonine treatment, or leaky scanning of the pORF TIS that results in recognition of a downstream start codon yielding to an instable alternative isoforms. The primary ribosomal proteins are stable and accumulate in the cell, whereas the isoform does not accumulate. Regulation of protein stability is another control mechanisms determining protein abundance, which cannot be addressed by ribosome profiling. The remaining TIS located in the coding regions where out-of-frame TISs. A portion of it may represent potential dual coding regions. Previous studies have detected dual coding regions in genes involved in fundamental cellular processes (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), such as translation (<italic>Eif4a2</italic>), cell cycle (<italic>Cdkn2a</italic>) and protein degradation (<italic>Ube2e2</italic>). Many translation initiation factors, including <italic>Eif1</italic>, <italic>Eif4a2</italic>, <italic>Eif4e2, Eif4a1</italic>, <italic>Eif2s1</italic> and <italic>Eif5</italic> showed a switch in TIS usage during myoblasts differentiation. We did not observe dual coding in <italic>Eif4a2</italic> in our data, but we did detect two TISs in <italic>Eif1</italic>, one representing the annotated start codon and the other representing an out-of-frame aORF with an AUG start. Nevertheless, for the majority of the alternative out-of-frame TISs, we currently lack further evidence. Our attempt to validate dual coding regions, in-frame aORF and small peptides derived from uORFs, based on publicly available mass spectrometry data, present several limitations, even if the proteomic data used is of high quality and acquired using state-of-the art instrumentation and methodology. An untargeted proteomic approach is not ideal due to dynamic range limitations and difficulties in detecting and quantifying low-abundant proteins among a diverse pool (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). A recent study showed that ribosome profiling data could be used to improve identification of novel N-termini isoforms and translated upstream ORF from proteomic data (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). However, only a small number of translated uORFs and N-terminal extensions was validated. We therefore conclude that the lack of consistency between ribosome profiling data and mass spectrometry data does not invalidate our findings, but positive validation of these translated uORFs and aORFs on protein level may require enrichment of peptides by anti-peptide antibodies raised against a number of predicted and synthesized peptides.</p><p>In this study we restricted the detection of TISs in coding transcripts. Nevertheless, a percentage of footprints derived from non-coding transcripts. LincRNAs bound to ribosomes have been observed in previous ribosome profiling (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and polysome profiling studies (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Whether they lead to active translation is still debated, with some studies showing no coding potential (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>) and others suggesting that translation occurs in portions of lincRNAs (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). The fragment-size of the protected footprint is one of the parameters commonly used to distinguish true ribosome footprints from RNA fragments derived from transcripts protected by other complexes that may co-sediment with ribosomes or fragments derived from stable RNA secondary structure. Our read-length distribution analysis showed that lincRNAs did not always display a preference for one specific read-length, as protein coding genes did, and for those which showed a preferential peak surrounding 30 nt, we did not observe characteristic signatures of translation, not even restricted to portions of the lincRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-2"><title>Cellular processes controlled by selective mRNA translation in myogenesis</title><p>During differentiation of myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes, protein synthesis generally correlated with mRNA levels for the majority of the genes. Genes with lower correlations are likely regulated at the level of mRNA translation. The latter were strongly enriched for genes encoding for ribosomal proteins, whereas a modest enrichment for genes involved in protein degradation, focal adhesions, regulation of actin cytoskeleton and calcium signaling was also observed. The ribosomal protein genes and the calcium signaling pathway were also enriched in the set of genes showing alternative TIS usage, but the enriched genes were different, indicating that these pathways are mainly regulated at translational level not only by different translation initiation but also through other mechanisms.</p><p>A previous study showed that the production of three ribosomal proteins (S16, L18 and L32) is regulated both at the level of transcription and translation during myoblast differentiation (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). The authors showed a decrease in transcription and a decrease in translation efficiency by measuring mRNA bound to polysomes. In line with their study, S16, L18 and L32 showed a significantly lower number of harringtonin footprints in myotubes, whereas the decrease in cycloheximide footprints did not reach statistical significance. A general downregulation was observed for the majority of the ribosomal protein genes both at transcriptional and translational level. Despite a positive correlation between RNAseq and cycloheximide footprints (<italic>r</italic> = 0.79, Pearson correlation), we found a poor correlation between RNAseq data and harringtonin footprints (<italic>r</italic> = 0.27, Pearson correlation), much lower than the correlation for all genes (<italic>r</italic> = 0.65). This discrepancy observed may be explained in different ways, one of which could be ribosome stalling, a known limitation in ribosome profiling data (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). If elongating ribosomes are stalled, this may lead to accumulation of footprints, which might be detected as alternative TISs in harringtonin data. The same applies to cycloheximide footprints, where ribosomal pauses might interfere with a correct quantification of translation. However, even if the peaks and footprints do not always reflect the production of novel short peptides or protein isoforms, we observed significant changes in ribosome footprints at those sites during myogenesis. These changes are highly reproducible between replicates, they are cell specific and tightly controlled during differentiation and therefore they likely represent a regulatory mechanism with relevance for muscle differentiation.</p><p>The mechanisms regulating alternative TISs usage in myogenesis remain to be investigated. Previous studies have shown that proteins involved in the translation machinery are autoregulated (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and their synthesis is mainly controlled at the level of translation (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). These mRNAs are mainly characterized by the presence of structural motifs, such as the 5&#x02032; TOP. The mTOR signaling pathway is known to regulate translation of TOP mRNAs. Serum removal could represent a downregulating stimulus for the mTOR pathway, possibly leading to mTOR-pathway inactivation and mTOR-dependent translation repression. The protocol for C2C12 differentiation is based on serum reduction (from 10 to 2% FBS) but our data does not show evidence of a major contribution of the mTOR signaling pathway toward the control of TOP mRNAs translation during myogenic differentiation, as we do not observe any enrichment of transcripts bearing a 5&#x02032; TOP and affected by a switch in TIS usage. Other studies have previously shown that the inhibition of mTOR can have different outcomes, from a major effect to little or no effect on TOP mRNA translation, depending on the cellular context (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). The ribosomal protein genes and translation factors which showed a switch in TIS usage did not contain a 5&#x02032; TOP, therefore we suggest that a different mechanism is used.</p><p>Next to genes involved in the translational apparatus, we found that many of the genes showing a switch in TIS usage are known to play a role in muscle development, maintenance and regeneration. <italic>Cryab</italic> (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), <italic>Spp1</italic> (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>), <italic>Tmbim6</italic> (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>) and <italic>Cs</italic> (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>) have been previously shown to be regulated at transcriptional level during myogenic differentiation. <italic>Eno3</italic> (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>), <italic>Pgam</italic> (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>) and <italic>Agl</italic> (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>) have been related to metabolic myopathies, whereas <italic>Eno3</italic> (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>) and <italic>Spp1</italic> (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>) have been recently reported as biomarkers for muscular dystrophies. We showed that these genes are regulated at translational level by switches of alternative TIS usage between uORFs and pORFs during differentiation. Due to the many regulatory potential of uORFs, a full understanding of the translational control of these genes may be relevant for clinical purposes.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-3"><title>The contribution of mRNA translation in myogenesis</title><p>Even though we observed a general positive correlation between transcription and translation, suggesting that most of the regulation occurs at transcriptional level, we also observed a dampening effect of translational regulation. The causes of this dampening effect remain to be elucidated. Translation can be regulated by many different mechanisms. Here we specifically focused on the alternative use of start codons. Our study showed that 312 genes were subjected to switches in alternative TIS usage during differentiation. Although we showed that the presence of a myotube-specific promoter in <italic>Tpm3</italic> resulted in an alternative TIS, we found that the majority of the switches detected at translational level was independent from transcription. Switches in TIS usage mostly occurred in genes with a single promoter, thus the transcription of genes from distinct promoters, and the translation initiation from distinct start codons, seem to be two complementary mechanisms to control gene and protein expression in myogenesis. Moreover, we showed that alternative promoters may also lead to recognition of regulatory uORFs located in the 5&#x02032;-UTR, as shown for <italic>Cryab</italic>. Therefore, alternative TSS can be used to regulate protein levels. Nevertheless the detection of alternative TSSs may be challenging when TSSs are characterized by a broad peak (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). The DeepCAGE technology and the subsequent clustering procedure may not have the resolution to identify TSSs which are in close proximity, leading to the incorporation of alternative TSSs into one single TSS. Our analysis might therefore underestimate the number of alternative TSSs which are in very close proximity and therefore overestimate the number of switches in TIS usage exclusively dependent on the translational control. It remains to be investigated to which extent this phenomenon may alter our results.</p><p>A considerable amount of footprint mapped in the 5&#x02032;-UTRs. Even though it is difficult to predict the effect of an uORF based on the length, many reports suggest that short uORFs are regulatory, whereas long uORFs and out-of-frame uORFs overlapping the pORF primarily inhibit protein synthesis (<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). We showed that the majority of the non-overlapping uORFs were between 1&#x02013;30 amino acids long, whereas the majority of the overlapping uORFs were longer than 30 amino acids, suggesting a likely stronger regulatory potential.</p><p>We further investigated the contribution of miRNAs in the regulation of translation, focusing on well-characterized myomiRs. For all experimentally validated targets we did not observe any major effect on translation inhibition. The amount of mRNAs targets present at transcriptome level and the amount of mRNAs targets translated reflected the general dampening effect observed for all other non-target genes, indicating that the myimiRs do not primarily affect the translational control of their target mRNAs.</p><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that translation initiation represent a layer of regulation of protein expression in myogenesis for specific subsets of functionally correlated genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="SEC5"><title>ACCESSION NUMBER</title><p>European Nucleotide Archive PRJEB7207</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SEC6"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkv281/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p>
