Although the major determinants of this metabolic transformation have been elucidated, their broad biological implications and clinical relevance are unclear. Here we systematically analyse the expression of metabolic genes across 20 different cancer types and investigate their impact on clinical outcome. We find that cancers undergo a tissue-specific metabolic rewiring, which converges towards a common metabolic landscape. Of note, downregulation of mitochondrial genes is associated with the worst clinical outcome across all cancer types and correlates with the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition gene signature, a feature of invasive and metastatic cancers. Consistently, suppression of mitochondrial genes is identified as a key metabolic signature of metastatic melanoma and renal cancer, and metastatic cell lines. This comprehensive analysis reveals unexpected facets of cancer metabolism, with important implications for cancer patients' stratification, prognosis and therapy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

The process of transformation is accompanied by profound alterations of cellular metabolism that fulfil the energy requirements of cancer cell growth and proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Dysregulation of cellular metabolism in cancer cells was originally described by Otto Warburg almost a century ago<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. He observed that metabolism of cancer cells relies mostly on glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen, whereas normal cells fully oxidize glucose in the mitochondria. These findings remained partially neglected until recently, when the availability of state-of-the-art technologies enabled a more comprehensive examination of the intricacies of cancer metabolism. It is now apparent that the metabolic reprogramming of cancer goes beyond activation of glycolysis. For instance, a recent systematic analysis of expression of metabolic genes across several cancer types showed that, besides glycolysis, other metabolic pathways, including nucleotides and protein synthesis, are activated in cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In support to an increased requirement of building blocks for nucleotide biosynthesis, Jain and colleagues found that increased glycine uptake strongly correlates with proliferation rates of cancer cells from the NCI-60 database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>Although these metabolic features of cancer are now exploited for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, their broader clinical implications are still under intense investigation. In this study we analyse expression data from 20 different solid cancers, encompassing a total of 8,161 cancer and normal samples from TCGA database to comprehensively investigate the metabolic transformation of cancer and its implications for patient prognosis. Consistent with previous observations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, we show that these cancers exhibit common metabolic signatures, but maintain some features of their tissue of origin. Importantly, by distinguishing tissue-dependent and tissue-independent metabolic signatures, we find that activation of nucleotide synthesis and inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism are main features of the convergent metabolic landscape of cancer. Furthermore, we find that downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation correlates with poor clinical outcome across several cancer types and it is associated with the presence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) signature. Consistently, loss of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-related genes is observed in metastatic melanoma samples, compared to the respective primary tissue. Overall, our analysis reveals novel and clinically relevant aspects of the metabolic transformation of cancer, with important implications for patient stratification, prognosis and therapy.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>The metabolic landscape of cancer</title><p>In order to investigate the metabolic landscape of cancer, we analysed the expression of metabolic gene across 20 different types of solid cancers from TCGA, encompassing a total of 8161 cancer and normal samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> for a schematic of the pipeline). RNAseq data from each cancer data set were analysed using a negative binomial generalized linear model (see Methods and ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), comparing the expression of metabolic genes in cancer tissues against tissues of origin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> was then applied against a manually curated metabolic gene signature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref> and Methods for details on the process). While composing metabolic gene signatures we noticed that several genes (&#x0223c;20&#x00025;) were associated with multiple metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>), in line with an interconnected topography of the metabolic network. We reasoned that promiscuity of genes across metabolic pathways can be a confounding factor when linking differential expression of a gene to a specific function. Indeed, in some cases significant enrichment of metabolic pathways was driven by promiscuous genes only, even without changes in pathway-specific genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). To account for this factor, we applied a correction for gene promiscuity in metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> and Methods). Promiscuity-corrected differential gene expression between cancer and normal tissues was then subjected to GSEA and significantly enriched metabolic pathways for each cancer type were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p><p>We then searched for metabolic pathways that are differentially regulated in more than 25&#x00025; of cancers compared to corresponding normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Besides glycolysis, a well-established metabolic feature of cancer, purine biosynthesis and DNA synthesis were the most frequently upregulated pathways across different cancers (14/20, 70&#x00025; and 10/20, 50&#x00025;, respectively). Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase, phosphoribosylaminoimidazole succinocarboxamide synthetase (<italic>PAICS</italic>) was the most frequently upregulated gene (71&#x00025;) within the purine biosynthesis pathway. Of note, purine biosynthesis and <italic>PAICS</italic> expression exhibited strong positive correlation with growth rate of the NCI-60 panel of cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), confirming the relevance of this pathway for cancer cell proliferation. Another shared metabolic feature of cancers that emerged from this analysis is the dysregulation of genes encoding for mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a-b</xref>). Overall, 65&#x00025; of cancers exhibited downregulation of at least one mitochondrial pathway, while the remaining 35&#x00025; showed its over-expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). In particular, downregulation of Citric Acid Cycle (CAC) and mitochondrial fatty acids oxidation (FAO) genes was observed in 40&#x00025; and 30&#x00025; of cancer types, respectively. OXPHOS was found upregulated in 35&#x00025; and downregulated in 25&#x00025; of cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a-b</xref>), showing heterogeneous distribution across cancers.</p><p>To validate these findings we took advantage of a recently published study where gene expression and metabolite abundance were measured in a cohort of breast cancer patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. First, we wanted to assess whether expression of metabolic genes correlates to expected changes in metabolite concentration. Expression levels of glycolytic genes positively correlated with accumulation of lactate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), and expression of purine biosynthesis and DNA synthesis correlated with abundance of nucleotides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b-c</xref>). Moreover, gene expression of FAO negatively correlated with palmitate levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>). We then applied metabolic GSEA on these cancer samples. Among metabolic pathways enriched between breast cancer and normal samples, purine biosynthesis and DNA synthesis were upregulated, while CAC, FAO and cyclic nucleotides metabolism were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), thus confirming our findings with an independent and cross-platform data set.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tissue-specific features of cancer metabolism</title><p>When performing hierarchical clustering of enriched metabolic pathways, we observed that cancers arising from the same tissue, or anatomically related sites, exhibit similar metabolic features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Notably, cancers maintained tissue-specific metabolic signatures even when analysed independently from their tissue of origin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). To corroborate this observation, we performed correlation analysis between the metabolic signatures of distinct cancers and corresponding normal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Most correlations were positive and significant (57/96, Spearman &#x003c1;, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.05), confirming that the metabolic landscape of cancer is reminiscent of its tissue of origin. Interestingly, we also observed few significant negative correlations (4/96), including highly expressed pathways in normal tissues that were downregulated in cancer. The overall loss of tissue-specific metabolic functions and the convergence to a common metabolic landscape across cancers was confirmed by the finding that the variance of metabolic pathways among cancers was lower than the variance among normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate tissue-specific metabolic rewiring of cancer, we first identified metabolic pathways that are enriched in each normal tissue, compared to average (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). We then determined the extent of tissue-specific metabolic rewiring in cancers by assessing whether metabolic pathways that characterize a normal tissue change in cancer tissue. While most tissue-specific metabolic functions were not altered in cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), 38&#x00025; of the metabolic pathways that were highly expressed in normal tissue were downregulated in cancer. Also, 22&#x00025; of the downregulated pathways in normal tissues were upregulated in cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Besides the definition of tissue-dependent metabolic pathways, this analysis allowed us also to define tissue-independent metabolic rewiring of cancer. Notably, purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis and DNA synthesis were among the most commonly (&#x0003e;20&#x00025;) upregulated pathways, whereas CAC, mitochondrial FAO and urea cycle were the most frequently downregulated ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p><p>We then wanted to investigate whether the observed metabolic rewiring of cancer generates tissue-specific metabolic liabilities. To this aim we took advantage of a recently published RNA interference screening on a large panel of genomically characterized cancer cell lines (Achilles 2.4)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In line with a tissue-specific metabolic reprogramming of cancer, tissue of origin predicted differential essentiality of 59&#x00025; of metabolic genes (349/595, analysis of variance-adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.05). Interestingly, purine biosynthesis and DNA synthesis were among the top predicted functions for tissue-independent essentiality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>OXPHOS is linked to clinical outcome and metastasis</title><p>We then investigated whether the observed metabolic alterations correlate with the clinical outcome of cancer patients. To this aim, we took advantage of survival data collected by TCGA. Patients from each cancer type were divided into &#x02018;high survival' and &#x02018;low survival' groups (See Methods Section for details and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Then, we performed differential gene expression analysis in low and high survival patients and applied promiscuity-corrected metabolic GSEA. Several metabolic pathways were found significantly altered in the low Survival compared to the High Survival group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). Overall, poor survival was associated with inhibition of at least one mitochondrial pathway in 10/15 cancers (67&#x00025;). OXPHOS was the most affected pathway in low vs high survival patients and was found downregulated in the low survival group of 9 out of 15 (60&#x00025;) cancer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The most frequently downregulated genes in this group were subunits of Complex I and IV of the respiratory chain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 9</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the possible relation between mitochondrial metabolism and poor clinical outcome, we performed GSEA on low and high Survival patients, taking advantage of a large collection of cancer-associated gene signatures from the Broad Institute. Among cancers that exhibited downregulation of OXPHOS, the most upregulated cellular function was EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), a gene signature associated with cancer aggressiveness and poor prognosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Notably, OXPHOS showed significant negative correlation with EMT in 19/20 cancer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>Given the role of EMT in cancer metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, we hypothesized an association between downregulation of mitochondrial genes, induction of EMT and the metastatic potential of cancer, which is directly linked to patient prognosis. To validate this hypothesis, we took advantage of the Skin Cutaneous Melanoma data set (TCGA), composed of 367 metastatic and 103 primary cancer samples, and performed differential metabolic gene expression and pathway enrichment analyses on metastatic vs primary cancer samples. EMT was strongly upregulated in metastatic vs primary cancer samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). Furthermore, OXPHOS was the most significantly downregulated metabolic pathway in metastatic vs primary cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Of note, we could not find significant changes in the expression of the nuclear coactivator PPAR&#x003b3; coactivator-1&#x003b1; (PGC1&#x003b1;), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis previously implicated in cancer metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, between metastatic melanoma vs primary tumours (BH-<italic>P</italic> value=0.37). In line with our findings on low vs high survival patients, cyclic nucleotides metabolism and purine biosynthesis were both upregulated in metastatic vs primary cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). To further validate the link between reduced expression of mitochondrial genes and metastasis, we compared the metabolic gene expression profile of metastatic and parental 786-O kidney cancer cell lines generated by Vanharanta <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> In line with our findings in cancer patients, EMT was strongly upregulated in metastatic vs parental cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>) and OXPHOS was the most downregulated metabolic pathway in metastatic cells compared to parental (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Moreover, cyclic nucleotides metabolism, one of the pathways found upregulated in metastatic vs primary melanoma, was also found upregulated in 786-O metastatic vs parental cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Of note, PGC1&#x003b1; levels were not significantly different between the 786-O metastatic vs parental cell lines dataset (BH-<italic>P</italic> value=0.51).</p><p>Finally, we wanted to assess whether downregulation of mitochondrial gene expression in patients with metastasis is accompanied by changes in metabolite levels. To this aim we took advantage of a recently published study where metabolomics and RNA sequencing were performed on a cohort of 138 clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Importantly, downregulation of mitochondrial transcripts was observed in metastatic compared to non-metastatic patients, and it was linked to poor patient survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Taking advantage of metabolomics data of these patients we observed that haem and citrate, two metabolites that can only be generated within mitochondria, were among the most downregulated metabolites in metastatic vs non-metastatic patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Dysregulation of cellular metabolism is now an established feature of cancer. Yet, the contribution of this metabolic reprogramming to cancer biology and to the clinical outcome of patients is still under investigation. Taking advantage of a large collection of cancer samples from TCGA consortium, we systematically investigated the mRNA expression of metabolic genes in 20 different cancer types and assessed the link between altered gene expression and survival of cancer patients. Our analyses revealed that different cancer types exhibited similar metabolic features, which are remnants of their tissue of origin, and that specific metabolic features correlate with metastatic potential and patient prognosis.</p><p>Previous studies have highlighted important features of altered metabolism between tumour and normal tissues in a pan-cancer perspective<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. For instance, Hu and colleagues performed an extensive analysis of metabolic gene expression changes in cancer compared to normal tissues, observing common patterns of metabolic adaptation among different cancer types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In accordance with this study, we found that distinct cancers display upregulated expression of glycolysis and nucleotide metabolism, and downregulation of FAO, whereas OXPHOS presented heterogeneous regulation. Subtle differences between Hu <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and our findings, including expression changes of TCA cycle genes, can be explained by differences in the curation of metabolic pathways, which we obtained by integrating multiple databases. Interestingly, the observation that expression of mitochondrial FAO is diminished across several cancer types is in line with the results from a recent pan-cancer analysis where signals from mRNA, miRNA and DNA methylation levels were integrated to find common expression changes in cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>Together with these findings, our results showed diminished expression of TCA cycle enzymes in cancer, and Succinate Dehydrogenase D (<italic>SDHD</italic>) ranked among the most frequently downregulated mitochondrial genes, in line with its role as mitochondrial tumour suppressor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. This finding is in line with a previous study reporting loss of co-expression of genes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, and with the decrease of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in tumour samples from TCGA database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Together with the observation that direct inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism is responsible for p53 genetic inactivation and increased tumourigenic potential<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, our results support the notion that downregulation of several mitochondrial pathways is a common feature of the metabolic rewiring occurring in different cancer types.</p><p>Although these data seem to support a role for mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer initiation and progression, mitochondria are far from being an accessory organelle in cancer cells. Cells completely devoid of mtDNA (<italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sup>0</sup>) have lower ability to form tumours in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and <italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sup>0</sup> cells need to acquire mtDNA from host cells to recover mitochondrial function and achieve growth <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Indeed, mitochondria are important for the generation of several precursor molecules, such as aspartate, citrate and succinyl-CoA for supporting nucleotide, lipid and heme biosynthesis, respectively. Moreover, mitochondrial metabolism is flexible and can engage in both oxidative and reductive metabolism to support the generation of cytosolic citrate even in the presence of mitochondrial dysfunction triggered by genetic or environmental cues. For instance, reductive citrate has been shown to support lipid synthesis under hypoxia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, in the presence of TCA cycle truncation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, or in the presence of respiratory chain inhibitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Therefore, without further experimental validation, our results cannot exclude the possibility that partial, rather than complete, loss of mitochondrial function supports the growth of cancer cells by inducing a glycolytic switch, known to support anabolic programmes in fast growing cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, while maintaining mitochondrial functions required for metabolism and signalling. Importantly, recent work demonstrated that partial mitochondrial dysfunction induces migration, invasion and metastasis, while complete loss of mitochondrial function leads to inhibition of the metastatic phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p><p>Our work established for the first time a link between metabolic alteration and survival of cancer patients. By comparing low and high survival patients from 15 different cancer types we observed that downregulation of OXPHOS gene expression is almost invariably associated with poor clinical outcome. This result suggests that, despite activation of OXPHOS could have different effects during cancer initiation depending on the tissue of origin, suppression of OXPHOS genes is a common feature of cancer progression and could have important implications for patient survival. Low OXPHOS was strongly associated with induction of EMT, a process linked to cancer invasion and metastasis, and one of the most common causes of cancer deaths. Consistently, OXPHOS was among the most downregulated pathways in distant melanoma metastases, compared to the primary cancer. These results support at much broader scale the finding that partial mitochondrial dysfunction increases metastatic potential of cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. At the same time, these results partially disagree with recent work from the Kalluri's laboratory, where LeBleu and colleagues investigated the metabolic phenotype (MP) of circulating tumour cells and metastasis from various breast cancer models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. In accordance with our findings, they found that metastatic cells exhibited low expression of OXPHOS genes, compared to the primary tissue and circulating cancer cells. However, they found that invasive ductal breast cancers are characterized by high expression of the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis PGC1&#x003b1;, which also correlated with metastasis. Our analysis did not show significant changes in PGC1&#x003b1; expression in metastatic vs primary cancers, suggesting that the findings of LeBleu are not a common feature of the metabolic transformation of cancer but, likely, apply to a specific subset of breast cancers. In line with the possible tissue-specific role of PGC1&#x003b1;, a recent study found that its downregulation is linked with prostate cancer progression and metastasis, and its genetic reactivation suppresses the formation of prostate cancer metastases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>Our analytical approach is not devoid of limitations. First, establishing a link between mRNA levels of metabolic enzymes and cellular function can be a daunting task, not only because of the lack of correlation between transcript abundance and protein concentration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, but also because of lack of large-scale information about downstream regulation of protein activity (for example, acetylation, phosphorylation, and so on). Moreover, regulation of metabolic pathways can be very intricate and often occurs at nodal points in the pathway, rather than at the level of every gene; therefore, mean expression of metabolic pathways is only a partial estimate of their activity. Second, the association between downregulation of OXPHOS and metastatic behaviour via induction of an EMT signature is based on correlation. Despite this hypothesis is in line with previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, and we further confirmed such link in an independent data set of metastatic melanoma, more experimental work is required to corroborate the molecular underpinnings linking mitochondrial function to metastasis.</p><p>Our results have multiple implications. First, they suggest that to fulfil their metabolic reprogramming cancers explore different molecular paths that entirely depend on the tissue of origin (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref> for a model). Second, they indicate that, despite the overwhelming genetic complexity that underlines transformation, cancer cells contrive common strategies to support their proliferation. Therefore, we hypothesize that the metabolic reprogramming of cancer is degenerated, that is, different oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes lead to similar metabolic signatures to support proliferation. It is therefore tempting to speculate that evolution of cancer might be driven by phenotypic traits, and that oncogenes and tumour suppressors might be selected for their efficiency in regulating these metabolic changes. In line with this hypothesis, a recent study found that metabolic and cancer-causing genes undergo co-altered somatic copy number variation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, indicating that alteration of cancer-associated genes is often linked with metabolic rewiring. These findings may catalyse a better understanding of the role of dysregulated metabolism in cancer and provide novel means to stratify patients based on their metabolic features.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cancer and normal samples selection</title><p>Samples from 20 different solid cancer types were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas data portal (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/dataAccessMatrix.htm">https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/dataAccessMatrix.htm</ext-link>).
