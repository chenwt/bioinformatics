The GENCODE consortium strives to provide this, augmenting computational and experimental evidence with manual annotation. The rapidly developing field of proteogenomics provides evidence for the translation of genes into proteins and can be used to discover and refine gene models. However, for both the proteomics and annotation groups, there is a lack of guidelines for integrating this data. Here we report a stringent workflow for the interpretation of proteogenomic data that could be used by the annotation community to interpret novel proteogenomic evidence. Based on reprocessing of three large-scale publicly available human data sets, we show that a conservative approach, using stringent filtering is required to generate valid identifications. Evidence has been found supporting 16 novel protein-coding genes being added to GENCODE. Despite this many peptide identifications in pseudogenes cannot be annotated due to the absence of orthogonal supporting evidence.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

However, identifying and annotating functional elements in the human genome is a persistent challenge. Despite intensive study, especially in identifying protein-coding genes, our understanding of the genome is far from complete, particularly with regard to non-coding RNAs, alternatively spliced transcripts and regulatory sequences. The GENCODE consortium is carrying out the annotation of all gene features in the reference human genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The annotation combines computational analysis, targeted experimental evidence and manual curation approaches to produce high-accuracy genome annotations for protein-coding genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) and pseudogenes. The reference gene set produced by GENCODE is the default gene set available in Ensembl.</p><p>A key goal of genome annotation is to describe a complete list of protein-coding genes. For many genes, confirmation of coding potential and the definition of the exact gene structure are not trivial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Automated algorithms utilize comparative genomics methods such as phyloCSF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> to score transcript-coding potential while annotation groups incorporate antibody tagging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and mass spectrometry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> proteogenomic experiments. GENCODE release (V22) contains only 19,814 protein-coding genes, decreasing from over 20,600 protein-coding loci in release V7. This fundamental refinement can mainly be attributed to improved comparative and proteomics analysis methods that have indicated transcripts with poor coding potential for removal from the reference gene set.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref></p><p>High-quality peptides from large-scale proteomics experiments confirm coding potential, especially for genes and transcripts where there is little other supporting evidence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Proteomics experiments only identify a fraction of detectable peptides. A peptide may not be detected if it is not amenable to the methods used or if the corresponding protein is not expressed in detectable quantities in the tissue type analysed. This means that while reliably identified peptides verify protein-coding potential, the lack of corresponding peptides does not prove a transcript is not translated. Despite this, the majority of protein-coding genes in the GENCODE annotation of the human genome are routinely identified with confident peptides in large-scale proteomics experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>The increased scale of proteogenomics endeavours means that a higher false positive rate is inevitable. Recent reviews of the proteogenomics field have highlighted the challenge posed by false positives<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Target-decoy database searching is the most common approach for determining false positive identification rates, however, recent publications have pointed out some of the limitations of this method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. To minimize erroneous identifications, accurate estimation of error and conservative significance filtering criteria must be applied. While initial filtering by a false discovery rate (FDR), calculated based on decoy identifications, is a good starting point, novel identifications should be examined independently and assessed by posterior error probability (PEP) and <italic>P</italic> value. The use of tools such as Percolator can also correct for inaccuracies in FDR estimation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Moreover, since many peptides are only detected occasionally, combining results from many experiments can improve proteome coverage and confidence of novel assignments. In addition, even with high confidence in peptide identifications alternative explanations such as sequence variants and contaminates must be considered. Proteogenomics experiments have been particularly useful for poorly annotated genomes, providing a powerful tool to validate new gene models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>Proteogenomics analysis can generate large numbers of putative novel protein-coding gene identifications. However, there are no suitable guidelines for how this data should be treated so that it can be successfully incorporated into genome annotation. We present here criteria for the generation and interpretation of proteomics evidence for novel annotations. We describe a proteogenomic workflow encompassing a search database, and stringent filtering criteria to refine peptide assignments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). To assist annotators, we propose a priority annotation score to rank identifications. From the annotator's perspective, we discuss how proteogenomics evidence can be interpreted and what additional information substantiates protein-coding potential for annotation. In the presented work, we concentrate on the human genome by reanalysing human tissue data from the draft human proteome experiments, but these methodologies are applicable to any sequenced genome.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reanalysis of the human proteome</title><p>We have implemented the workflow shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, and used it to reprocess over 52 million spectra from the human proteome experiments. This resulted in 17,777,190 significant peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) corresponding to 342,015 distinct peptide sequences longer than 7 amino acids (aa), representing 34&#x00025; of the query spectra. PSMs were determined as significant using a 1&#x00025; FDR and a 0.05 PEP cut-off. Significant PSMs were required to identify the same peptide with these criteria via multiple search algorithms. This equated to a final estimated PSM <italic>q</italic>-value of 0.0007 (0.07&#x00025; FDR).</p><p>The distribution of identified peptides in the search space is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, with 99.5&#x00025; matching known protein-coding sequences (CDS). About 0.6&#x00025; of these were unique to either GENCODE or UniProt, highlighting the importance of considering multiple sequence annotation sources. These differences are due to independent database curation and annotation efforts. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> further breaks down the identified peptides by tissue, showing testis and ovary tissues to have the highest total number of peptide identifications. Testis also contained the most tissue-specific peptides, followed by liver, spleen, brain and foetal tissues. This observation suggests that these tissues have a significant number of uniquely expressed genes or alternative transcripts not found in other tissues. Other recent publications focusing on the analysis of Testis tissue have also found this to be true<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p><p>Conducting protein inference and clustering to produce the shortest list of proteins that explain all significant peptides, we found evidence for 19,262 human proteins. For known proteins, we mapped these proteins to their Ensembl gene identifiers, finding evidence for 16,271 genes or clusters of genes with distinct peptides. A cluster of genes is defined as a set of genes, usually from the same family, which match one or more unique peptides specific to this set. Genes that only matched a subset of peptides from another gene were not counted in this number. About 13,852 genes were unambiguous identifications evidenced by multiple peptides and at least 1 uniquely identifying peptide. This is in reasonable agreement with the numbers of genes reported in previous studies using similar levels of stringency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Further filtering by number of uniquely identifying peptides produces 11,606 and 10,740 genes with 2 and 3 unique peptides, respectively.</p><p>Among these genes, 7,716 transcripts were identified with unique peptides revealing 1,169 genes with evidence of alternative splicing. Further strict filtering increased the PEP threshold to 0.01, removed modified peptides, removed peptides with &#x0003e;30 aa and peptides with &#x0003e;2 missed cleavages. This additional filtering returned 32,497 gene-specific peptides and reduced the resulting genes with multiple different transcripts to 867. About 8,425 of the identified peptides crossed exon boundaries in these genes. About 1,869 transcripts mapped to these genes with 9,114 unique peptide mappings, and 2,956 of these peptides crossed exon boundaries. Testis again showed the highest amount of alternative transcription.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identifying novelty in the proteome</title><p>About 1,406 of the identified peptides did not match previously annotated coding regions within known protein-coding genes in GENCODE or UniProt. While these peptides could represent genuine novel CDS annotations, they could also be due to false positive assignments, or explicable as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that lead to single amino-acid variants (SAVs). Genuine novel CDS annotations can take three forms: the addition of completely novel protein-coding genes where no previous annotation existed; the annotation of a CDS within a locus that was previously classified as an lncRNA or pseudogene; or the addition of novel CDS within pre-existing protein-coding genes (for example, the identification of additional coding exons). While the novel data is the most interesting in terms of GENCODE annotation, it is at the highest risk of false positive identifications. We examined these identifications and devised suitable filtering criteria and quality measures to produce a refined set of novel peptides for genome annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>To generate higher confidence peptide identification, we increased our acceptance threshold to a minimum PEP of 0.01. Examination of the remaining spectra revealed that certain types of peptide commonly showed poor ion series coverage casting reasonable doubt on their assignments. As a consequence, long peptides &#x0003e;29 aa, peptides with &#x0003e;2 missed cleavages and semi-tryptic peptides were eliminated. In addition, we examined the incidence of post-translationally modified PSMs by comparing the enrichment of modification type in the novel data and the CDS data. These analyses found that deamidation and N-terminal carbamidomethylation were overrepresented among novel identifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We have therefore disregarded all novel PSMs with these modifications. However, other modifications such as oxidation and acetylation showed similar proportions in both CDS and novel PSMs and have been retained, they only contribute a small portion (6&#x00025;) of the novel PSMs.</p><p>The human genome has been the subject of intensive study and annotation for many years. Hence, the chances of a peptide being completely novel are small and an alternative explanation should be considered. There are several repositories of human genome annotation and these are being constantly updated with new annotations. Each novel peptide was blasted against the latest available GENCODE, RefSeq, NextProt and UniProt sequence database releases to identify peptides found in updated protein-coding annotations; 231 (7&#x00025;) of the novel peptides were eliminated in this way. Also peptides containing SAVs will not match their corresponding protein sequence and can be misinterpreted as novel. To account for this, all novel peptides were required to be at least two amino acids different to any peptide from a known protein-coding gene.</p><p>The implemented peptide filtering regime should eliminate the majority of false positives. However, manual inspection of spectra is recommended for key peptides, especially those determined to provide evidence for new protein-coding regions. The final set of 650 highly confident novel PSMs mapped to 204 unique peptides and inferred 168 possible novel protein-coding annotations, 17 with multiple peptide evidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset 1</xref>). In addition, any new gene annotations obtained were further validated by mapping tissue-specific RNAseq transcript data from the Uhl&#x000e9;n study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> to the corresponding gene regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>As part of this analysis, we proposed a priority annotation score for each novel peptide and protein. This score used peptide features suggested by expert annotators based on prior experience, targeting criteria that appeared to distinguish peptides that led to annotation from those that did not. The aim of this score was to rank novel peptides identifications, highlighting the protein and peptide mappings most likely to lead to new annotation. The peptide priority annotation score is based on various peptide features that are not normally considered in PSM scoring including the PEP, the number of PSMs observed, the number of replicate identifications, the delta scores between top and second rank assignments, peptide length and the amino-acid sequence complexity. The full formula used can be found in the online methods. The summed score of all unique peptides identifying a novel protein was then used to rank the putative novel protein identifications. In the context of our human proteogenomic analysis, this score was difficult to further optimize since, in spite of the speculative search space used, only a few novel genes were identified. This likely reflects the high quality of existing annotation for this reference genome. However, all filtered novel identifications were manually examined regardless of ranking, and we were thus able to demonstrate a good correlation between peptide score and the likelihood of annotation taking place (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). This priority annotation score is potentially more useful for annotators targeting non-model organism genomes, based on the presumption that such gene sets are less complete in terms of protein-coding content. However, we emphasize that the scoring system does not provide actual probability estimations; it should instead be used to rank potential proteins. Furthermore, while a score of &#x0223c;100 marks the point at which the annotation of a peptide became probable in this study, this is unlikely to be the same for studies on other genomes given the number of variables involved (such as the quality of genome sequence, and the size and nature of the proteomics data).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Manual annotation of the multi-peptide list, containing 17 prospective protein-coding regions, led to the addition of 7 protein-coding genes to GENCODE. In addition an eighth novel protein-coding region was created within the <italic>INPP5F</italic> protein-coding gene as part of an alternatively spliced transcript. Subsequently, 9 novel protein-coding genes were annotated in the list of 151 single-peptide identifications (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). In total, our survey has led to the addition of 16 protein-coding genes to GENCODE: 8 based on lncRNA or RNAseq models, and 8 on pre-existing pseudogenes. The coding status of four of the pseudogenes&#x02014;<italic>MAGEB6P1, MYO15B</italic> and two CENPV-related loci&#x02014;were highlighted by Pandey <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, although <italic>MYO15B</italic> was previously regarded as a coding locus by UniProt. However, our <italic>MYO15B</italic> peptide is novel to this study and has supported the annotation of a CDS that is 1,534 aa longer than the UniProt entry. Two of the remaining 11 cases (HUMG00000150367 and HUMG00000158324) correspond to unreviewed entries in UniProt; the coding potential of the latter, in common with the CENPV-related loci, is also supported by data from PeptideAtlas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Of the remaining cases, one represents our single agreement with the 404 translated lncRNAs proposed by Wilhelm <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> (ENST00000424358), leaving 9 protein-coding genes that represent novel discoveries.</p><p>These annotations have resulted from a combination of the proteogenomic data presented here and the HAVANA manual annotation process, which incorporates next-generation transcriptomic data sets such as RNAseq<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, CAGE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> and polyAseq<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> that were not available during the genome-wide annotation phase of the GENCODE project. Certain pseudogenes, for example, were previously wrongly annotated since correct transcript structures could not be deduced, a problem confounded by 11 of the 16 novel protein-coding genes having single-exon CDS. Incorrect transcript structures can also prevent the identification of CDS based on conservation and paralogy. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, which shows a protein-coding gene reconstructed on the site of a shorter pseudogene of <italic>TEX13A</italic>. RNAseq data is required to support the transcript structure, where testis-specific transcription is observed in agreement with the proteomics results, and the 714 aa CDS shows widespread conservation across mammalian genomes. In total, 15 of the 16 novel protein-coding genes either display mammalian conservation beyond primates or are putative members of known gene families. The outlier is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, an endogenous retroviral element-associated CDS with conservation limited to certain primate genomes.</p><p>Despite the conservative and rigorous criteria presented here, 90&#x00025; of our novel peptide identifications have not led to annotation, for two main reasons: either annotation did not make biological &#x02018;sense' in a transcriptomic context, or there was an absence of orthogonal supporting evidence for the translation or transcription of the model. In the latter case, we note that numerous identifications were made solely within Cufflinks-derived RNAseq models; none of these led to protein-coding annotation, despite many of these peptides appearing to have good PSMs. In fact, few of these structures were seen to be supported by orthogonal transcript evidence, and so could not be added to GENCODE even as lncRNAs. Since proteogenomic surveys must be wary about alternate peptide explanations and the persistence of false positives, these non-annotations are therefore suggestive in this regard. Due to the difficulty in confirming peptide-to-protein inference, many of these novel peptide assignments may be correct but originating from a protein source not considered in our search space. Although the peptide data was essential in highlighting the putative CDS in each of these cases, it was the orthogonal data sets that ultimately led to annotation, in particular the observation of mammalian conservation. For illustration, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref> compares an 11 aa lncRNA-associated peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>) with a 19-aa peptide identified from an RNAseq model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The shorter peptide identifies a novel 63-aa CDS exhibiting strong vertebrate conservation, with striking eye-specific transcriptomic data matching the identified peptide. In contrast, the longer peptide is found 4 aa downstream of a STOP codon within a LINE transposon, in a region that shows no signature of protein-coding evolution. Indeed, we did not annotate any lineage-specific CDS in the single-peptide list, even when they could be linked to canonical initiation codons. We propose that lineage-specific CDS should only be annotated based on the presence of multiple, high-quality and manually validated peptides, unless other sources of experimentally derived supporting evidence are available.</p><p>Pseudogenes provide a particular interpretative challenge; such loci account for the majority of identified novel peptides. These loci differ from the pseudogenes converted to protein-coding genes previously discussed; they contain sequence disablements such as frameshifts or premature termination codons, whereas the latter are <italic>bona fide</italic> protein-coding genes previously mis-annotated. One could assume that pseudogene peptides are incorrect, given that these loci are traditionally thought of as being non-functional. Our initial concern was that peptides attributed to pseudogenes may actually derive from paralogous loci outside the search space, or from allelic variant forms of the parent genes. We found little evidence for these scenarios, although it is plausible that some pseudogene peptides could be explained by undocumented parental allelism, the presence of paralogous loci within reference assembly gaps, the existence of unappreciated copy number variation or retro-transposition events that are not fixed in the human lineage. These cases would be difficult to confirm without proteomic and transcriptomic experiments being conducted on paired samples.</p><p>It is interesting that many of the processed pseudogenes in our lists belong to families with dozens of copies, for example, the GAPDH family. All except one of these parental genes are described by Protein Atlas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> as producing a protein found at &#x02018;high levels' in multiple tissues. It could be that highly transcribed genes produce more pseudogenes due to the increased chance of retro-transposition, raising the likelihood that one or more will gain the potential to be translated. Alternatively, it may simply be that higher levels of protein expression inevitably lead to an increase in the capture of dissonant spectra, or perhaps increase the likelihood of cryptic <italic>in situ</italic> modifications that are subsequently misinterpreted. Ultimately, it is clearly logical to be conservative in the interpretation of pseudogene peptide evidence. As for lineage-specific lncRNA CDS, pseudogene translation should only be considered for annotation where more than one high-quality unique peptide can be linked to an in-frame initiation codon. For such cases, a novel biotype &#x02018;translated pseudogene' has been created in GENCODE; conversion to full-protein-coding gene status will only occur when the functional basis of the locus is experimentally established.</p><p>Proteomics has potential as a powerful tool for genome annotation, allowing validation of existing protein-coding annotations and discovery of novel coding regions. It offers substantial benefits for less refined genomes, although our identification of 17 novel coding regions demonstrates that mass spectrometry has an important role to play in human annotation. It is notable that despite the high levels of stringency and filtering used, the majority of peptides identified outside the known protein-CDS have not led to novel annotations, emphasizing a need for vigilance in interpreting such data sets and the need to handle pseudogenes identified by proteomics with care. Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the number of proteogenomics experiments published, many of which strive to obtain the largest coverage of peptides and novel identifications possible. The size of these data sets places a burden on annotators, as they strive to separate those genuine identifications from the inevitable set of spurious peptides. We believe that proteogenomics should take a &#x02018;quality-over-quantity' approach, as exemplified by the integrated mass spectrometry and annotation workflow presented here. In addition, we propose a priority annotation score for ranking novel proteomics evidence. Although of limited benefit in this study, the higher scoring peptides did lead more frequently to new annotation, and we believe this would be of great value in non-reference genomes. Above all, proteomics data sets should not be interpreted in isolation, rather they should be considered as a single component of an annotation strategy that also includes high-throughput transcriptomic data coupled with comparative analyses.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Raw data sources</title><p>Three large, publicly available human tissue proteomics data sets were downloaded from the Internet.

RNAseq transcript models were imported from three sources: Ensembl RNAseq models assembled using data from the Illumina Human BodyMap 2.0 project, which captures transcription in 16 human tissues (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-513">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-513</ext-link>); models generated by the Kellis lab at MIT using also Human BodyMap data and the Scripture software<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>; and models produced by Caltech and CSHL using RNAseq data from different ENCODE cell lines and the Cufflinks software<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. GENCODE non-coding gene sequences, AUGUSTUS predictions, pseudogenes and RNAseq models overlapping GENCODE coding regions were filtered out from the final sequence database. For some of the databases the sequences needed to be translated into amino acids from nucleotide sequences; this was done using the EMBOSS (v6.6) six-pack tool<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> to generate three-frame translations of the sequences, splitting stop codons into separate ORFs with a minimum length of 10 amino acids. Finally, a set of randomized decoy sequences of equal size to the target database was generated using the Mimic tool (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/percolator/mimic">https://github.com/percolator/mimic</ext-link>) and appended to the database. To account for isobaric peptides all isoleucine (I) residues within the database were replaced with leucine (L); after searching, leucine residues were always converted to the ambiguous code J. All protein accessions were formatted to include the source database, a unique identifier and if available a genomic locus. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> contains a summary of the sequence database components including the number of proteins, peptides and amino acids.

The TOPP tool MascotAdapterOnline was used to submit mzML files to a Mascot Server v2.4 (Matrix Science) cluster; the in-house developed TOPP tool MSGFPlusAdapter was used to run MS-GF&#x0002b; v10089 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>) on the same files across a large computer cluster.

In addition, SEQUEST combined with Percolator<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> was used to search the data in a Proteome Discoverer v1.4 (Thermo Scientific) workflow. All database searches were performed with a precursor tolerance of 10&#x02009;p.p.m. and a fragment tolerance of 0.02&#x02009;Da for HCD spectra and 0.5&#x02009;Da for CID spectra. Up to three missed cleavages were allowed. The fixed modification carbamidomethyl (&#x0002b;57.0214) was specified for all cysteine residues. In addition, the following variable modifications were used in the searches: N-terminal acetylation (&#x0002b;42.01056), N-terminal carbamidomethyl (&#x0002b;57.0214), deamidation of asparagine and glutamine residues (&#x0002b;0.984), oxidation of methionine (&#x0002b;15.9949), and N-terminal conversion of glutamine and glutamic acid to pyro-glutamine (&#x02212;17.0265, &#x02212;18.0106).

PSMs matching contaminant or decoy sequences were also removed. Proteins were then inferred from the final list of peptides, taking a simple approach to cluster proteins that matched the same set of peptides, so that each protein cluster had at least one unique peptide. To calculate the number of genes identified by these proteins, we mapped GENCODE CDS and UniProt accessions back to Ensembl gene identifiers. Several protein clusters did not contain a GENCODE CDS nor a UniProt accession; these non-CDS protein identifications were separated and further filtered for genome annotation. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> displays the &#x02212;10log(PEP) score distribution of CDS and novel PSMs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Non-CDS peptide analysis</title><p>Non-CDS identifications, which we define as peptides uniquely matching a single sequence not found in the GENCODE CDS, UniProt database nor the contaminant sequence databases were further filtered to an increased stringency.

In addition after identifying an enrichment of deamidated and N-terminally carbamidomethylated PSMs in the non-CDS data set, PSMs so modified were also removed. Peptides were also checked to make sure that modifications were identified on the correct N-terminal residues in the case of pyroglutamate conversions.

The latter had been based on an observed region of homology to TEX13A. The novel CDS is supported by four high-quality peptides unique to the locus (RNASEQ00000005460); one peptide aligns three times within a tandem repeat region. Transcription is apparently testis-specific in both the Illumina BodyMap and Human Protein Atlas RNAseq libraries; the BodyMap read coverage graph produced by Ensembl is shown below the model. The transcription start and end points of the novel structure are supported by CAGE data from the FANTOM5 project<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref> and polyAseq data from Derti <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> (not shown). PhastCons 100-way data are shown in blue (genome.ucsc.edu); while the CDS is conserved in mammals, there is length variation within the repetitive region. An orthologous gene model has been added to the mouse GENCODE annotation set as OTTMUSG00000054810. (<bold>b</bold>) lncRNA OTTHUMG00000150367 (ERVK1) has been reannotated as a protein-coding gene with a 109-aa CDS. This CDS is entirely found within repeat-masker sequence corresponding to the HERVK3, although the first exon is found within non-repeat sequence. RNAseq libraries indicate that the transcription of this locus is widespread, for example, found in all 27 Human Protein Atlas tissue RNAseq libraries generated by Fagerberg <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref> as processed by Hezroni <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref> (heart, kidney and liver coverage graphs are shown below the model), while the three high-quality PSMs generated here have been identified in 9 tissues.

Alternatively spliced transcripts have been omitted for clarity. PhyloCSF plots are shown for the relevant reading frames<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>: the CDS is conserved in mammals, while a putative orthologue in the tetraodon genome is identified within an unplaced contig. The peptide (which spans the splice junction) was found only in retina. Strikingly, all transcriptomic data identified in each highlighted species is limited to eye tissues: human CAGE data from FANTOM5 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>; green triangle) identifies TSS within corneal and lens epithelial cells, vitreous humour and retina tissues; mouse CAGE data identifies TSS within eyeball tissue; the 6 splicing human ESTs identified are all derived from eye tissues, as are each of the 20 tetraodon mRNAs, 10 dog ESTs and 3 mouse mRNAs identified (not shown).

However, we do not observe support for these introns, the TSS or the transcript endpoint. The peptide falls within the final exon, which does not show evidence of conservation in PhastCons 100-way plots, and entirely within repeat-masker sequence (specifically an L1M6 element; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.repeatmasker.org">www.repeatmasker.org</ext-link>).
