It is not known if there are unifying principles, properties, or logic in the response of the developing CNS to hypoxic exposure. Here, we use the small vertebrate zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) to study the effects of hypoxia on connectivity gene expression across development. We perform transcriptional profiling at high temporal resolution to systematically determine and then experimentally validate the response of CNS connectivity genes to hypoxia exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We characterized mRNA changes during development, comparing the effects of chronic hypoxia exposure at different time-points. We focused on changes in expression levels of a subset of 1270 genes selected for their roles in development of CNS connectivity, including axon pathfinding and synapse formation. We found that the majority of CNS connectivity genes were unaffected by hypoxia. However, for a small subset of genes hypoxia significantly affected their gene expression profiles. In particular, hypoxia appeared to affect both the timing and levels of expression, including altering expression of interacting gene pairs in a fashion that would potentially disrupt normal function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, our study identifies the response of CNS connectivity genes to hypoxia exposure during development. While for most genes hypoxia did not significantly affect expression, for a subset of genes hypoxia changed both levels and timing of expression. Importantly, we identified that some genes with interacting proteins, for example receptor/ligand pairs, had dissimilar responses to hypoxia that would be expected to interfere with their function. The observed dysynchrony of gene expression could impair the development of normal CNS connectivity maps.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-016-2638-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hypoxia</kwd><kwd>Connectivity</kwd><kwd>Synapse</kwd><kwd>Axon pathfinding</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 MH107039</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2 MH100008</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA042014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milash</surname><given-names>Brett</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000912</institution-id><institution>March of Dimes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FY13-425</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Hypoxic injury complicates up to 60&#x000a0;% of preterm births and leads to a broad range of neurological birth defects including epilepsy, autism, ADHD, and mental retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite the significant clinical impact, the specific effects of hypoxia on the developing central nervous system (CNS) are poorly characterized, and the molecular mechanisms largely unknown. Imaging studies show altered patterns of connectivity in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of children born prematurely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The timing of preterm birth, from 24 up to 37&#x000a0;weeks gestation, encompasses a key CNS developmental window characterized by widespread axon pathfinding and synaptogenesis, and thus makes the brain particularly vulnerable to disruptions of connectivity. Major pathways established during this at-risk period in premature infants include the extension of the corticospinal tracts, the development of the corpus callosum, and the formation of connections in the cortical hemispheres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Development of connectivity in the CNS is a critical step in neural development and appears to be disrupted in disorders including autism and intellectual disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The development of connectivity more precisely involves the processes of axon guidance and pathfinding, synapse development and stabilization; and in the mature CNS, circuit properties and functional networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Experimental studies have demonstrated that developmental hypoxia can disrupt axon pathfinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and alter synapse gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. <italic>hif1</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>,</italic> a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor whose protein expression is stabilized in hypoxia, controls many of the downstream responses to hypoxia including in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Developmentally, it is not known if there are critical hypoxia exposure times. Functionally, it is unclear if certain types of connectivity genes are more affected by hypoxia, and what classes or types of genes are at risk. To address these questions in a comprehensive, reproducible, and experimentally accessible fashion we performed our experiments in the small vertebrate zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>). Advantages of zebrafish are that it combines the relevancy of vertebrate CNS structures and genes, with rapidity and efficiency for testing molecular mechanisms. Its low cost and ability to generate large numbers of animals in a range of experimental conditions provide significant statistical power. In addition, fundamental developmental, neurobiological, and genomic mechanisms are conserved with mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Our objective was to identify the gene expression changes occurring with hypoxia in the developing CNS, and to determine if there were patterns of gene expression changes that would inform understanding of the effects of hypoxia. Our focus was on characterizing the effects of hypoxia on connectivity genes. We compared gene expression profiles across development during the first three days of zebrafish embryogenesis, when the majority of CNS development occurs, including neurogenesis, axon pathfinding, and synapse formation. Analysis was limited to those genes involved in CNS connectivity development. We found that the majority of CNS connectivity genes were unaffected by hypoxia. However, for a small subset of genes hypoxia significantly affected their expression profiles, and caused changes in both timing and levels of expression that could have significant effects on connectivity development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Studying the effects of hypoxia on CNS connectivity development</title><p>To study the effects of hypoxia on development of the CNS, and in particular the effects of chronic hypoxia on the formation of connectivity in the CNS, we assayed for changes in gene expression profiles. We collected total RNA from zebrafish at five different embryonic developmental stages (24&#x000a0;h post-fertilization (hpf), 36 hpf, 48 hpf, 60 hpf, 72 hpf): the five stages reflect key epochs in early zebrafish development, and encompass the majority of CNS connectivity development, from neurogenesis through synapse formation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For the majority of our subsequent analyses, we restricted our analysis to 1270 genes with known or likely roles in the development of CNS connectivity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic illustrations of experiments. <bold>a</bold> Diagram of zebrafish developmental stages (hpf, hours post-fertilization) and timing of RNA sample collection.

Principal component analysis (PCA) using the entire transcriptome of 31,860 genes and performed with both the normoxia and hypoxia data sets showed some separation of samples in earlier developmental stages, but tighter clustering at older ages (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). This trend remained when the normoxic and hypoxic samples were analyzed separately (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref>). The PCA results show that the RNAseq read variance for the experimental replicates at any given developmental stage or experimental condition (hypoxia or normoxia) were more similar to each other than to samples from different ages or conditions. Thus, the PCA shows that the different conditions (developmental stage; hypoxia/normoxia) were the contributors for the variance.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Principal Component Analysis of Gene Expression.

To adjust for changes in levels due to changes associated with development, we normalized expression for each gene to its mean level across development in each experimental condition (normoxic or hypoxic), and then compared hypoxic to normoxic levels at each developmental time-point (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). We found that the 1270 genes grouped into fourteen K-means clusters. The largest cluster (223 genes), cluster 1, had minimal changes across development or with hypoxic conditions. Several other clusters showed a developmental increase in gene expression but with little or no effect from hypoxia (clusters 2, 7, 10, 12; total of 526 genes). In total 749 genes (59&#x000a0;%) were unaffected by hypoxia. The remaining clusters demonstrated differential responses of gene expression to hypoxia during development. Expression analysis showing three representative genes from clusters 5, 8, and 14 displayed as lines demonstrates how different genes had differential responses to hypoxia across development (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Interestingly, Clusters 5 and 11, which displayed the most dynamic responses to hypoxia, contained a total of only nine genes. However, although transcription factors constituted a majority of the two clusters (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c, d</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>), there were not other apparent shared biological features of the clusters, including a Pathway Commons Network analysis showing no direct protein-protein interactions between the members of clusters 5 or 11 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. GO pathway analysis was most descriptive for cluster 1, the largest cluster; while clusters 2, 7, and 10, which showed increases in expression during development but no effect from hypoxia, contained a higher proportion of receptor/ligand genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). Thus, there did not appear to be a certain type or category of genetic response to hypoxia, as least as tested with Pathway Commons Network analysis or GO pathway analysis.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Normalized K cluster analysis demonstrates altered timing of expression caused by hypoxia. <bold>a</bold> K cluster groups shown as heat maps, in which gene expression is averaged across development, and deviations both from the developmental average, and hypoxia versus normoxia, are shown.

K-means analysis of the entire transcriptome resulted in eighteen clusters. Genes that clustered together in the connectivity gene analysis were often split into different clusters when the entire transcriptome was analyzed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). The K cluster analysis for the entire transcriptome often provided decreased resolution compared to when only connectivity genes were analyzed. For example, some genes from clusters 5 and 9 in the pan-transcriptome analysis, when analyzed in the connectivity gene set could be observed to in fact have differential expression profiles at 24 and 48 hpf (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>, red lines). However, it is reassuring that for most genes their cluster assignments and grouping remained constant in both the whole transcriptome and connectivity-only analyses (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Of note, analysis of the entire transcriptome included the <italic>hypoxia-inducible factor</italic> (<italic>hif</italic>) genes. <italic>hif1ab</italic>, <italic>hif1an,</italic> and <italic>hif2</italic>(<italic>epas1a</italic>) were in cluster 1; <italic>hif2(epas1b)</italic> and <italic>hif1al2</italic> were in cluster 13; and <italic>hif1aa</italic> was in cluster 14. Thus, we think that the use of the entire transcriptome for K means clustering does not provide additional insight and actually obscures some of the findings from analysis of the 1270 connectivity genes.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Normalized K cluster analysis of all genes compared to connectivity genes only shows improved resolution of expression differences. <bold>a</bold> Analysis of all genes (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;31,860), K cluster groups shown as heat maps, in which gene expression is averaged across development, and deviations both from the developmental average, and hypoxia versus normoxia, are shown.

We had several major findings. First, we found that the majority of CNS connectivity genes are not significantly affected by hypoxia during development. Second, for the minority of connectivity genes which are affected by hypoxia do not represent a single type or category of gene or protein. Third, connectivity genes affected by hypoxia display a dysynchrony. That is, their relative expression level is aberrantly increased or decreased at an inappropriate time of development. Hypoxia also altered expression levels at defined developmental times of interacting gene pairs, including axon guidance ligand/receptor pairs and synaptic proteins, that would be predicted to disrupt their normal combinatorial functioning. While following hypoxia embryos showed a slowing in their developmental progression, the gene response to hypoxia was not simply a delay in the timing of their normal expression, and in some cases the hypoxia in fact caused an &#x0201c;acceleration&#x0201d; with increased levels of expression.</p><p>Previous work from our group and others has shown that hypoxic injury can disrupt the normal development of axon and synaptic connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The work presented here extends those findings by demonstrating that hypoxia acts at least in part by a causing a dysynchronous response of genes including of interacting receptor/ligand pairs. For example, the receptor/ligand pair <italic>plxnA3</italic> and <italic>sema3ab</italic> are both up-regulated by hypoxia, which could lead to elevated GTPase activity and increase repulsive axon guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Or, as we found, hypoxia causing a decrease in pre-synaptic <italic>syn1</italic> coupled with a post-synaptic increase in <italic>dlg4</italic>, could alter synaptic stabilization and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>While the changes in gene expression reveal some of the functional logic of the hypoxic response in our analysis we are not able to differentiate direct or indirect effects. Genes could be directly regulated by hypoxia-responsive transcription factors; or could be downstream targets in a multi-step cascade. Our findings provide an excellent starting point for deciphering the regulation of genes by hypoxia. In addition, future experiments can address why certain genes are particularly vulnerable to hypoxia, which has important implications for understanding the effects of hypoxia on CNS connectivity development. In our analysis we focused our attention on a subset of 1270 genes with known roles in connectivity development, in particular on genes with roles in axon pathfinding and synapse development and stabilization. Since the genes regulating connectivity development are relatively well-established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], our limitation of analysis to this subset provided an enhanced ability to detect trends and patterns that would otherwise have been obscured by including the entire transcriptome.</p><p>Future studies could also examine whether certain neuron groups are more susceptible to the effects of hypoxia. While we used RNA from the head and brain, changes in expression from other non-neural tissues could have affected our results. Subsequent studies could use genetically-defined methods to limit analysis to neural tissue only, for example with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis or translating ribosomal affinity purification (TRAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>The transcription factor <italic>hif1</italic>&#x003b1; is a master regulator of the cellular response to hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] along with a collection of other <italic>hif</italic> genes and transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. <italic>hif1</italic>&#x003b1; is necessary for normal brain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], but in the developing brain hypoxia or ectopic expression of <italic>hif1</italic>&#x003b1; interrupts normal axon guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This adverse effect of hypoxia on connectivity has also been observed to affect synapse development in a rodent model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. When we analyzed the changes in expression of the different <italic>hif</italic> isoforms in response to hypoxia we noted relatively minor changes. This is similar to a previous report in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and is likely due to the regulation of <italic>hif</italic> by hypoxia predominantly occurring at the post-transcriptional (protein) stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>Chronic hypoxia and injury to the developing brain in premature infants can lead to adverse neurocognitive and neurodevelopmental outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Premature infants can experience extended bouts of hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and MRI studies have demonstrated altered connectivity in ex-premature infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Our findings suggest that certain key genetic pathways may be affected in premature infants by hypoxia.</p><p>In summary, our data suggests two central findings concerning the effects of hypoxia on CNS connectivity development. First, that the major effects of hypoxia are due to a dysynchrony of gene expression; and second, that hypoxia disproportionately affects a subset of connectivity genes. These results should lead to further investigations on why certain genes are prone to the effects of hypoxia, and what effects those gene responses have on the developing CNS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Zebrafish experiments were approved and performed under guidelines from the University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and regulated under federal law (the Animal Welfare Act and Public Health Services Regulation Act) by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare at the NIH, and accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Care International (AAALAC).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Fish stocks and embryo raising</title><p>Adult fish were bred according to standard methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].
