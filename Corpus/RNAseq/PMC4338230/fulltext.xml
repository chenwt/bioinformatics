The ice plant (<italic>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</italic>) is a halophyte that is capable of growing under high salt conditions. For example, the roots of ice plant seedlings continue to grow in 140 mM NaCl, a salt concentration that completely inhibits <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> root growth. Identifying the molecular mechanisms responsible for this high level of salt tolerance in a halophyte has the potential of revealing tolerance mechanisms that have been evolutionarily successful. In the present study, deep sequencing (RNAseq) was used to examine gene expression in ice plant roots treated with various concentrations of NaCl. Sequencing resulted in the identification of 53,516 contigs, 10,818 of which were orthologs of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes. In addition to the expression analysis, a web-based ice plant database was constructed that allows broad public access to the data. The results obtained from an analysis of the RNAseq data were confirmed by RT-qPCR. Novel patterns of gene expression in response to high salinity within 24 hours were identified in the ice plant when the RNAseq data from the ice plant was compared to gene expression data obtained from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants exposed to high salt. Although ABA responsive genes and a sodium transporter protein (HKT1), are up-regulated and down-regulated respectively in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and the ice plant; peroxidase genes exhibit opposite responses. The results of this study provide an important first step towards analyzing environmental tolerance mechanisms in a non-model organism and provide a useful dataset for predicting novel gene functions.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by JST ERATO (T.S. and T.H.), and Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (26870262 to H.T.) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan and from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

The amount of arable land impacted by high salinity has increased, due to climate change, irrigation practices, desertification, flood, and other causes. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimated that 45 million ha out of 230 million ha of irrigated land is affected by salinity (FAO: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/">http://www.fao.org/home/en/</ext-link>). Studies using <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> as a model plant have identified a number of genes involved in salt tolerance. In particular, several transcription factors have been identified as key regulators of salt tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, such as DREB2A [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Additionally, DREB2A orthologs in other plant species, such as rice, soybean, poplar, buffalograss, and sugarcane, also appear to be involved in salt tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Collectively, these studies have demonstrated that the DREB2A gene regulatory network is an important molecular mechanism for salt tolerance in the Plant Kingdom. Additional data from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have also revealed cross-talk of the DREB2A pathway with other pathways, such as the ABA-mediated signaling, osmotic response, and some ionic response pathways that are induced by exposure to high salt [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>It is commonly accepted that better root growth supports better whole plant growth. Since root growth is strongly inhibited under high salt conditions, understanding how roots respond to high levels of salt is essential to understand salt tolerance. Numerous studies have been conducted at the molecular level on the response of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots to high salt conditions. Dinneny et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported that cell-type specific salt response machinery is essential for determining the appropriate transcriptional response to salt stress. Morphological changes in the root, such as swollen cortical cells and a delay in root hair development are among the cell-type specific responses to high salt. These changes have been shown by using live-imaging analysis and these responses occurred within 24 hours in the roots of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition to the information derived from the studies of cell type&#x02013;specificity, the analysis of salt tolerance among naturally occurring genetic variants (accessions) of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has also provided important molecular information. Katori et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], in a study of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions, identified several QTLs that were associated with salt tolerance. Importantly, a genome wide association study (GWAS) indicated that the ability to accumulate NaCl in the leaves of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is dependent on the genetic variation of the Na transporter, AtHKT1 [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The authors indicated that the genetic variation is most likely related to the adaptation to coastal or high saline soil environments [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>With the recent advances in sequencing and bioinformatic technologies, researchers have begun to move to non-model plants to study molecular mechanisms that are responsible for salt tolerance. <italic>Thellungiella halophila</italic> has been widely used due the similarity of its genome sequence to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. A recent study has also reported on the transcriptional response to high levels of salinity in semi-mangrove plants [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Using deep sequencing technology, Huang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported on gene expression in response to salt that was partially common to a variety of plants and species-specific responses also existed. Their study demonstrates the ability to use non-model plants to address biological questions. Based on this premise, we propose that studying gene expression in halophytic plants can discover unique aspects of salt tolerance.</p><p><italic>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</italic> (ice plant) is a halophyte that switches from C3 photosynthesis to Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) under high salinity and drought stress (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). Mature ice plants can grow in soil that contains a salt concentration above 450 mM NaCl, which is higher than found within seawater [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This finding was based on studying the response of shoot growth to high salinity, however, to date no studies have been conducted in ice plants to characterize the response of roots to high salt concentrations. The genome size of <italic>M. crystallinum</italic> is 250 to 300 M bp and comprised of 2n = 18 chromosomes [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although transformation technologies for ice plant have not been established, ice plant seedlings are similar in size to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> making their use in molecular analysis relatively straightforward. Since roots directly contact the soil containing the high concentrations of salt, analyzing root growth in this halophyte and their molecular response to high salinity should provide significant insight into the molecular adaptation of roots to high levels of salt. Genes identified in <italic>M. crystallinum</italic> that are associated with salt tolerance will serve as strong candidates for use in the genetic engineering of agricultural crops with increased salt tolerance.</p><p>In the present study, deep sequencing technology was used to characterize the regulatory network underlying high salinity tolerance in the ice plant. The transcriptomic dataset obtained from <italic>M. crystallinum</italic> was used to construct an ice plant mRNA database. Using this database, the transcriptional responses of ice plant and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were compared in order to determine if essential salt response pathways are conserved in these plant species. These data sets can be used to investigate the molecular mechanism of short-term salt tolerance in a non-model plant and should provide new insight into salt tolerance. The information obtained from this study, and the identified genes associated with salt tolerance, can be used to advance efforts to use plant biotechnology to improve agricultural productivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant growth and salt treatment</title><p>Seeds of <italic>M. crystallinum</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Col-0 ecotype were maintained in the dark at 4&#x000b0;C for 1 day, sterilized for 5 min in 25% bleach and 0.05% Triton X-100, washed 3 times with sterile water and sown onto Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium (pH 5.8) containing 1% sucrose and 1% agarose.

Although 31 GO categories were represented in the up-regulated genes identified in Arabidopsis treated with 140 mM NaCl, only five GO categories, &#x0201c;response to heat&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;response to cold&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;response to water deprivation&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;response to high light intensity&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;response to abscisic acid stimulus&#x0201d; overlapped with the GO categories that were identified for the up-regulated genes in <italic>M. crystallinum</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0118339.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, bold text). Since only 44 genes were up-regulated in ice plant subjected to the 140 mM NaCl treatment, it was concluded that this level of salt does not have a large impact on the ice plant at the transcriptional level. The observation that the rate of root elongation in ice plants that were exposed to 140 mM NaCl was not significantly different than the rate in ice plants not subjected to salt stress (<xref rid="pone.0118339.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>), supports this contention.

The up-regulation of four genes were found to be common amongst the DREB2A CA OX and 140 mM NaCl treated ice plant datasets.

Lastly, 15 genes were up-regulated in both the 250 mM NaCl-treated ice plant roots and the DREB2A CA OX plants, and 21 genes were commonly up-regulated in both the 500 mM NaCl-treated ice plants and the DREB2A CA OX plants (<xref rid="pone.0118339.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig.</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0118339.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>).

The high levels of salt tolerance, present in some wild species of plants, present an excellent resource to study the adaptive mechanisms that form the basis of salt tolerance, and such plants may provide a valuable source of genes that can be used to improve salt tolerance in agronomic crops. In the present study, the transcriptional response of the ice plant, <italic>M. crystallinum</italic>, treated with different concentrations of NaCl was investigated using RNAseq. In the past ten years, high-throughput sequencing technologies have made whole genome sequencing of non-model organisms possible. As demonstrated in the present study, large numbers of short reads of transcripts of non-model organisms can be assembled into larger contigs composed of genes that can be identified, annotated, and quantified.</p><p>The genome size of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice is estimated to be 125 M bp and 389 M bp, respectively, with 28,517 and 37,869 encoded genes, respectively ([<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], TAIR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.org/">http://www.arabidopsis.org/</ext-link>); [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], IRGSP1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/">http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/</ext-link>)).

In the current study, 53,516 contigs were assembled and 10,818 of them were found to have orthologs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. It has been suggested that 50&#x02013;100 x coverage of the genome is required in order to assemble and analyze the genome of an organism by next generation sequencing [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Based on this estimate, approximately 25 G bp of sequence data would be needed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the ice plant genome and that around 0.8 M bp of sequencing data will be required to identify a single gene. We obtained approximately 5 G bp of sequence data and identified about 11,000 genes with significant homology to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes. This indicates that the amount of sequencing needed per gene is only about 0.4 M bp. Improved prediction of gene structure based on genomic sequences requires the ability of bioinformatic software to assemble contigs from short EST-like transcript sequences [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Since this requires a genome coverage of 50&#x02013;100x, it is easy to see that RNAseq is an economic and efficient approach for investigating the transcriptome and genome of non-model organisms where a reference genome does not exist. The N50 of the ice plant contigs obtained in this study was 1,919 bp, which was larger than the N50 of 887 bp obtained for a semi-mangrove plant, <italic>Millettia pinnata</italic>, that was also obtained by RNAseq [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The N50 of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice was 1,809 and 1942 bp, respectively, which is very similar to what was obtained for ice plant, indicating that many of the contigs from ice plant would be expected to contain the sequence of nearly full-length transcripts.</p><p>Even with RNAseq technologies, there are difficulties in identifying genes that have a low level of expression. We identified 251 ice plant genes with homologues in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> among the 644 genes that were significantly up-regulated by NaCl treatment in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> microarray datasets. The average expression level of these 251 genes, as determined by their signal intensity in the microarray, was approximately 322. The average gene expression level of the remaining 393 genes, for which homologous genes could not be identified in <italic>M. crystallinum</italic>, was 260. It is possible that all 393 of the genes that did not have homologues in the ice plant might represent genes that are unique to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. These results might be due to a failure in the ability to assemble the lowly expressed genes. A comparison of the expression data in the RNAseq datasets with the results obtained by RT-qPCR indicated that the results obtained by RNAseq were highly reliable and could be used to effectively characterize the genes that were affected by salt stress in the ice plant.</p><p>All results obtained in this study including the short reads, assembled sequences, and expression data have been deposited in a publically available database, along with some useful bioinformatic tools for analyzing the datasets. This database was established to foster collaboration between researchers and support present and future work on <italic>M. crystallinum</italic>.</p><p>Almost one-third of the genes identified in the ice plant have othologs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. This number may not be sufficient enough to conduct a complete analysis of the gene regulatory network that is induced by salt in the ice plant. The GO analysis of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> dataset revealed a large number of GO categories that were up-regulated or down-regulated in response to the NaCl treatment. Almost all of the GO categories that were up-regulated in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were not identified in <italic>M. crystallinum</italic>. These results suggest that the system which allows ice plant to be salt tolerant is perhaps unique. Interestingly, &#x0201c;peroxidase activity&#x0201d; in ice plant was down-regulated by 250 and 500 mM NaCl but not in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. This GO category plays and important role in root growth, and the up-regulation of peroxidase activity in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has been reported to promote root growth [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The down-regulation of &#x02018;peroxidase activity&#x02019;-related gene expression in ice plant is consistent with the inhibition of root growth that was observed under the high salt concentrations. Moreover, this category was up-regulated by salt treatment in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> dataset, and the RT-qPCR result indicated that at least two peroxidase genes (At1g30870 and At1g05260) were regulated in an opposite manner in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> vs. ice plant. Mcr016912.000, which is an ortholog of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RCI3 peroxidase gene (At1g05260), decreased its expression level in ice plant in response to the NaCl treatment. Overexpressing <italic>RCI3</italic> in transgenic lines of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> resulted in growth inhibition in response to salt stress [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A comparison of the transcriptome data of DREB2A CA OX with the transcriptome dataset of ice plant indicated that the number of genes significantly affected in both species was quite low. One gene in ice plant, a cationic peroxidase, which is an ortholog of At1g30870 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, was strongly down-regulated but not in DREB2A CA OX (<xref rid="pone.0118339.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig.</xref>). These data also indicate that ice plant likely uses a different mechanism than <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> in responding to salt stress. In addition to DREB2A, there are multiple transcription factors that are involved in salt tolerance (see review in [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). For the next step in the study of salt tolerance mechanisms, we will be able to use our datasets for comparing other signals that are regulated by other transcription factors besides DREB2A orthologs. It is plausible to suggest that perhaps the salt tolerance genes identified in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> studies are already expressed at a high level in ice plant even when the plant is not exposed to salinity. For this reason, ice plant exhibited tolerance to the 140 mM NaCl treatment and roots were able to continue to grow.</p><p>On the other hand, several genes analyzed in the current study exhibited the same expression response to NaCl in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and the ice plant. However, only five GO categories, &#x0201c;response to heat&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;response to cold&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;response to water deprivation&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;response to high light intensity&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;response to abscisic acid stimulus&#x0201d; were up-regulated in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and in ice plant. Salt treatment has been reported to increase endogenous ABA levels in the roots of ice plant [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This finding, along with our transcriptome data, indicates that ABA plays an important role as a signal molecule in the response of both the ice plant and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to salt stress. A QTL analysis of salt tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> was conducted by Katori et al.

Allelic variation in this gene was reported to be a major factor responsible for the natural variation in the ability to accumulate Na in leaves and salt tolerance in general [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Agarie et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118339.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] reported that the mechanism responsible for salt tolerance in the ice plant is its ability to transport salt from roots to the shoots, where it accumulates in bladder cells on the surface of leaves. In our study, the AtHKT1;1 ortholog in ice plant was significantly down-regulated in response to NaCl treatment (<xref rid="pone.0118339.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). The similar result on AtHKT1;1 expression observed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and the ice plant in response to salt treatment, suggests that the ability to transport and isolate excess amounts of Na also plays an important role in salt tolerance in ice plant.</p><p>In conclusion, a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of the response to salt of the ice plant, <italic>M. crystallinum</italic>, was conducted and the resulting dataset was compared with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene expression data obtained from previous studies using microarray. Using these data, we provided an overview of gene expression in the two species in response to salt stress and how expression was either similar or different. <italic>M. crystallinum</italic> is not a commonly used model plant species and a sequenced reference genome is not available. Using our transcriptomic datasets, however, we were able to observe new patterns of gene expression associated with salt tolerance in the ice plant and identify the sequence of the genes associated with salt tolerance in ice plant. Transgenic approaches can now be used to conduct functional studies of these ice-plant-specific genes in model plants and economically important crop species. Furthermore, metabolomic and proteomic data can be combined with our transcriptomic data to develop a comprehensive understanding of salt tolerance in <italic>M. crystallinum</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118339.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Gene expression data based on the RNAseq analysis of the transcriptome of ice plant roots treated with various concentrations of NaCl.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118339.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118339.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Gene expression in roots of NaCl-treated <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants.</title><p>Data were obtained from the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> microarray database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/</ext-link>).</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118339.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118339.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Levels of gene expression in roots of DREB2A CA OX plants and ice plants in response to salt stress.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118339.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118339.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>The list of the primers used to conduct an RT-qPCR analysis of gene expression in ice plant root exposed to salt stress.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118339.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118339.s005"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Venn diagram illustrating the overlap of salt-responsive gene expression in DREB2A CA OX and ice plants.</title><p>Data on gene expression in DREB2A CA OX were obtained from the published study by Sakuma et al.
