However, limitations in present genetic modification techniques impose difficulties in our ability to fully explore the potential of various T cell subsets and assess the potential of other leukocytes armed with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). To address this issue, we generated a transgenic mouse model using a pan-hematopoietic promoter (<italic>vav</italic>) to drive the expression of a CAR specific for a tumor antigen. Here we present a characterization of the immune cell compartment in two unique <italic>vav</italic>-CAR transgenic mice models, Founder 9 (F9) and Founder 38 (F38). We demonstrate the <italic>vav</italic> promoter is indeed capable of driving the expression of a CAR in cells from both myeloid and lymphoid lineage, however the highest level of expression was observed in T lymphocytes from F38 mice. Lymphoid organs in <italic>vav</italic>-CAR mice were smaller and had reduced cell numbers compared to the wild type (WT) controls. Furthermore, the immune composition of F9 mice differed greatly with a significant reduction in lymphocytes found in the thymus, lymph node and spleen of these mice. To gain insight into the altered immune phenotype of F9 mice, we determined the chromosomal integration site of the transgene in both mouse strains using whole genome sequencing (WGS). We demonstrated that compared to the 7 copies found in F38 mice, F9 mice harbored almost 270 copies. These novel <italic>vav-</italic>CAR models provide a ready source of CAR expressing myeloid and lymphoid cells and will aid in facilitating future experiments to delineate the role for other leukocytes for adoptive immunotherapy against cancer.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the Cancer Council of Victoria, Australia (1066554) and the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia (1003667).

In addition to gaining a greater understanding about basic fundamental biology, transgenic mouse models have also been used to generate cellular subsets with useful genetic modifications, facilitating their characterization. This includes fluorescent biomarkers such as the expression of fluorochromes or selectable elements in a certain cellular subset. For example, expression of a gene encoding diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by the Forkhead box p3 (FoxP3) promoter induces transgene expression in regulatory T cells (Treg) and enables their identification by GFP and specific depletion by diphtheria toxin [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Similarly, mice bearing transgenes encoding for specific T cell receptor (TCR) genes facilitate the study of T cell biology and their function against defined antigens, such as the OVA-TCR-1 (OT1) and Clone-4 TCR (CL4) systems [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These mouse models ultimately become a convenient source for isolating specific cell subsets, eliminating the complex and onerous task of <italic>in vitro</italic> genetic modification of cells. Furthermore, transgene integration is consistent in amount and location, which is often not observed in other methods of genetic modification.</p><p>In addition to adding to the basic understanding of the function of a gene, transgenic mouse models have been used to further characterize the expression pattern of specific gene promoters. While the <italic>vav</italic>1 protein (an isoform of <italic>vav</italic>) was known to play a role in immune development and function [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the transcriptional elements and regulation of the promoter was further revealed through generating a transgenic mouse model whereby the marker transgene &#x003b2;-galactosidase (&#x003b2;-gal), and human CD4 in subsequent studies, was driven by the <italic>vav</italic> promoter [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These studies demonstrated the <italic>vav</italic> promoter was capable of driving the expression of a transgene in a transgenic mouse model and, similar to the endogenous <italic>vav</italic>1 protein, transgene expression was restricted to cells of the hematopoietic lineage. Interestingly, they also showed that the expression of the transgene was present during all stages of maturation in multiple immune subsets, indicating the importance of the <italic>vav</italic>1 protein in immune cell development.</p><p>The use of transgenic mouse models has greatly added to the wealth of knowledge in the field of immunology and moreover, transgenic mice are often the subject in the development of current therapeutic treatments, particularly in the study of cancer. Adoptive immunotherapy is a promising form of cancer treatment, which involves the activation and expansion of tumor-reactive lymphocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and their re-infusion into patients [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Transgenic mouse models have also played an important role in the optimization of adoptive immunotherapeutic regimens for patients [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Adoptive immunotherapy of cancer includes the use of genetically modified T cells with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). CAR T cells specific for the CD19 antigen have proven to be clinically efficacious, with recent clinical trials treating a range of blood cancers including B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), achieving up to 90% complete responses in some trials [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have been a major focus in most studies of CAR T cells, recent studies have highlighted the potential for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and macrophages as co-effectors to enhance the anti-tumor effect of adoptively transferred T cells [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, very few studies have investigated the therapeutic potential of various other adoptively transferred immune subsets in the context of cancer. Despite the success observed in these studies and the knowledge that the co-transfer of helper immune subsets, together with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, generates a greater anti-tumor response, there have been no studies investigating the anti-tumor potential of different combinations of CAR-expressing leukocyte subsets.</p><p>Our minimal understanding of the potential role of CAR-expressing leukocyte subsets stems, at least in part, because of the technical difficulties in genetically modifying many major leukocyte subsets. A common form of stable genetic modification utilizes retroviral vectors, which leads to the integration of the desired transgenes into the genome. Although effective for highly proliferative cells such as T cells, this approach is not yet clinically applicable to more quiescent cells or slower growing cells of the innate immune system. Furthermore, <italic>ex vivo</italic> activation, used to induce proliferation, changes the phenotype of na&#x000ef;ve or unstimulated lymphocytes subsets. Finally, as <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured cells often have a short half life, the constant supply of engineered T cells requires new cycles of retroviral transduction be performed regularly, a process that is laborious, costly and time consuming.</p><p>To overcome these limitations and study the <italic>in vivo</italic> biology of a range of CAR-expressing immune subsets, we have developed a transgenic mouse model in which the expression of a CAR specific for the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/ErbB2) tumor antigen is driven by the <italic>vav</italic> promoter, which is crucial in immune cell development [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and active in most hematopoietic cells [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The CAR was composed of two intracellular signaling chains (CD28 and CD3&#x003b6;) linked to an extracellular signaling motif recognizing Her2/ErbB2 [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The restricted expression of the <italic>vav</italic> promoter ensured that the expression of the CAR was expressed only on cells of hematopoietic origin [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In two different founders, we demonstrate that the <italic>vav</italic> promoter is capable of driving the expression of the CAR on multiple immune subsets, from both lymphoid and myeloid origin. Interestingly, in one of the founders (Founder 9) we observed a very high CAR gene copy number (~270), which was associated with abnormal T cell development and a reduction in T cell numbers in both the thymus and periphery. The second founder (Founder 38) contained fewer integrations [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], whose presence seemed to have less effect on immune development and differentiation. The generation of this transgenic model will further enhance our knowledge about the role of CAR expression in both the development and function of different lymphoid and myeloid subsets.</p><p>This work was performed as part of a PhD thesis with publication by C.SM.Yong. Studies characterizing the function and anti-tumor potential of cells derived from these mice will be the subject of a future publication within the same thesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Generation of the <italic>vav</italic>-CAR transgene and transgenic mice</title><p>Previous work using the HS21/45 promoter in generating transgenic mouse models have reported that the function of the <italic>vav</italic> promoter relies on the presence of the hypersensitivity sites 1, 2, 4 and 5 [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

Structural variation detection with Socrates ([<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) detected a total of 86 breakpoints in the sequencing data for F9 (<bold><xref rid="pone.0140543.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref></bold>) and 69 for F38 (<bold><xref rid="pone.0140543.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref></bold>). The breakpoints identified how the transgene components are connected, as well as sub-blocks within the two main components, and an additional segment on Chr17. Further analysis of the read mappings also identified overhanging, non-mapping reads in between the two main components on Chr17. An assembly of those reads (and matching extensions) identified a 2.1 kbp sequence inserted in between the native material.

There were no fusions of the transgene and the native mouse genome predicted by Socrates. We then proceeded to investigate anomalously mapped read pairs and, in particular, fragments that are partially mapped to the transgene and any of the native chromosomes. Clusters of such read pairs indicated the insertion site for both of the samples (<bold>Figs <xref rid="pone.0140543.g008" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0140543.g009" ref-type="fig">9</xref></bold>).

Given the evidence of singular insertion sites in both samples, as well as homozygous fusions from the end of the transgene to its start in both samples we conclude that the multiple copies of the transgene formed a single concatemer, always orientated 5&#x02019; to 3&#x02019;, that has then been integrated into the mouse genome.</p><p>The results from whole genome sequencing revealed Founder 9 mice harbored a large number of transgene copies, with 267 copies (heterozygotes) integrated in Chromosome 10 at position 97235394 (on the negative strand) (<bold><xref rid="pone.0140543.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A</xref></bold>).

Indeed, in addition to answering basic fundamental biological questions, transgenic mice have also been utilized as a tool for generating large numbers of genetically modified cell subsets and have had particular importance in proof of principle studies. In order to better understand the role of immune subsets other than T cells when genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor against a tumor antigen, we took the approach of developing a mouse model in which the expression of a CAR was under the control of an immune specific promoter (<italic>vav</italic>), whose expression is integral in immune cell maturation and development. Here we demonstrate the ability of the <italic>vav</italic> promoter to drive the expression of a CAR transgene in multiple immune cells of both myeloid and lymphoid origin.</p><p>Interestingly, we observed a marked difference in both the composition and anatomical appearance of the immune compartment in <italic>vav</italic>-CAR transgenic mice (F9 and F38) compared to WT mice. A distinct reduction in size, weight and cellular numbers from both the spleen and thymus of <italic>vav</italic>-CAR mice was observed when compared to control mice. While both transgenic founder lines were generated in the same manner, through pro-nuclear microinjection, there were evident differences within the immune composition of F9 and F38 mice, suggesting a variation in the integration point of the <italic>vav</italic>-CAR transgene. These differences were apparent in the lymphocyte compartment of F9, whereas the proportion of cells of the myeloid lineage from both F9 and F38 mice were comparable to those from WT mice. The transgene integration of F9 mice had profound effects on the development of T cells, and was apparent during all stages of T cell development as anomalies in the proportion and development of T cells in the thymus, lymph nodes and spleens of these mice were observed.</p><p>It is well accepted that the generation of transgenic mice involves many random factors; the number of copies, the orientation of those copies and the integration site itself are all uncontrollable events. While the number of copies differed between F9 and F38 mice, the transgene orientation was similar; in that each transgene copy was orientated 5&#x02019; to 3&#x02019;, creating a long unidirectional fragment of repeating DNA. Linearized DNA used to generate transgenic mice has been reported to form long unidirectional concatemers <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The linearized DNA is found to re-circularize via intra-molecular ligation, after which homologous recombination between the plasmids results in the formation of a tandem &#x02018;head to tail&#x02019; concatemer of transgene DNA. This occurs prior to insertion into the host genome, which is hypothesized to occur via preferential integration based on short homologous sequences at the ends of the introduced concatemer [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, this unidirectional concatenate process is dependent on the concentration of linear DNA injected, with &#x02018;head to head&#x02019; or &#x02018;tail to tail&#x02019; junctions observed in high concentrations of injected DNA [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. While amplification of the integrated transgene may also contribute to the large copy number, previous studies have shown a correlative relationship between the integrated copy number and the number of copies injected [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Despite finding the entry point for the transgenes, the exit point in F9 mice remains undetermined. While the best scenario is to assume that the transgene has inserted in a linear manner and exited from the genome at the same point of entry (creating a clean break), there also remains the possibility of non-linear insertion, and subsequently the exit point at another location in the genome. Other gene mapping procedures, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or thermal asymmetric interlaced (TAIL) PCR [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], could be used to properly determine the transgene location in the genome and the exact exit point, respectively.</p><p>We demonstrated that the <italic>vav</italic> promoter was indeed capable of driving the expression of a CAR throughout multiple immune subsets, from both myeloid and lymphoid lineages in both F9 and F38 mice. The proportion of CAR expressing cells differed between the immune subsets in each mouse strain. The role of <italic>vav</italic>1 in the development and function of T cells and NK cells has been well established [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], however the role of <italic>vav</italic>1 in monocytes is not as well characterized [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Studies utilizing <italic>vav</italic>1<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice have shown it is integral in migration, morphology and complement-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages and is particularly important for integrin regulation in neutrophils [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our study also demonstrates that the <italic>vav</italic>1 promoter is transcriptionally active in these subsets as we observed a significant proportion of CAR expressing myeloid cells, albeit the level of CAR expression was lower than those observed in T lymphocytes. This may be due to a reduced necessity of <italic>vav</italic>1 protein for the development and function of these immune subsets compared to lymphoid cells. Indeed, previous studies in <italic>vav</italic>1<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice have shown that mice deficient in <italic>vav</italic>1 have exhibited altered immune phenotypes, with the most notable abnormalities reported in the development and function of B and T lymphocytes [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition, our results support the findings that cells of the myeloid lineage may not be entirely reliant on <italic>vav</italic>1 for proper development. While lymphoid development was greatly disturbed in F9 mice, both cellular numbers and proportion of monocytes were comparable to that of WT mice [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, the scope of our study did not properly assess the migratory or phagocytic abilities of monocytes, although it remains possible that these functions may be impaired in F9 mice.</p><p>Surprisingly, the results from whole genome sequencing revealed the insertion site in F9 mice did not interrupt a protein-coding gene integral in T cell development, but rather was located within a predicted <italic>linc</italic>RNA (Gm34044), whose function is yet to be characterized. Disruption of this predicted gene may have contributed to the observed phenotype, however we hypothesize that rather, a developmental block at the transition from DN to DP in the thymus due to altered thymic developmental transcriptional networks or possibly early elimination is responsible for the altered immune phenotype observed in these mice.</p><p>Given the abnormal phenotype in F9 mice and the developmental block observed in F9 thymocytes, we had hypothesized a reduction in endogenous <italic>vav</italic> transcription may have been responsible. Surprisingly, our data suggested that a reduction in the transcription of endogenous <italic>vav</italic> was not the cause of the developmental block in F9 mice. Previous accounts of <italic>vav</italic>1 deficiency in thymocyte development have observed a large reduction in single positive (SP) and double positive (DP) cell numbers, yet no difference observed in the number of double negative (DN) thymocytes between WT and <italic>vav</italic>1<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We observed in our F9 model similar reductions in both the DP and SP populations, however in contrast to previous accounts in <italic>vav</italic>1<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] we report a significantly large proportion of DN thymocytes (58% in F9, 2% in WT and 6% in F38).</p><p>Studies using <italic>vav</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have demonstrated the necessity for <italic>vav</italic> during thymic development, with particular importance during the transition from CD44<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> (DN3) to CD44<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>-</sup> (DN4) in the double negative stage [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The role for <italic>vav</italic> at this timepoint seems to be integral for the expression of not only the pre-TCR but also for autocrine production of IL-2 [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Thymocytes lacking in <italic>vav</italic> are unable to receive adequate IL-2 stimulation, and as a result are arrested in the double negative phase. The thymic phenotype of F9 mice closely mimics that observed in mice with compound deficiencies in both <italic>vav</italic> and an additional gene essential for thymic selection. Developmental blocks between the DN and DP stage have been reported in studies looking at <italic>vav</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup><italic>Rag-2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> thymocytes [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] as well as <italic>vav</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> x A1 transgenic TCR mice [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Similar observations have also been made in mice deficient in other members involved in the T cell activation pathway. Thymocytes from mice deficient for <italic>slp76</italic>, <italic>lat</italic> or double deficient for <italic>syk/zap70</italic> display a more severe phenotype to F9 mice, with almost 100% thymic arrest in development between the DN3 to DN4 stage [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], resulting in a large proportion of DN thymocytes in these models. We had hypothesized the high copy number of transgene <italic>vav</italic> promoters may have diverted transcription factors from the endogenous <italic>vav</italic> promoter, resulting in reduced <italic>vav</italic> transcription and thus causing a developmental block in the thymus in F9 mice. However, we observed no differences in the mRNA levels of <italic>vav</italic>1 in our studies. It is well accepted that transcription factors are promiscuous in nature and often can bind and regulate more than one singular gene. As transcriptional regulation acts as a balanced network, it would be fruitful to widen our RNA analysis, potentially by performing an RNAseq to determine whether other transcriptional programs were affected.</p><p>Another hypothesis that may also explain the immunodeficiency observed in F9 mice is that continuous signaling via the intracellular CD3&#x003b6; chain of the CAR may have abrogated normal development of T lymphocytes. While both <italic>vav</italic>-CAR mice express the CAR during all stages of thymic development, the differences in the T cell population of these mice may be due to the copy number or number of intracellular CD3&#x003b6; molecules present. Previous studies have also observed defects in immune development in transgenic mice bearing high transgene copy numbers. High copy numbers (&#x0003e;11) of an isoform of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) or the heavy chain constant region locus of B lymphocytes were found to produce defects in B cell development, and similar to F9 mice, a splenic population of &#x0201c;null&#x0201d; cells which did not stain for a number of immune markers [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In particular, a transgenic model with a high copy number of the human CD3&#x003b5; closely mirrors the phenotype we observe in F9 mice, whereby mice containing over 30 copies of the transgene had much smaller thymuses, and were also T cell immunodeficient [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Intriguingly, this deficiency was only observed in mice with &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; copy numbers (&#x0003e;10). Similarly, immunodeficiency was only present in our high copy number line (F9) where as immune development in F38 mice, with low copy number, seemed relatively unaltered. Future studies generating transgenic models should take this factor into consideration, that not only the transgene insertion but also the copy number may interrupt normal development.</p><p>In addition to the developmental blockade between the DN and DP stages in F9 mice, thymocytes from both transgenic strains seemed to be skewed towards a DN4 stage, with almost 80% of DN thymocytes present at this point of development. Similar observations have been reported in mice overexpressing both the pre-TCR&#x003b1; chain in addition to a pre-rearranged TCR&#x003b2; chain (pT&#x003b1; Tg<sup>high</sup> x V&#x003b2;5 Tg) [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], with almost all DN thymocytes present in the DN4 stage of development. The excess availability of the pre-TCR&#x003b1; in this model was hypothesized to facilitate a more efficient transition through the DN stages of development, resulting in a higher level of proliferation of DN3 and greater survival of DN4 thymocytes. As <italic>vav</italic> is known to play an integral role in downstream signaling of the pre-TCR&#x003b1; [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], dysregulation in the expression of the <italic>vav</italic> promoter may have potentially contributed to this phenotype. This increase in developmental efficiency may also be due to the internal signaling components of the receptor. The presence of both a CD3&#x003b6; and CD28 intracellular signaling chain prior to the expression of the pre-TCR&#x003b1; or TCR&#x003b2; chain may have provided sufficient stimuli to accelerate the thymic development process, resulting in a much larger population of DN4 thymocytes.</p><p>Given the importance of <italic>vav</italic>1 in lymphocytes, it was surprising to note the complete absence of CAR expression in B lymphocytes, an immune subset which had been previously reported to display high levels of transgene expression under the <italic>vav</italic> promoter. In previous <italic>vav</italic> transgenic mouse models, Oglivy <italic>et al</italic>. reported high levels of a human CD4 transgene and the anti-apoptotic protein B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) in multiple immune subsets and during all stages of immune development [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140543.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This information together suggests that the absence of CAR expression in B cells is unlikely to be due to a genetic event, but rather mediated by the CAR itself. Since the transgene used in our model comprised of an extracellular single chain variable fragment of antibody origin, we speculate that recognition of the CAR during the natural negative selection process may have resulted in deletion of CAR expressing B cells, allowing only CAR-negative clones to survive in the periphery. Alternatively, structural elements within the CAR may have rendered it unsuitable for expression in B cells. Furthermore, the CAR transgene encodes a protein encoding immune-signaling elements, unlike previous <italic>vav-</italic>driven transgenes, which may also have contributed to the altered immune phenotypes.</p><p>In contrast, we also observed a large proportion of lineage-negative cells present in both the thymus and in the peripheral organs of F9 mice. These &#x02018;<italic>other</italic>&#x02019; cells were bereft of most immune surface markers yet expressed the highest level of CAR compared to every other immune subset. The developmental block in DN to DP thymocytes, in conjunction with the high level of receptor expression in these cells, lends support to our hypothesis whereby the high copy number of the <italic>vav-</italic>CAR promoter outcompeted the endogenous <italic>vav</italic> promoter for transcription factors. Indeed, the level of CAR expression on peripheral T cells was proportional to the number of transgenes present (in homozygous or heterozygous mice), and was inversely correlative with the total number of T cells. Based on our findings, we assume these lineage-negative cells are lymphocytes that have not undergone complete development due the reduction in endogenous <italic>vav</italic>1 protein, however we cannot account for how these cells were able to survive the natural selection process in the thymus and furthermore migrate and survive in the periphery. Ironically, while having a detrimental effect on a large proportion of thymocyte development, the presence of receptor and more importantly, its intracellular signaling chains, may have also provided sufficient stimuli for these cells to escape negative selection. There is also the possibility these lineage negative cells may belong to the non-conventional lymphocyte family. The depth of our study did not focus greatly on this arm of the immune system, and other cells such as natural killer T cells (NKTs) [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] or mucosal associated invariant T cells (MAIT) cells [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] may also have contributed to this population. Furthermore, innate lymphoid cells (ILC), a relatively recent addition to this family, are characterized by the lack of conventional immune surface markers [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Future work will look into characterizing these <italic>other</italic> cells and assessing their function.</p><p>In this study, we introduce a novel mouse model for the study of different immune subsets that are capable of expressing a chimeric antigen receptor. We exploited the expression of the <italic>vav</italic>1 promoter to ensure CAR expression was strictly restricted to immune cell subsets. Two founder mice were generated in this study, Founder 38 with a relatively normal immune phenotype and Founder 9 displaying gross abnormalities in regards to the development and maturation of T lymphocytes. Using whole genome sequencing, we determined the insertion sites and observed a marked difference in the number of transgene insertions in both transgenic mice. While the integration site in these mice had little effect on their natural immune development, it was possible that the copy number of transgenes could interfere with immune development. To this end, we report that the <italic>vav</italic> promoter was indeed capable of driving the expression of a CAR throughout multiple immune subsets in various stages of maturation. A detailed characterization of these mice will greatly benefit future studies investigating the function of CAR expressing immune cells. The use of a transgenic mouse model in which multiple immune cells stably express the same CAR against a tumor antigen will allow for future studies to delineate a role for other immune cells in adoptive immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Generating <italic>vav</italic>-CAR plasmid DNA</title><p>Previous studies have described the HS21/45 plasmid containing the <italic>vav</italic> promoter flanking the human CD4 transgene (<bold><xref rid="pone.0140543.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref></bold>) [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

This is linked to an extracellular c-myc tag and human CD8 hinge region. The intracellular signaling chains consist of mouse CD28 and mouse CD3&#x003b6; (<bold><xref rid="pone.0140543.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>)</bold>. Both HS21/45 plasmid and pCR4 TOPO plasmid were digested using restriction enzymes <italic>Not1</italic> and <italic>Sfi1</italic>. Digested DNA was isolated on a 1% agarose gel. The HS21/45 containing the <italic>vav</italic> promoter and the CAR insert was then extracted and ligated (<bold><xref rid="pone.0140543.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref></bold>). Nucleotide sequencing was performed to verify the correct ligation (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Generating <italic>vav</italic>-CAR mice</title><p>Ethics statement: This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations of the Victorian Bureau of Animal Welfare, Department of Primary Industries, and the National Health and Medical Research Council's Australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee: Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee under Permit number E498. All efforts were made to minimize suffering. Mice were monitored daily for deterioration in condition and signs of stress, as defined by lethargy, ruffled fur or a hunched appearance, at which time the mice were considered to have reached the ethically permitted humane endpoint criteria and were humanely euthanized. Mice were euthanized using carbon dioxide asphyxiation. Tumors in excess of 150 mm2 were also considered to have reached humane endpoint criteria.</p><p>The HS21/45 DNA plasmid containing the CAR insert (<italic>vav</italic>-CAR) was prepared using an Endofree kit (Qiagen, Netherlands) to isolate endotoxin-free DNA. The HS21/45-CAR plasmid was digested using <italic>HindIII</italic> and analyzed on a 1% SeaPlaque Agarose gel (Lonza). The <italic>vav</italic>-CAR transgene was excised, treated with agarase enzyme (New England Biolabs) and centrifuged to pellet residual agarose. The DNA supernatant was then applied to VM Millipore filters (pore size 0.05&#x003bc;M, VMWP02500), suspended in Injection Buffer (10mM Tris (HCl) pH 7.4, 0.1mM EDTA, 10 M NaOH, MilliQ water) and allowed to dialyze in Injection Buffer at room temperature for 5&#x02013;6 hours. The DNA concentration was assessed by comparing a series of DNA dilutions with a microinjection standard on a 1% gel. The final concentration of DNA was adjusted to 2 mg/ml. The <italic>HindIII</italic> digested fragment encoding the transgene was pronuclear microinjected into fertilized oocytes derived from C57BL/6 mice. Pups were tested for transgene integration by PCR amplification of the SV40 sequence using the following primers SV40 forward 5&#x02019;-ATGAGTTTGGACAAACCACAACTAG-3&#x02019; and reverse 5&#x02019;-ACCTCCCCCTGAACCTGAAACATAA-3&#x02019;. Amplified DNA was analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. In all experiments, wild type mice consisted of Her2<sup>+</sup> transgenic mice [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] or wild type C57BL/6 mice. No difference was observed between both strains in terms of organ weight, cellular number or immune composition for these studies, thus WT mice denote control mice negative for the CAR transgene.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>The spleen, thymus and inguinal lymph nodes were harvested from either WT mice, Founder 9 mice or Founder 38 mice and dissociated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were then processed through a 70 &#x003bc;m filter to produce single cell suspensions. Splenocytes and peripheral blood were treated with ammonium chloride potassium (ACK) lysis buffer to eliminate red blood cells. Cells were then counted and resuspended in Fc receptor-blocking buffer (anti-mouse Fc&#x003b3;RII/Fc&#x003b3;RIII, clone 2.4G2 made in house from tissue culture supernatant) for 10 minutes prior to staining with the following antibodies; TCR&#x003b2;-PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone H57-597), CD3-e450 (clone 17A2), CD4-APC-eF780 (clone RM4-5), CD8-Pe-Cy7 (clone 53&#x02013;6.7), CD11C-e450 (clone N418), CD11B-APC (clone M1/70), F4/80-Pe-Cy7 (clone BM8), GR1-APC-eF780 (clone RB6-8C5), CD19-PE (clone eBio1D3), FR4-APC (clone eBio12A5), CD25-PE (clone PC61.5), NK1.1-Pe-Cy7 (clone PK136), CD49b-APC (clone DX5), &#x003b3;&#x003b4;- Biotin (clone GL3) (Gamma delta), Streptavadin-PE (all from eBioscience), Myc-tag Alexa488 (clone 9B11) (Cell Signaling) or mouse immunoglobulin isotype IgG2a Alexa488 (Invitrogen).

The DNA was quantified and the purity verified. 500 ng of DNA were fragmented using a focal acoustic device (Covaris S2) and used to prepare libraries with the KAPA Library Preparation Kit for Illumina platforms (KAPABIOSYSTEMS). Libraries were size selected to an average fragment size of 600 bp using the PippinPrep Instrument (SAGE Science). Three indexed libraries were pooled and sequenced across three lanes of an Illumina HiSeq2500 flowcell using High Output chemistry v3 (Illumina) to generate 2x100 bp reads.</p><p>The sequencing data consisted of three lanes each of 100 nucleotides long paired-end (PE) reads generated on an Illumina HiSeq. The F9 data contains about 380 million reads (2*192,120,925) and the F38 data 325 million reads (2*162,782,766). To align the read data we used bowtie2 (version 2.2.3 [<xref rid="pone.0140543.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]) and the mm10 build of the mouse genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">http://genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>) as reference. We ran bowtie2 with the &#x0201c;&#x02014;local&#x0201d; option to enable it to partially map reads, which is needed for subsequent structural variant analysis. The mapping to the mm10 reference resulted in a 99.6% alignment rate for F9 and an average haploid sequence coverage of 12.8. Similarly, the alignment rate for F38 mice was 99.7% with an average haploid sequence coverage of 10.8. The whole genome sequencing dataset can be found in the European Nucleotide Archive with study title &#x0201c;Expression of a chimeric antigen receptor in multiple leukocyte lineages in transgenic mice&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>PCR for transgene integration</title><p>The following PCR primers were designed to verify the genotype of <italic>vav</italic>-CAR mice. <bold>F9 mice</bold>; Gm34044 forward: 5&#x02019;-CCATTTGGATTTGCTGTCCT-3&#x02019;, CAR reverse 5&#x02019;-TAACCCACCAGATTCCAAGC-3&#x02019;, Gm34044 reverse: 5&#x02019;-ATGGGCATTTTCTGTTGGAA-3&#x02019;. <bold>F38 Mice</bold>; For transgene: Stxbp5l forward 1: 5&#x02019;-AATGAAATGACCTGGTAATCATT- 3&#x02019;, CAR reverse: 5&#x02019;-AGGCGAGGACAATTTCTATCC-3&#x02019;, For wild-type: Stxbp5l forward 2: 5&#x02019;-CTAGCAGTTCCTGTTGAGATA- 3&#x02019;, Stxbp5l reverse: 5&#x02019; -ACTTGCTTCTCTCTCCTTATG- 3&#x02019;.
