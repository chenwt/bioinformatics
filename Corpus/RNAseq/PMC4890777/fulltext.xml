The most ubiquitous, CD44 standard, has been used as a cancer stem cell marker in ovarian and other cancers. Expression of the epithelial CD44 variant containing exons v8-10 (CD44v8-10) has been associated with more chemoresistant and metastatic tumors in gastrointestinal and breast cancers, but its role in ovarian cancer is unknown; we therefore investigated its use as a prognostic marker in this disease. The gene expression profiles of 254 tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas RNAseqV2 were analyzed for the presence of CD44 isoforms. A trend for longer survival was observed in patients with high expression of CD44 isoforms that include exons v8-10. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of tumors for presence of CD44v8-10 was performed on an independent cohort of 210 patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer using a tumor tissue microarray. Patient stratification based on software analysis of staining revealed a statistically significant increase in survival in patients with the highest levels of transmembrane protein expression (top 10 or 20%) compared to those with the lowest expression (bottom 10 and 20%) (p = 0.0181, p = 0.0262 respectively). Expression of CD44v8-10 in primary ovarian cancer cell lines was correlated with a predominantly epithelial phenotype characterized by high expression of epithelial markers and low expression of mesenchymal markers by qPCR, Western blot, and IHC. Conversely, detection of proteolytically cleaved and soluble extracellular domain of CD44v8-10 in patient ascites samples was correlated with significantly worse prognosis (p&#x0003c;0.05). Therefore, presence of transmembrane CD44v8-10 on the surface of primary tumor cells may be a marker of a highly epithelial tumor with better prognosis while enzymatic cleavage of CD44v8-10, as detected by presence of the soluble extracellular domain in ascites fluid, may be indicative of a more metastatic disease and worse prognosis.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Commons Development</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donahoe</surname><given-names>Patricia K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Austen Fund</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donahoe</surname><given-names>Patricia K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>McBride Family</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donahoe</surname><given-names>Patricia K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Sudna Gar</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>P&#x000e9;pin</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005294</institution-id><institution>Massachusetts General Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donahoe</surname><given-names>Patricia K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="18"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files or on the TCGA website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">http://cancergenome.nih.gov/</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files or on the TCGA website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">http://cancergenome.nih.gov/</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of death among women with gynecological cancer worldwide, with the high mortality attributable to the advanced stage at which it is diagnosed, typically long after intraperitoneal metastatic spread has occurred [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In order for metastasis to occur, ovarian cancer cells often alter expression of proteins involved in extracellular matrix interaction, such as CD44, to modulate invasion [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156595.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As a cellular adhesion molecule and a major extracellular glycoprotein, the hyaluronic acid receptor CD44 has been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis in breast, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>CD44 is encoded by a maximum of 20 exons, 10 of which are referred to as variant exons. The standard isoform (CD44s) contains only 10 exons, including the first 5 exons of the 5&#x02019; end and the last 5 exons of the 3&#x02019; end, thus lacking the variant exons in the middle, referred to as v1-v10 or exons 5a-15 in standard nomenclature [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156595.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156595.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. CD44s is the most ubiquitous isoform, widely expressed on the surface of most tissues and all hematopoieitic cells where it is responsible for lymphocyte homing and other cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. A large number of alternative splicing isoforms of CD44 exist which contain a combination of variant exons (V1 through V10) inserted into the juxtamembrane extracellular region under the control of epithelial splicing regulatory proteins (ESRP) 1 and 2 [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Many CD44 variant isoforms have tissue-specific expression; CD44v8-10 is expressed in epithelial tissues and in epithelial-type carcinomas of the pancreas, prostate, breast, and lung [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], where it has been extensively studied as a specific marker of malignant cells, with increased expression observed during gastric carcinogenesis in a murine model and in the adenoma to carcinoma progression in human colorectal cancer [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and gastric cancers [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>CD44s and CD44 variant isoforms have been implicated in drug resistance and identified as stem cell markers [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

However, studies on isoforms containing different individual variant exons in ovarian cancer have generally suggested improved overall survival associated with splice isoforms of CD44 [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The epithelial splice variant 8&#x02013;10, expressing v8, v9, and v10 together, has not been examined in high-grade serous ovarian cancer; Therefore, it&#x02019;s reliability and feasibility in predicting prognosis was investigated in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data analysis</title><p>Expression data (Level 3) on documented CD44s and CD44 variant isoforms for tumors of the ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma was analyzed in a cohort of 255 subjects in the TCGA (after censoring samples from recurrent tumors and focusing only on high-grade disease (G2 and G3)).

Tumor core samples (3 mm) were obtained at initial debulking surgery, scored according to the F&#x000e9;d&#x000e9;ration Internationale de Gyn&#x000e9;cologie Obst&#x000e9;trique (FIGO) guidelines, and were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. All tumors biopsies, discarded de-identified ascites samples, and corresponding patient information were collected under IRB-approved protocols after written informed consent was obtained. Each new paraffin block contained 24 randomly distributed tumor cores, with at least 2 cores per patient, and were sectioned at 7 micron thickness as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Slides were rinsed and stained with a diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution, counter stained with Hematoxylin (Dako, Carpinteria CA), dehydrated, and coverslipped before being scanned and digitized with a Scanscope (Leica, Buffalo Grove IL) and analyzed with the Aperio Imagescope software (Leica, Buffalo Grove IL). Positivity and Intensity (PI) scores were calculated as the product of stained area fraction (positivity) and its intensity. For the purpose of the staining analysis, we examined only cores in which greater than 50% of the tissue remained intact on the glass slide. Based on this criterion we had 6 patients for whom we calculated the PI score using a single core, and 203 in which we took the average PI score from 2 cores, for a total of 209 patients analysed. Patient survival was calculated from date of diagnosis to date of death, or entrance into hospice care when not available and converted from days to months by dividing the number of days by 30. Overall survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier plots and statistical significance inferred by log-rank tests. Correlations to clinical parameters were made using chi-square analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using the Prism 6 software (Graphpad, La Jolla CA).</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Cell Lines</title><p>A series of primary ovarian cancer cell lines was derived from patient ascites, per IRB-approved protocol (#2007P001918/MGH) [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Briefly, after centrifugation of the ascites fluid, the cell pellets were introduced into tissue culture under two different conditions (adherent and spheroid). In adherent cultures, cells were maintained at complete confluency for several weeks to several months until tight epithelial cell clones were observed. Contaminating cell types (leukocytes, mesothelial, and fibroblast cells) were removed by repeated partial trypsin digestion until no contaminating cell types could be observed. Subsequently the cells were passaged at least 5 times at 1:10 dilution to derive stable homogenous cell line. Alternatively, for spheroid cultures (denoted by the&#x02013;sph suffix), cells were plated in regular flasks for 24h and non-adherent cells were collected and transferred into new ultra-low attachment flasks, while attached cells were discarded. Spheroid cultures were passaged by dissociation and diluted 1:10 for at least 5 passages to derive stable homogenous cell lines. The panel of primary cell lines consists of 16 serous epithelial ovarian cancers (ptAB, ptAB-sph, ptAF, ptAF-sph, ptW, ptW-sph, ptAO, ptAO-sph, ptD, ptH, ptAI, PKD1, PKD2, ptAL-sph, ptAM-sph, ptAK-sph), one endometrioid epithelial cancers (ptAP-sph), and one mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer (ptG) grown in adherent and/or spheroid culture conditions.</p><p>Primary cell lines were maintained in cell culture in monolayers in DMEM:F12 media with 10% FFBS 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine (Corning, New York NY) or as non-adherent spheres in serum-free tumor sphere media [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] at 37C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

All primary tumor microarray samples examined were taken at the time of initial debulking surgery. Diffuse and focal staining was observed in the columnar epithelium of papillae, often in the basal layer (arrows) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156595.g002">Fig 2A, 2B and 2C</xref>) of the epithelium, but not in the tumor stroma in any of the cores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156595.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), and always on the cell surface rather than an intracellular or cytoplasmic location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156595.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, insert). Total intensity of positive pixels and total number of positive pixels, as determined by Imagescope software, were combined into a positive intensity score (PI), which was averaged across the two representative cores per patient, and used for patient stratification.

We confirmed this finding using an independent cohort of 210 patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma in which we investigated cell surface expression of the transmembrane CD44v8-10 protein in a tumor tissue microarray. When patients were stratified based on expression levels to compare the top 10% and 20% to the bottom 10% and 20% respectively, we found a statistically significant improved survival in the highest expressing patients compared to the lowest expressing patients, with a 69% and 73% increase in median survival time respectively, which correspond to a difference of over 20 months. The predictive power of CD44v8-10 staining in the tumor is stronger in younger patients, suggesting it is best used for prognosis in patients under the age of 60. Increased survival was predicted by previous observations of a survival benefit associated with expression of CD44s and other full-length transmembrane CD44 variant isoforms[<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156595.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesized that the increased survival observed with high expression of cell surface transmembrane CD44v8-10 protein may be related to the more epithelial nature of those tumors. Using an unbiased approach based on principal component analysis of qPCR markers of mesenchymal and epithelial status, we found that CD44v8-10 correlates with epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and EpCAM, while CD44s correlates with mesenchymal markers such as vimentin in ovarian cancer. Previous studies using E-cadherin, EpCAM, and vimentin as tumor markers, have shown that epithelial differentiation of tumors is associated with improved prognosis in many cancer types including breast, ovarian, colorectal, prostate, and gastrointestinal [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], presumably due to the less invasive nature of these tumors. Expression of E-cadherin has been extensively studied since downregulation during epithelial to mesenchymal transition is associated with increased cancer cell migration and more metastatic tumors in ovarian cancer [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Conversely, EpCAM over-expression has been associated with both improved prognoses and favorable response to platinum based chemotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] further suggesting that epithelial differentiation leads to improved prognosis in ovarian cancer. Expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin in epithelial cells of pancreatic and non-small cell lung carcinomas is correlated with poor prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156595.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Similarly, in ovarian cancer, the presence of a higher percentage of vimentin positive cells in metastatic pleural effusions is associated with increased chemoresistance and poor initial response to chemotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These results suggest that the epithelial phenotype of ovarian cancer cells may be a favorable prognosticator in ovarian cancer, for which transmembrane CD44v8-10 may be a useful marker.</p><p>Interestingly, there is both intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity in the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers in our datasets suggesting the epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes are not dichotomous but rather a continuum or an EM spectrum [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The data we obtained from primary tumor xenografts and from the primary cell lines from which the tumors were grown, suggest that some tumors can express epithelial markers such as CD44v8-10 protein alongside mesenchymal markers such as vimentin. Our observation supports the hypothesis that ovarian cancers are highly heterogeneous and can have intermediate characteristics in between the well-differentiated epithelial or mesenchymal phenotypes which may be important for prognosis, and for which additional markers of EM may be particularly useful [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156595.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>It is important to differentiate between the proteolytically cleaved, soluble fragments and the intact protein of CD44v8-10 found on the cell surface. The presence of CD44v8-10 on the surface of the cancer cells and its association with epithelial differentiation, may confer a survival benefit in high grade serous ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156595.g007">Fig 7</xref>). However, we hypothesize that loss of CD44v8-10 from the cell surface could be implicated in epithelial to mesenchymal transition and more aggressive behavior of a tumor. Decreased surface expression of CD44v8-10 could be achieved by either downregulation of expression at the transcriptional level, an isoform switch regulated by splice factors away from variant exons v8-10, or as a result of increased proteolytic cleavage. For the latter, we have previously shown that CD44 cleavage is associated with tumor invasion and is mediated by the ADAM10 and ADAM17 proteases [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Furthermore the cleaved extracellular domain of CD44v8-10 may act as a dominant negative by preventing extracellular matrix binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156595.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Previous attempts to detect CD44s and CD44 splice variants (V5, V6 and V7-8) in the serum of ovarian cancer patients did not reveal a significant prognostic effect of these molecules as a predictor of tumor burden or recurrence [<xref rid="pone.0156595.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; however, cleaved and soluble V8-10 isoforms have not been investigated in the serum or ascites of ovarian cancer patients. We were able to detect cleaved soluble CD44v8-10 in ascites of patients by western blot, and found an association with worse prognosis, suggesting this specific isoform may be a useful biomarker. We hypothesize that high cleavage rates of CD44v8-10 isoforms may be associated with more metastatic cancer cells which overexpress proteases, and since CD44v8-10 is highly specific to malignant ascites while CD44s is ubiquitous in patient fluids, soluble CD44v8-10 may represent a uniquely sensitive biomarker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156595.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Further studies should determine if the cleaved extracellular domain of CD44v8-10 is detectable in the serum of ovarian cancers patients by ELISA where it could be employed as a biomarker for prognosis, diagnosis, or tumor burden monitoring along with CA-125.</p><fig id="pone.0156595.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0156595.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Surface expression of transmembrane CD44v8-10 protein or soluble cleaved CD44v8-10 extracellular fragments have distinct prognostic significances in ovarian cancer.</title><p>High expression of the cell surface transmembrane CD44 containing variant exons v8-10 is associated with improved survival, which may be indicative of a more epithelial tumor.
