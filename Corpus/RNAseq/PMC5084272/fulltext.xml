In animal cells, the kinesin-5 Eg5 primarily drives this reorganization by actively sliding MTs apart. Its primacy during spindle assembly renders Eg5 essential for mitotic progression, demonstrated by the lethal effects of kinesin-5/Eg5 inhibitors (K5Is) administered in cell culture. However, cultured cells can acquire resistance to K5Is, indicative of alternative spindle assembly mechanisms and/or pharmacological failure. Through characterization of novel K5I-resistant cell lines, we unveil an Eg5 motility-independent spindle assembly pathway that involves both an Eg5 rigor mutant and the kinesin-12 Kif15. This pathway centers on spindle MT bundling instead of Kif15 overexpression, distinguishing it from those previously described. We further show that large populations (&#x0223c;10<sup>7</sup> cells) of HeLa cells require Kif15 to survive K5I treatment. Overall, this study provides insight into the functional plasticity of mitotic kinesins during spindle assembly and has important implications for the development of antimitotic regimens that target this process.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="sp1"><funding-source>National Institutes of Health<named-content content-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">R01GM086610</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s01"><title>Introduction</title><p>During mitosis, microtubules (MTs) organize into a bipolar array termed the spindle that segregates the duplicated genome. Spindle bipolarity is essential for accurate chromosome segregation and is established by separating the duplicated centrosomes in animal cells. Given the importance of spindle bipolarity, the cell deploys a cohort of MT-associated factors to drive centrosome separation. Kinesin-5/Eg5 is the dominant player in mammalian somatic cells (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Sawin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Blangy et al., 1995</xref>), being optimally tuned for this specific function in the following ways. First, Eg5 organizes into homotetramers with a pair of motor heads on opposing ends of the molecule (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kashina et al., 1996</xref>). This enables single molecules to simultaneously engage adjacent MTs (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>). Second, its catalytic cycle is limited by ATP hydrolysis rather than product release, biasing Eg5 to remain attached to MTs (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Krzysiak and Gilbert, 2006</xref>). With these unique mechanochemical properties, Eg5 harnesses its ATPase activity to slide antiparallel MTs apart, thereby generating centrosome separation forces important for bipolarizing the nascent spindle.</p><p>Eg5 also contains unique structural features that dispose the motor to small-molecule inhibitors (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Brier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Maliga and Mitchison, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lad et al., 2008</xref>). We and others have capitalized on Eg5 inhibitors (K5Is) to reveal auxiliary spindle assembly pathways that emerge after chronic exposure K5Is (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Raaijmakers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Sturgill and Ohi, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). This approach has improved our understanding of spindle physiology and adaptability, revealing that cytoplasmic dynein and the kinesin-12 Kif15 can drive centrosome separation in K5I-resistant cells (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Raaijmakers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Sturgill and Ohi, 2013</xref>). Additional studies have shown that Eg5 can become refractory to pharmacological inhibition through the acquisition of mutations that abrogate motor&#x02013;small molecule interactions (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kasap et al., 2014</xref>). Despite this progress, it remains to be tested whether such diverse means of K5I resistance share a commonality that could serve as a focal point for therapeutic intervention.</p><p>Here, we identify Kif15 as a molecular linchpin of K5I resistance in HeLa cells. We first describe a novel spindle assembly pathway that involves a spontaneous Eg5 rigor mutant and Kif15. We propose that the Eg5 rigor mutant, which tightly binds MTs regardless of its nucleotide state and/or pharmacological inhibitors, activates Kif15-driven spindle assembly by creating MT bundles, the preferred substrate of Kif15 (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Sturgill et al., 2014</xref>). Kif15 is not overexpressed in this scenario, contrasting a better-characterized K5I rescue pathway that requires elevated Kif15 levels (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Tanenbaum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Vanneste et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Sturgill and Ohi, 2013</xref>). Given that Kif15 plays a prominent role in the small handful of K5I-resistant cells (KIRCs) characterized thus far, we next test the prevalence of Kif15 in the acquisition of K5I resistance. Using a HeLa cell line largely devoid of Kif15, we find that adaptation to K5Is requires Kif15 under all tested conditions. We conclude that Kif15 is essential for K5I resistance in HeLa cells, even in cases that necessitate additional factors such as the Eg5 rigor mutant discovered here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s02"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>KIRC-2 and -3 express a spontaneous Eg5 rigor mutant, Eg5-G268V</title><p>We generated K5I-resistant cell lines by treating HeLa cells with a saturating dose of S-trityl-<sc>l</sc>-cysteine (STLC; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">DeBonis et al., 2004</xref>) and isolating emergent colonies. We assigned the acronym KIRC (K5I-resistant cell) to these cell lines in place of EIC (Eg5-independent cell; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Sturgill and Ohi, 2013</xref>), because not all adaptation mechanisms may obviate a requirement for Eg5.

G268 is a highly conserved residue among members of the kinesin superfamily, and mutations to the analogous residues within conventional kinesin (G234) and Kip1p (G297) trap the motor heads in a strong MT-binding state (i.e., &#x0201c;rigor&#x0201d;), regardless of the nucleotide cofactor (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rice et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chua et al., 2007</xref>). To test whether a G268V substitution similarly affects Eg5, we examined the catalytic and MT-binding properties of recombinant Eg5-WT and Eg5-G268V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>) in vitro.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Table Small?><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title><italic>EG5</italic> expression profile</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col width="54%" span="1"/><col width="23%" span="1"/><col width="23%" span="1"/><thead><tr><th align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Transcript profile</bold></th><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>KIRC-2</bold></th><th align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>KIRC-3</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">G803T allele frequency</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.71%</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.03%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In conventional MT gliding assays, Eg5-WT moved MTs in an ATP-dependent manner at an expected velocity of 1.1 &#x000b1; 0.3 &#x000b5;m/min (mean &#x000b1; SD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201507036/DC1" id="supp3">Video 1</ext-link>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kwok et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, Eg5-G268V failed to power MT gliding, despite its ability to capture MTs from solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201507036/DC1" id="supp4">Video 2</ext-link>). This result can potentially be explained by an inability of Eg5-G268V to release MTs, even in the presence of ATP. To more rigorously test this idea, we performed MT copelleting assays with Eg5-WT and Eg5-G268V in ATP-containing buffers. Indeed, Eg5-G268V was enriched in the MT pellet compared with Eg5-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). FCPT, an ATP-competitive K5I that induces tight binding of Eg5 onto MTs (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Groen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Rickert et al., 2008</xref>), shifted all detectable Eg5-WT into the MT pellet yet did not alter the fractionation of Eg5-G268V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p><p>Coupled with published literature (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rice et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chua et al., 2007</xref>), our results demonstrate that Eg5-G268V maintains a high affinity for MTs irrespective of its nucleotide state. This rigor mutation could underlie the ability of Eg5 to bind spindles in KIRC-2 and -3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). To test the ability of STLC to displace rigor Eg5 from spindle MTs, we treated KIRC-1 cells with FCPT to induce tight MT binding of WT Eg5 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) in STLC-treated cells. Although Eg5 was absent from spindles in DMSO-treated KIRC-1 cells, it localized to spindles in FCPT-treated KIRC-1 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201507036/DC1" id="supp5">Fig. S1</ext-link>). This demonstrates that a rigor motor state of Eg5 is dominant to pharmacological inhibition by STLC. Because FCPT and STLC block Eg5 activity through different mechanisms (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">DeBonis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Rickert et al., 2008</xref>), this result cannot be explained by simple competition of the two K5Is for a single drug-binding site. We conclude that Eg5 tetramers in KIRC-2 and -3 containing at least one copy of the rigor mutant Eg5-G268V will stably bind spindle MTs despite the presence of STLC.</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>Eg5-G268V robustly bundles MTs and is essential for spindle assembly in KIRC-2 and -3</title><p>Heterotetramers containing at least two copies of Eg5-G268V would be expected to function as static MT cross-linkers instead of motile MT sliders.

To test the MT bundling effects of endogenous Eg5-G268V, we monitored spindle MT architecture in KIRC-2 and -3 cells. Subtle changes in spindle MT bundling are difficult to detect, so we focused on the non&#x02013;kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule (non&#x02013;K-MT) population to increase our ability to detect enhanced MT bundling. We depleted the outer kinetochore component Nuf2 by RNAi to prevent K-MT formation, yielding spindles with reduced end-on K-MT attachments and scattered chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">DeLuca et al., 2002</xref>).

As expected, Eg5 depletion increased the parental HeLa line MI from 6.3 &#x000b1; 1.0 to 80.1 &#x000b1; 4.2 and MPI from 14.3 &#x000b1; 1.8 to 100.0 &#x000b1; 0.0 (mean &#x000b1; SEM, unless otherwise noted; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref> and Fig. S2, B and C). Meanwhile, Eg5 depletion negligibly affected KIRC-1, changing the MI from 6.3 &#x000b1; 1.1 to 8.2 &#x000b1; 1.4 and the MPI from 49.7 &#x000b1; 5.6 to 32.9 &#x000b1; 1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref> and Fig. S2, B and C). Strikingly, KIRC-2 and -3 responded to Eg5 RNAi similarly to the parental HeLa line. Eg5 RNAi increased the MI of KIRC-2 from 10.6 &#x000b1; 0.4 to 57.6 &#x000b1; 1.0 and KIRC-3 from 8.9 &#x000b1; 0.7 to 51.1 &#x000b1; 6.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2 D</xref> and S2 B). Furthermore, Eg5 RNAi increased the MPI of KIRC-2 from 52.3 &#x000b1; 8.4 to 96.3 &#x000b1; 1.8 and KIRC-3 from 50.0 &#x000b1; 3.8 to 96.3 &#x000b1; 0.3 (Fig. S2 C). Because Eg5 depletion, but not pharmacological inhibition, halted spindle assembly and mitotic progression in KIRC-2 and -3, we conclude that Eg5 remains essential in these cell lines independent of its catalytic activity. These results demonstrate that Eg5 remains essential for mitotic progression in some K5I-resistant cells and reveal a potentially novel role for Eg5 as a MT cross-linker during spindle assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s05"><title>Enhanced spindle MT bundling in KIRC-2 and -3 cells affects Kif15 partitioning</title><p>In principle, MT bundling by Eg5-G268V could affect spindle assembly by changing the distribution and activity of other spindle-associated factors.

To examine the oligomerization state of cellular Kif15, we expressed EGFP-labeled Kif15 (EGFP-Kif15) in HeLa cells and subjected the cellular extracts to single-molecule analysis (see Materials and methods). The initial single-molecule fluorescence intensity of EGFP-Kif15 averaged 16,316 &#x000b1; 398 arbitrary units (au; mean &#x000b1; the 95% confidence interval [COI]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3 D</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201507036/DC1" id="supp9">S3 A</ext-link>).

Of note, the cell cycle state of the extracts did not affect the initial fluorescence intensity distributions of EGFP-Kif15 (Fig. S3 B).

EGFP or EGFP-Kif15 were placed under control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter and integrated into the genomes of the HeLa and <italic>KIF15</italic>&#x00394; cell lines. Both the HeLa-EGFP and HeLa-EGFP-Kif15 cell lines expressed endogenous Kif15, whereas <italic>KIF15</italic>&#x00394;-EGFP and <italic>KIF15</italic>&#x00394;-EGFP-Kif15 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). By immunoblotting, we verified that EGFP-Kif15 was expressed in a doxycycline-inducible manner in both the HeLa and <italic>KIF15</italic>&#x00394; cell lines. EGFP-Kif15 protein levels resembled endogenous Kif15 levels 1 d after doxycycline induction and increased with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). To test the K5I-resistance capacity of these transgenic cell lines, we initiated STLC treatment 1 d after doxycycline induction. Strikingly, the HeLa-EGFP-Kif15 line did not regress in response to STLC and the <italic>KIF15</italic>&#x00394;-EGFP-Kif15 line initially regressed but rapidly rebounded from STLC treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Notably, the HeLa-EGFP-Kif15 cell line grew more vigorously than the <italic>KIF15</italic>&#x00394;-EGFP-Kif15 cell line in the presence of STLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). This proliferative advantage may be caused by the presence of endogenous Kif15, suggesting that the ability of cells to override the cytotoxic effects of K5Is is highly sensitive to the overall cellular concentration of Kif15 protein. As expected, neither EGFP-expressing transgenic cell line showed robust growth after 6 d of exposure to STLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Microscopic examination of HeLa-EGFP cultures did, however, reveal small cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>) that would likely mature to colonies resembling those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref> after 28 d. Such clusters were undetected in <italic>KIF15</italic>&#x00394;-EGFP cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). These data reinforce our conclusion that Kif15 plays a fundamental role in the acquisition of K5I resistance and motivate further experiments to study the timing and extent of <italic>KIF15</italic> expression in the rescue of K5I toxicity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s08"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although previous studies have emphasized overexpression as a means by which Kif15 can confer K5I resistance (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Tanenbaum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Vanneste et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Raaijmakers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Sturgill and Ohi, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2014</xref>), we demonstrate herein that elevated Kif15 levels are not the only means by which cells can develop Kif15-dependent K5I resistance. Instead, enhanced spindle MT bundling consistently accompanies Kif15-driven spindle assembly. Given that MT bundles serve as the substrate for Kif15 (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Sturgill et al., 2014</xref>), we propose that MT bundling factors can activate Kif15-driven spindle assembly by altering the bundling architecture of spindle MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Although the MT bundling factor studied here is an Eg5 rigor mutant, we envisage that any MT-associated factor with cross-linking activity can trigger Kif15-dependent spindle assembly.</p><fig id="fig7" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Small?><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Model.</bold> Kif15-dependent K5I resistance emerges through enhanced microtubule bundling.

See text for details.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_201507036_Fig7"/></fig><p>Despite the abundance of MT bundling factors within the cell, the emergence of KIRCs is relatively rare (&#x0223c;1 in 500,000 cells, or &#x0223c;0.0002%). One underlying reason may be that excessive MT bundling interferes with spindle function in somatic cells. This notion is indicated by the lethal consequences of rigor mutations within the kinesin-5 Kip1p of <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chua et al., 2007</xref>). This effect is particularly noteworthy as Kip1p is nonessential in <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chua et al., 2007</xref>), indicating that lethality emerges from the dominant, gain-of-function nature of the mutation. Furthermore, elevated levels of the MT bundling factors TPX2, NuSAP and HURP inhibit normal progression through mitosis in mammalian cells (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gruss et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Song and Rape, 2010</xref>). We were therefore surprised to find that KIRC-2 and -3 not only tolerate but also require the Eg5 rigor mutant for survival. Given that Eg5-G268V&#x02013;encoding mRNAs represent &#x0223c;1/3 of all <italic>EG5</italic> transcripts as determined by RNaseq, a logical prediction holds that the rigor mutant is present at low levels, perhaps just enough to induce non&#x02013;K-MT binding by Kif15. Indeed, overexpression of EGFP-Eg5-G268V in HeLa cells proved quite toxic (unpublished data). Secondarily, Eg5 tetramers likely contain low copy numbers of the rigor mutant, which may be better tolerated by the cell.</p><p>Our work shows that not all K5I-resistant cells are Eg5 independent. Here, the disconnect between K5I resistance and Eg5 dependency stems from the rigor mutant behaving as a static cross-link instead of a motile force generator. But other possibilities are certainly plausible, such as mutations to the drug-binding site (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Wacker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kasap et al., 2014</xref>). Because the nature of suppressor mutations are likely to impact disease management strategies, their identification will help in using antimitotic drugs to their maximal potential. Along these lines, this study uncovers a potentially novel spindle assembly function for Eg5. Going forward, it is imperative to determine whether Eg5 contributes to spindle assembly via non&#x02013;MT-sliding function&#x02014;e.g., by modulating MT dynamics (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Hancock, 2015</xref>) or acting as a mechanical brake (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Myers and Baas, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Saunders et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Rozelle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Shimamoto et al., 2015</xref>)&#x02014;to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the spindle assembly process.</p><p>Finally, this study is the first to identify a fundamental requirement for Kif15 in the emergence of K5I-resistant HeLa cells. We speculate that K5Is steer cells into an evolutionary bottleneck that requires Kif15 and that adaptive changes occur during passage through the bottleneck that enable populations to recover and diversify. Further studies are required to test the universality of our finding and identify other features required for life after adaptation to K5Is. Lastly, our findings point to the potential importance of Kif15 small-molecule inhibitors, which may significantly improve the cell death&#x02013;inducing activity of K5Is in the context of a tumor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s09"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s10"><title>Cell culture, transfections, and drug treatments</title><p>HeLa &#x0201c;Kyoto&#x0201d; (HeLa) cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS, penicillin, and streptomycin.

Flow cells were then washed with 50 &#x000b5;l P12 buffer supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml casein to remove nonadsorbed fluorescent proteins.

Unlike EGFP-HSET and XMAP215-EGFP, Kif15 was unable to nonspecifically bind silanized coverslips with sufficient affinity for intensity analysis. To increase the number of bound fluorescent particles, GMPCPP-stabilized MTs were adsorbed onto a coverslip via a biotin-streptavidin interaction, and EGFP-Kif15 was locked onto MTs by introducing EGFP-Kif15 (&#x0223c;1:100 diluted HeLa lysates or 200 pM purified protein) along with 1 mM AMPPNP in P12 buffer supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml casein.</p><p>To obtain first-frame intensity values, a 2D Gaussian fitting routine was implemented in ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/gdsc/intranet/microscopy/imagej/gdsc_plugins#install">http://www.sussex.ac.uk/gdsc/intranet/microscopy/imagej/gdsc_plugins#install</ext-link>), local maxima were detected automatically, and the reported Gaussian intensity values were corrected for local background.
