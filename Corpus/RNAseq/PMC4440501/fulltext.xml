The genetic basis of this fascinating phenomenon is poorly understood. Closely related species of <italic>Nasonia</italic> parasitic wasps differ in long-term memory (LTM) formation: <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> will form transcription-dependent LTM after a single conditioning trial, whereas the closely-related species <italic>N. giraulti</italic> will not. Genes that were differentially expressed (DE) after conditioning in <italic>N. vitripennis</italic>, but not in <italic>N. giraulti</italic>, were identified as candidate genes that may regulate LTM formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>RNA was collected from heads of both species before and immediately, 4 or 24&#x000a0;hours after conditioning, with 3 replicates per time point. It was sequenced strand-specifically, which allows distinguishing sense from antisense transcripts and improves the quality of expression analyses. We determined conditioning-induced DE compared to na&#x000ef;ve controls for both species. These expression patterns were then analysed with GO enrichment analyses for each species and time point, which demonstrated an enrichment of signalling-related genes immediately after conditioning in <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> only. Analyses of known LTM genes and genes with an opposing expression pattern between the two species revealed additional candidate genes for the difference in LTM formation. These include genes from various signalling cascades, including several members of the Ras and PI3 kinase signalling pathways, and glutamate receptors. Interestingly, several other known LTM genes were exclusively differentially expressed in <italic>N. giraulti</italic>, which may indicate an LTM-inhibitory mechanism. Among the DE transcripts were also antisense transcripts. Furthermore, antisense transcripts aligning to a number of known memory genes were detected, which may have a role in regulating these genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study is the first to describe and compare expression patterns of both protein-coding and antisense transcripts, at different time points after conditioning, of two closely related animal species that differ in LTM formation. Several candidate genes that may regulate differences in LTM have been identified. This transcriptome analysis is a valuable resource for future in-depth studies to elucidate the role of candidate genes and antisense transcription in natural variation in LTM formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-015-1355-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antisense</kwd><kwd>Illumina Hi-Seq</kwd><kwd>Learning</kwd><kwd>Long-term memory</kwd><kwd>Strand-specific sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>The ability to learn and form memory and the underlying cellular processes are evolutionary conserved, but there is substantial natural variation in memory dynamics between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The opportunity to acquire new skills or adapt behaviour through learning is an important benefit and can increase fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Memory formation can, however, be maladaptive when unreliable associations are formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, the process of memory formation is energetically costly, depending also on the type of memory that is formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, variation in memory dynamics is considered to be an adaptation to specific ecological constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Three main types of memory can be distinguished based on temporal expression and cellular pathways involved. Anaesthesia-sensitive memory (ASM), also known as short-term memory (STM), typically lasts from minutes up to an hour and is sensitive to disruptive treatments, such as a cold shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. During the ASM phase, the formation of more stable and durable types of memory starts, a process called memory consolidation, and this process can take hours to days to complete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Two main forms of consolidated memory are distinguished. Anaesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) typically lasts from hours to days and formation of this type of memory is thought to depend on changes in existing proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Long-term memory (LTM) can last from days up to the entire lifetime of an animal. LTM formation is dependent on both transcription and translation and it is, therefore, considered the most costly type of memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As a result, many animal species require multiple conditioning trials, which are spaced in time, to induce LTM consolidation. Such repeated learning experiences allow animals to evaluate the information before investing in costly LTM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A single conditioning trial or massed conditioning trials, i.e. multiple trials without or with a very short inter-trial interval, typically do not induce LTM formation, but result in the formation of ASM and ARM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, the number of trials required to form LTM differs, even between closely related species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A number of insect species are known to consolidate LTM after a single conditioning trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Ecological factors, including the value of the appetitive or aversive stimulus and the reliability of the learned association, are considered decisive for the number of trials required to form LTM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Very little is currently known about genetic and neural factors that are involved in natural variation in LTM formation.</p><p>We have studied the genetic basis of variation in LTM formation in the parasitic wasp <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> and its closely related species <italic>N. giraulti</italic>. The genus <italic>Nasonia</italic> has emerged as a powerful model with unique opportunities for genetic studies on inter-species differences, because of the possibility to interbreed both species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> forms ASM, ARM and LTM after a single conditioning trial in which an odour is associated with the appetitive stimulus of a host to parasitize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. LTM is expressed 4&#x000a0;days after conditioning, as demonstrated by inhibition through transcription- and translation-inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. <italic>Nasonia giraulti</italic>, on the other hand, forms ASM and ARM after a single conditioning trial and this memory disappears within 2&#x000a0;days. Multiple spaced conditioning trials are required to induce long-lasting memory retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This difference in LTM formation between these two species, which is thought to be the result of differences in their ecology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], provides excellent opportunities to study the genetic basis of LTM formation. A recent study, in which genes of <italic>N. giraulti</italic> where backcrossed into the genetic background of <italic>N. vitripennis</italic>, revealed two quantitative trait loci that underlie the difference in long-lasting memory retention between <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> and <italic>N. giraulti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This study investigates differences in gene expression patterns related to LTM formation between the two <italic>Nasonia</italic> species, as a second approach to identify genes that are involved in the difference in LTM formation.</p><p>Conditioning will induce differential gene expression in <italic>Nasonia</italic> wasps, compared to the expression levels of unconditioned (i.e. na&#x000ef;ve) wasps, as a result of learning, but also as a result of contact with the host and oviposition behaviour. Controls are necessary to distinguish learning from host- or odour induced gene expression. Comparing <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> that has been conditioned (host&#x02009;+&#x02009;odour) to <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> that has only had contact with the host is not a suitable comparison, as these wasps are known to learn multiple cues of the host environment upon host contact, including visual cues and information on the absence of odours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Consequently, this comparison may not reveal differences in learning-induced gene expression. Exposure to the odour alone is also not a suitable control, as it could induce habituation, a non-associative form of learning, which may not occur when wasps experience both host and odour. For this reason, we determined conditioning-induced differential expression patterns, which reflects learning, but also contact to the host or odour, of the both <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> and <italic>N. giraulti</italic>. These wasps were subjected to an identical conditioning procedure, which provides a control for host or odour induced differential expression, as well as for gene expression related to ASM or ARM, which occurs in both species. By focussing only on conditioning-induced differentially expressed genes that are unique to <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> we identify the genes that are most likely to be involved in the difference in LTM between the two species.</p><p>The gene expression profiles of <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> and <italic>N. giraulti</italic> were analysed using Illumina HiSeq sequencing of RNA extracted from the heads of na&#x000ef;ve and conditioned wasps. A strand-specific RNA-sequencing protocol was used to distinguish sense and antisense transcripts. Sequencing RNA strand-specifically is important considering that genes can be encoded on different strands of the DNA and a considerable part of these genes is known to overlap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Strand-specific information, therefore, will improve the accuracy of the gene expression analysis. Also, antisense transcripts are known to have an important role in memory dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This is, to our knowledge, the first study of strand-specifically sequenced transcriptomes of insect brains.</p><p>RNA was isolated from na&#x000ef;ve wasps, which were not conditioned, and from conditioned wasps at three time points after conditioning, i.e. immediately, 4&#x000a0;hours or 24&#x000a0;hours afterward (3 replicates per time point), in order to observe temporal patterns in gene expression during LTM formation. LTM formation is known to depend on at least two waves of transcriptional activity that occur during or shortly after conditioning, and several hours after conditioning respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The three time points shortly after conditioning were chosen as this study aims to identify genes that are involved in the early and intermediate phases of LTM formation, which are expected to be decisive for LTM formation. Conditioning-induced gene expression was determined by comparing expression levels of conditioned wasps to the na&#x000ef;ve wasps for both species separately, to control for na&#x000ef;ve differences in gene expression between the two species. Differentially expressed genes after conditioning were subsequently analysed by (1) a GO enrichment analysis, to assess functional expression patterns, (2) analyses of known (long-term) memory genes, and (3) identification of genes with an opposing differential expression pattern in <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> and <italic>N. giraulti</italic>. Based on the combination of these analyses we describe temporal patterns of gene expression after conditioning for both species, as well as differences in conditioning-induced gene expression between the two species. Differentially expressed genes, especially genes with a known role in memory formation, that are unique to <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> or that have an opposed expression to <italic>N. giraulti</italic> (i.e. that are upregulated in one species and downregulated in the other species, or vice versa) were identified as promising candidate genes for regulating the difference in LTM formation between the two species. Considering that LTM formation is evolutionary conserved, the findings of the study may be applicable to other animal species as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Transcriptome assembly and annotation</title><p>The results of the <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly (both filtered and unfiltered) are presented in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1.

These analyses also demonstrate distinct temporal patterns in the molecular functions of differentially expressed transcripts at the three time points after conditioning. For both wasp species, the enriched GO terms observed immediately after conditioning (mostly signalling processes in <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> and cell regulatory processes in <italic>N. giraulti</italic>), had very little overlap with those at 4 or 24&#x000a0;hours after conditioning. Also, the most pronounced differences between the two species were observed immediately after conditioning, a procedure that lasts in total 1.5&#x000a0;hour in our experiment. This result suggests that this early differential gene expression may be decisive for whether LTM formation is initiated after a single conditioning trial or not, as also indicated by previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, several differences between the species are also observed at later time points, which were expected as LTM formation takes 4&#x000a0;days to complete in <italic>Nasonia</italic>.

Both up- and downregulation of genes with a known role in (long-term) memory formation was observed in <italic>N. vitripennis</italic>, which may point to activation of positive regulatory mechanisms, as well as deactivation of LTM inhibitory mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Interesting observations include the pronounced differential expression of genes that are part of the Ras and Rho signalling cascades, which was observed immediately after conditioning in <italic>N. vitripennis</italic>, but much less in <italic>N. giraulti</italic>. A couple of glutamate receptors were differentially expression in <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> only, whereas others were differentially expressed in <italic>N. giraulti</italic> only. Finally, an opposite expression pattern was observed for three genes involved in PI3 kinase signalling between <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> and <italic>N. giraulti</italic>. Although our study is the first to compare gene expression patterns after conditioning between animals that differ in memory performance, two other studies have made such a comparison between na&#x000ef;ve animals. Pravosudov <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] report on two populations of chickadees that differ in spatial memory performance and Armbrecht <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] compared control mice and mice with impaired memory performance. These studies reported differences in gene expression in various genes, including genes in the Ras signalling pathway and glutamate receptors in the chickadees, and genes in the Ras and PI3K signalling pathways in mice. This may indicate that these genes have an evolutionary conserved role in regulating natural variation in (long-term) memory performance and makes these genes promising candidates for further studies.</p><p>Some of the differentially expressed genes that were observed only in <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> may not be involved in LTM formation, but rather in ARM formation. In <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> two types of ARM are distinguished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A short lasting type is observed from an hour up to at least a day after conditioning and this type is likely also formed in <italic>N. giraulti</italic>.

A recent proteome analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> brains after odour-electric shock conditioning indicates substantial changes in protein expression, regardless of whether ARM or LTM was formed, whereas relatively few differences in protein expression were observed in flies that formed LTM, compared to ones that formed ARM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Compared to this study, our substantial differences between the two species are surprising and it is possible that some of the observed differences in conditioning-induced differential gene expression rather reflect species-specific differences in the response to the host than the difference in LTM formation.</p><p>Although we have described several differences, there are also hundreds of differentially expressed genes that are observed in both species. In addition, GO enrichment analyses indicate pronounced changes in translation and metabolism after conditioning, especially after 4 and 24&#x000a0;hours, in both species. This overlap may be the result of gene expression involved in ASM or ARM formation, memory types that do not depend on transcription during or shortly after conditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but which may induce differential gene expression afterwards. The proteome analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> brains, mentioned above, indicates substantial changes in protein expression related to metabolism, regardless of whether ARM or LTM was formed, which seems to suggest a role for metabolism-related pathways in memory formation in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>Part of the overlapping conditioning-induced differential gene expression may also be related to contact with the host, which was similar in both <italic>Nasonia</italic> species. During conditioning, the wasps will touch, evaluate and typically also feed from the host haemolymph, which induces the formation of eggs that are required for future oviposition. A recent study in <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> females indicated downregulation of various metabolic processes in ovipositing females compared to resting females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The observed changes in metabolic pathways, which were observed in both <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> and <italic>N. giraulti</italic> in this study, may therefore also be related to oviposition behaviour.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Alternative splicing</title><p>Alternative splicing was detected in large numbers of multi-exon genes and is known to be important for protein function, especially in neuronal genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

Different splice variants of fragile X mental retardation protein (<italic>FMRP</italic>) in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are thought to be involved in ASM and LTM, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Information on splice variants is, therefore, crucial for understanding gene functioning, but reliable and accurate determination of splice variants is challenging due to the small length of HiSeq reads that were analysed in this study.

However, for most DE genes with multiple splice variants, only a single splice variant was differentially expressed.

It also provided, for the first time, the opportunity to study conditioning-induced expression patterns of antisense transcripts. We focused on antisense RNA, although other lncRNAs (&#x0003e;200&#x000a0;bp in length), that aligned to genomic DNA, were also distinguished.

A total of 5.0% (1525) and 2.4% (719) of all transcripts were classified as antisense transcripts in <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> and <italic>N. giraulti</italic>, respectively. The actual number of antisense transcripts may be higher, because only transcripts with a high percentage of alignment length and identity were classified as antisense transcripts and others were classified as lncRNA or unknown transcripts. An interesting observation is that 47.9% (730) and 21.4% (154) of these <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> and <italic>N. giraulti</italic> antisense transcripts, respectively, only aligned to a known protein, but not to a sense transcript, which suggests that these genes had been silenced. GO enrichment analyses of antisense transcripts revealed an overrepresentation of genes involved in behaviour and signalling, which hints towards a role in the regulation of memory formation related genes and antisense transcripts were observed for 14 out of 78 known memory genes that were studied. In addition, differential expression of antisense transcripts after conditioning had been observed. Although the significance of these observations remains to be investigated, they hint towards a role of antisense transcripts in the regulation of long-term memory formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our transcriptome analysis is the first to provide an extensive overview of conditioning-induced differential expression patterns of both protein-coding and antisense transcripts, in the heads of two <italic>Nasonia</italic> parasitic wasp species, which differ in the formation of LTM. Although we identified the most promising candidate genes for this difference in LTM by focussing on genes with a different conditioning-induced expression pattern between the two <italic>Nasonia</italic> species, further functional studies are required to confirm that these genes indeed have a role in variation in LTM formation. RNAi can be used to manipulate gene expression levels and investigate if and how candidate genes are involved in memory formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Our study is a valuable resource for such future studies on the genetic basis of variation in (long-term) memory. Considering that learning and memory formation are evolutionary conserved, our results may be applicable to other species and may provide novel insights for studies on neurodegenerative diseases in humans, in which known memory genes are involved as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec23"><title>Insects</title><p><italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> (strain AsymCx) and <italic>N. giraulti</italic> (strain RV2x(U)) were used in the experiments. These strains are completely homozygous and have a sequenced genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Wasps were reared on <italic>Calliphora vomitoria</italic> pupae as described by Hoedjes <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Female wasps were collected on the day of emergence, were provided honey and water in a polystyrene rearing vial, and were kept in a climate cabinet at 25&#x000b0;C and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L/D). This study involved non-regulated (invertebrate) species and, therefore, was exempt from ethical approval.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conditioning procedure</title><p>Female wasps were conditioned using a Pavlovian conditioning assay in which an odour (chocolate) is associated with the appetitive stimulus of a host (<italic>C. vomitoria</italic> pupa) as described by Hoedjes <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Briefly, wasps were individually given two host pupae (appetitive unconditioned stimulus, US) in a well of a 12 well-microtiter plate in the presence of chocolate odour (the conditioned stimulus, CS+). Wasps were allowed to drill into the pupae and perform host feeding for 1&#x000a0;hour. Oviposition does not take place during this period. Wasps that did not initiate drilling within 30&#x000a0;minutes (~5-10%) were removed from the experiment. After the 1-hour period, the wasps were gently removed from the hosts and transferred to a clean rearing vial. After a 15-minute resting period, wasps were exposed to vanilla odour (CS) for another 15&#x000a0;minutes without an appetitive or aversive stimulus present, which enhances memory performance. After this conditioning trial, the wasps were transferred to a rearing vial with access to honey and water, and were kept in a climate cabinet as described above. Na&#x000ef;ve wasps, from the same age and batch as the conditioned wasps, were collected and transferred to rearing vials directly, without exposing them to either hosts or odour. These wasps served as a control to which the gene expression levels of the conditioned wasps were compared (i.e. to determine conditioning-induced differential gene expression). Both <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> and <italic>N. giraulti</italic> were conditioned using this protocol. Three groups of 30 wasps were (individually) conditioned per species at the same time. This was repeated 3 times on different days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Sample preparation and RNAseq</title><p>Groups of 30 wasps were collected for RNA isolation (1) immediately after conditioning, (2) 4&#x000a0;hours after conditioning or (3) 24&#x000a0;hours after conditioning and (4) without conditioning (na&#x000ef;ve controls). The na&#x000ef;ve controls were collected for RNA isolation immediately after the other wasps had been conditioned. We did not collect unconditioned wasps at the other time points after conditioning, as age-related differences in gene expression in the 24&#x000a0;hours after conditioning were expected to be small, compared to conditioning-induced differential gene expression. Furthermore, the subsequent analyses, which compared the two <italic>Nasonia</italic> species, provide a control for potential differences in age-related gene expression among time points.</p><p>Wasps were frozen in liquid nitrogen; heads were cut off with a scalpel and collected in a 1.5&#x000a0;ml microcentrifuge tube, which was stored in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted from the heads using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Antwerp, Belgium) according to instructions of the manufacturer. A total of 3 biological replicates were collected for each of the three treatments and unconditioned controls, resulting in 12 samples per <italic>Nasonia</italic> species. RNA quantity and integrity was measured using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Amstelveen, The Netherlands). The RNA concentration ranged from 270 &#x02013; 650&#x000a0;ng/&#x003bc;l and the RNA integrity number (RIN) was between 9.7 and 10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>One microgram total RNA was used for mRNA isolation and subsequent RNAseq library preparation following the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Protocol (Illumina). In short, mRNA was isolated using oligo dT beads and chemically fragmented prior to first strand cDNA synthesis using random hexamer primers. Strand specificity was achieved by replacing dTTP with dUTP during Second Strand synthesis and the addition of transcription inhibitor Actinomycin D to the First Strand Master Mix. Obtained cDNA fragments were used for 3&#x02019;adenylation and adapter ligation using 24 different barcoded adapters, one for each library. Adapter-ligated cDNA was amplified using 15 PCR cycles. Quality control of libraries was done using Agilent Bioanalyzer2100 DNA 1000 assays. Quantification was performed using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) and a fluorescence plate reader system (Tecan XFluor). Equimolar amounts of all 24 libraries were pooled together and were applied on two lanes together with Illumina V3 reagents. Paired-end 100&#x000a0;bp sequencing was performed on a HiSeq2000 instrument. De-multiplexing of obtained sequences was done using CASAVA 1.8.1. software.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Transcriptome assembly</title><p>All reads were quality filtered and adapter trimmed using cutadapt (version 0.9.5), options: &#x02212;O 10, &#x02212;n 3, &#x02212;q 10. Data were then filtered using fastq-mcf, options: &#x02212;k 5, &#x02212;q 20, &#x02212;l 50.</p><p>The reads of all <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> samples were pooled to assemble the transcriptome <italic>de novo</italic> using Trinity (version r2013-02-15, option: &#x02212;-SS_lib_type RF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The same was done for <italic>N. giraulti</italic>. The assembled transcripts have names that consist of three parts, for example comp100_c0_seq1, of which the first two parts define the &#x0201c;gene&#x0201d; name. All transcripts from one &#x0201c;gene&#x0201d; were considered to be alternative splice variants of that gene, for example comp100_c0_seq1 and comp100_c0_seq2. Transcripts smaller than 200&#x000a0;bp and those that had little read support were removed from the transcriptome. The latter was done by first mapping the unfiltered reads of each sample individually back to the transcriptome using bowtie (version 0.12.7, options: &#x02212;n 2, &#x02212;e 99999999, &#x02212;l 25, &#x02212;3 0, &#x02212;a, &#x02212;m 200, &#x02212;I 1, &#x02212;X 1000, &#x02212;-nofw) and quantifying the mapped reads using eXpress (version 1.3.1). Then, the rounded effective read counts per transcript were analysed using R (version 2.15.2) and only transcripts with more than one read count per million (cpm) for at least 3 samples were kept.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Annotation</title><p>Transcripts were annotated by aligning them to the <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> proteome (Nvit 2.0) or NCBI RefSeq nr database (sept-01-2013) using blastx (options: &#x02212;max_target_seqs 1, &#x02212;word_size 11, e-value 10), which is integrated in the Blast facility of the Centre for BioSystems Genomics (CBSG) and Wageningen University (created by Applied Bioinformatics, Plant Research International). Because the mRNA was sequenced strand specifically, the sense or antisense orientation of the aligned transcripts could be deduced.</p><p>The transcripts were first aligned to the <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> proteome. Transcripts that aligned to a protein with less than 60% protein alignment length were aligned to the NCBI RefSeq nr database. Protein-coding transcripts were defined as sense transcripts if they had more than 60% protein alignment length to a <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> protein or NCBI RefSeq nr database protein. The transcripts that did not align to a protein with more than 60% protein alignment length could be of different origin: (1) sense RNA encoding proteins not present in the published proteome databases, (2) sense RNA encoding proteins smaller than 60% of the complete protein, for example unknown small splice variants, (3) antisense RNA, (4) lncRNA, or (5) misassembled transcripts. Point (2) was addressed by also defining all transcript variants of a protein-coding (sense) transcript as sense transcripts, even if they were smaller than 60% if the complete protein. We defined antisense transcripts (3) as transcripts with an antisense orientation to a protein with more than 50% protein alignment length, or with an antisense orientation to a sense transcript with more than 80% antisense transcript alignment length and 95% sequence identity. Antisense transcripts that do not align to a protein, but only to a sense transcript likely have a hit to an untranslated region of that gene. Transcripts that were not categorized as sense or antisense transcripts but aligned to the <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> genome or NCBI RefSeq nt database with more than 80% alignment length and 95% sequence identity are suggested to be lncRNA (4). Transcripts without sense, antisense or long non-coding label were defined as &#x02018;unknown&#x02019; (5) and may include misassembled transcripts, but also (anti)sense transcripts or lncRNA with insufficient alignment length or identity to known sequences. Putative open reading frames (ORFs) were determined for long non-coding and unknown transcripts using the script &#x02018;transcripts_to_best_scoring_ORFs.pl&#x02019; from Trinity (options -m 30 -S). Putative ORFs were defined as an ORF with a 5&#x02019;start and 3&#x02019;end and minimally 30 amino acids.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Differential expression analysis</title><p>Conditioning-induced differentially expressed (DE) transcripts in the <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> and <italic>N. giraulti</italic> transcriptomes, compared to na&#x000ef;ve expression levels, were identified using EdgeR (version 3.0.8). This analysis includes normalization for differences in length between genes. The rounded effective read counts of each sample, extracted from eXpress, were analysed using a GLM trended dispersion with Pearson correlation with eight degrees of freedom and <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, and also taking the replica effect into account. A Benjamini and Hochberg&#x02019;s approach was applied for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). To assess inherent differences in gene expression between the two species, the differential gene expression of na&#x000ef;ve <italic>N. giraulti</italic> compared to na&#x000ef;ve <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> expression was identified as well (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p><p>Three complementary analyses were used to analyse the conditioning-induced differential gene expression patterns of <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> and <italic>N. giraulti</italic>. (1) Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were performed on the DE transcripts that aligned to the <italic>N. vitripennis</italic> proteome (Nvit 2.0) using the Blast2go GUI and a Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, in order to visualize expression patterns of functional clusters of genes. GO terms were linked to the Nvit 2.0 proteome using Blast2GO as described on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Generic GOSlim categories were used to limit the number of GO term categories (Gene Ontology Consortium, jan-10-2014).

(2) The gene expression patterns of 78 genes that are known from literature to be involved in (long-term) memory formation were analysed for both species (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4).
