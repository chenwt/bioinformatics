    "Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing from next generation sequencing (NGS) data has the potential for widespread applications. Here we introduce a novel tool (HLAreporter) for HLA typing from NGS data based on read-mapping using a comprehensive reference panel containing all known HLA alleles, followed by de novo assembly of the gene-specific short reads. Accurate HLA typing at high-digit resolution was achieved when it was tested on publicly available NGS data, outperforming other newly developed tools such as HLAminer and PHLAT. HLAreporter can be downloaded from http://paed.hku.hk/genome/."
