Stochastic, reversible switches in expression of the methyltransferase produces variation in methylation of specific sequences. Phase-variable methylation by both Type I and Type III methyltransferases is associated with altered gene expression and phenotypic variation. One phase-variable gene of <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> encodes a homologue of an unusual Type IIG restriction-modification system in which the endonuclease and methyltransferase are encoded by a single gene. Using both inhibition of restriction and PacBio-derived methylome analyses of mutants and phase-variants, the <italic>cj0031c</italic> allele in <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strain NCTC11168 was demonstrated to specifically methylate adenine in 5&#x02032;CCCGA and 5&#x02032;CCTGA sequences. Alterations in the levels of specific transcripts were detected using RNA-Seq in phase-variants and mutants of <italic>cj0031c</italic> but these changes did not correlate with observed differences in phenotypic behaviour. Alterations in restriction of phage growth were also associated with phase variation (PV) of <italic>cj0031c</italic> and correlated with presence of sites in the genomes of these phages. We conclude that PV of a Type IIG restriction-modification system causes changes in site-specific methylation patterns and gene expression patterns that may indirectly change adaptive traits.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>02 June 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p><italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> is a major cause of food-borne gastroenteritis in humans with more than 400 million cases of Campylobacteriosis reported annually worldwide (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Currently, the disease burden exerted by <italic>Campylobacters</italic> in the UK is higher than for any other foodborne pathogen (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) with chickens being the main source of infection in over 80% of disease cases (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). <italic>Campylobacters</italic> are present in a very high fraction of farmed chickens with significant numbers of bacteria in each colonized bird (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Rapid micro-evolution may be a major mechanism that facilitates persistent colonization of and rapid transmission between individual birds. One of the characteristic mechanisms for enabling rapid adaptation is phase variation (PV) mediated by hypermutable simple sequence repeats (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Most of phase-variable genes of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> encode surface proteins or enzymes that modify host surface structures (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However one of these phase-variable genes encodes a restriction modification (RM) system that has the potential to act as a stochastically-regulated modifier of expression of other genes or mediate alternation between phage susceptible and resistant states (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>PV is an adaptive process characterized by high frequency, reversible ON/OFF switching of gene expression that is stochastic in nature and gives rise to heterogeneous population (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The main mechanism of PV in <italic>C. jejuni</italic> involves insertion or deletion of repeat units during genome replication in polyG or polyC repeat tracts located in the reading frames of genes. In a recent survey, each <italic>C. jejuni</italic> genome was found to contain between 12 and 29 polyG/polyC tracts capable of mediating PV (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Most of these phase-variable loci encode enzymes that modify the glycan components of the flagella, capsule and lipooligosaccharide. One of the tracts was present in a putative Type IIG restriction-modification system. This is a general paradigm with phase-variable Type I and III RM systems being found in other host adapted bacterial pathogens including <italic>Helicobacter pylori, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>The three major classes of RM systems (i.e. I, II and III) are distinguished by the composition and nature of the recognition sequences, position of cleavage, requirements for co-factors and subunit composition (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A Type IIG RM system is a subclass of the Type II RM systems in the majority of which the endonuclease (ENase) and methyltransferase (MTase) activities are fused into a single polypeptide chain rather than being present as separate enzymes. These Type IIG enzymes methylate only one strand within either a symmetric or asymmetric recognition site while the endonuclease activity occurs 14&#x02013;21 bp away from the recognition site in a 3&#x02032; direction (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This biochemical property of Type IIG RM systems is similar to that of Type IIS and Type III RM systems. Two of the most highly characterized prototypical Type IIG enzymes are BpuSI and Eco57I (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, REBASE (rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) predicts the existence of 6400+ putative Type IIG RM enzymes with 100+ recognition sites and a presence in a vast range of bacterial species.</p><p>RM systems are regarded as defensive weapons of pathogenic bacteria preventing infection by phages or invasion by foreign DNA (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). A putative role in epigenetic gene regulation through methylation-dependent control of the interactions of DNA binding regulatory proteins with their cognate recognition sites was suggested by analogy with the Dam methylase, a known epigenetic regulator of bacterial virulence gene expression (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The role of RM-mediated epigenetic regulation was demonstrated by showing that ON/OFF PV of the <italic>H. influenzae modA</italic> gene was correlated with altered expression of several genes (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). This gene encodes the methyltransferase component of a Type III RM system whose PV-dependent co-regulated genes were termed the phasevarion. Subsequently, Type III RM systems in three other human pathogens, <italic>H</italic>.<italic>pylori, N. meningitidis</italic> and <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and a Type I system in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> were found to have phasevarion activities (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The alterations in expression of a &#x02018;regulon&#x02019; are predicted to be mediated through differential methylation of promoter elements or other regulatory sequences. Critically, phasevarions include genes mediating resistance to stress and virulence phenotypes leading to the suggestion that phase-variable RM systems may be a common mechanism for regulation of virulence and stress survival in a wide range of bacterial pathogens.</p><p>Most <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strains contain one Type I RM and four Type II systems, one of which is a Type IIG enzyme (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). This Type IIG RM system exhibits significant sequence variation between strains in the domain presumed to encode the target recognition domain (TRD). In agreement with this hypothesis, strains vary in the methylation site associated with this gene. In strain NTCT11168, the homologue of this Type IIG gene, <italic>cj0031</italic>, contains a polyG tract and undergoes PV both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This observation of major shifts in the bacterial population from the OFF to ON expression state of <italic>cj0031</italic>, during passage of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> in chickens, combined with similarities in the mechanism of methylation to the phasevarion-associated Type III RM systems, suggested that PV of <italic>cj0031</italic> may confer fitness advantages on the bacterial population, due to alterations in expression of multiple genes mediated by changes in global methylation. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the functions, methylome, global expression patterns and phenotypic variation of mutants and phase-variants of <italic>cj0031</italic> in <italic>C. jejuni strain</italic> NCTC11168.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>Two variants of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strain NCTC11168 were used in the present study: a motile but non-swarming variant (11168); and a chicken-adapted hypermotile variant (CH11168).

Examination of sequences generated from the RNA-Seq data confirmed that <italic>cj0031</italic> contained an ON number of repeats and that the mutant lacked the gene. Major differences in gene expression were observed with 89 and 130 genes exhibiting a statistically-significant reduction or increase, respectively, of &#x0003e;1.5-fold in the mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). A subset of 20 genes exhibited changes of &#x0003e;5-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>; with 14 having reduced and 6 increased expression). An qRT-PCR of nine genes confirmed the observed changes in relative gene expression levels (Supplementary Figure S2). Major changes in gene expression were observed in two tRNA genes and genes whose products contribute to metabolism (e.g. Uxa, altronate hydrolase; Cj0073-Cj0075, iron-sulphur cluster proteins) or transport (e.g. PutP, a sodium-proline symporter; HydA<italic>2</italic>, NI-Fe hyrdrogenase; Lct<italic>P</italic>, L-lactate permease).

The NCTC11168 genome contains 1776 of these sequences with an average of 1.1 sites per kbp and &#x0223c;1 site per gene. Only 69 sites are located in intergenic regions and these sites are associated with 38 genes. Significant &#x0003e;1.5-fold alterations in expression were only observed for three of these genes in &#x00394;<italic>cj0031</italic> (two upregulated and one downregulated). None of these genes had known roles in adhesion, invasion or biofilm formation. The loci that contained genes exhibiting large differences (&#x0003e;5-fold) in expression were examined for the presence of Cj0031 methylation sites. In some of these loci, 2&#x02013;4 5&#x02032;CCYGA sequences were present within the reading frames of multiple genes but in other loci most of the genes contained 0&#x02013;1 sequences (Supplementary Figure S3). As an alternative, loci with 4&#x02013;6 genic 5&#x02032;CCYGA sequences were examined for alterations in gene expression and multiple examples were observed with &#x0003c;1.5-fold changes in expression. There was however an association between the presence of multiple recognition sites and an increase in gene expression with 23% of genes containing four or more repeats (<italic>n</italic> = 83) exhibiting a significant increase in expression whereas only 7% and 10% of genes with 1&#x02013;3 (<italic>n</italic> = 1038) or 0 (706) sites, respectively, exhibited an increase in expression. However the average increase in expression for genes containing four or more sites was 2-fold with no genes showing a &#x0003e;3.5-fold increase in expression.

id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p><italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> contains several phase variable genes with known or potential roles in survival and adaptation of this species to various niches in hosts and the environment. While phase-variable genes usually encode surface structures, a provocative association with non-surface coding genes is widely reported and in particular a distinctive PV signal is found for RM systems of several pathogenic bacteria (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). PV of surface molecules is an adaptive strategy enabling escape of not only innate and adaptive host immune responses but also a dynamic and evolving phage population (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The phase-variable RM systems provide another strategy to escape selection by phages. A more surprising finding was of a phasevarion whereby PV of the methyltransferase of a phase-variable RM system coordinates the expression of multiple genes through changes in genome methylation (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). We define herein the recognition sites of a novel, phase-variable Type IIG RM system and investigated the contributions of this enzyme to a <italic>Campylobacter</italic> phasevarion and phage restriction.</p><p>Previous SMRT sequencing of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strain NCTC11168 detected methylation sites for four of the putative RM systems but not for Cj0031 as this gene was in an OFF state in the analysed variant of this strain (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). We isolated an ON variant and constructed both a deletion mutant and complementation strain to facilitate characterization of this RM system. By examining inhibition of methylation activity, we detected a HindIII site that exhibited a differential pattern of digestion between ON and OFF variants of <italic>cj0031</italic>. This suggested that the Cj0031 recognition site was either 5&#x02032;CCCGA with methylation on the adenine or an AT-rich sequence (e.g. 5&#x02032;AAGAA). SMRT sequencing identified the methylation site of this enzyme as either 5&#x02032;CCCGA or 5&#x02032;CCTGA as methylation of these sites was absent in a <italic>cj0031</italic> deletion mutant but present in an ON phase variant of this gene.</p><p>The phylogenetic analysis of <italic>cj0031</italic> showed that homologues of <italic>cj0031</italic> were present in <italic>H. pylori</italic>, a close relative to <italic>C. jejuni</italic>, as well as several other more diverse bacterial species. Homologues of <italic>cj0031</italic> were present in other strains of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> and have a 90&#x02013;99% sequence similarity with conservation of the motifs characteristic of restriction endonucleases. Despite this high overall level of conservation, one region (IV; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) of the protein exhibited high levels of variation between all alleles of Cj0031 for which methylomes have been determined. This region is predicted to encode the TRD as has been predicted for the hypervariable regions of other RM-associated methyltransferases. The methylation site of CfeFV, the homologue of <italic>cj0031</italic> in strain 81&#x02013;176, has been characterized by SMRT sequencing as 5&#x02032;GGRCA (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) whereas that of Cj0031 was 5&#x02032;CCYGA. The putative TRD regions of these homologues differ by 87&#x02013;91 amino acids in the 136&#x02013;140 residues of region IV suggesting that the amino acids responsible for site-specific DNA recognition are located therein. The IA3902 homologue, CjeIAORF32P, exhibits significant amino acid variation from Cj0031 in both regions III and IV (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and methylates at a 5&#x02032;GAAGAA sequence (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). A notable feature of these alignments is of the absence of the polyG tract in the other Cj0031 homologues suggesting that PV may be restricted to a sub-set of alleles.</p><p>Populations of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strain NCTC11168 will contain phase-variants of Cj0031 with either methylated (ON) or non-methylated (OFF) 5&#x02032;CCYGA sequences, raising the potential for association of a phasevarion with PV of Cj0031. A phasevarion is a set of genes whose expression is regulated by ON-OFF switching of site-specific methylation by a phase-variable methyltransferase. The observation of reductions in adhesion, invasion and biofilm formation in <italic>cj0031</italic> deletion mutants was indicative of association of Cj0031 PV with a phasevarion. These alterations in host cell attachment were not due to differences in motility (Supplementary Figure S1) but were in general minor differences in phenotype. The degree of these effects could have been reduced by PV of the ON variants so that starting populations contained variable proportions of OFF variants. An alternative explanation of differences in phenotype is the impact of PV of other genes. The potential importance of this caveat was reduced by the observation of similar phenotypes for the ON variant of the wild-type and complementation mutant and similarly for the OFF variant and deletion mutant. Furthermore, no influence on biofilm formation of PV of <italic>cj0031</italic> during the experiment or of differences in expression of other phase-variable genes between strains was observed in additional repetitions of the biofilm assay. Inactivation of another putative methyltransferase, Cj1461, reduced both the motility and invasion by <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strain 81&#x02013;176 (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Similarly, Fields and Thompson (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) reported that inactivation of CsrA, a global post-transcriptional regulator, reduced motility, biofilim formation and adherence of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strain 81&#x02013;176 but enhanced invasion leading to the proposal that CsrA directly or indirectly represses invasion specific genes. The RNASeq analysis of &#x00394;<italic>cj0031</italic> detected an altered level of expression for Peb1A (<italic>cj0921c</italic>, &#x02212;2.8-fold) but not for any other known adhesins or invasins. Peb1A is a periplasmic protein that mediates uptake of dicarboxylic amino acids&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). A variable association of this gene with reductions in adhesion has been reported (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Thus, the Cj0031 methyltransferase might act as a phasevarion with alterations in expression of Peb1A resulting in reductions in host cell adhesion and invasion. Alternatively the alterations in metabolic pathways, also observed in the &#x00394;<italic>cj0031</italic> RNASeq data, could be responsible for the observed phenotypic variation. A final possibility is that observed differences in gene expression may have impacted on other types of phenotypic variation.</p><p>The proposed mechanism of regulation of a phasevarion is through differential methylation of promoter elements leading to alterations in binding of regulatory proteins and/or RNA polymerase to promoter elements in an analogous manner to Dam methylase-mediated regulation of bacterial gene expression (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). There was only weak evidence of a genome-wide association between presence of 5&#x02032;CCYGA sequences and alterations in transcription as detected in the RNASeq data. An alternate possibility is that variable methylation at only some of the 5&#x02032;CCYGA sites has any effect on transcription and that the differential regulation is through perturbation of one or more global regulators of gene expression. However, there were no significant alterations in expression of known two-component regulators (i.e. RacRS, DccRS, cbrRS and FlgRS), sigma factors (FliA and RpoN), CsrA or of Fur (a significant 2-fold change in <italic>flgR</italic> was observed but this was disregarded as there was no overall change in expression of the <italic>fla</italic> genes). Finally, the Peb1A gene contained a single 5&#x02032;CCYGA sequence within the reading frame, which is the number expected by chance for any gene of this genome. Thus, neither the overall nor specific distribution of Cj0031 methylation sites provides a clear insight into the mechanism for altering gene expression as implied by differences in phenotypic variation or as detected in the RNASeq data.</p><p>An alternate putative function of all RM systems is restriction of phage replication. Testing of a phage panel revealed that inactivation of <italic>cj0031</italic> resulted in a higher EOP for 12 phages. This loss of inhibition of phage replication provides evidence that Cj0031 is an active restriction endonuclease with the ability to restrict phage DNA. The efficiency of restriction by RM systems is, for some systems, directly proportional to the number of recognition sites located in the genome of the invading element (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) with low numbers of restriction sites for a specific RM system correlating with a greater probability to escape restriction. The high prevalence of sites for Cj0031 in two of the restricted phages, CP8 and CP30, supports the view that the restriction activity is correlated with the number of restriction sites. Intriguingly, the <italic>cj0031</italic> site has a higher prevalence (1.5- to 6-fold) in all phage genomes than that of the homologue present in strain PT14 (i.e. A911_00150; GAACAA). If the main function of Cj0031 is restriction of phage growth and the number of recognition sites is correlated with higher restriction of phage growth, then the Cj0031 and CfeFV alleles may be more widely distributed in <italic>Campylobacter</italic> genomes than the alleles with 6 bp recognition sites. Evolution of PV of Cj0031 could then be driven by selection for phage resistance in the ON state and selection for expression of one state of the phasevarion in the alternate state. Alternatively selection for the OFF state may be driven by receptiveness to adaptive mutations associated with natural transformation (assuming in-coming DNA can be restricted by Cj0031 endonuclease activity) or fluctuating levels of Cj0031-resistant methylated phage genomes as speculated elsewhere (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).</p><p>Our study provides evidence of a dual role for PV of the Type IIG enzyme, Cj0031, of <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strain NCTC11168 as a limiter of phage spread and a regulator of a gene expression. The underlying mechanism of action for the alteration in gene expression is not known and does not appear to involve differential methylation of specific recognition sites by Cj0031. Nevertheless PV of Cj0031, as detected during infections in chickens and mice (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), produces changes in expression of multiple genes that may lead to phenotypic variation and generation of highly differentiated variants with differing capabilities of adaptation to diverse niches.</p></sec>
