A significant outcome of divergence in the TE landscape is evident in hybrid dysgenic syndromes, a strong form of genomic incompatibility that can arise when (TE) family abundance differs between two parents. When TEs inherited from the father are absent in the mother's genome, TEs can become activated in the progeny, causing germline damage and sterility. Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> indicate that dysgenesis can occur when TEs inherited paternally are not matched with a pool of corresponding TE silencing PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) provisioned by the female germline. Using the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> syndrome of hybrid dysgenesis as a model, we characterize the effects that divergence in TE profile between parents has on offspring. Overall, we show that divergence in the TE landscape is associated with persisting differences in germline TE expression when comparing genetically identical females of reciprocal crosses and these differences are transmitted to the next generation. Moreover, chronic and persisting TE expression coincides with increased levels of genic piRNAs associated with reduced gene expression. Combined with these effects, we further demonstrate that gene expression is idiosyncratically influenced by differences in the genic piRNA profile of the parents that arise though polymorphic TE insertions. Overall, these results support a model in which early germline events in dysgenesis establish a chronic, stable state of both TE and gene expression in the germline that is maintained through adulthood and transmitted to the next generation. This work demonstrates that divergence in the TE profile is associated with diverse piRNA-mediated transgenerational effects on gene expression within populations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Transposable elements (TEs) are selfish elements that copy themselves. More than half of the human genome is comprised of such elements. Studies in the fruit flies <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> have been important in demonstrating a role for RNA silencing by PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in protecting the genome against these harmful elements. These small RNAs are capable of recognizing TE mRNAs and mediating their destruction. They are also transmitted by the female germline to offspring in order to maintain a stable genome across generations. When males carrying a particular TE family are crossed with females lacking the element, the mother is unable to provide genome defense via complementary piRNAs that target the element. This leads to excess TE activation in the germline and sterility, a phenomenon known as hybrid dysgenesis. In this article we characterize the genomic landscape of TE destabilization that occurs in dysgenic crosses of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic>. We demonstrate that this mobilization is associated with an increased level of germline TE expression that persists through adulthood. In addition, we find that TE activation is associated with diverse effects on normal gene expression that are also mediated by piRNAs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Science Foundation MCB-1022165 and NSF MCB-1413532(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsf.gov">www.nsf.gov</ext-link>) to JPB, NSF CNS-1337899, National Institutes of Health NIH-P20GM103638 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov">www.nih.gov</ext-link>) to JPB (P.I.

This mixing of genomes introduces potentially advantageous variation under changing environmental conditions, but also provides a condition ripe for exploitation by selfish elements [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Because syngamy can introduce selfish elements to new genomes and recombination can separate selfish elements from their harmful consequences, selfish elements such as transposable elements (TEs) can proliferate [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This is exemplified by the <italic>P</italic> element in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Through a likely horizontal transfer event from the distant species <italic>D</italic>. <italic>willistoni</italic>, the <italic>P</italic> element invaded <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> less than 100 years ago and is now found in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> world-wide [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Because TEs can be harmful and also drive a rapid accumulation of differences between species, they have been proposed to contribute to reproductive isolation. While their proliferative nature makes it very unlikely that TEs are drivers of speciation itself [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], TE misregulation has been observed in a variety of interspecific hybrids. For example, increased TE expression is observed in malformed backcrosses between recently diverged species of lake whitefish [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Similar observations have been made in species ranging from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] to wallaby [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using interspecific crosses have been especially important for our understanding of TE control in hybrids. The results so far have been idiosyncratic. Interspecific hybrids between closely related members of the <italic>affinis</italic>, <italic>simulans</italic>, <italic>virilis</italic> and <italic>pseudoobscura</italic> groups of <italic>Drosophila</italic> show little evidence for increased transposition [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In contrast, increased transposition is observed in crosses between <italic>D</italic>. <italic>buzzatii</italic> and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>koepferae</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the latter case, the increased rate of TE movement has been attributed to a form of genomic stress, though the nature of this stress is not clear. Additionally, interspecific hybrids between <italic>D</italic>. <italic>simulans</italic> and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> (which are more distantly related compared to those in previous crosses examining this question [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]) do show increased expression of TEs [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and this is attributed to adaptive divergence in components of the TE regulatory machinery. Since species may differ significantly both in TE profile and regulatory machinery protein function, it is challenging to determine how divergence in TE profile alone contributes to TE activation in interspecific hybrids.</p><p>For this reason, intraspecific syndromes of hybrid dysgenesis provide critical insight into the role that divergence in TE profile can play in determining TE activity across generations. Hybrid dysgenesis is defined as a syndrome of hybrid sterility [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and germline damage that occurs in intraspecific crosses when the male carries one or more TE families absent in the female [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The dysgenesis phenomenon in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has provided crucial insight into mechanisms of host genome defense by small RNAs. This is because activation of TEs inherited solely through the <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline can be explained by the fact that the maternal germline is the primary agent of transgenerational TE repression via PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) maternally loaded into the egg [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>piRNAs are 23&#x02013;30 nt RNAs found in complex with PIWI proteins and they play a crucial role in maintaining genome integrity via the repression of TEs. Many piRNAs are derived from TE fragments residing in distinct genomic regions known as piRNA clusters [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Anti-sense TE transcripts derived from these clusters are processed into piRNAs and, in complex with PIWI proteins, serve as guides to target resident TE transcripts for PIWI-mediated 'slicing' [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This system serves as a mechanism of genome defense because the proliferative nature of TEs can be inherently recognized by their tendency to transpose into piRNA clusters, whereby they serve as guides to recognize mRNAs of the same TE family. In the absence of the maternally provisioned piRNAs that target TE mRNAs for PIWI-mediated slicing, paternally inherited TEs become activated in the progeny germline. This has been demonstrated for the <italic>P-M</italic> and <italic>I-R</italic> systems of hybrid dysgenesis in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the <italic>P-M</italic> system, <italic>P</italic> strains, but not <italic>M</italic> strains, carry active copies of the DNA transposon known as the <italic>P</italic> element. In the <italic>I-R</italic> system, <italic>I</italic> (<italic>Inducer</italic>) strains, but not <italic>R</italic> (<italic>Reactive</italic>) strains, carry active copies of the non-LTR retrotransposon <italic>I</italic> element. Dysgenesis arises when <italic>I</italic> or <italic>P</italic> strain males are mated, respectively, with <italic>R</italic> or <italic>M</italic> strain females lacking such elements. These females are unable to maternally provision matching piRNAs that target the activating element.</p><p>The <italic>P-M</italic> and <italic>I-R</italic> systems of dysgenesis represent cases in which the TE profile differs between strains with respect to only one family of inducing elements. In contrast, a third syndrome of hybrid dysgenesis in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> represents a more complicated form of dysgenesis that appears to be caused by the mass action of multiple active elements abundant in one strain, but not another. Elements that likely contribute to this syndrome were first identified through direct analysis of induced lesions identified in the offspring of F1 progeny that escaped sterility from the dysgenic cross. The major driver of dysgenesis appears to be the <italic>Penelope</italic> element, the founding member of a clade of retroelements designated <italic>Penelope-</italic>like elements that are distinct from non-LTR and LTR retroelements [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Active copies of <italic>Penelope</italic> are abundant in the inducer strain (Strain 160) and only degenerate copies are present in the <italic>M</italic>/<italic>R-</italic>like reactive strain (Strain 9) [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, expression of the <italic>Penelope</italic> element is elevated in the ovaries and testes of F1 dysgenic progeny that have escaped ablation of the gonads [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition to the <italic>Penelope</italic> element, three other elements (<italic>Helena</italic>, a non-LTR<italic>; Paris</italic> and <italic>Polyphemus</italic>, both DNA transposons [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) are also more abundant in the 160 inducer strain, and these likely contribute to dysgenesis. A complex mode of hybrid dysgenesis, driven jointly by multiple elements, is supported by the fact that females of some "neutral" strains&#x02014;capable of preventing dysgenesis when crossed with inducer males but also incapable of induction [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]&#x02013;lack <italic>Penelope</italic> piRNAs in the their germline. If <italic>Penelope</italic> is the sole cause of paternal induction, it is difficult to explain how such strains could prevent induction when the female germline lacks <italic>Penelope</italic> piRNAs.</p><p>In light of this complexity, a second model for hybrid dysgenesis not directly driven by transposable elements in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> has been proposed. A previous study showed that not only do inducer and reactive strains differ with respect to TE abundance, they also differ with respect to piRNA cluster activity [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In particular, small RNA sequencing in these two strains demonstrated that telomeric regions of the inducer strain exhibit uniquely strong piRNA cluster activity. Differences in telomeric cluster activity were proposed as potentially causative of dysgenesis. Here, we directly test this hypothesis by genetically assessing the contribution of inducer strain telomeres to hybrid sterility.</p><p>Because the 160 inducer strain and the 9 reactive strain of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> differ with respect to multiple elements, the dysgenic syndrome in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> may perhaps be more similar to that observed between species with respect to TE profiles, but with minimal divergence in protein coding function since it arises from an intraspecific cross. This syndrome may be considered an intermediate state between the <italic>P-M</italic> and <italic>I-R</italic> models and crosses between entirely different species that differ significantly at the genic level as well. Therefore, the dysgenic syndrome in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> serves as a useful model for understanding the consequences of accumulating differences in TE profile between populations.</p><p>A fundamental question is how TE activation in dysgenic crosses influences the entire genomic TE landscape. Early studies of <italic>P</italic> element hybrid dysgenesis in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> indicated downstream activation of additional TEs [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], but this interpretation was soon called into doubt [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Nonetheless, the syndrome of hybrid dysgenesis in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> provides strong support for cascading germline activation of TEs because multiple TEs were found to transpose in the germline of dysgenic progeny [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. While different TE families may contribute to the initial induction of dysgenesis in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic>, germline co-mobilization has been demonstrated by the transposition of TEs that are evenly distributed between the two strains, in contrast to <italic>Penelope</italic>, <italic>Helena</italic> and <italic>Paris</italic>, which are more abundant in inducer strain 160 [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Significantly, a recent study of the <italic>P</italic> element system indicates that the previous conclusion of no co-mobilization may have been premature [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the face of <italic>P</italic> element activation, DNA damage can perturb piRNA biogenesis and this defective piRNA biogenesis is presumed to drive the mobilization of additional TEs. Thus, global TE mobilization may also be observed in syndromes of hybrid dysgenesis that are driven by a single element. Whether a similar mechanism caused by DNA damage explains co-mobilization in the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> system is unknown.</p><p>To fully understand the mechanisms underlying TE activation in dysgenic crosses, the developmental context must be considered since co-mobilization may be induced at any point in the developing or aging germline. A critical feature of the <italic>P-M</italic> system is that the germline crisis ameliorates with age. In particular, as flies age to 21 days, fertility is partially restored and piRNA levels that target the <italic>P</italic> element are restored to the same level as non-dysgenic reciprocal females. Thus, even though <italic>P</italic> element derived piRNAs are not maternally inherited, <italic>de novo</italic> piRNA production from paternally inherited P insertions is evident. This <italic>de novo</italic> piRNA production also coincides with restored silencing of <italic>P</italic> element mRNA. Rescue of germline crisis is also proposed to be enhanced by movement of other elements into piRNA clusters [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Here we use the unique system of hybrid dysgenesis in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> to define the landscape of TE expression that coincides with the initial activation of multiple TE families. Because analysis of piRNA production and TE expression can be confounded in atrophied gonads, we focus solely on germline tissues that have escaped complete gonadal atrophy. Specifically, we examine piRNA and TE expression in 0&#x02013;2 hour old embryos laid by F1 females from non-dysgenic crosses, and F1 escaper females of the dysgenic cross. This represents an endpoint of the dysgenic crisis and also provides insight into how the effects of hybrid dysgenesis in females that escape sterility can be passed on to further generations. In contrast to the <italic>P-M</italic> system, which may resolve within the germline as flies age [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the effects of dysgenesis on TE expression in the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> system persist through adulthood. Because this occurs within an intraspecific cross, increased levels of persisting TE expression are not explained by divergence in the piRNA machinery.</p><p>By comparing 0&#x02013;2 hour old embryos laid by genetically identical females derived from dysgenic versus non-dysgenic crosses, we show that germline activation of TEs is driven by a multi-layered mechanism. Diverse elements are activated corresponding to TE copy number asymmetry between strains but there is also corresponding activation of some TEs that are evenly distributed between strains. This state of chronic increased TE expression is maintained as flies age, suggesting a different mechanism underlying co-mobilization compared to the <italic>P-M</italic> system. Interestingly, increased and persistent TE expression in the germline of females of the dysgenic cross coincides with a shift in piRNA pools. This shift in piRNA pools is associated with increased abundance of piRNAs that target genes outside of piRNA clusters, leading to significant effects on non-TE gene expression. Finally, differences in the TE profile between strains coincide with different modes of trans-generational gene regulation by genic piRNAs that arise from polymorphic TE insertions. Overall, this work identifies multiple modes by which differences in the TE landscape between strains can influence patterns of TE and gene expression across generations via piRNAs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Genome wide asymmetry in TE abundance in a dysgenic cross of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic>
</title><p>Previous studies identified <italic>Penelope</italic> to be the primary driver of dysgenesis in the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> system because multiple active copies reside in the inducer strain 160, but only degenerate copies reside in the reactive strain 9. <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization has identified more than 45 euchromatic <italic>Penelope</italic> insertions in strain 160 and none in strain 9 [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, the <italic>Helena</italic> elements (euchromatic insertions Strain 160: 18; Strain 9: 0) and <italic>Paris</italic> elements (euchromatic insertions Strain 160: 26; Strain 9: 0) were shown to be more abundant in inducer strain 160 [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Recently a third element, <italic>Polyphemus</italic>, was identified as more abundant in strain 160.

Likewise, the three repeat sequences enriched in strain 9 show no apparent evidence of TE related coding capacity. In addition to the four TEs known to be overrepresented in copy number in strain 160, and the two putatively non-TE repeat sequences, we identify five additional elements enriched in strain 160 (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). These are candidates for contributing to the dysgenic syndrome. It is important to note that in this comparison there is a form of ascertainment bias.

Since reduced piRNA function can lead to increased telomeric TE activity, our observed TART excess in strain 160 may be a readout of compromised piRNA function in the inducer strain that is either a cause or consequence of TE excess. For these reasons, it was critical to test for a role of telomeric regions in the induction of dysgenesis. Overall, we found that diverse TE families are in excess in strain 160.

A phylogenetic approach using full-length fragments is ideal for this purpose, but full-length TE assemblies are not available with short read sequencing technology. Therefore, we estimated relative TE family age by examining the sequence heterogeneity within mapping reads (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>) by considering the average frequency of the most common nucleotide variant, across all nucleotide variants within the mapping.</p><p>A young element that has recently invaded will show high similarity (higher homogeneity) among copies, nearing 1 for an average frequency of the major nucleotide variant.

For a recent TE <italic>re-activation</italic> in only one strain, we expect higher sequence homogeneity within that strain but higher heterogeneity in the other strain, arising from degraded copies. For an element that has recently invaded a species and is present in both strains, but achieves greater copy number in one strain, we expect a similar level of sequence homogeneity in both strains.

<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref> demonstrates the degree to which asymmetry in maternal provisioning predicts TE expression in reciprocal dysgenic and non-dysgenic progeny in the next generation. Many of the elements that are more abundant in strain 160 have greater piRNA abundance in the 160 female germline and also are expressed at higher levels in the germline of the dysgenic cross. This drives a significant positive correlation between the log 2 of the ratio of piRNA abundance between strains and relative TE expression levels. However, with Spearman's rho less than 0.2, this is not a strong relationship. Therefore, maternal provisioning of piRNA is only a modest predictor of TE expression in hybrid dysgenesis. For example, element 750 shows no difference in piRNA abundance between parental strains but is more highly expressed in the dysgenic germline. Additionally, a reduced level of TE piRNA abundance persisting in the dysgenic germline is positively associated with increased expression for many (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>, for example <italic>Helena</italic>), but not all elements. In contrast to <italic>Helena</italic>, <italic>Skippy</italic> and <italic>Slicemaster</italic> are both more highly expressed in the dysgenic germline even though both show <italic>higher</italic> levels of piRNA abundance in the dysgenic germline.

Since differences in maternal piRNA and siRNA load are strongly correlated between the strains (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), this is not surprising. Interestingly, in contrast to piRNA levels, zygotic siRNA levels were not predictive of differences in TE expression between reciprocal progeny (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>).

These results do not support a model of global disruption in piRNA biogenesis maintained in adult flies. Rather, they support a model in which the persistence of higher expression for some TEs is driven by idiosyncratic defects in the restoration of piRNA biogenesis in aged females that occur on a TE-by-TE basis. Strikingly, for several TEs, signatures of piRNA biogenesis appear largely restored, despite increased expression in the dysgenic germline. For TEs that are increased in expression in the dysgenic germline, there appear to be multiple causes (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), including, but not limited to, reduction in ping-pong pairs, suggesting multiple modes of TE derepression in hybrid dysgenesis.</p><table-wrap id="pgen.1005332.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005332.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Properties of TEs significantly more expressed in the dysgenic germline by at last 2-fold (FDR&#x0003c;0.1).</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pgen.1005332.t001g" xlink:href="pgen.1005332.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TE</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">160:9 Abund.

We performed GO analysis using the GOrilla program that identifies enriched ontologies in sorted lists [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Sorting by FDR value, we identified several interesting terms for genes down-regulated in dysgenesis.

Since chromatin marks and gene silencing are important for TE control, down-regulation of these genes may play a role in increased TE expression in the dysgenic germline.

Global gene expression might be modulated if genic piRNA silencing were either attenuated or enhanced during dysgenesis. Therefore, we examined how the global landscape of genic piRNAs was influenced by the activation of diverse TEs in dysgenesis. For this analysis, we excluded genes that lacked hits to CDS regions. We also excluded genes that lacked orthologs in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> to exclude TEs mis-annotated as genes.</p><p>In the dysgenic germline we found significant enrichment of piRNAs derived from genes. We identified 105 genes that had at least 5 piRNA per million mapping to genic CDS regions in either the parental strains or reciprocal F1 progeny. For these 105 genes, there was a significant excess of piRNAs in the dysgenic germline (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>; p-value &#x0003c; 0.0001, Wilcoxon-signed rank test). Genic piRNA production, relative to parental strains, is also higher in non-dysgenic progeny, indicating that this may arise from crosses between strains with divergent piRNA profiles. For some genes, the genic piRNAs were predominantly anti-sense, but the majority of genes were associated with primarily sense strand piRNAs (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Comparing genic piRNA density across introns and exons, we found that piRNAs from these genes are enriched on exons (Paired T-test across genes contrasting intronic and exonic density: Library 1: p = 0.0046, Library 2: p = 0.0024). This suggests that genic piRNA processing may occur in the cytoplasm. We examined genic piRNAs for piRNA biogenesis signatures: first position U bias and 10th position A bias. Results indicate that the genic piRNAs are primary piRNAs (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). From the entire set of 105 genes, focusing on 80 genes that primarily produce sense piRNAs, we found a signature of primary piRNA biogenesis and a very weak signature of secondary piRNA biogenesis (Library 1: U first position: 0.33, background U: 0.21, A 10th position: 0.25, background A: 0.22; Library 2: U first position: 0.33, background U: 0.21, A 10th position: 0.24, background A: 0.23).</p><fig id="pgen.1005332.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005332.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Genic piRNA targeting is increased in the dysgenic germline.</title><p>(A) log10 Z-score heat map of genic (CDS) piRNA density for <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> orthologs (above a threshold of 5 piRNAs per CDS per 1 million mapped in at least one of four columns).

For the several genes that produced both sense and antisense piRNA, we often found evidence of either a TE in the reference genome or an indication of a nearby insertion in genomic mappings of one of the two strains. Not only did these genes have sense and antisense piRNA, but unique piRNA also mapped to intergenic regions around these genes, indicative of cluster spreading in <italic>cis</italic>. In contrast, genes with sense piRNA mapping only to exons usually showed no evidence of proximal TE insertions and piRNA did not map to intergenic regions. This supports the idea that these sense and exon-only piRNA are generated from processing of genic mRNA in the cytoplasm.</p><p>The 105 genes were also more highly expressed above the genome-wide background (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>, Wilcoxon rank sum test, p &#x0003c; 0.001). Among the genes with the greatest excess of piRNA abundance in the dysgenic germline, the primary piRNA biogenesis signature was strongest for the genes with expression level higher than 1000 RPKM (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). This indicates that these small RNAs are not simply degradation products of highly expressed genes. Importantly, the production of these genic sense piRNAs has an apparent effect on gene expression. Of the 105 genes, 89 were identified to show the highest piRNA abundance in the dysgenic germline. These 89 genes were more lowly expressed in the dysgenic germline compared to the non-dysgenic germline (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>, Wilcoxon rank sum test, p &#x0003c; 0.001). Among this set of 89 genes, there was a significant excess of genes more lowly expressed in dysgenesis compared to more highly expressed (p = 0.03, Sign Test). We attribute this to primary piRNA biogenesis from the sense strand since lower expression is observed for genes that are primarily targets of sense piRNA biogenesis (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).</p><p>GO enrichment analysis using GOrilla indicated that these 105 genes are highly enriched for ribosomal proteins (FDR p-value = 1.9E-13, 19-fold enrichment; <xref rid="pgen.1005332.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>).

Therefore, we employed a genetic approach to determine whether identified telomeric clusters were causal of dysgenesis or, perhaps, simply consequences of excess telomeric TART activity identified in the inducer strain. In the previous study [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], two telomeric clusters specific to strain 160 were identified, one residing at the tip of the second chromosome and another residing at the tip of the sixth chromosome. We therefore tested whether chromosomes carrying telomeres from the inducer strain 160 were highly inductive, when transmitted paternally, or highly protective, when present in the female germline of the dysgenic cross.</p><p>We found that induction of dysgenesis is distributed across all chromosomes, with the exception of the dot sixth chromosome (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Therefore, strain 160 telomeres of the second and sixth chromosomes do not contribute uniquely to induction of dysgenesis. Using QTL analysis (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>) with special attention to telomeric and pericentric regions (motivated by the fact that these genomic compartments often contain TE-rich piRNA clusters[<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]), we identified three genomic regions for which strain 160 variants at these positions significantly protected against F1 sterility when present in the mother (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., dysgenesis; <xref rid="pgen.1005332.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). The genomic region with the most significant effect corresponded to the pericentric region of chromosome 5. The pericentric region of the X chromosome also explained a significant proportion of variation in protective ability, followed by a euchromatic region in the proximal arm region of chromosome 4. We tested for interactions between these loci and saw no evidence for synergism (p-value for all interactions &#x0003e;0.2). Our previous work also found chromosome 5 to be the most protective, followed by the X and then chromosome 4 [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Together with the results from this study, there is strong genetic evidence that pericentric, cluster-derived piRNAs play a role in the protection against dysgenesis in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic>. By contrast, variation in telomeric repeat abundance between strains does not explain variation in protection against dysgenesis. Thus, telomeric piRNA clusters and amplified TART elements are likely a result of TE destabilization in the inducer strain rather than a driver.</p><fig id="pgen.1005332.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005332.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Genetic analysis of zygotic induction and maternal repression of gonadal atrophy.</title><p>(A) Induction of sterility by 160 is broadly distributed across the genome, with the exception of chromosome 6 (the dot chromosome).

Among the 221 repeats within the TE library (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Dataset</xref>), there are 141 that meet this qualification. We further reasoned that if any female with full repressive ability had piRNA abundances for a TE that were similar to strain 9, we could rule out that TE as a driver of dysgenesis. Of the remaining 141 candidate TEs, 88 TEs have at least one protective female that has normalized piRNA abundance derived from that TE less than or equal to strain 9. Thus, we were left with 53 candidate contributing repeats. Using these criteria, we were unable to eliminate any of the elements 3-fold enriched from strain 160. Therefore, we are unable to conclude that maternal loading of piRNA corresponding to a single TE can mediate protection against the induction of dysgenesis.</p><p>piRNA sequence data from the six most protective F1 females suggests a minimal role for the TART element piRNAs as mediators of maternal protection. This is because the vast majority of TART piRNAs in the protective mothers are derived from the tip of the X chromosome from 160 (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>) and three of the six females that are most protective against dysgenesis lack the X 160 telomere allele.

A <italic>Ulysses</italic> element insertion upstream of this gene in strain 9 is specifically associated with genic silencing and shunting <italic>oysgedart</italic> into piRNA biogenesis (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). 5' genic piRNAs derived from <italic>oysgedart</italic> are dual-strand in strain 9 ovaries (which includes somatic and germline tissue) but biased towards the sense strand in the germline.</p><p>Maternal deposition of piRNAs derived from a specific locus can mediate piRNA biogenesis at that locus in the next generation [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. For <italic>cdi</italic>, a recent study demonstrated that maternal deposition leads to maintenance of piRNA biogenesis from the 160 <italic>cdi</italic> allele. In progeny of strain 160 mothers and strain 9 fathers, maternally deposited piRNAs derived from the <italic>cdi</italic> cluster also activate piRNA biogenesis and methylation of H3K9 from the strain 9 <italic>cdi</italic> allele [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>We found that two modes of genic targeting by piRNAs result in contrasting effects on gene expression across generations. The first mode was found at the <italic>cdi</italic> locus (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Here, maternal deposition of <italic>cdi</italic> piRNAs mediates silencing in the germline, but not the soma. <italic>cdi</italic> gene expression is highly reduced in the germline of strain 160 and the germline silencing of both alleles of <italic>cdi</italic> is maintained when transmitted maternally and made heterozygous in combination with the wild-type strain 9 allele. In contrast, when the <italic>cdi</italic> cluster allele is transmitted paternally, piRNA cluster activity is reduced and germline expression levels are maintained near the level of strain 9, with similar contributions from each allele. Critically, this asymmetry in gene expression is not observed in the soma. Carcasses of females from reciprocal directions of the cross showed similar levels of expression from both alleles (Dysgenic Carcass: 17.1 RPKM [9 Allele: 7 counts; 160 Allele: 9 counts] vs. Non-dysgenic Carcass: 23.4 RPKM [9 Allele: 5 counts; 160 Allele: 12 counts]) (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>).</p><p>The second mode was found at the <italic>oysgedart</italic> locus (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). The <italic>oysgedart</italic> allele in strain 9 shows a novel mode of genic targeting by piRNA. Similar to <italic>cdi</italic>, we identified sense and anti-sense piRNAs in the ovary. However, germline piRNAs derived from <italic>oysgedart</italic> are primarily sense derived. Strikingly, in neither direction of the cross is this form of sense piRNA biogenesis maintained in progeny. Instead, the wild-type allele from strain 160 seems to function in <italic>trans</italic> to limit this mode of silencing. Thus, in both directions of the cross, the expression of <italic>oysgedart</italic> is maintained at equal levels, but only at about 60% of wildtype since the <italic>Ulysses</italic> insertion allele from strain 9 is expressed at a lower level. While sense piRNA biogenesis is turned off in reciprocal directions of the cross, expression of the 9 allele is reduced in <italic>cis</italic>. In neither direction of the cross does there appear a maternal effect on somatic expression for <italic>oysgedart</italic>. Even though expression of the 9 allele is reduced in the germline, it remains on in the soma of both dysgenic (RPKM: 62.0, [9 Allele: 21 counts; 160 Allele: 21 counts]) and non-dysgenic (RPKM: 80.9, [9 Allele: 29 counts; 160 Allele: 25 counts]) F1 females (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). This demonstrates that the allelic <italic>cis</italic> effects on local silencing by the <italic>Ulysses</italic> insertion are germline, not soma, specific (Fisher's exact test for difference in allele effects between soma and germline. Dysgenic: p&#x0003c;0.0001, Nondysgenic: p&#x0003c;0.0001). Interestingly, in contrast to <italic>cdi</italic> which has shown to be enriched for H3K9 methylation in strain 160 ovaries, we find no evidence that <italic>oysgedart</italic> is so enriched in strain 9 ovaries (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>We then tested how this mode of piRNA biogenesis is maintained in further generations. We found that the <italic>cdi</italic> piRNA cluster can cause heritable activation of piRNA biogenesis from the strain 9 allele, a process equivalent to paramutation. In F3 flies generated by backcrossing hybrid non-dysgenic females to strain 9 males (maintaining maternal transmission of the cluster) cluster behavior was maintained even when <italic>cdi</italic> was homozygous for the strain 9 allele (<xref rid="pgen.1005332.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). In one case, cluster behavior was lost. Because the cross scheme was maintained over two generations, we are unable to determine the generation in which the cluster activity was lost, however, it is clear that <italic>cdi</italic> can paramutate in one generation but that this paramutation is not robust across multiple generations (though see [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]). In the same F3 flies, we did not observe restoration of cluster maintenance for <italic>oysgedart</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Discussion</title><p>Due to their proliferative nature, differences in the TE landscape within populations and between species can accumulate rapidly. Since TEs are harmful, it has also been proposed that this divergence drives rapid evolution of the piRNA machinery itself [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Divergence at both levels is expected to greatly influence patterns of TE activity in crosses between individuals. Within a species, hybrid dysgenesis syndromes driven from a single element family reveal that maternally deposited piRNAs targeting the activating TE are critical for maintaining TE control and fertility. In contrast, crosses between species that differ with respect to both TE profile <italic>and</italic> the machinery of piRNA biogenesis show dramatic collapse of piRNA biogenesis and this can be attributed to divergence in the piRNA machinery rather than differences in the maternally deposited pool [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Previous studies, combined with results presented here, indicate that the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> system represents a complex form of intraspecific hybrid dysgenesis involving more divergent TE profiles compared to other syndromes of hybrid dysgenesis. However, because it is an intraspecific cross, there is minimal divergence in the TE regulatory machinery. Therefore, the dysgenic syndrome in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> can be considered an important model for understanding the dynamics of TE control at an intermediate stage in the divergence of TE profile within a single species.</p><p>Here we show that differences between genetically identical dysgenic and non-dysgenic individuals are manifested in multiple ways. When genomes from two strains of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> are brought together, TEs that are more abundant in one genome become more highly expressed in the germline of the next generation. This difference in TE expression persists in the germline as flies age. Coincident with this, there is also a persistent increase in TE expression for several TEs that are evenly distributed between strains.</p><p>We identify multiple modes by which piRNAs modulate gene expression. First, many genes become off-targets for piRNA biogenesis, and their expression levels are reduced. The mechanism for this is unclear, but may be driven by the same mechanism that leads to idiosyncratic defects in piRNA biogenesis for some TEs. One possibility is that compromised piRNA function in the cytoplasm leads to a shift in the targets of primary piRNA biogenesis. A similar increase in sense genic piRNA abundance has been observed in <italic>rhino</italic> and <italic>uap56</italic> mutants and this has been attributed to compromised specificity in piRNA processing [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Therefore, the increased genic piRNA abundance in the dysgenic germline may be a readout of compromised piRNA biogenesis and loss of specificity in the cytoplasm. Secondly, divergence in the TE profile between strains leads to differences in the pool of maternally deposited genic piRNAs. Depending on the nature of genic piRNAs, these can modulate gene expression in diverse ways across generations. For the <italic>cdi</italic> gene, maternally deposited piRNAs from both strands mediate gene silencing of both alleles in non-dysgenic progeny. Alleles of <italic>cdi</italic> share properties with imprinted genes since expression depends on which parent the allele is inherited from. However, <italic>cdi</italic> differs from canonical imprinting in that a silenced <italic>cdi</italic> allele is capable of silencing the other allele in <italic>trans</italic> when inherited maternally, similar to paramutations observed in maize, mice and recently in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Imprinted genes can have a significant downstream effect on patterns of gene expression [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Even in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where there is no evidence for DNA methylation, there are significant, albeit poorly understood, parent-of-origin allelic effects on global gene expression [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Such transgenerational effects on gene expression may contribute to large numbers of genes being differentially expressed between the dysgenic and non-dysgenic germline. In contrast to <italic>cdi</italic>, a <italic>Ulysses</italic> insertion upstream of the <italic>oysgedart</italic> gene seems to mediate only deposition of sense piRNAs. In this case, the wild-type non-insertion allele appears to resist transgenerational silencing and expression is maintained equally between reciprocal hybrids.</p><p>Since we identify a large number of differences in TE and genic expression that are mediated by piRNAs in diverse ways, it is difficult to distinguish between causal factors and downstream effects. However, our genetic analyses clearly demonstrate that both induction of and protection against dysgenesis is distributed across the genome. Since multiple TE families are in excess copy number in the inducer strain, the weight of evidence favors a complex mode of hybrid dysgenesis driven jointly by the mass action of multiple elements. This is supported by the fact that the regions of the genome that are most protective against dysgenesis are located in the pericentric regions, which are known to be critical sources of piRNAs [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], further supporting a model in which pericentric regions play a unique role in TE control [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>].</p><p>Representing an intermediate state of TE divergence between single TE family dysgenesis syndromes and interspecific crosses, several observations are worth noting from the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> system. First, in crosses between <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>simulans</italic>, piRNA biogenesis is globally defective and this is attributed to the accumulation of incompatibilities that arise from rapid divergence in the protein sequence of the piRNA biogenesis machinery. In the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> system where there is only divergence in the TE profile between strains, we see no such global collapse of piRNA biogenesis. In this sense, this is more similar to what is observed in the <italic>P-M</italic> system of dysgenesis.</p><p>However, there are some key distinctions between the <italic>P-M</italic> system, driven by a single element, and the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> system of dysgenesis. In the <italic>P-M</italic> system, as flies age, piRNAs targeting the active element are restored and <italic>P</italic> element silencing is regained. We see very little restoration of silencing for many TEs that are most likely to contribute to dysgenesis. For example, the <italic>Helena</italic> element remains much more highly expressed in the dysgenic germline and this is also associated with failure to restore the piRNA pool targeting <italic>Helena</italic>. Therefore, despite the fact that these tissues (0&#x02013;2 hour old embryos) have escaped the ablation event of dysgenesis, idiosyncratic defects in TE silencing persist and these are passed on to the next generation. Furthermore, increased TE expression is observed for some TEs that appear to have a restored level of piRNA biogenesis. Thus, a further defect in dysgenesis is a lack of effective silencing by a restored pool of piRNA. This suggests multiple mechanisms contribute to chronic increased TE expression in the dysgenic germline.</p><p>A long-standing question is what underlies TE co-mobilization in dysgenic syndromes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. For many years, the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> system was considered unique in that it was associated with increased movement of elements equally abundant between strains, the <italic>Ulysses</italic> element being the best example. Recent work by Theurkauf and colleagues suggest that co-mobilization in fact may be a general property of dysgenic syndromes [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. By what mechanism does the movement of one element activate the movement of others? The current working model is that DNA damage from a moving element activates the DNA damage response within the germline. This, in turn, drives Chk-2 mediated phosphorylation and degradation of Vasa. Vasa is critical for nuage assembly and germline piRNA biogenesis [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In the absence of proper Vasa and germline piRNA function, resident transposons become activated, leading to co-mobilization.</p><p>This is a strong candidate for the mechanism of co-mobilization in the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> system. A burst of TE mobilization in the germline at any time during development may drive movement of TEs found in equal copy number between strains via the DNA damage response. However, it is difficult to explain the persisting and idiosyncratic pattern of increased expression for some TEs in the dysgenic germline that is observed in aged females that have escaped sterility. In the <italic>P-M</italic> system, Vasa degradation is relieved as the aging dysgenic flies recover partial fertility and <italic>P</italic> element silencing is restored. In <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic>, full silencing is not restored, even in the germline that has escaped ablation. Coinciding with increased levels of expression that persist for some TEs, we also note that there is a persisting increase in piRNAs that target genes. This is similar to observations in flies defective in <italic>rhino</italic> and <italic>uap56</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. We have shown that global defects in TE repression observed during hybrid dysgenesis share this feature. Strikingly, the genes that are piRNA targets are highly enriched for ribosomal proteins RNAs (FDR p-value: 1.9E-13, 19-fold enrichment; <xref rid="pgen.1005332.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). The mechanism by which increased genic piRNAs target ribosomal protein RNAs is unclear, however there are multiple lines of evidence that disrupted levels of ribosomal proteins can lead to increased levels of repeat expression [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. For example, an early genome wide screen in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> identified approximately 27 genes involved in transposon silencing, two of which were ribosomal proteins [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Disruption of the ribosome is known to trigger nucleolar stress and p53 activation [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Thus, nucleolar stress mediated by genic piRNAs may also contribute to persisting TE activation in the dysgenic germline.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec014"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec015"><title>Custom <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> TE library</title><p>Few annotated TEs are available for <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic>.

TE RPKM estimates were obtained by directly mapping with BWA to the annotated TE library and normalizing with known TE length and the number of reads that mapped to the reference genome. mRNA RPKM estimates were obtained using the RNA-seq tool in CLC. Fold analysis was performed by calculating RPKM(+0.01) ratios. We used DEseq2 [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] on RNAseq read count data to test for differential expression for both TEs and genes between dysgenic and non-dysgenic germ lines. Analysis of TEs and genes was performed separately. The model employed tested for treatment effects, age effects, and age x treatment interaction effects. While the same model was fit for genes and TEs, these models were run independently to account for possible differences in the mean/variance relationship between these groups. Genes with fewer than 40 total reads mapped across all samples were removed from the analyses prior to calling differential expression in order to reduce the loss of power due to multiple testing. Statistical significance was assessed using FDR, focusing on treatment effect only. GO analysis was performed with GOrilla[<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] using <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> orthologs genes sorted by FDR value for the test of treatment effect.</p><p>Additional germline mRNA seq was performed using the same protocol for pure strain 9 and strain 160 (RPKMs averaged for cluster analysis across 2 libraries each for 7&#x02013;15 day old females and 15&#x02013;25 day old females). Allele counts were determined by direct counting within the RNA-seq mappings (summed across all library mappings) for a SNP known to distinguish the two strains within the transcripts for <italic>cdi</italic> and <italic>oysgedart</italic>. Somatic mRNA seq analysis was likewise performed (3 libraries per condition, each library from a 10 pooled female carcasses, RPKMs averaged across libraries and allele counts estimated as before).</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Small RNA sequencing</title><p>All small RNA was size selected from 15% acrylamide, cut between an 18 bp oligo and the 30nt rRNA.

The filtered 23&#x02013;30 nt small RNA reads were mapped to our curated TE library with BWA.aln [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], using the default parameters. Reads were normalized by non-unique mappers to the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> reference genome using BWA.aln defaults. Calculations for ping-pong percent [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and density of piRNA pairs were done with the R package viRome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ark-genomics.org/bioinformatics/virome">http://www.ark-genomics.org/bioinformatics/virome</ext-link>), with some modifications.

Reads were normalized by non-unique mappers to the genome. BEDTools intersect [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] was utilized to count piRNA hits on genes and CDS sequences. Fastq reads specific to genic piRNA hits were extracted using Enve-omics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/lmrodriguezr/enveomics">https://github.com/lmrodriguezr/enveomics</ext-link>) and FASTX-Toolkit (hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html) was used to process and analyze nucleotide bias for genic piRNA subsets. We did not perform DEseq2 analysis because estimation of the dispersion parameter with DEseq2 is unlikely to be robust with about 200 TEs, compared to standard mRNA-seq analysis that estimates the dispersion parameter using thousands of genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Percent ping-pong was defined as the percent of 23 to 30 nt mapping reads that had a corresponding read on the opposite strand with a 10 bp 5'-5' overlap. We also measured piRNA biogenesis by determining ping-pong pair density. This measure was obtained by counting all non-redundant ping-pong pairs (counting each read only once) per kb.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Genetic analysis of genomic regions from strain 160 that maternally protect against dysgenesis</title><p>To identify regions of the 160 genome that protect against dysgenesis when present in females, an F3 mapping/QTL experiment was performed. F3 females were generated by crossing 160 females to strain 9 males (a non-dysgenic cross), followed by two rounds of backcrossing to strain 9 males. This resulted in the production of F3 mothers for which strain 160 was the great-grandmother. All but the final cross was performed <italic>en masse</italic>. Dysgenic crosses were performed with &#x0003e;160 single 4 to 5 day old tester F3 females mated with three 4 to 5 day old strain 160 males. Adults were transferred to new vials daily and dysgenesis was estimated by counting the number of dysgenic testes in progeny over all testes counted (2 per male) across three broods. Females were then collected, ovaries removed (for small RNA sequencing by Fasteris, top protectors only) and carcasses retained for genomic DNA extraction. Genotyping was performed using the TaqMan Open Array platform on all females, with the exception of the top six females that had the strongest ability to protect against dysgenesis. SNPs distinguishing 160 and 9 chromosomes were chosen in pairs for redundancy, one pair at each telomere and pericentric region, as well as one or two euchromatic SNPs. Care was taken to avoid repeat sequences by screening with Blast against the reference and also using RepeatMasker. F3 Females were then genotyped for 160/9 heterozygosity, alongside pure strain 9 and 160 controls, by National Jewish Health. Single marker regression was carried out with RQTL after dropping individuals with missing genotype data from the analysis. 5000 permutations were done to find the significance threshold at alpha = 0.05. For the top 6 protectors, whole genome sequencing was performed (100 bp, paired-end) using the Nextera library prep protocol.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Genotyping by whole genome sequencing</title><p>Reference genome scaffolds from <italic>D</italic>. <italic>virilis</italic> were concatenated according to their supported positions and orientations on known Muller elements, with a large scaffold arbitrarily generated by concatenating scaffolds from unknown positions.

A pseudo-diploid heterozygous genome was then assembled by placing these scaffolds into one file.</p><p>Paired-end reads from the top six protectors were mapped to the hybrid genome, using BWA&#x02019;s default parameters, with the goal of inferring spans of heterozygosity for strain 160 by identifying reads that map uniquely, under high stringency, to the strain 160 haploid reference. The mapping output was piped into SAMtools for filtering by quality score (-q 42) and post-alignment processing (SAM to BAM conversion and indexing). A relatively high cutoff quality score was used in order to remove reads that could have mapped promiscuously. We were able to remove all reads that mapped to more than one locus/allele leaving us with reads that are specific to either strain 9 or 160. Spans of heterozygosity for strain 160 were visualized with a sliding window for read density along the 160 chromosomes within the psuedo-diploid reference genome.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Chromatin immunopreciptiation sequencing</title><p>Chromatin isolation and immunoprecipitation was performed using 200 pairs of ovaries from strain 9 and strain 160 according to the protocol described in Du and Elgin [<xref rid="pgen.1005332.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed using anti-H3K9me2 (Abcam 1220) at 1:100. Input and IP DNA was used for SR50-bp Illumina sequencing.
