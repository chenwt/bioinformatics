However, this resource has underperformed in its ability to effectively identify novel therapeutics and evaluate the heterogeneity in a patient's tumor. The patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model retains the heterogeneity of patient tumors, allowing a means to not only examine efficacy of a therapy, but also basic tenets of cancer biology in response to treatment. Herein we describe the development and characterization of an ovarian-PDX model in order to study the development of chemoresistance. We demonstrate that PDX tumors are not simply composed of tumor-initiating cells, but recapitulate the original tumor's heterogeneity, oncogene expression profiles, and clinical response to chemotherapy. Combined carboplatin/paclitaxel treatment of PDX tumors enriches the cancer stem cell populations, but persistent tumors are not entirely composed of these populations. RNA-Seq analysis of six pair of treated PDX tumors compared to untreated tumors demonstrates a consistently contrasting genetic profile after therapy, suggesting similar, but few, pathways are mediating chemoresistance. Pathways and genes identified by this methodology represent novel approaches to targeting the chemoresistant population in ovarian cancer</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ovarian Cancer</kwd><kwd>Patient-derived xenograft</kwd><kwd>cancer stem cells</kwd><kwd>chemoresistance</kwd><kwd>animal models of cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Although most ovarian cancer patients present with advanced-stage disease, response to front-line platinum-based chemotherapy is high, on the order of 75%. The combination of surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy will allow remission in most patients, and about 40% of advanced stage patients will live at least 5 years [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, absolute cures are uncommon, with 80% of patients eventually having a recurrence [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The clinical profile of high rates of positive responses yet high recurrence rates suggests the presence of a subpopulation of cells within the heterogeneous tumor that survives initial chemotherapy, to lie dormant and eventually regrow with chemoresistant disease. Only by targeting this subpopulation can we achieve durable cures [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Pre-clinical models used in drug discovery have predominately used clonal ovarian cancer cell lines, which cannot account for tumor heterogeneity, and evolve though selective growth and time to become very different from tumors growing in patients. Recently some of the most commonly used ovarian cell lines used were reported to have profiles more like endometrioid than papillary serous carcinoma, as defined by TCGA expression profiling[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Studying tumors preclinically that more closely resemble human tumors may increase the likelihood that medications effective in preclinical studies are effective in clinical trials. The patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, whereby tumors are collected from patients and immediately implanted into mice, has recently been characterized and may allow such an advantage[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>We set out to further characterize the PDX model and determine whether the heterogeneity seen in ovarian cancer is recapitulated, in order to explore the cell populations responsible for chemoresistance. One potential subpopulation with chemotherapy resistance is the cancer stem cell (CSC) population. CSC's have been shown to have increased tumorigenicity in mice, chemotherapy resistance, and are enriched in recurrent ovarian cancer [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In developing and characterizing the PDX model our goals were to 1) optimize methods to allow a high success rate of implantation, 2) examine retention of heterogeneity, 3) determine if PDX tumors respond to chemotherapy similarly to patient tumors, 4) assess whether treatment with chemotherapy results in survival of just CSC populations, and 5) identify pathways that are amplified in resistant tumors. We demonstrate that the PDX model can be established with a high success rate, have similar expression profiles and biologic activities as patient tumors, and can be used as a model to identify the chemoresistant population.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Implantation success rate and establishment of the ovarian PDX model</title><p>Here we report outcomes on the first 34 patient samples implanted into SCID mice.

identify the best location for growth. Subcutaneous (SQ) and mammary fat pat (MFP) sites were tested as their location allows for tumor growth to be monitored with caliper-measurements. Intraperitoneal (IP) injection was examined, to provide an orthotopic location for model establishment. The subrenal capsule (SRC) was evaluated given previous reports of high take rates in this site [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Implantation for all 4 sites was conducted as described in the methods. Therefore both site and method of processing were controlled for each patient. The rates for PDX tumor development in each site, including individual implants are presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>. In the first 34 patients, a PDX line was established in 85.3% of SQ implants. This is compared to 63.64% in the MFP, 22.2% IP, and 8.3% in the SRC. SQ xenografts almost always visually disappeared in the weeks after implantation before regrowing and being detectable at a mean of 78.4 days after implantation (range 17-174 days, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) compared to 77.3 days for the MFP (range 29 to 129 days, NS). The success of a PDX being established is highest in the SQ site in part due to the increased number of implants per patient. Based on this data, and subsequent studies showing similar expression profiles in tumors from the SQ site and original patient tumors (described below), continued development of the PDX model was done in the SQ site. PDX tumors were examined for histologic characteristics by a gynecologic pathologist. In all cases and in up to six generations of reimplantation, the original histology was maintained (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Interestingly, in the few cases where a mixed epithelial-type ovarian cancer was implanted, both histologies were present in each of the subsequent PDX generations.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Take rates of different sites for implantation and maintenance PDX histology</title><p>(A) Tumors were implanted subcutaneously (SQ), in the mammary fat pad (MFP), intraperitoneal (IP), or sub-renal capsule. The success of implantation was similar comparing SQ to MFP, however more PDX lines were established from SQ implant due to number of implants.

However, a growing body of evidence suggests that certain cell subpopulations have enhanced ability to initiate tumors, often termed tumor-initiating cells (TIC's) or sometimes CSC's if additional attributes are demonstrated [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We examined whether resulting PDX tumors maintained tumor heterogeneity from a tumor-initiating cell standpoint. PDX tumors and original patient tumors were subjected to IHC for the TIC markers ALDH1A1 [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], CD133 [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and CD44 [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For ALDH1A1, CD44, and CD133, the patient samples averaged expression of 19.95%, 5.56%, and 3.27% respectively. The PDX tumors had similar expression of ALDH1A1 and CD133 at 17.4%, and 7.1% respectively (p=0.80 and 0.49, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). There was a significant change in expression of CD44, but it was actually a decrease, from 5.54% to 2.36% (p=0.014). If TICs in ovarian cancer are indeed the cells mediating xenograft formation, these data suggest that they subsequently differentiate into marker-positive and -negative cells and recapitulate tumor heterogeneity, in keeping with the CSC hypothesis[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Related to heterogeneity, the human/murine component of PDX tumor would have implications to the biologic relevance of this model. IHC for human HLA antigen was conducted to identify the species-specific composition of the PDX tumor. Interestingly, all stromal cells in the PDX tumors were of murine origin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). This was consistent across 100% of the tumor specimen, and in all of the first 15 PDX tumors established.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Establishment of the PDX line does not enrich for the tumorigenic cell population and human stroma is replaced in the implanted PDX</title><p>(A) Representative staining for ALDH1A1, CD133, and CD44 on the patient sample and untreated PDX.

Weroha <italic>et al</italic> have previously demonstrated similar amplification and deletion patterns between PDX and patient tumors using aCGH [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To characterize whether expression of key oncogenes are similarly expressed in PDX tumors, an RT<sup>2</sup> PCR array on four pair of patient samples and matched PDX tumors was used. This array quantifies mRNA levels of 84 genes that are recognized targetable oncogenes[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. There was a strong correlation of expression in 79 of the cancer drug targets, with an overall R<sup>2</sup>-value of .744 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This correlation was also present in individual samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). The five genes that exhibited the poorest correlation had expression in the patient with near-zero mRNA expression in the PDX. These genes were platelet-derived growth factor receptor, alpha and beta polypeptide (PDGFRA, PDGFRB) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor one, two, and three (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGF3). These genes were expected to be decreased in the PDX tumor, since they are produced by the host, and the primers are human-specific. Therefore, there is strong consistency in expression of targetable oncogenes intrinsic to malignant cells, despite the fact that these tumors are growing in the subcutaneous compartment. In addition, we profiled the genetic difference of oncogene expression using the RT<sup>2</sup> PCR array comparing PDX tumors from the IP location versus the SQ implant. There was a strong correlation of expression among the 84 genes in the oncogene drug target array, with an overall R<sup>2</sup>-value of .8895 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This indicates that the SQ tumor has similar expression to a tumor growing in the orthotopic location.</p><p>While expression at the single-gene level is important, biologic similarity regarding response to treatment is equally important. Mice with measurable tumors from 19 PDX models were treated with IP carboplatin (90 mg/kg/week) and paclitaxel (20 mg/kg/week) in combination for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, percent-reduction in tumor volume was calculated and compared to the patient's response to therapy, categorized as complete (CR, no evidence of disease at completion of 6 cycles of primary chemotherapy) or partial (PR, residual disease present at completion of 6 cycles of primary therapy). Patients that had a CR to therapy had an average reduction in volume of 63.73% (range 95.04% to 24.87%) compared to an average reduction of just 1.53% (range 57.77% reduction to 107.9% increase) in patients that had a PR (p = 0.0009, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). There was also a differential, but not significant, response between patients who had an optimal or suboptimal tumor reductive surgery (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). While not definitive, this suggests that patients presenting with disease unable to be optimally debulked are more aggressive and resistant to chemotherapy.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Cancer drug targets are maintained in the PDX line and the PDX response to treatment correlates to the patient's response to primary chemotherapy</title><p>(A) The SABiociences RT<sup>2</sup> qPCR array for cancer drug targets was run on the patient's tumor and their matched untreated PDX tumor.

Ki-67 was examined to measure proliferation, and was not significantly different in untreated PDX tumors compared to the original patient tumor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>,B). However, treated tumors had significant decrease in Ki-67 positivity (33.6% compared to 64.9% in untreated tumors p=0.0013). Examining the trend of each tumor individually (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), two pair actually showed an increase in Ki-67, one of which had a 107% increase in tumor size on therapy, but the other with a 70.9% reduction.

Across all six pairs, 299 genes were found to be significantly differentially expressed in the treated PDX samples compared to untreated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), 137 of which have known roles in cancer.

Four of the samples clustered together, and the remaining two were separated in the 3D space. All the treated samples showed a shift in the same direction away from their untreated PDX pair (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This indicates that while the majority of genes are similar before and after treatment, all six tumors were affected similarly by therapy.

Ovarian PDX tumors form at a high rate when placed in the subcutaneous location. Growing tumors recapitulate the heterogeneity of the original patient tumor, and are not composed of just TICs, though the stromal component is murine. The PDX tumors have similar oncogene expression as the patient tumor, and respond to chemotherapy in a similar manner as the patients from which they were harvested. These similarities make the PDX model an attractive platform for pre-clinical testing of therapies that will hopefully correlate with a clinical response better than noted in cell lines. Finally, using this model has allowed identification of pathways mediating survival after chemotherapy that are attractive targets for future study.</p><p>In most malignancies, preclinical studies have primarily utilized cell lines to assess novel therapies and biologic processes. Cell lines are still ideal for carefully controlled studies on mechanisms and pathways. However, in terms of translating results to the clinic, these models have underperformed [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The clonal nature of cell lines limits the ability to study both intratumoral and interpatient heterogeneity [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, new genomic studies indicate that commonly-used ovarian cancer cell lines do not accurately represent high-grade serous ovarian cancers when compared to profiling performed on the TCGA dataset[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> ].</p><p>Development of PDX models have been demonstrated in a few malignancies, including ovarian, colorectal, medulloblastoma, pancreatic, breast, and non-small cell lung cancers [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and have consistently been found to be similar to patient samples. One well-established program in pediatric malignancies has demonstrated prediction of response in the clinic is higher when the PDX model is used [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, there are drawbacks to the model. The time for PDX tumors to grow is variable, but usually on the order of months, making experiments slow and expensive. Historically, rates for success of PDX establishment have been low, with the most successful models having 37% establishment rate [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], until Weroha's recent report of 74% overall success in ovarian cancer[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In this study, we had 85.29% success rate of establishing a PDX in the first 34 patients we implanted in the SQ. We believe the higher success rate is due to several factors. Given similar success of Weroha's report, this may be disease-specific. Strong working relationships with clinicians and pathologists allow for implantation within one hour of removal. We used two different processing methods that could be directly compared - one where solid tumors were implanted (SQ and SRC), and one where tumors were dissociated (MFP and IP). With both methods, the take rate was more dependent on the site implanted than the processing method. A crucial factor is the starting material. Other groups have reported that higher engraftment rates are associated with more aggressive tumors [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Instead of using the primary tumor from the ovary, we have implanted omental or peritoneal metastatic implants. The reasons for this are both biologic and practical. From a practical standpoint, omental implants are easily distinguished from normal tissue, reducing the risk of implanting normal tissue. A portion of &#x0201c;tumor&#x0201d; taken from the ovary, a complex tissue with normal solid components, may more likely be misinterpreted grossly as tumor, when in fact was benign. Because the omentum is well-vascularized, tumors are very &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d;, giving additional confidence that the portion implanted is not necrotic. Finally, it has been demonstrated that other factors produced in the omental microenvironment are pro-tumorigenic, and are likely implanted with these tumors[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The biologic rationale for using metastatic implants is that these sites are more relevant to the portions of tumors that recur. Therefore it may be more clinically relevant to characterize the metastatic site.</p><p>The site of implantation is an important consideration as there are benefits and drawbacks from using an orthotopic or heterotopic site. Heterotopic locations allows for easier monitoring of the tumor while orthotopic preserves the appropriate microenvironment [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, in developing this model, use of the intraperitoneal orthotopic location had practical limitations of lower engraftment rates and difficulty in assessment of growth. In several instances mice become moribund with ascites before there was appreciable tumor volume, even when following with micro-CT imaging. This limits the ability to measure response to a therapy, and provides less tissue for analysis and propagation into the next generation of PDX. However, the Weroha study demonstrated an ability for high take rate using the intraperitoneal injection with large volumes of tumor-cells [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Like our study, their mice also demonstrated development of ascites but by using ultrasound, were able to more accurately follow tumor progression then using a micro-CT. By using the heterotopic location, tumor growth can be easily monitored for establishment, growth, and response to therapy [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, biologic relevance has to be demonstrated. With our findings that subcutaneous tumors have similar oncogene expression profiles to patient tumors and the orthotopic intraperitoneal PDX tumors, and respond to chemotherapy similarly, the subcutaneous model appears relevant. This information helps alleviate the primary concern of not using the orthotopic location and provides a mechanism for decreasing the technical complexity of establishing and using a PDX model. While in our hands, not enough intraperitoneal tumors developed to evaluate their correlation to the clinical response, based on our oncogene data comparing SQ and IP tumors and the Weroha study, it appears both models are equivalent. Not enough intraperitoneal tumors developed to demonstrate whether they would be equivalent, or superior, to the subcutaneous model. While previous groups have reported a high rate of success using the subrenal-capsule for tumor establishment [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], we did not see these successes. The ultimate proof of the importance of location in the PDX model will require testing numerous compounds, and relating the response in PDX tumors to responses in patients. PDX models in other malignancies have demonstrated a similar response rate between mice and the corresponding clinical trial [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>-<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Such studies in ovarian cancer are ongoing. But our analysis of the oncogene expression profiles, and their consistent similarity to patient tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), suggest that differences in targetable oncogenes between orthotopic PDX tumors and patient tumors are minimal.</p><p>We also demonstrate that the ovarian PDX model maintains the heterogeneity of the original patient tumor, at least from a TIC standpoint. Studies of CSC and TIC populations have shown that some cells are more capable of forming xenograft tumors than other[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our analysis of density of ALDH1A1, CD44, and CD133 cells, the most consistent markers of TICs in ovarian cancer, demonstrates that PDX tumors are not only composed of these subpopulations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). It is possible that these subpopulations are the drivers of tumor formation, but as they grow they produce differentiated tumors with both CSC and non-CSC populations. This in fact would be predicted by the CSC model.</p><p>Potential limitations to the PDX model in ovarian cancer have been identified through our analysis. We saw that of 84 oncogenes examined, 5 were under-expressed in PDX tumors: receptors for platelet-derived growth factors and VEGF receptors. The fact that all members of these receptor families strengthens the validity of the association. Analysis of the species making up tumor stroma showed it to be composed purely of murine origin. The reduced content of human stromal genes is expected [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] as a result of the replacement of the human stroma with mouse stromal cells after implantation. Prior reports in pancreatic cancer have suggested that human stromal cells are maintained for several generations[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], although Weroha <italic>et al</italic> also found that IP ovarian PDX tumors had murine stroma. Whether murine stroma impacts the validity of the model will depend on the specific agent and pathway targeted.</p><p>The heterogeneity demonstrated in ovarian PDX tumors makes it uniquely positioned to investigate the key clinical problem of chemoresistance and recurrence. Ovarian cancer has a high rate of response to primary chemotherapy followed by an equally high rate of recurrence. One hypothesis is that this population is the same as the tumorigenic CSC population. While we have seen an increase in CSC density in the treated PDX tumors, and previously in treated patients[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the persistent/recurrent tumors were by no means completely composed of these populations. Either the CSC populations had already begun to give rise to repopulating daughter cells negative for the CSC marker, or (more likely) other chemoresistant populations exist that cannot be identified by ALDH1A1, CD44, or CD133 alone. Going beyond CSCs, we have shown that surviving tumors have more cells in dormancy, decreasing from a baseline of 65% to 34%. RNA-seq analysis resulted in 299 genes being significantly different between the treated and untreated tumors with principal component analysis indicating that the changes in gene expression represent a small subset of the entire genetic makeup of the tumor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Most remarkable and encouraging is that the changes were similar in all pairs tested, providing hope that there may be common pathways to be targeted in most patients. One of the top up-regulated genes was ABCG1 (BCRP1), a member of the White family of ATP-Binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Expression of ABCG1 has been shown to identify a side population of cancer cells that demonstrate CSC properties and chemoresistance [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Interestingly, one of the top activated pathways identified by IPA Ingenuity pathway analysis was Sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling. This pathway has been shown to protect oocytes from apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Taken together, the enrichment of CSC markers in the treated population, decrease in cell proliferation, and increase in genes and signaling pathways predicted to play a role in chemoresistance, it appears that treatment of the ovarian PDX results in the survival of a cell population that is chemoresistant to primary therapy. The global analysis by RNAseq provides a snapshot of possible pathways that are responsible for the development of chemoresistance. These will be important targets for therapy in future studies. With the development of an ovarian PDX model that recapitulates the clinical response and the heterogeneity of ovarian cancer, investigators are positioned to more effectively evaluate novel therapeutics and use the model to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance. Hopefully targeting these pathways will sensitize cells to chemotherapy and lead to more durable cures.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Development of an ovarian PDX model to study <italic>de novo</italic> chemotherapy resistance provides a unique use of the xenograft model beyond testing pre-clinical compounds, allowing for possible novel understandings of tumoral responses to therapy that may lead to new strategies for targeting the residual survival population after primary therapy. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s5"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s5_1"><title>Collection and Implantation of tumor specimens</title><p>Under IRB and IACUC approval, patients with suspected ovarian cancer that were being treated by the Division of Gynecologic Oncology at UAB were consented for this study.

For RNA-seq, total RNA quality was assessed and the rRNA depleted and concentrated. The RNA-Seq libraries were prepared, validated and quantified. The raw fastq files were aligned to human genome hg19 of a local instance of Partek Flow software package (Saint Louis, MO). Pre-alignment was conducted to determine if trimming is needed based on reads quality score. Aligner STAR was used for best recovery[<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The BAM files were loaded into Partek Genomics Suite 6.6 (Saint Louis, MO) for further analysis [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM)-normalized reads were calculated and the expression levels of genes were estimated [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Additional filter was applied to exclude genes of low expression. The differential expressions were determined by using paired t-test [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Further functional analysis was conducted by using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Redwood City, CA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL, TABLE AND
