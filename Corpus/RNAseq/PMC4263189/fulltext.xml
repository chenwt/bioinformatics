Here, we show that negative elongation factor (NELF) interacts with Integrator complex subunits (INTScom), RNAPII and Spt5. The interaction between NELF and INTScom subunits is RNA and DNA independent. Using both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 promoter and genome-wide analyses, we demonstrate that Integrator subunits specifically control NELF-mediated RNAPII pause/release at coding genes. The strength of RNAPII pausing is determined by the nature of the NELF-associated INTScom subunits. Interestingly, in addition to controlling RNAPII pause-release INTS11 catalytic subunit of the INTScom is required for RNAPII processivity. Finally, INTScom target genes are enriched in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transactivation response element/NELF binding element and in a 3' box sequence required for small nuclear RNA biogenesis. Revealing these unexpected functions of INTScom in regulating RNAPII pause-release and completion of mRNA synthesis of NELF-target genes will contribute to our understanding of the gene expression cycle.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms6531-i1.jpg"/>RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) pausing at transcriptional start sites is an important element of gene transcription regulation.

RNAPII pausing and elongation shortly after initiation is controlled through the action of negative and positive transcription elongation factors such as NTEF and P-TEFb, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. NTEF consists of the negative elongation factor (NELF), a protein complex composed of four subunits (A, B, C/D and E) and the DRB (5,6-dichloro-1&#x003b2;-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole)-sensitivity-inducing factor DSIF, which is a heterodimer, composed of Spt4 and Spt5 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). NELF and DSIF cooperatively establish RNAPII promoter-proximal pausing at least by binding to initiated RNAPII and possibly to the nascent transcript<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In order to overcome RNAPII pausing and to enter transcription elongation, P-TEFb is recruited to promoter-proximal region and phosphorylates NELF and Spt5 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Phosphorylated NELF dissociates from RNAPII while phosphorylation of Spt5 switches its activity from negative to positive elongation factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Additionally, P-TEFb phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNAPII largest subunit (RPB1) to ensure productive elongation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. RNAPII CTD, which consists of multiple heptad repeats of the consensus sequence YSPTSPS that can be phosphorylated at several sites, serves as a platform for the binding of factors required for the expression of RNAPII-transcribed genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Indeed, for protein coding genes P-TEFb-mediated phosphorylation of CTD at Serine 2 (Ser2) has been shown to have a key role in RNAPII pause-release and in coordinating/coupling transcription elongation to RNA processing, including splicing, 3'end processing and termination of transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Phosphorylation of RNAPII CTD at Ser7 mediates the recruitment of Integrator complex (Integrator complex subunits (INTScom)), a ~14 subunit complex, to the promoter of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes to activate transcription and direct 3' end processing of the transcripts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>A role for DSIF and NELF in inducing paused polymerase has been well established<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. However, the reversal of RNAPII pausing does not always lead to the overexpression of target genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Indeed, NELF-depletion has only a limited effect on gene expression, possibly because NELF intrinsically has a limited effect on gene expression and/or because mRNA synthesis is a complex process involving multiple rate limiting steps which requires additional factors. Additionally, the strength of RNAPII pausing varies among genes. Thus, much remains to be learned about how the efficiency of RNAPII pausing and elongation is regulated at the mechanistic and biochemical level. In this study, we reveal a physical and functional link between NELF and INTScom. We show that INTScom is associated with TSS of NELF-target genes and that it regulates NELF-mediated RNAPII pausing. Interestingly, INTScom is also required for the production of mature mRNA from its target genes. Our study reveals an unexpected function of INTScom in regulating RNAPII pausing and processivity at coding genes.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>NELF interacts with the integrator complex subunits</title><p>To gain more insight into NELF-mediated RNAPII pausing we immunopurified (IP) NELF and its associated partners from HeLa nuclear extracts. Dignam nuclear extracts prepared from control and Flag-HA-tagged NELF-E subunit (eNELF-E) expressing cells were subjected to tandem affinity chromatography as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Flag-HA IPed materials were run on SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS&#x02013;PAGE) and proteins were visualised by silver staining and identified by mass spectrometry (MS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset 1</xref>). Major MS-identified eNELF-E nuclear partners are the core subunits of the NELF complex (A, B, C/D). As previously reported, both Spt5 and subunits of RNAPII were recovered<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Interestingly, MS identified all subunits of the Integrator complex (INTScom) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We first confirmed the interaction between INTScom subunits and NELF-E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). As negative controls, subunits of the NURD and INO80 complexes were absent in eNELF-E immunopurified materials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). Interestingly, we found that RPB1 associated with eNELF-E is phosphorylated on Ser7 but not on Serine 2 or Ser5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). We next asked whether the interaction between NELF and INTScom subunits is mediated through nucleic acids or by protein&#x02013;protein interactions. For this purpose, nuclear extracts were treated with either RNase or DNase and Ethidium bromide prior IP using anti-Flag antibody. The presence of INTS3 and INTS11 subunits in IPed material was assessed by western blotting. We found that NELF/INTScom interaction is independent of RNA and DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>). As positive control, RNase treatment resulted in reduced interaction between CyclinT1, CDK9 and HEXIM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1C</xref>). Thus, and in agreement with the recent finding by Yamaguchi and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, NELF/INTScom interaction is mediated through protein&#x02013;protein interaction. To test whether NELF, INTScom, Spt5 and RPB1 associate in a single complex, glycerol gradient sedimentation of Flag-purified eNELF-E was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The presence of eNELF-E-interacting proteins in the collected fractions was analysed by western blot. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> shows a major peak containing NELF and the INTS3 subunit (fraction 4) and a second peak containing NELF, INTScom and RPB1 (Fraction 16). To further characterise NELF-associated proteins, Flag IPed NELF-E was subjected to second IPs (ReIP) using anti-Spt5, anti-INTS13 and anti-HA antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, a small fraction of subunits of the INTScom, NELF-A, NELF-E, Spt5 and RPB1 were present in ReIP using anti-Spt5 and anti-INTS13 antibodies suggesting that a fraction of NELF associates with INTScom, possibly as part of a RNAPII complex on the gene. Altogether, these experiments suggest that NELF interacts with INTScom and with INTS3 independently of other INSTcom subunits.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>INTScom regulates RNAPII pausing and processivity at the HIV-1 LTR</title><p>INTScom is a large multisubunit complex known to associate with the CTD of RPB1 and to catalyse the endonucleolytic cleavage of nascent snRNAs near their 3' ends<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. To explore a role for the INTScom in NELF-mediated RNAPII pausing at protein coding genes, we used the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) promoter. Transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) leads to RNAPII pausing and premature termination after synthesis of a short RNA, the transactivation response element (TAR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. We first asked whether INTScom subunits, like NELF associate with the viral LTR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using chromatin prepared from HeLa cells containing a single copy of an integrated LTR-<italic>luciferase</italic> reporter gene (HeLaLTR-<italic>luc</italic>) and the indicated antibodies. INTScom subunits accumulate where expected on U2 snRNA chromatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). As expected, NELF and RNAPII were found at the promoter-proximal region (TAR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>) of the integrated LTR-<italic>luc</italic> reporter construct. Like NELF and RNAPII, INTS3, INTS11 and INTS13 associate with the TAR region and were absent from the 5'upstream region and the 3' end of the luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). This experiment shows that INTScom subunits associate with the promoter-proximal region of the HIV-1 LTR. We next analysed the role of Integrator subunits in regulating transcription from the viral LTR by nuclear run-on assay (NRO). HeLaLTR-<italic>luc</italic> were transfected with siRNA specific for INTS3, INTS9 or INTS11. Non-targeting scrambled (SCR) siRNA, NELF-E or Spt5-specific siRNAs were used as controls (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref> for knockdown efficiency). Treatment of SCR-transfected cells with the viral transactivator Tat was used as positive control. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref> (upper panel), knockdown of NELF-E, but not Spt5, results in transcriptional activation of the reporter construct. Knockdown of INTS3, like that of Spt5, resulted in no obvious transcription phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, upper panel). Interestingly, knockdown of the catalytic INTS11 subunit and its regulatory subunit INTS9 results in a dramatic transcriptional activation of the viral LTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, lower panel). However, and in contrast to transcriptional activation by the viral transactivator Tat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, lower panel), such increase in transcription was largely observed up to the middle of the reporter construct and highly limited at the 3' end of the reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, lower panel). Consistently, the RNAPII processivity index was five times lower in INTS11 and INTS9 knockdown cells as compared to cells knocked down for NELF-E or treated with Tat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In addition, a correlation between transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>) of the reporter construct and luciferase assay is observed in Tat and siNELF-E treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Only a 4&#x02013;6-fold induction of luciferase activity is observed in siINTS11 and siINTS9-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>) contrasting with their strong impact on transcriptional activation. Consistently, when the LTR-<italic>luc</italic> reporter mRNA (polyadenylated) was quantified by reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR, we observed a modest increase of the reporter mRNA in INTS11-KD cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3D</xref>). Of note, in this assay knockdown of INTS11 had no effect on TAR region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3D</xref>) suggesting a role of INTS11 in regulating transcription elongation at the viral promoter. Taken together, our results revealed an unexpected dual function of the INTScom in regulating RNAPII pausing and processivity at the HIV-1 promoter.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>INTScom dictates the strength of NELF-mediated RNAPII pausing</title><p>We next asked whether the function of the INTScom in regulating RNAPII pausing at the HIV-1 promoter also applies to cellular coding genes. Supporting this idea, microarray analyses showed that INTS3 and INTS11depletion (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4A</xref> for knockdown efficiency) from HeLa cells led to changes in the expression of thousands of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset 2a&#x02013;d</xref>). The impact on gene expression could not be attributed to the loss of U1 or U2 snRNA, since no significant changes in their expression were observed within the time frame of these experiments (data not shown) or to an effect on cell cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4B</xref>). Interestingly, a majority of these genes (2,164 genes) were commonly identified as differentially expressed (DE) upon depletion of NELF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset 2a</xref>). Such significant overlap (<italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;1e&#x02212;300) highlighted a novel possible function of INTScom subunits in co-regulating NELF-dependent coding genes.</p><p>To further investigate whether this involves a direct role of INTScom subunits, ChIP coupled to high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) was performed using antibodies specific for NELF-E, Spt5, INTS3, INTS11 and H3K4me3. The identified ChIP-Seq peaks of INTS11, like NELF-E, preferentially localised close to the TSSs of coding genes (+/&#x02212; 250&#x02009;bp) and INTS3 showed similar distributions to Spt5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset 3</xref>). Heat maps of the ChIP-Seq reads organised by ranking of genes according to NELF-E levels showed a tight correlation between its binding and the binding of INTScom subunits near TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), as confirmed by analysis of the averaged distribution of their ChIP-Seq peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5C,D</xref>). Moreover, intersection analyses of ChIP-Seq data showed that the binding sites of INTS3 and INTS11 tightly overlapped with that of NELF and Spt5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>; <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c;1e&#x02212;300). INTS11 binding sites were found provided INTS3 was also bound with very few exceptions (16 genes). Accordingly, clustering analyses recapitulated the tight correlations found amongst NELF/Spt5, RNAPII pausing and INTScom subunits with respect to their individual binding intensities to each TSS, at genome-wide levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). As such our results highlight that the recruitment of INTScom to TSS is correlated to the presence of NELF-Spt5. Finally, direct targets bound by INTS3/11 and NELF-E/Spt5 were highly enriched among the differentially regulated genes upon INTS-3/11 depletion in microarray analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;1e&#x02212;12; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset 2a&#x02013;d</xref>), showing a direct function of INTScom subunits in co-regulating the expression of protein coding genes together with NELF/Spt5.</p><p>Taken together, our data raised the hypothesis that INTScom subunits impact the expression of their direct target genes through the regulation of NELF-mediated RNAPII pausing. In support of this hypothesis, inspection of averaged RNAPII ChIP-Seq profiles over TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>) and calculation of the &#x02018;pausing index&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>) showed that the presence of INTS11 and/or INTS3 correlates to RNAPII accumulation around the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>) and NELF/Spt5-mediated RNAPII pausing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Indeed, genes containing NELF, Spt5 and INTS3 show lower RNAPII occupancy around the TSS and a lower pausing index as compared with genes bound by NELF, Spt5, INTS3 and INTS11 or to genes containing NELF and Spt5 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e&#x02013;f</xref>; <italic>P</italic>-value ~1e&#x02212;6 and &#x02212;14, respectively). The correlation of INTS3 and INTS11 on RNAPII pausing was most significant in the context of paused genes that are bound by NELF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>, compare box 1 with boxes 2 and 3, or 4 with 5 and 6, respectively). Such analysis also suggested that INTS3 and INTS11 may have opposite effects on NELF-mediated RNAPII pausing or elongation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7A</xref>). Of note, calculation of the pausing index confirmed the highly specific correlation between NELF binding and RNAPII pausing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7B</xref>), validating our analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><p>To further assess how INTS3/11 may influence RNAPII occupancy, ChIP-Seq analyses of RNAPII were performed upon depletion of either subunit (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7C</xref> for knockdown efficiency). INTS11 depletion increased RNAPII occupancy over gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), that is, the number of ChIP-Seq reads found in gene bodies (see Methods). Such increase in reads was specific for direct targets whose promoters were bound by NELF and INTS3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, upper panel; compare boxes 1 and 2 with 6 and 7; <italic>P</italic>-values of 1e&#x02212;23 and 1, respectively). In stark contrast, INTS3-depletion led to the opposite effect, namely the decrease of RNAPII occupancy over NELF-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, lower panel, <italic>P</italic>~1e&#x02212;6 and 1, respectively). Further normalisation of ChIP-Seq reads in gene bodies by reads over TSSs showed a specific decrease of RNAPII occupancy for the subset of genes that are bound by INTScom subunits and NELF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Such decrease was detected for the genes that were up-regulated upon INTS11-KD and NELF-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p><p>We next asked whether the impact of INTS11 on RNAPII occupancy might in turn affect RNA levels over its target genes. Inspection of the averaged profile of strand-specific RNASeq (+) reads showed a significant increase along the bodies of up-regulated genes upon INTS11-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>; <italic>P</italic>~1e&#x02212;12; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7d</xref>; left box plot and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset 4</xref>).

Such &#x02018;HIV-like&#x02019; phenotype was highly enriched among &#x02018;direct targets&#x02019; (genes bound by NELF, Spt5, INTS3 and INTS11) corresponding to a total of 859 genes. Approximately half of these genes (432 genes; <italic>P</italic>~1e&#x02212;191) were further down-regulated upon INTS3-KD in complete agreement with the antagonistic effect of INTS3 and INTS11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). Thus, similarly to the HIV promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), these results support a role of INTScom in regulating RNA processing at coding genes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>INTScom target genes are enriched in hNBE and 3'box sequences</title><p>We next analysed whether the INTScom regulated coding genes share some sequence determinants. Systematic motif search from the ChIP-Seq peaks of NELF or INTScom subunits INTS11/3 showed that the binding of INTS11 tightly correlated with that of NELF independently of the subsets of promoters analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>).

This is in complete agreement with our genome-wide analyses showing that INTScom is preferentially recruited to NELF-target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>). Of interest, TSSs of cellular genes up-regulated upon INTS11-KD were specifically enriched in the HIV-1 TAR/loop motif recently identified as the human NELF Binding Element (&#x02018;hNBE&#x02019;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref> &#x02018;CUGGGA&#x02019; and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset 5</xref>). Accordingly, TSSs harbouring such a motif were highly enriched in the group of genes that were up-regulated upon INTS11-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>, <italic>P</italic>-value~1e&#x02212;48; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>), by contrast to down-regulated genes. Our data shows that hNBE/TAR motif is a marker for INTS11 target genes, reinforcing the functional link between INTS11 and NELF in regulating RNAPII pausing at coding genes.</p><p>Inspection of RNAPII profiles over the termination sites of the 859 &#x02018;direct targets&#x02019; of INTS11 (up-regulated genes upon INTS11-KD and with INTScom/NELF peaks in their promoters) showed that they harboured a RNAPII peak within the last 500&#x02009;bp before termination sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>; see red plot). By contrast, such termination site-associated (&#x02018;TESA&#x02019;) RNAPII peak was not detected near the termination sites of down-regulated or control genes upon INTS11-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>; see black plot). Interestingly, the TESA RNAPII peak was also detected for the thousands of promoters bound by INTScom provided that the hNBE/TAR motif was also present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>; compare left and right plots, black curves). In complete agreement, the promoters of up-regulated genes are specifically enriched in hNBE/TAR motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Also, INTS11-KD decreased significantly the averaged RNAPII levels in the region corresponding to the TESA peak, as compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, compare green and black curves; <italic>P</italic>-values +/&#x02212; TAR:~1e&#x02212;48 and 1e&#x02212;3, respectively). Therefore, our data support the view that similar to HIV promoter, presence of an hNBE/TAR close to paused sites may be prone to INTScom-mediated control of RNA processing.</p><p>INTScom-mediated U2/snRNA processing depends on the presence of a 3' box (&#x02018;AAAAACAGACC&#x02019;) upstream of the termination site<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Importantly, we found a 3' box close to termination sites (&#x0003c;1,500&#x02009;bp) in more than 1,200 coding genes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset 5</xref>). Also, nearly 40% of the genes bound by INTScom and NELF also contained such 3' box near their termination sites (834/2,127). Of the INTScom target genes, only those also harbouring this 3' box showed a clear TESA RNAPII peak, in stark contrast to those with no 3' box near their termination site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>; compare red and black plots, respectively). As such, these results raised the possibility that, similar to snRNAs, 3'box sequence exacerbates INTScom-mediated RNAPII processivity defects at a subset of its target coding genes. We therefore asked whether INTS11 endonuclease activity plays a role in regulating RNAPII processivity. Complementation experiments were performed using HeLaLTR-luc cells knocked down for INTS11. We found that wild type INTS11, but not INTS11E203Q catalytic mutant, significantly reverted the enhanced luciferase expression after endogenous INTS11-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8C</xref>), suggesting that the endonuclease activity of INTS11 is required for RNAPII pausing and processivity at the HIV-1 promoter.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>INTScom is required for production of mature mRNA</title><p>To extend our results showing that INTScom is required for production of full length transcript from the HIV reporter construct to its target genes, we measured the relative variations of RNASeq reads over termination sites (&#x02212;500 to 0) normalised to gene bodies, for INTS11-depleted cells as compared to control cells. These measures were performed both for total RNAs as well as for mature RNAs pre-selected through polyA+ purification (see Methods). Such analysis showed that INTS11-KD led to a decrease of RNA levels near 3' ends specifically for genes bound by INTScom and NELF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset 6A,B</xref>) as well as for genes harbouring hNBE/TAR motif near their TSSs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8D,E</xref>). Of interest, the decrease in RNA levels at termination sites was not detected using mature RNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8F,G</xref>; compare left and right plots/box plots), supporting a role of INTS11 prior to production of mature polyadenylated RNAs, in complete agreement with our data using HIV reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>Systematic scoring of RNASeq reads near termination sites between INTS11-KD and control, for total RNAs or polyA+ RNAs (see Methods) allowed us to further highlight the role of INTS11 in RNA processivity. The scored defects correspond to genes harbouring decreasing levels of reads near termination sites with respect to reads over gene bodies, similarly to what was found by the NRO. Genes harbouring such defects upon INTS11-KD largely overlap with those showing RNA processivity defects upon NELF-KD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8H</xref>; <italic>P</italic>-value~1e&#x02212;206), reinforcing the functional interaction between NELF and INTScom. Processivity defects are also observed by normalising RNAPII ChIP-Seq reads near termination sites with reads in gene bodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8I</xref>), as detected for the list of down-regulated genes upon INTS11-KD. Of interest, the 3' box was one of the most specific motifs associated with RNA processing defect at the termination sites upon INTS11-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Also, the presence of a 3' box is specifically associated with decreased levels of total RNAs in INTS11-KD as compared with control cells with no significant variations in mature RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>; <italic>P</italic>-value~1e&#x02212;11 and 1e&#x02212;1, respectively). Accordingly, comparison of RNASeq profiles between INTS11-KD and control cells showed that the presence of a 3' box was required to detect a specific decrease in RNA levels over termination sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>; <italic>P</italic>-value~1e&#x02212;105), in stark contrast to what was found for mature RNA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8J</xref>; <italic>P</italic>-value~1). Our data highlighting the INTS11-mediated regulation of RNA levels near termination sites, in the presence of a 3' box, suggest a new role of INTScom in regulating RNA processing of coding genes. Of interest, genes harbouring such processing defects are largely enriched within gene ontologies involved in responses to various stresses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>), supporting the link between INTScom and NELF-mediated RNAPII pausing.</p><p>INTS11-KD also led to an increase of antisense RNASeq &#x02018;&#x02212;&#x02019; reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10A</xref>) as evidenced by strand-specific RNASeq analysis.

Thus, INTScom regulates RNAPII-mediated divergent transcription of coding genes.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study reveals an unexpected function of INTScom in regulating both RNAPII pause-release and processivity of NELF-target genes. Biochemical analyses show that a fraction of NELF associates with INTScom, RNAPII and Spt5. The observed interaction between NELF and INTScom is mediated through protein&#x02013;protein interaction. This is consistent with the recent report showing that, <italic>in vitro</italic>, recombinant NELF produced in bacteria, particularly GST-NELF-A, binds to the recombinant INTScom produced in insect cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In the same study, GST-CTD is shown to interact with recombinant INTScom only when CTD is phosphorylated by P-TEFb. Interestingly, we found that RPB1 associated with NELF/INTScom is phosphorylated on Ser7, suggesting its role in the assembly of the complex. Taken together, both studies (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and our manuscript) converge towards a model where INTScom establishes interactions with both NELF and RPB1. An interesting observation from our biochemical study is the fact that INTS3 is able to interact with NELF and Spt5 in the absence of the other INTScom subunits and RNAPII. This is consistent with previous reports showing that INTS3 can achieve cellular functions independently of other INTScom subunits through interactions with other cellular complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Both biochemical and functional analyses show that the strength of RNAPII pausing mediated by NELF depends on whether the genes are bound by NELF-Spt5, NELF-Spt5-INTScom or NELF-Spt5-INTS3 ranging from highly paused to low-paused genes, respectively.</p><p>An intriguing observation is the opposite activity of INTS3 and INTS11 on NELF-mediated RNAPII pausing. The presence of INTS3 alone correlates with low RNAPII density at the TSS and increased RNAPII in gene bodies. In complete agreement, its depletion reduces RNAPII occupancy over gene bodies. By contrast, INTS11 depletion increases RNAPII occupancy and RNA levels over gene bodies but not over termination sites, resulting in defects in RNAPII processivity and RNA processing. This is in agreement with the recent report showing that INTScom is required for the recruitment of the super elongation complex to ensure a productive transcription elongation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. As such, INTScom subunits may couple the release from NELF-mediated RNAPII pausing to RNA processing. How INTScom is recruited to NELF-target genes is unknown. That NELF, Spt5, INTScom and RNAPII interaction is independent of nucleic acids suggests a direct recruitment as a complex to target genes. However, it is possible that they assemble as a complex at the TSS of NELF-target genes. Nevertheless, INTScom-mediated regulation of coding genes is restricted to NELF-target genes. This is consistent with the fact that INTScom target genes are highly enriched in hNBE motif around the TSS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig.4e</xref>). Our data suggest that the catalytic activity of INTS11 may play a role in regulating RNAPII processivity. Interestingly, our sequence motifs search revealed the presence of the 3' box sequence close to termination sites of INTScom target coding genes. The presence of a 3' box was associated with a decrease in RNA levels over termination sites in INTS11-depleted cells. These data suggest a functional contribution of the 3' box in INTS11-mediated regulation of RNA processing. INTScom may thus play a key role in allowing NELF to couple the pause-release of RNAPII to mRNA processing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Deciphering the mechanism by which INTScom regulates NELF-target genes will certainly make an important contribution to our understanding of the transcription cycle.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Immuno-purification of NELF-E</title><p>NELF-E cDNA was purchased from Source BioScience LifeSciences (Clone IRAUp969C0381D) and cloned into pOZ-FH-N<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.

Briefly, following the alignment of sequence reads on the human genome version hg19 with TopHat 2.0.9, all subsequent analyses were done in R 3.0.2 ( <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</ext-link>) with Bioconductor packages ( <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org">www.bioconductor.org</ext-link>), including GenomicRanges 1.14.4 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), Rsamtools 1.14.3 and Homo.sapiens 1.1.2. Coverage data for each gene (exons only) was calculated from aligned RNASeq reads.

RNASeq analyses (RNASeq; Hi-Seq2500; Illumina) were performed from three independent replicates for each condition.

The specificity of the lists of DE genes was functionally verified through other packages (for example, DESeq2) of through manual read counting with HTseq.

For specificity of the RNASeq reads, &#x02018;lone&#x02019; genes were pre-selected to eliminate any background RNASeq signal from overlapping genes (for example, divergently transcribing genes). RNASeq reads were normalised (RPKM) for all conditions and variations were scored as a Log ratio between control and depleted (INTS11-KD) conditions. RNA processivity index were measured for total RNAs (ribo-depleted RNAs) or polyA+ RNAs as the log ratio of normalised RNASeq reads in gene bodies (+500 to+1000 from TSSs) over the corresponding termination site (&#x02212;500 to 0 from TES). For statistical tests, QQ-plots were used to validate the normal distribution of the variations in processivity providing with confidential intervals using the &#x02018;pnorm&#x02019; function of R as the probability of obtaining the change in processivity. Pair-wise wilcoxon test was then used to statistically test whether variations in processivity were relevant for a given subset of genes. In this case, we compared such variations to that obtained for a group of genes that were active (similar expression levels according to RNASeq reads) yet that showed were not deregulated upon INTS11-KD and NELF-KD. We also used &#x02018;unbound&#x02019; genes (genes with no ChIP-Seq peak for NELF, INTS11 or INTS3) as an additional control. Variations in strand-specific RNASeq+/&#x02212; reads were analysed separately by comparison between INT11-KD and control/mock-depleted cells. Significant variations in RNASeq- reads were scored using non-overlapping, &#x02018;lone genes&#x02019; (every gene with no overlapping genes in the &#x000b1;5&#x02009;Kbp surrounding window). Variations in read counts were scored within the &#x02212;2000 to 0 windows from their TSSs from three independent replicates and normalised to the total number of reads in the window. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>, control genes with no significant change in expression (grey boxes) were scored by DESeq2 as genes harbouring similar levels of RNASeq reads in INTS11-KD and NELF- KD as compared to control cells.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Author contributions</title><p>M.B., B.S. and O.C. conceived the study and wrote the paper.

KD and overexpression efficiencies are shown as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8C</xref>. *<italic>P</italic>-value&#x0003c;0.05; **<italic>P</italic>-value&#x0003c;0.005; ***<italic>P</italic>-value&#x0003c;0.0005, no*=not significant as measured by student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test. Error bars represent standard deviations (<italic>n</italic>=3). (<bold>e</bold>) Scatter plot scoring the variations in RNASeq reads near TES (normalised to gene bodies) between INTS11-KD and control. The variations in processivity were quantified as log <italic>P</italic>-values (x and y axes) scoring variations for every group of genes depending on the presence or not of a DNA motif close to their TSSs or to their TES (see Methods). Variations were measured for total RNAs (<italic>x</italic> axis) and for polyA+ RNAs. The red and blue dots correspond to the scores obtained for the subset of genes harbouring TAR or 3' box (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset 5</xref>). (<bold>f</bold>) Averaged RNASeq+ reads in knockdown or control cells (as indicated) near TES (<italic>x</italic> axis) of genes bound by INTScom harbouring a 3' box (red plot; &#x0003e;1,200 genes; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset 5</xref>) or not (&#x02018;control&#x02019; genes) near their TES.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ncomms6531-f5"/></fig></floats-group></article>
