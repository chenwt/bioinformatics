Although epithelial tissue is the major site for host-pathogen interactions, there is handful of studies to show how epithelial cells respond to pathogens. Bacterial infection in the mammary gland parenchyma induces local and subsequently systemic inflammation that results in a complex disease called mastitis. Globally <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is the single largest mastitis pathogen and the infection can ultimately result in either subclinical or chronic and sometimes lifelong infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the present report we have addressed the differential inflammatory response in mice mammary tissue during intramammary infection and the altered epigenetic context induced by two closely related strains of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, isolated from field samples. Immunohistochemical and immunoblotting analysis showed strain specific hyperacetylation at histone H3K9 and H3K14 residues. Global gene expression analysis in <italic>S. aureus</italic> infected mice mammary tissue revealed a selective set of upregulated genes that significantly correlated with the promoter specific, histone H3K14 acetylation. Furthermore, we have identified several differentially expressed known miRNAs and 3 novel miRNAs in <italic>S. aureus</italic> infected mice mammary tissue by small RNA sequencing. By employing these gene expression data, an attempt has been made to delineate the gene regulatory networks in the strain specific inflammatory response. Apparently, one of the isolates of <italic>S. aureus</italic> activated the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling leading to drastic inflammatory response and induction of immune surveillance, which could possibly lead to rapid clearance of the pathogen. The other strain repressed most of the inflammatory response, which might help in its sustenance in the host tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our studies shed substantial lights to understand the mechanisms of strain specific differential inflammatory response to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection during mastitis. In a broader perspective this study also paves the way to understand how certain bacteria can evade the immune surveillance and cause sustained infection while others are rapidly cleared from the host body.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Epigenetic modifications</kwd><kwd>Histone</kwd><kwd>Acetylation</kwd><kwd>Mastitis</kwd><kwd><italic>S. aureus</italic> infection</kwd><kwd>Micro-RNA</kwd><kwd>Gene expression</kwd><kwd>Inflammatory response</kwd><kwd>Chromatin immunoprecipitation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Mastitis, characterized by inflammation of the mammary gland, is a major disease affecting dairy cattle worldwide[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The severity of the inflammation is dependent on the causative agent and the host response to it. Although viruses, fungi, or protozoa can cause mastitis, the most common causes are Gram positive and negative bacteria. These bacterial infections can result in a spectrum of clinical outcomes ranging from acute and life-threatening to chronic and subclinical mastitis. <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> are the two largest single pathogens isolated from milk. <italic>S. aureus</italic> induced mastitis is characterized by a more moderate and delayed Somatic Cell Count (SCC) increase and infection can ultimately result in subclinical, chronic, and sometimes lifelong infection
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Outcome of infection can be influenced by the infecting strain
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. <italic>S. aureus</italic> potentially produces a variety of virulence factors that contribute to persistence and pathogenicity of the organism
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Lipotechoic acid (LTA) is the major immune stimulatory molecule, identified in Gram positive organisms recognized by TLR-2. Activation of the pattern recognition receptors (PRR) initiates signaling cascades and finally leads to activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and MAP kinase pathways that culminate in the transcription of a wide range of immune genes including cytokines which are synthesized by infiltrating cells as well as resident cells in response to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We have selected two predominant evolutionarily related but not identical clones of <italic>S. aureus</italic> from fresh milk samples collected from subclinical cases of mastitis cows
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] to compare the host immune response during mastitis.</p><p>Bovine mammary epithelial cells (MEC) is a good model system to study host immune response during bacteria-induced mastitis, but recent reports have shown that it poorly mimics whole animal data
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Inbred mice strains, like BALB/c, have been extensively used to study mastitis. Our previous study had shown that <italic>E. coli</italic> infection induced severe mastitis in mice
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], which inspired us to use the same model system to study <italic>S. aureus</italic> induced mastitis. The alteration of global mRNA profile during <italic>S. aureus</italic> induced mastitis in bovine and goat has been reported earlier
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Recently Lawless <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] reported alteration of microRNA (miRNA) profile in MECs upon <italic>Streptococcus uberis</italic> infection. However the alteration of miRNA upon <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection in the host mammary tissue has not been studied. Vanselow <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] reported DNA remethylation at the alphaS1-casein promoter during <italic>E. coli</italic> infection induced bovine mastitis. Wang <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] also showed aberrant DNA methylation at the CD4 gene promoter in the peripheral blood cells of the mastitis cow.</p><p>In the present study we have developed a mice model for <italic>S. aureus</italic> induced mastitis. <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection induced hyperacetylation at histone H3K9 and H3K14 residues in mice mammary tissue. Hyperacetylated histones were selectively enriched at the promoters of overexpressed proinflammatory genes. <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection also altered the microRNA profile of the host tissue. We have used two <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates to compare the strain specific response of mice mammary tissue. Remarkably, it was observed that the two strains of <italic>S. aureus</italic> induced differential expression of inflammatory genes. The strain relative/specific alteration in gene expression in mice tissue seems to be linked to the histone acetylation pattern. The RNA sequence analysis of the infected tissue revealed that small microRNAs expression also changed upon infection, suggesting a complex network of coding and non-coding RNA expression (in the context specific epigenetic state) in the process of pathogen clearance or sustained infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is the major mastitis pathogen isolated from milk samples</title><p>In order to identify the different bacterial pathogens present in the milk, we collected 294 fresh milk samples from subclinical cases of mastitis cows reared in seven independent farms. 705 different bacterial isolates were classified into different species by 16S rRNA sequencing and species specific PCR
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and <italic>Staphylococcus sp.</italic> emerged as the major mastitis pathogen isolated from these samples
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The majority of the isolates could be grouped under the subclass of coagulase negative staphylococci (CONS), which are the largest emerging class of mastitis pathogens all over the world. In these samples we found that <italic>S. aureus</italic> is the largest single pathogenic species (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Genetic diversity among these <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates has been reported earlier
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We had checked the presence of eight major virulence factors and most of the isolates were found to be positive for at least five different virulence genes. In order to establish <italic>S. aureus</italic> induced mastitis in mice, we selected two isolates harboring seven virulence genes. These two isolates, HF-14LY/t6877 and HF-16Y/t-267 (designated as SA1 and SA2, respectively), belong to different pulsotypes (Figure&#x000a0;

These pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) bind to TLR2 and other PAMP receptors and activate MyD88 complex mediated signalling cascades like classical NF-&#x003ba;B, MAPK, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Activation of TLR2-MyD88 cascade leads secretion of several pro-inflammatory mediators like interleukins, interferon (IFN)&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1;, and cytokines that are essential for the recruitment and survival of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of a set of pro-inflammatory genes had shown gradual increase in their expression from 4&#x000a0;h to 24&#x000a0;h post infection by both SA1 and SA2 (Figure&#x000a0;

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> infected mice mammary tissue showed hyperacetylation at histone H3K9 and H3K14 residues in the mammary epithelial cells (Figure&#x000a0;

However, between SA1 and SA2, substantial difference could be noticed even at the context of H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation. In order to further confirm the alteration of different histone acetylation marks upon SA1 and SA2 infection in comparison to PBS control, we extracted the total histones from control and infected tissue and subjected to western blot analysis.

Then we compared these predicted miRNAs to our DE microRNAs and identified annotated and novel DE miRNAs. We have identified 6 and 23 of anti-correlated DE miRNAs and mRNAs in SA1 and SA2 infected tissues, respectively, through negative correlation analysis. Interestingly many of the DE mRNA and miRNA did not show any correlation, which indicates involvement of other regulatory mechanisms of gene expression. As expected there was large variation in the number of predicted interactions of microRNAs and mRNAs (Additional file

Both SA1 and SA2 infected tissue showed reduced expression of protein lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) p300 (KAT3B) mRNA but no change in the expression of other known KATs (GCN5/PCAF, Tip60, and so on) could be observed. We could not check p300 protein levels in these samples due to technical limitations. We speculate that there should be enrichment of acetylated p300 that in turn induced H3 acetylation. H3K9 hyperacetylation in the <italic>S. aureus</italic> infected mice tissue also indicates plausible role of PCAF (KAT2B), which could be explored further. Reduction of p300 mRNA was concomitant with increased expression of mmu-miR-451 and mmu-miR-363 that targets 3&#x02019;-UTR of p300. Mmu-miR-451 is known to destabilize cytokine mRNAs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and mmu-miR-363 is known to be associated with regulation of MAPK signaling
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. SA1 infected tissue had high levels of mmu-miR-301 that represses NF-&#x003ba;B repressing factor (NRF)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and led to induction of NF-&#x003ba;B (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In SA2 infected tissue there was reduction in both mmu-miR-301 and NF-&#x003ba;B (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Both SA1 and SA2 infection led to expression of mmu-miR-298 that targets IKKi/IKK&#x003f5;
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and thus regulates NF-&#x003ba;B pathway
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Upregulation of mmu-miR-150 (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>: Table S1) upon SA1 infection will negatively regulate CIITA and thereby help in immune evasion
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Overexpression of mmu-Let7 miRNA will directly inhibit IL6
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and which could be the cause of rapid decrease in IL6 expression. Upregulated mmu-miR-20 family could be useful in chromatin remodeling and subsequent gene expression. mmu-miR-20 and mmu-miR-106 have to regulate IL10 expression and macrophage inflammatory response
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. All these data clearly suggest that SA1 infection induces overexpression of a bunch of microRNAs that is known to target mRNA of genes pervasively involved in proinflammatory responses. SA2 infection induced expression of genes like Trem2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells), FERT2 (Fer tyrosine kinase-2) that will suppress inflammatory response (Figure&#x000a0;

The outcome of bacterial infection ranges from unnoticeable subclinical mastitis to life-threating severe infection. The growth and pathogenesis of any bacterium is largely influenced by the host immune system but the detailed understanding of pathogenesis in mastitis is sketchy. Our previous studies have shown that staphylococci are the largest pathogen group associated with mastitis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which is as per with the global scenario

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) coupled with western blotting (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) showed significant hyperacetylation at histone H3K9 and H3K14 residues in the SA1 infected tissue, whereas there was hardly any difference between SA2 and PBS inoculated tissues. Unlike <italic>E. coli</italic> infection
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], there was no change in histone H4 acetylation and H3K36 trimethylation levels during the <italic>S. aureus</italic> induced mastitis.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Taken together these data indicate that there are few epigenetic modifications (like H3K14 acetylation) that are commonly altered during many bacterial infections. It also strongly argues for the fact that there is pathogen specific alteration of other epigenetic modifications, which clearly highlights the complexity of the epigenetic regulation associated with the tissue response during bacterial infection. Selective enrichment of histone H3K14 acetylation at the overexpressed gene promoter (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) clearly shows involvement of histone modifications in the process. We have not detected significant enrichment of H3K14ac in many other promoters that could be due to overall low levels of histone hyperacetylation in the infected tissue. Although western blot and IHC analysis showed H3K9 hyperacetylation in SA2 infected tissue, we did not see any promoter specific enrichment of H3K9 acetylation. These data clearly shows that <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection induced both global as well as promoter specific H3K14 hyperacetylation, whereas H3K9 acetylation levels had been altered globally but may not be in a promoter specific manner. It is also possible that poor efficacy of the H3K9ac antibody in formaldehyde-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) ChIP applications interfered in detection of promoter specific enrichment. Our data argue for the fact that hyperacetylation of H3K14 residue is necessary but not sufficient for global transcription activation. A combination of several histone modifications (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Modak <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]) writes the epigenetic language of global transcription activation during bacterial infection.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection induces specific histone posttranslational modifications during mice mastitis. It also induces differential expression of a set of microRNAs during mice mastitis. Our data clearly show the strain specific alteration of epigenetic modulators, namely histone acetylation and microRNA expression, that results in differential expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes. This kind of strain specific alterations in host gene expression will subject some pathogens for rapid clearance whereas others can sustain for longer duration inside the host. This probably could partially explain why <italic>S. aureus</italic> vaccine has not been successful so far. Although the mechanism of differential inflammatory response is not very evident from this study, yet we speculate the involvement of activated p300 and/or PCAF/GCN5 in the entire process. This study also shows the role of host microRNAs in host-pathogen interaction and disease manifestation. In future these epigenetic modifications can emerge as potential therapeutic target for mastitis and/or other bacterial diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Mastitis is one of the major bacterial infection induced pathogenic condition that affects all mammals including human.

Briefly, 7&#x000a0;days postpartum mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of 2&#x000a0;mg Ketamine per mouse. Mice teats were cleansed with 70% ethanol. A total of 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of the bacterial culture were carefully inoculated with a sterile syringe fitted with 30G needle in two abdominal pairs of mammary glands (left fourth (L4), right fourth (R4), left fifth (L5), and right fifth (R5)) in 36 mice. Twelve mice were simultaneously inoculated with PBS as control. Mice recovered from anesthesia were left in the cage with pups to suckle 1&#x000a0;h post inoculation. The animals were examined at regular intervals for generalized and local reaction that include redness of the teat, swelling of mammary gland, and appearance of a sunken abdomen.</p><p>Tissue collection: Mice were sacrificed with overdose of Ketamine and laid on their back; the abdominal skin was opened by mid ventral incision. The mammary glands were carefully dissected out using sterile scissor and forceps at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48&#x000a0;h post inoculation. Gross examination of mammary gland tissues was carried out and was collected in protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), RNA- later&#x000ae; solution (Ambion), and 10% formalin (Merck). The samples collected in RNA-later were incubated at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. RNA stabilized tissues were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen after discarding the RNA-later and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. The formalin fixed tissues were processed for histopathology, stained with hematoxylin and eosin and were observed under light microscope for recording histological changes. The same tissues were used for immunohistochemical analysis following the protocol published by Modak <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Tissues collected in protease inhibitor were incubated on ice for 1&#x000a0;h and then flash frozen before storing at -80&#x000b0;C till further processing.
