To gain insight into how such Treg populations differ, we performed RNA sequence (RNAseq) analyses on flow sorted Tregs from all three sources. We identify several molecules that could contribute to the observed increased suppressive capacity of follicular lymphoma nodal tregs, including upregulation of CTLA-4, IL-10, and GITR, all confirmed by protein expression. In addition, we identify, and confirm functionally, a novel mechanism by which Tregs target to and accumulate within a human tumor microenvironment, through the down regulation of S1PR1, SELL (L-selectin) and CCR7, potentially resulting in greater lymph node retention. In addition we identify and confirm functionally the upregulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR5 as well as the secretion of the chemokines CXCL13 and IL-16 demonstrating the unique ability of the follicular derived Tregs to localize and accumulate within not only the malignant lymph node, but also localize and accumulate within the malignant B cell follicle itself. Such findings offer significant new insights into how follicular lymphoma nodal Tregs may contribute to the biology of follicular lymphoma and identify several novel therapeutic targets.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>U.S. Public Health Service (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>R01-CA122645</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernstein</surname><given-names>Steven H.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>U.S. Public Health Service (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>SPORE in Lymphoma P50-CA130805</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernstein</surname><given-names>Steven H.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Rochester Human Immunology Center (NIAID R24 AI054953) Pilot Grant</institution></funding-source><award-id>5-29712</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernstein</surname><given-names>Steven H.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>6344-11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernstein</surname><given-names>Steven H.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 CA09363</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nedelkovska</surname><given-names>Hristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Internal Pilot Project Grant 5-29712 from National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease R24 AI054953 awarded to SHB and SPH.

If so, increased number of Tregs should be associated with worse outcome as is seen with many, but not all solid tumors, however there are conflicting data regarding prognostic significance of Tregs in FL.[<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155347.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155347.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155347.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155347.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] These potential contradictory effects of Tregs on clinical outcome is likely due to the balance of Tregs in the microenvironment relative to other immune-effector cells, and the type and anatomical distribution of the Tregs dictating their net biological activity.</p><p>Tregs have been shown to up-regulate the canonical transcription factor of the specific T-cell populations they suppress in response to unique microenvironmental signals.[<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155347.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This results in their expression of a chemokine receptor profile that drives these Tregs to traffic to and suppress their target T cell population. For example, Tregs that express T-bet up-regulate CXCR3 driving them to traffic to sites of Th1 inflammation and thus suppress Th1 cells. Similarly, Tregs that localize in the GC are a distinct subset of Tregs called T-follicular regulatory cells (TFR).[<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155347.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Such cells modulate the B-cell GC response by limiting the number and function of T-follicular helper (TFH) cells. In mice, TFR are derived from na&#x000ef;ve Tregs that up-regulate Bcl-6 upon activation, resulting in CXCR5 expression directing such cells to the GC via gradients of CXCL13.[<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155347.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155347.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] We and others have shown an increased proportion of TFR in FL compared to that seen in NLN and in contrast to observations in mice, we have shown that human FL TFR are partially derived from TFH.[<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] TFH cells support the viability of FL B-cells.[<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In addition, the TFH-B-cell axis is a critical pathway in the biology of several types of cancer.[<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Taken together, Tregs that inhibit tumor specific TH1 cells would be expected to have different effects on tumor growth than Tregs that inhibit TFH cells in tumors, where these cells play a tumor supporting role. Therefore, molecular events that modulate Treg migration and trafficking would be anticipated to partly dictate whether Tregs have a tumor suppressive and/or promoting role.</p><p>Although Tregs play a fundamental role in FL biology, significant questions remain regarding how such Tregs infiltrating FL differ from those infiltrating NLN, especially for homing, migration and function. To this end, we performed RNAseq analysis of purified Tregs from malignant FL. As we had the unique ability to obtain NLN, we performed RNAseq on their sorted Tregs. Finally, we also performed RNAseq on Tregs from pathologically enlarged reactive lymph nodes (RLN), biopsies of which showed reactive lymphoid hyperplasia as seen with infectious or inflammatory processes.</p><p>The following gene, protein and functional studies resulted in several key findings: 1) many differentially expressed genes in FL vs. NLN are related to cell migration and movement, 2) FL Tregs have the unique ability to localize within the malignant B-cell follicle, in part through an autocrine CXCL13-CXCR5 axis, 3) production and secretion of IL-16 by FL Tregs as well as increased retention of Tregs in the FL resulting from irreversible down-regulation of S1P1 may partly account for observed increased frequency of Tregs in FL relative to NLN, 4) FL Tregs may modulate tumor microenvironment through their elicitation of IL-16 and CCL4, and 5) Several molecules, including CTLA-4, IL-10 and GITR may comprise a pattern that could account for the increased suppressive capacity of FL Tregs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Patient Samples</title><p>Primary FL and RLN were obtained from, 12 and 5 patients respectively, undergoing routine biopsy (Table D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0155347.s001">S1 File</xref>).

Further, we found that cell migration and movement categories were highly enriched based on the FL vs. NLN comparison. Consistent with this, significant differences were found in chemokine, chemokine and G-protein receptors, and adhesion molecule genes in FL vs. NLN Tregs, including CXCL13, CCR7, CXCR5, S1P1 and L-selectin. These differences suggest a propensity for GC localization and nodal retention of FL Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155347.g007">Fig 7</xref>).

Increased expression of CXCR5 and CXCL13 would be likely to result in B cell follicle localization and accumulation of FL Tregs. Also, CXCR5-CXCL13 would function as an autokrine loop to futher retain FL Tregs within the follicle. Increased secretion of IL-16 by these Tregs would result in further recruitment of additional Tregs. Lastly, nodal egress of FL Tregs would be inhibited by the decreased expression of S1PR1, additionally resulting in nodal accumulation of FL Tregs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0155347.g007"/></fig><p>Previously, we found a greater proportion of T-cells having a Treg phenotype in FL compared to NLN partially due to FL tumor cell elaboration of CCL22 which is chemotactic for CCR4 expressing Treg-cells.[<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Present data suggest an additional novel mechanism, namely, the lack of expression of S1P1 in FL but not NLN Tregs, a type 1 G-protein coupled receptor that is a primary determinant for lymphocyte egress from the lymph node. S1P1 mediates lymphocyte egress from the thymus and secondary lymphoid organs likely through internalization of the receptor upon agonist stimulation.[<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Because there is no optimal antibody to characterize human S1P1 expression at the protein level, we confirmed our findings functionally by demonstrating that Tregs from six different human FL samples were not able to migrate in response to S1P, unlike in NLN. Although recently shown to mediate Treg accumulation in a murine breast cancer model,[<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] this is the first demonstration to our knowledge that S1P1 loss may be a mechanism for Treg accumulation in human tumor.</p><p>Microenvironmental signals may transiently alter expression patterns and functional capacity of infiltrating lymphocytes, and removal from this environment may support reversion to normal patterns. Local signals may account for the decrease in S1P1 expression, thus temporally retaining these cells within the tumor microenvironment. However, the decrease in S1P1 expression does not appear transiently inhibited by the microenvironment, as removing FL Tregs from the microenvironment and culturing them for up to 48 hours <italic>in vitro</italic> does not result in increased S1P1 expression. This suggests a more permanent expression pattern conferred on tumor infiltrating Tregs and consequently, a more terminal differentiation pattern. Further study into mechanisms by which FL Tregs acquire these unique expression patterns that facilitate increased tumor localization as well as retention within the malignant node would undoubtedly result in additional therapeutic targets.</p><p>Our studies further show that FL Tregs express a cytokine/chemokine profile that is unique compared to NLN Tregs, and likely plays a fundamental role in shaping the FL tumor microenvironment. For example, we show that IL-16 is abundantly secreted by FL Tregs compared to NLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155347.g005">Fig 5</xref>). IL-16 has chemo-attractant activity with preferential recruitment of the Th1 and Treg subsets.[<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] Although FL Tregs produce more IL-16 then do NLN Tregs, NLN Tregs have more IL-16 transcripts. This discrepancy is likely due to mature IL-16 requiring processing of a precursor molecule.[<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155347.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] Finally, we demonstrate that FL Tregs produce CCL-3 and CCL-4, both of which are chemotactic for CCR5 expressing Tregs and CD4 and CD8 effector cells, more so than NLN Tregs. Taken together, the different transcriptional profile of FL vs. NLN Tregs leads to different cytokine and chemokine profiles that have both an autocrine effect on Tregs as well as possible effects on different immune effector cells.</p><p>Not all gene expression data we observe directly correlates with protein levels, as described for IL-16 above. We have previously shown with flow cytometry that there was no statistically significant difference in the levels of either CD39 or CD73 protein, on a per cell basis,[<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] however, our data here demonstrates reduction in CD39 (ENTDP1) and CD73 transcripts in FL Tregs as compared to NLN. This discrepancy has at least two potential explanations: First, intracellular pools of these proteins may differ between different Tregs while surface expression remains similar (we only assessed extracellular protein levels by flow). Second, global mRNA and protein levels do not necessarily correlate.[<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]</p><p>We have previously shown that FL Tregs show greater suppressive capacity then those derived from NLN or RLN.[<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] As shown, FL Tregs express higher levels of IL-10, CTLA-4 and GITR then do NLN Tregs at both transcriptional and protein levels, consistent with this increased suppressive capacity. This is of particular interest as therapeutic agents targeting each of these inhibitory pathways are at various stages of development. Additionally, it has recently been shown that signaling through Treg S1P1 results in an AKT mediated attenuation of Treg suppression.[<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] Because FL Tregs have lower expression of S1P1 then do NLN Tregs, they may be subjected to less attenuation of their suppressive function resulting in greater effector T-cell suppression then seen with NLN Tregs.</p><p>There is great interest in targeting Tregs therapeutically to augment immunotherapeutic approaches such as tumor vaccines or checkpoint inhibitors. Because our data suggest that FL Tregs are skewed towards a TFR phenotype, along with recent findings that suggest Tfh support FL cell viability (through CD40L expression and elaboration of IL-4),[<xref rid="pone.0155347.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] it is possible that depletion of Tregs in FL could have an adverse clinical effect by removing the &#x0201c;brakes&#x0201d; on the FL supporting TFH. Furthermore, given cytokines/chemokines elaborated by FL Tregs, it is likely that Treg depletion would have additional effects on remodeling tumor microenvironment, which may or may not be clinically beneficial. Understanding how microenvironment of a given tumor type modulates the function of Tregs infiltrating the tumor will be critical to determining whether Treg depletion is a rational therapeutic strategy for a given tumor.</p><p>Our data support shaping of the tumor infiltrating Treg transcriptome by the tumor microenvironment. Further insights into pathways through which tumors modulate the Treg transcriptome and thus the function of tumor infiltrating Tregs could lead to discovery of new therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0155347.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supplemental Methods, Figures and Tables.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0155347.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0155347.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Supporting Data.</title><p>File containing data for flow cytometry, Luminex, migration and S1P1 qPCR assays.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0155347.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0155347.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Friedberg</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Cerhan</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Flowers</surname><given-names>CR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Dillon</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Farber</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal><article-title>Follicular lymphoma in the United States: first report of the national LymphoCare study</article-title>. <source>Journal of clinical oncology: official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology</source>. <year>2009</year>;<volume>27</volume>(<issue>8</issue>):<fpage>1202</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>8</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2008.18.1495">10.1200/JCO.2008.18.1495</ext-link></comment> ; PubMed Central PMCID: PMC2738614.<?supplied-pmid 19204203?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19204203</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0155347.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Carreras</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lopez-Guillermo</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fox</surname><given-names>BC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Colomo</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Martinez</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Roncador</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
