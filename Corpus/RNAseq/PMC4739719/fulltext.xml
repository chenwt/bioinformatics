Using RNA-seq, we evaluated targeted and neighboring gene expression in tissues from 44 homozygous mutants compared with C57BL/6N control mice. Two allele types were evaluated: 15 targeted trap mutations (TRAP); and 29 deletion alleles (DEL), usually a deletion between the translational start and the 3&#x02019; UTR. Both targeting strategies insert a bacterial beta-galactosidase reporter (LacZ) and a neomycin resistance selection cassette. Evaluating transcription of genes in +/- 500 kb of flanking DNA around the targeted gene, we found up-regulated genes more frequently around DEL compared with TRAP alleles, however the frequency of alleles with local down-regulated genes flanking DEL and TRAP targets was similar. Down-regulated genes around both DEL and TRAP targets were found at a higher frequency than expected from a genome-wide survey. However, only around DEL targets were up-regulated genes found with a significantly higher frequency compared with genome-wide sampling. Transcriptome analysis confirms targeting in 97% of DEL alleles, but in only 47% of TRAP alleles probably due to non-functional splice variants, and some splicing around the gene trap. Local effects on gene expression are likely due to a number of factors including compensatory regulation, loss or disruption of intragenic regulatory elements, the exogenous promoter in the neo selection cassette, removal of insulating DNA in the DEL mutants, and local silencing due to disruption of normal chromatin organization or presence of exogenous DNA. An understanding of local position effects is important for understanding and interpreting any phenotype attributed to targeted gene mutations, or to spontaneous indels.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Insertion of foreign DNA into mammalian genomes, and the deletion of DNA, may have unintended consequences extending beyond the site of the mutation. In the mouse, the insertion of foreign DNA, including foreign regulatory DNA, combined with the deletion of part of the targeted gene, had striking effects on the regulation of neighboring genes. And this ectopic local gene dysregulation occurred at high frequency in regions of high gene density. These findings emphasize the importance of evaluating the local effects on gene regulation following spontaneous insertions and deletions, and after engineering mutations, in mammalian systems. Phenotypes associated with mutations in a specific gene may be partially or entirely due to effects on neighboring genes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work was funded by the National Institutes of Health Grants U42OD011175 (KCL, DBW), U54HG006364 (KCL, DBW), and U01HG004080 (PJdJ).

To this end, strong reliable ubiquitously expressing promoters have been identified and engineered to provide appropriate and consistent transgene expression [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Exogenous DNA promoting gene silencing has been identified and removed from constructs [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and insulating DNA has been utilized to reduce the influence of flanking DNA at the insertion site [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, targeting vectors into safe havens with open chromatin [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] ensures that other genes are not disrupted and the targeting eliminates concatenation of the vector which may produce silencing [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The literature emphasizes a consideration of the impact of the local genome on the fidelity of the transgene [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and generally doesn&#x02019;t consider the effect of transgene integration on the local genome function. There are a few reports describing unintended position effects of either random integration or targeting events in mammals. And most of these reports relate to finding that a random integrant has disrupted either the regulatory domain [e.g., <xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], or coding sequence of another gene. This lack of data may be a consequence of not looking.</p><p>In transgenic studies of commercial crop and animal species due to food safety concerns, investigators have evaluated unintended consequences and pleiotropic effects of transgene integration [for reviews see <xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Since the majority of commercial plant and animal transgenics are not targeted, the approach has been to look at physiological parameters such as blood, nutritional value, e.g., carbohydrate composition of commercial crops, morphological changes by histology and transcriptome changes in multiple random integrants. And indeed they have been able to identify transgene specific vs. insertional position effects, primarily using transcriptome analysis [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Similarly, for viral delivery systems for human gene therapy, the unintended consequences of vector integration are of obvious concern for safety reasons [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The advent of expression profiling by the sequencing of cDNA libraries (RNA-seq) [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] enabled by NextGen sequencing has created an opportunity for using transcriptome analysis as a diagnostic tool to elaborate molecular mechanisms of disease [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], drug response [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and response to toxins [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It is timely that we apply this technology to evaluate the consequence of the genomic insertion of targeted transgenic constructs.</p><p>The International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) is an international effort to create a resource of targeted gene-specific knockout C57BL/6N mouse embryonic stem cells for ~ 17,000 protein coding genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The next step in this process is to use these stem cells to produce live animals for cryopreservation and phenotyping and the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium was formed to complete this initiative (IMPC) [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The NIH Common Fund supported Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) is part of the IKMC and IMPC projects and has already produced targeted stem cells for ~ 7,500 genes, and approximately 2,500 of these have now been used to generate live mice. The KOMP project uses two separate targeting strategies [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In one approach (<underline>C</underline>HORI-<underline>S</underline>anger-UC <underline>D</underline>avis, CSD) the construct is a targeted gene trap (TRAP) which can be converted to a conditional allele (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Methods</xref>). The TRAP is inserted into an intron 5&#x02019; to a critical exon and is designed not to disrupt any intronic regulatory elements. The vector construct is identical to that used by the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program (EUCOMM) [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In contrast, the Velocigene (VG) targeting strategy uses BAC recombineering to create a vector that deletes the entire open reading frame from the ATG of the targeted gene to the 3&#x02019; UTR creating a deletion allele (DEL). The inserted vectors for the CSD and VG alleles are very similar. <underline>Both targeting strategies leave behind a bacterial beta-galactosidase reporter (LacZ) and a neo selection cassette usually driven by a heterologous promoter</underline>. In order to evaluate local targeting effects, the use of the same targeting vector to target many different genes is ideal to evaluate the potential off-target effects since the vector remains unchanged but the local targeted environment is varied. In addition, we have two different targeting strategies which can be compared. In this report we evaluate the local effects of TRAP and DEL targeting events in C57BL/6N adult mice by using RNA-seq to characterize the expression of the targeted gene, and genes flanking the targeted gene, in tissues from 44 unique mouse lines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Expression of Neighboring Genes</title><p>We present here the changes in gene expression by RNA-seq for genes within +/- 500 kb of the center of the targeted gene.

Expression of exons proximal to the gene trap, non-functional splicing around the gene trap, expression of the 3&#x02019; UTR or distal exons for deletion mutants, and reads mapping to intronic non-coding sequence, may have resulted in apparent failure of the targeting. In addition, with small numbers of replicates the DESeq2 statistic may not find significance despite large differences in read counts. Therefore, we used the criteria of a minimum of 100 reads in either the WT or HOM library, and relative reads in the HOM libraries of 20% of wildtype or greater to identify those mutants with possible failed targeting for additional follow-up. We followed-up by examining the patterns of read alignment to introns, exons, and untranslated regions of each gene.</p><p>Using the criteria described above, 8/15 TRAP mutants (47%) were evaluated further for targeting. Inspection of reads mapping to the mouse genome helped to confirm targeting, for example where reads mapped to exons proximal to the gene trap, or to untranslated regions.

The frequency of down-regulated genes within +/- 500kb was significantly higher than expected from a genome wide survey for both DEL and TRAP mutants, whereas for up-regulated genes these only occurred above the genome wide expected frequency for DEL mutants and not for TRAP mutants. As would be expected, gene density around the target influenced the likelihood of local effects, since targets with local effects had approximately twice the number of genes in the 500kb flanking regions than genes with no local effects.</p><p>Some of the local gene differential expression around targeted genes may have been due to the co-regulation of gene clusters. Genes tend to cluster in euchromatin due to the requirement of an open DNA structure and regions of generally up- or down-regulated genes have been identified in mammalian genomes [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but this doesn&#x02019;t necessarily mean that the genes are co-regulated in response to developmental or cellular demands, or act in the same or related pathways. The presence of bidirectional promoters could also partly explain the co-regulation of flanking genes. Approximately 11% of human and mouse promoters are bidirectional [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and regulate expression of flanking genes. The function of these bidirectional promoters may be to maintain an open chromatic structure and to coordinate expression of gene networks [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, at least some of the local effects we found in this study could be compensatory feedback in response to loss of the gene product and/or the presence of bidirectional promoters. However, the frequency of local effects around the DEL targets was much higher than the 11% frequency of bidirectional promoters and suggests some other mechanisms were involved. In some cases, we found local effects in a specific tissue, identical to the local effects found in other tissues, even when the targeted gene was not normally expressed in that tissue, e.g., <italic>Prkcdbp</italic>, <italic>Apof</italic>, and <italic>G6b</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005691.s001">S1 Table</xref>). And, we found that there was a unique pattern to the clustering of dysregulated genes around the DEL targets. Up-regulated genes were primarily 3&#x02019;, with 77% 3&#x02019; of the targeted gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005691.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Down-regulated genes were equally distributed 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; and were within 100kb of the targeted gene. The observations that gene dysregulation tended to cluster around the target even when the targeted gene was not expressed in that tissue, and the unique and different topography of up- and down-regulated genes, support the conclusion that some of these local effects were due to the targeting event and not a compensatory change due to the loss of targeted gene product.</p><p>We hypothesize that the local transcriptional dysregulation, was due to three mechanisms: 1) the targeting event disrupted regulatory and insulating elements within the targeted gene and this had cis-acting effects on flanking genes; 2) the exogenous promoter in the neo selection cassette acted on 3&#x02019; genes to either increase or decrease gene expression; and 3) insertion of ~ 5 kb of exogenous DNA, and elements in the vector, promoted gene silencing.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Disruption of intragenic regulatory sequences</title><p>There are many intragenic elements involved in the regulation of transcription found within introns and in the 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; UTRs of genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The intragenic elements include secondary promoters, enhancer, repressor and insulating elements, and sequence coding for miRNAs affecting stability of transcripts. There are examples of transgenes acting in cis to affect neighboring gene regulation due to the disruption of regulatory elements [e.g., <xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Disruption of cis-regulatory elements was more likely to occur in the DEL targeting strategy than in the TRAP strategy and may account for why local gene effects were more frequently found flanking DEL targets. Unintended disruption of miRNA sequence is of particular relevance since many miRNAs are found within introns of protein coding genes. Osokine et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] reviewed the literature and found approximately 200 cases of unintended disruption of miRNA in mouse mutations and targeted mouse stem cell lines. In our analysis of the 44 targeted genes, we predicted that a higher proportion of DEL targeting events would disrupt intragenic regulatory elements than TRAP events (58% vs. 7%). This could explain the finding that up- and down-regulated genes were found with more frequency flanking DEL compared with TRAP targets.</p><p>In addition, enhancers and repressors found in complex promoters can act in cis on distant promoters through chromatin looping [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Deletion of the entire gene 3&#x02019; prime to the promoter in the DEL strategy would bring enhancer and repressor elements in the targeted gene promoter into closer proximity with downstream promoters and increase the opportunity for interactions. This is consistent with the preponderance of up-regulated genes in DEL targets found 3&#x02019; to the targeting event.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Heterologous promoter and neo cassette</title><p>There are a number of reports that targeted introduction of selectable marker genes disrupted the regulation of neighboring genes in the mouse [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. For the majority of these reports, it is difficult to determine if the targeting disrupted a cis-acting regulatory domain, or if the presence of the neo selection cassette, including the promoter, affected neighboring gene regulation. These published examples used the <italic>Pgk</italic> promoter to drive neo expression. For Scacheri [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] it was clear that the presence of the heterologous promoter in the targeted gene was responsible for the lethality phenotype since the lethality was found in heterozygotes, and an aberrant transcript from the antisense strand of the <italic>Pgk</italic> promoter was expressed and possibly had dominant-negative effects. In the Ramirez-Solis report [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] targeting of mouse <italic>Hoxb4</italic> with a <italic>Pgk</italic>-Neo vector resulted in a phenotype that did not recapitulate the phenotype produced in a different mouse mutant caused by a point mutation.</p><p>Both the TRAP and the DEL vectors utilized a heterologous promoter and a neo selection cassette. However, these were different in a number of respects: including different promoters, <italic>hACTB</italic> and <italic>hUBC</italic>; and different polyA signals, SV40 and polyA from <italic>mPgk</italic>. Both the <italic>hACTB</italic> and <italic>hUBC</italic> are strong promoters [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], the hUBC promoter has some bi-directionality [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and both are active in embryonic stem cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. One explanation for the difference in local gene effects between the TRAP and DEL mutants could be explained by differences in the selection cassette and not the targeting strategy.</p><p>It is possible that the TRAP or DEL vector linker regions, or neo coding sequence, contain cryptic splice donors and that the heterologous promoter drives expression of the neo cassette and it is then spliced around the polyA signal to exons in genes 3&#x02019; to the neo coding sequence. Meyers et al, [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] used <italic>Pgk</italic>-neo to target the mouse <italic>Fgf8</italic> and they reported aberrant splicing of the Fgf8 transcripts due to cryptic splice sites in the neo cDNA sequence. The TRAP and DEL neo sequences are identical except for nucleotides coding for three additional amino acids at the N-terminus, and the TRAP neo and the neo used by Meyers [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] are identical. Therefore, the cryptic splice acceptor/donors found in the neo by Meyers may also act in some of the TRAP and DEL vectors, leading to spurious reads mapping either to the targeted gene, or to exons in genes 3&#x02019; of the target.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Local silencing</title><p>In randomly integrated transgenes it is well established that repeated elements and concatenates of integrants [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and the presence of non-mammalian DNA especially of viral origin [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], are associated with silencing by histone modifications due to transacting factors and marked by cytosine CpG methylation. The vectors used for gene targeting, including the vectors used by both the TRAP and DEL strategies, generally avoid sequence that may promote silencing. However, both the LacZ and the neo resistance cDNA are of bacterial origin and the LacZ sequence specifically could be problematic. Several reports have described variegated expression of LacZ containing transgenes [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], suggesting silencing. Both the LacZ sequence and the neo-resistance gene sequence used in these constructs have high GC content. And one study reported that varying the CpG content of a LacZ reporter driven by the <italic>hEF1&#x003b1;</italic> promoter in transgenic mice significantly affected silencing of the promoter independent of insertion site. In that experiment, the silencing of LacZ expression was correlated with cytosine CpG methylation in the exogenous promoter, and was eliminated by reducing CpG content of the LacZ [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This suggests that the sequence of the LacZ cassette could activate methylation of local CpG islands in neighboring promoter regions. However, this has never been demonstrated in targeted transgenes inserting a LacZ reporter by homologous recombination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Confirmation of Targeting</title><p>For DEL alleles, RNA-seq confirmed targeting for 97% of the targeting events. However, for DEL mutants with a significant numbers of reads mapping to the targeted gene, it was necessary to examine the mapping distribution of the reads across the gene to reach a conclusion. For TRAP alleles, confirmation of targeting by using only total read counts from RNA-seq was ~50%. For the 50% of the TRAP targets with significant numbers of reads from RNA-seq mapping to the gene in HOM tissues, usually the reads mapped to all exons. This does not necessarily mean that the targeted gene was expressing a functional protein. There are examples of splicing around gene traps in mice in the literature [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Some of these examples of alternative splicing, or splicing around the gene trap sequence, produced functional protein and were hypomorphs [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and some produced message which was not translated [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. This alternative splicing may be a consequence of a weak splice acceptor at the gene trap, or the presence of cryptic splice donors and acceptors within the neo cassette [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Splicing around the gene trap appears to be tissue specific. In the case of <italic>Arap1</italic> reported in this paper and described above with clear alternative splicing around the gene trap, this mouse gene has 19 splice variants, many of them protein coding, in the Ensembl database (ENSMUSG00000032812). Therefore, the Arap1 gene in particular may be transcriptionally organized to splice around the trap. In another more recent example of splicing around the gene trap, Hanstein et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] evaluated the mRNA produced by a TRAP mutant for <italic>Panx1</italic>. They showed that intact mRNA was produced, although it was ~ 30% of that found in wild type mice, and that this TRAP mutant was a functional hypomorph which was adequate to recapitulate the phenotype in a true -/- null mutant. We also evaluated by RNA-seq the pattern of mRNA expression in this same TRAP mutant and also showed that <italic>Panx1</italic> mRNA was knocked down but not eliminated in the three tissues we sequenced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005691.s001">S1 Table</xref>). For any gene trap mutant, relying upon the presence or absence of RNA mapping to the exons of the targeted gene is not necessarily evidence that the gene is functionally expressed. If mRNA is detected and maps to the exons in an RNA-seq experiment, ultimately it is necessary to assess the amount of protein, and sequence the cDNA, in order to conclude if the splicing around the gene trap is likely to produce a functional protein.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Conclusions</title><p>RNA-seq is a useful method to assess gene targeting efficiency and to determine if follow-up studies with mRNA sequencing and protein assays are needed to confirm the mutation. In addition, RNA-seq readily identifies up- and down-regulation of genes in close proximity to the target which may be compensatory or a consequence of the targeting strategy and vector. We report here that local effects of targeting occur in both TRAP and DEL targeted mutations but occur with higher frequency in DEL mutations. It is likely that, in some cases, these local effects on gene transcription surrounding the targeted site are a consequence of the presence of the LacZ/selection cassette in the TRAP and DEL mutants, and/or the deletion of the open reading frame in DEL mutants. Future work comparing local gene expression changes in TRAP and DEL mutants having intact targeting vectors, with those following Cre excision of the neo cassette, will help us determine if the neo cassette is responsible for the local gene expression changes. We do not know if, or how frequently, local gene expression changes due to the vector insertion, affect phenotypes in targeted mutants. However, one recent report using the identical TRAP allele targeting <italic>Slc25a21</italic> in the mouse revealed phenotypes that were a consequence of the down-regulation of a neighboring gene and not disruption of the targeted gene [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In some cases, up-regulation of a local gene may not have any physiological consequences unless the full pathway in which the protein product plays a role is active in that tissue. For genes flanking the target that are down-regulated, it is more likely that this would have a consequence in that tissue since the pathway is already active but expression is reduced in the mutant. When evaluating phenotypes in targeted mouse mutants, or in spontaneous indel mutations, one should consider the effect of the mutation on the expression and function of closely linked genes flanking the mutation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This work was approved by the University of California Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (UCD IACUC Protocol #17328) and was performed in accordance to the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health, Institute of Laboratory Animal Research and Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Gene List</title><p>The 44 genes for which homozygous (HOM) mutant tissues were evaluated by RNA-seq is: <italic>2700097O09Rik</italic>, <italic>Aard</italic>, <italic>Adam26a</italic>, <italic>Adig</italic>, <italic>Apof</italic>, <italic>Arap1</italic>, <italic>Arl10</italic>, <italic>Atp6v1b1</italic>, <italic>Ccdc116</italic>, <italic>Ccl9</italic>, <italic>Cd248</italic>, <italic>Fastk</italic>, <italic>Fbxo44</italic>, <italic>G6b</italic>, <italic>Gkn2</italic>, <italic>Gnpda2</italic>, <italic>Gpr182</italic>, <italic>Il6ra</italic>, <italic>Inf2</italic>, <italic>Iqub</italic>, <italic>Jazf1</italic>, <italic>Kctd15</italic>, <italic>Klf14</italic>, <italic>Lancl2</italic>, <italic>Lpin3</italic>, <italic>Lrrc72</italic>, <italic>Lyplal1</italic>, <italic>Mtnr1b</italic>, <italic>Negr1</italic>, <italic>Oxgr1</italic>, <italic>Panx1</italic>, <italic>Plekha8</italic>, <italic>Ppapdc2</italic>, <italic>Prkcdbp</italic>, <italic>Rgcc</italic>, <italic>Sik1</italic>, <italic>Slc1a3</italic>, <italic>Slc7a13</italic>, <italic>Tex37</italic>, <italic>Tmem248</italic>, <italic>Tmem256</italic>, <italic>Tst</italic>, <italic>Ube2e2</italic>, <italic>Wtip</italic>.

The targeting strategies and cell lines have been described by Skarnes et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] for the CSD and EUCOMM alleles, and by Valenzuela [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] for the Velocigene (VG) alleles. A description of each allele is available through the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; or the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) Repository [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. CSD/EUCOMM clones are gene trap (TRAP) alleles with the targeting vector expressing beta-galactosidase (LacZ) inserted 5&#x02019; to a critical proximal exon. The geometry of the CSD/EUCOMM allele was: splice acceptor, IRES, LacZ, SV40 polyA, <italic>hACTB</italic> promoter, neo, SV40 polyA. Two of the CSD/EUCOMM mutants we evaluated in this report did not have the standard <italic>hACTB</italic> promoter driving neo expression. One uses the <italic>mPgk</italic> promoter, and the other was promoterless and used the T2A self-cleaving strategy. VG targeting produced deletion alleles (DEL) that excised the entire gene between the translational start site and the 3&#x02019; UTR, leaving the LacZ at the ATG of the targeted gene. However, with very large genes only the 5&#x02019; exons/introns were removed. The geometry of the VG alleles was: LacZ cDNA, SV40 polyA signal, hUBC promoter, neo, Pkg polyA signal.</p><p>Mice were produced by injection of targeted stem cells into blastocysts. Chimeras were backcrossed to C57BL/6NTac or C57BL/6NCrl inbred mice and the resulting founding heterozygous mutants were expanded by additional backcrosses. Targeting was confirmed by long-range PCR [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] or the loss-of-allele assay [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] and zygosity for the targeted allele was confirmed by a qPCR assay specific for the LacZ sequence. Additional tests were completed as per Ryder et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] to confirm vector integrity. HOM mice and control, wild type (WT) littermates were produced by breeding of heterozygous mice and weaned at approximately 21 days of age. Breeders and weaned animals were housed in an environmentally controlled animal facility on a 12:12 hour, light:dark cycle, with lights on at 07:00Hr.

Tissues were rapidly removed and placed into RNAlater (Qiagen Inc), or were quick frozen in liquid nitrogen.

For each HOM mutant mouse line, 4&#x02013;5 male mice approximately 50 days of age were necropsied and tissues processed for RNA extraction. In addition, 5 age-matched WT mice were dissected and the tissues processed in parallel with the mutant mice. Tissues were homogenized with a bead mill in RNAzol-RT (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). DNA and protein was separated from RNA by water precipitation and the resulting aqueous phase was mixed with an equal volume of isopropanol. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), including DNase treatment of the silica bound RNA to remove contaminating DNA. RNA quality was assessed by a Nucleic Acid Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) and only RNA with an RNA Integrity Number &#x0003e; 8.0 was used for library production.</p><p>For RNA-seq analysis, total RNA from homozygous biological replicates was pooled for each mutant tissue after normalizing for concentration. cDNA libraries from mRNA were created using the TruSeq kit from Illumina (San Diego, CA). Single end sequencing with 50nt reads was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument using 4&#x02013;5 multiplexed libraries per lane at the QB3 Sequencing Center at the University of California, Berkeley. The resulting sequence was parsed into individual libraries by barcode, and then preprocessed with the FastX Tool kit [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] to eliminate low quality and short reads using a minimum Phred score of 20 and a minimum read length of 18. Generally 95% of reads passed our quality trimming and the average number of trimmed reads was greater than 20M per library. We then aligned using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner tool [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] against the Ensembl mouse NCBI m38 build, mm10 transcriptome and MiRBase miRNA database [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Approximately 90% of quality-trimmed reads mapped to the mouse transcriptome/miRNA reference sequences.</p><p>Comparisons between HOM mutant &#x00026; WT reads were completed using the R Bioconductor package, DESeq2 [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. RNAseq reads were mapped against the MM10 mouse reference genome using Tophat2 [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. For verifying targeting, we used a criterion of normalized HOM targeted gene expression of less than 20% of WT gene expression. If the reads of the targeted gene in the HOM mutant exceeded this criterion, then we examined the distribution of HOM targeted gene reads mapped against the MM10 genome in order to determine the source of unexpected reads using the Integrated Genomic Viewer (IGV, v 2.3) from the Broad Institute [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. For the regional effects analysis, for each library we compared read counts for HOM and WT libraries, for each gene and miRNA coding sequence within +/- 500 kb of the target. Up- or down regulated genes were defined as significantly different by DESeq2 (unadjusted p &#x0003c; 0.05). The unadjusted p value was used as a less stringent criterion since the study lacked power due to the low number of biological replicates. In addition to examining local effects, we determined the genome-wide frequency of detecting up- or down-regulated genes within 500kb of each gene in every HOM library that was significantly down-regulated relative to the wild-type reference library using the DESeq statistic with an unadjusted p &#x0003c; 0.05 criterion. A conservative 500kb interval flanking targeted genes was decided upon by a preliminary analysis of the data which showed that the majority of local effects occurred between 0 and 200 kb of the targeted genes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">results</xref>). All of the sequencing data generated for this study was deposited at the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA; Project #PRJNA280546, KOMP Mouse Mutant Transcriptome Pilot).</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Bioinformatics Analysis of Regulatory Elements</title><p>To analyze the likelihood there were regulatory elements deleted by targeting, we used the Swissregulon Database [<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005691.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].

Similarly, for the DEL targets, if two or more TFBS, along with corroborating data from CHIPseq tracks, were deleted by targeting, then that event was scored as likely to have disrupted regulatory elements.
