Therefore specific responses, which protect and repair against the collateral damage caused by the immune response, are critical for successfully surviving pathogen attack. We previously demonstrated that ROS are generated during infection in the model host <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> by the dual oxidase Ce-Duox1/BLI-3. Herein, an important connection between ROS generation by Ce-Duox1/BLI-3 and upregulation of a protective transcriptional response by SKN-1 is established in the context of infection. SKN-1 is an ortholog of the mammalian Nrf transcription factors and has previously been documented to promote survival, following oxidative stress, by upregulating genes involved in the detoxification of ROS and other reactive compounds. Using qRT-PCR, transcriptional reporter fusions, and a translational fusion, SKN-1 is shown to become highly active in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine upon exposure to the human bacterial pathogens, <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</italic> Activation is dependent on the overall pathogenicity of the bacterium, demonstrated by a weakened response observed in attenuated mutants of these pathogens. Previous work demonstrated a role for p38 MAPK signaling both in pathogen resistance and in activating SKN-1 upon exposure to chemically induced oxidative stress. We show that NSY-1, SEK-1 and PMK-1 are also required for SKN-1 activity during infection. Evidence is also presented that the ROS produced by Ce-Duox1/BLI-3 is the source of SKN-1 activation via p38 MAPK signaling during infection. Finally, for the first time, SKN-1 activity is shown to be protective during infection; loss of <italic>skn-1</italic> decreases resistance, whereas increasing SKN-1 activity augments resistance to pathogen. Overall, a model is presented in which ROS generation by Ce-Duox1/BLI-3 activates a protective SKN-1 response via p38 MAPK signaling.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>To fight infection, an animal's immune response produces a variety of toxic compounds that are directed at the invading pathogen. However, these toxic compounds can also damage the host's tissue. Therefore an important job of the immune response is to prevent and repair damage caused by &#x0201c;friendly fire.&#x0201d; In this study, we explore this damage control function of the immune response in a small worm called <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which can be infected by feeding on human pathogens and serves as a model of human infection. Upon exposure of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to reactive compounds, a factor called SKN-1 was shown to induce the production of protective, detoxifying enzymes. Here, we demonstrate that SKN-1 also becomes active in infected animals. The cause of SKN-1 activation is reactive compounds produced by the animal's immune system, i.e. a source of &#x0201c;friendly fire.&#x0201d; We additionally show that a highly conserved signaling pathway, called the p38 MAPK pathway, controls SKN-1 activity during infection. Finally, we demonstrate that SKN-1 activity is beneficial to the worm during infection, enhancing survival. Because humans share many of the components of the interaction we describe, this study provides broad insights into the principals of damage control during immune response.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infection by pathogenic microorganisms requires a coordinated response from the host to cope with the multitude of physiological challenges presented by the attack. In addition to producing compounds that have direct antimicrobial activity and countering pathogen virulence strategies, the host must also initiate stress responses to protect cellular resources and processes from the negative consequences of &#x0201c;friendly-fire.&#x0201d; Damage, disease, and sometimes death of the host can occur if immune responses are not controlled or protected against properly. Septic shock and various autoimmune diseases are examples of immune responses gone awry. In this work we explore the connections between infection, immune response and cellular stress response using the well-studied model host <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans.</italic></p><p>A general response to microbial challenge that most animals possess is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The best-studied example is the production of ROS as an antimicrobial response in the phagolysosome of phagocytic cells by the NADPH oxidase gp91<italic><sup>phox</sup></italic>. However, this response is not limited to phagocytes, and NADPH oxidases are present in the skin as well as the mucosal epithelium of the oral cavity, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Bedard1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Lambeth1">[2]</xref>. Less complex organisms that lack innate immune cells, such as <italic>C. elegans</italic>, also encode for NADPH oxidases. For instance, the dual oxidase Ce-Duox1/BLI-3 is present in the hypodermis and in the intestine of <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Chavez1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Edens1">[4]</xref>. Our laboratory and others recently demonstrated that an intestinal infection triggers the release of ROS by Ce-Duox1/BLI-3 in what appears to be a protective response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Chavez1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Jain1">[5]</xref>. Presumably due to the production of ROS however, there was also evidence of cellular damage as shown by lipofuscin accumulation and loss of protein homeostasis, which was worsened by the knock-down of certain oxidative stress enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Chavez2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-MohriShiomi1">[7]</xref>. The goal of this work was to determine if infection, by triggering ROS release by Ce-Duox1/BLI-3, induces an oxidative stress response in the host as part of the overall response to the pathogen.</p><p>SKN-1 is a transcription factor that senses oxidative stress and functionally affects resistance to oxidative stress and lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. It is an Nrf ortholog, a protein family found in all eukaryotes that upregulates the Phase 2 genes of the three-phase detoxification system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-An1">[8]</xref>. Phase 2 genes encode enzymes that defend against ROS and other reactive compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Xu1">[9]</xref>. A large number of genes are regulated by SKN-1, including many glutathione-S-transferases that are important for detoxifying reactive compounds such as xenobiotics and peroxidized lipids by conjugating glutathione to electrophilic centers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Oliveira1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Park1">[11]</xref>.</p><p>SKN-1 transcriptional activity is regulated by phosphorylation by the p38 MAPK, PMK-1, which promotes its localization to the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Inoue1">[12]</xref>. Interestingly, PMK-1 is a major regulator of <italic>C. elegans</italic> innate immunity and loss of this protein results in a strong susceptibility phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Kim1">[13]</xref>. Work on PMK-1 showed that it is regulated by a phosphorylation cascade involving the activation of a Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain protein, TIR-1, which leads to the activation of a MAPKKK called NSY-1, which then activates a MAPKK called SEK-1, culminating in PMK-1 phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Kim1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Liberati1">[14]</xref>. Phosphorylation of the transcription factor ATF-7 by PMK-1 is thought to ultimately promote innate immune gene expression by turning this repressor of innate immune gene expression into an activator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Shivers1">[15]</xref>. While SEK-1 is also required for activation of SKN-1 by oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Inoue1">[12]</xref>, the roles of TIR-1 and NSY-1 are controversial. One report shows that NSY-1 and TIR-1 are dispensable for activation of PMK-1 in response to oxidative stress created by sodium arsenite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Inoue1">[12]</xref>, whereas two other publications show that NSY-1 is required for resistance to oxidative stress caused by paraquat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Hayakawa1">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Li1">[18]</xref>.</p><p>In earlier studies, loss of SKN-1 was not observed to affect the overall susceptibility of the worm to infection by <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and it was postulated that the oxidative stress transcriptional response mediated by SKN-1 is not involved in pathogen defense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Shivers1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Kawli1">[19]</xref>.

We establish that bacterial infection stimulates SKN-1 activity in a manner dependent on the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. We show that components of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway previously established as necessary for responding to pathogen are involved, including NSY-1, SEK-1 and PMK-1, but not TIR-1. In contrast to previous work, we find that loss of SKN-1 activity increases susceptibility to the pathogens whereas constitutive activation results in increased resistance. Of key significance is the demonstration that ROS produced by Ce-Duox1/BLI-3 is the source of oxidative stress triggering SKN-1 activity during infection. Overall, this work establishes that a protective SKN-1 response is activated during infection via p38 MAPK signaling as a result of the mucosal oxidative burst generated by the host.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Pathogen Infection Induces Expression of SKN-1 Controlled Genes</title><p>Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that <italic>C. elegans</italic> releases significant amounts of ROS during infection and that expression of oxidative stress response genes such as <italic>sod-3</italic> is induced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Chavez2">[6]</xref>.

If loss of SKN-1 causes a susceptibility phenotype, constitutively active SKN-1 is predicted to increase resistance. We increased SKN-1 activity by two known means. First, we reduced expression of <italic>gsk-3</italic> by RNAi, which causes constitutive nuclear localization of SKN-1 and therefore, greater transcriptional activity. By phosphorylation, GSK-3 normally inhibits nuclear localization of SKN-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-An2">[39]</xref>. Secondly, we reduced expression of <italic>wdr-23</italic>, which encodes a WD40 repeat protein that targets SKN-1 to an ubiquitin ligase for proteasomal degradation. Loss of WDR-23 results in increased SKN-1 protein levels and greater output of its transcriptional program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Choe1">[40]</xref>. Reducing the expression of both of these genes significantly increased resistance to <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002453-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002453.s001">Text S1</xref>). As a control, the expression of <italic>skn-1</italic> was additionally reduced by RNAi, which abrogated the phenotypes, confirming that the increased resistance was dependent on <italic>skn-1</italic>. In previous work, loss of <italic>gsk-3</italic> or <italic>wdr-23</italic> both increased survival upon exposure to oxidative stress, however there was little (<italic>wdr-23</italic>) to no (<italic>gsk-3</italic>) concomitant increase in longevity when lifespan was assayed on non-pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-An2">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Choe1">[40]</xref>. Therefore, the significant increase in pathogen resistance observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002453-g006">Figure 6A</xref> is not just a byproduct of causing a long-lived phenotype in general. To look at the effect of increased SKN-1 activity by another means, we examined two strains in which SKN-1 is over-produced because the strains carry extra copies of SKN-1::GFP.

Upon exposure to intestinal pathogens, Ce-Duox1/BLI-3 is activated by an unknown mechanism to produce extracellular ROS. In addition to possibly having direct antimicrobial properties, ROS generated by Ce-Duox1/BLI-3 (likely in the form of membrane diffusible H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) activates the p38 MAPK signaling cascade, which results in the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of SKN-1. SKN-1 carries out a transcriptional program to produce proteins with detoxification functions that eliminate ROS and help repair or recycle damaged molecules. Overall, we demonstrated that this response is functionally important during infection; loss of <italic>skn-1</italic> increased susceptibility of the worms to pathogen, whereas increasing SKN-1's activity increased resistance</p><fig id="ppat-1002453-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1002453.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Proposed model for SKN-1 activation during infection.</title><p>See the main text for a description.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1002453.g008"/></fig><p>Interestingly, there is evidence for Nrf-related transcription factors like SKN-1 protecting against immune-derived oxidative stress in other systems, suggesting broad conservation of this protective mechanism. A study by Jain et al. showed that the SKN-1 ortholog, Yap1 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisae</italic>, protected this microbe against Ce-Duox1/BLI-3-derived ROS produced by <italic>C. elegans.</italic> Specifically, it was demonstrated that a <italic>dar</italic> (distended anal region) phenotype caused by colonization with <italic>S. cerevisae</italic> was abrogated by a Yap1 mutation. The <italic>dar</italic> phenotype was dependent on <italic>bli-3</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Jain1">[5]</xref>. Therefore it appears that Nrf-related transcription factors not only protect the host against oxidative stress during host-pathogen interactions, but also protect eukaryotic pathogens and enable their virulence. In higher animals, there is also evidence that Nrf-related transcription factors respond to immune-induced oxidative stress. For example, increasing concentrations of HOCl were shown to increase activation of Nrf2 and immune responsive genes in mouse macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Woods1">[41]</xref>. Because Nrf transcription factors generally upregulate the production of &#x0201c;Phase 2&#x0201d; detoxification enzymes with activities such as metabolizing free radicals and conjugating xenobiotics and peroxidized lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Oliveira1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Park1">[11]</xref>, it is logical that their activity would be helpful during pathogen attack when there is often excess ROS production and cellular stress. It is therefore not surprising that one central signaling pathway, p38 MAPK signaling, has a crucial role in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> response to both pathogen and oxidative stress.</p><p>When considering the components of the p38 MAPK pathway that govern oxidative stress response, SEK-1 and PMK-1 have well-established functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Inoue1">[12]</xref>. The importance of two upstream components, NSY-1 and TIR-1 is less clear and may depend on the oxidative stressor used to assay function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Inoue1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Hayakawa1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Kondo1">[17]</xref>.

The loss of <italic>tir-1</italic> did not cause a significant change in expression, suggesting that it is not involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002453-g004">Figure 4G, S</xref>3B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002453.s001">Text S1</xref>). These data suggest that other components may feed into the pathway upstream of SEK-1 to activate SKN-1. Though we tested several potential candidate kinases with previously established roles in p38 MAPK signaling including MEK-1, MKK-4 and IKK&#x003b5;-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Kell1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Kim2">[43]</xref>, none of them reduced SKN-1 activity (data not shown). In mammalian systems, a thioredoxin redox sensor inhibits the mammalian homolog of NSY-1, ASK-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Liu1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Saitoh1">[45]</xref>. ROS production causes the disassociation of the thioredoxin and allows an active signaling complex to form with other adaptor molecules enabling p38 MAPK signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Matsuzawa1">[46]</xref>. We are actively exploring if a thioredoxin is involved in activating NSY-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>In addition to SKN-1, p38 MAPK signaling in <italic>C. elegans</italic> was previously shown to regulate another bZIP transcription factor, ATF-7. Loss of <italic>atf-7</italic> enhances susceptibility to pathogen. However, rather than simply acting to induce immune activation, ATF-7 normally represses innate immune activation. Phosphorylation by PMK-1 turns ATF-7 from a repressor into an activator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Shivers1">[15]</xref>. Since ROS released from Ce-Duox1/BLI-3 activates SKN-1 activity via p38 MAPK signaling, one could postulate that ROS also activates ATF-7. Alternatively, the signaling cascade might have some way of distinguishing between different inputs to selectively activate these transcription factors depending on the stimulus. Such a model might allow better coordination of gene expression to meet specific challenges. One gene shown to be regulated by ATF-7, <italic>T24B8.5</italic>, encodes a ShK-like toxin peptide which has predicted antimicrobial activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Shivers1">[15]</xref>. Perhaps SKN-1 coordinates a &#x0201c;defensive&#x0201d; arm of the innate immune response by regulating genes encoding enzymes involved in protecting against and repairing cellular damage, whereas ATF-7 regulates an &#x0201c;offensive&#x0201d; arm by controlling genes encoding for activities that are directly antimicrobial. A more thorough study of the genes regulated by ATF-7 and SKN-1 on pathogen would need to be carried out to investigate this hypothesis.</p><p>The precise role(s) of ROS generated by Ce-Duox1/BLI-3 in protecting the worm from infection is not yet completely understood, though this study implicates an important signaling function. On <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, reducing expression of <italic>bli-3</italic> increased the susceptibility phenotype of <italic>skn-1</italic>. The incomplete epistasis suggests that Ce-Duox1 has additional roles in protecting the worm from the pathogen independent of activating <italic>skn-1.</italic> One role could be activating other transcription factors regulated by p38 MAPK signaling such as ATF-7, as mentioned above. A potential role, independent of signaling, is in host physical barrier function. The ROS generated by Ce-Duox1/BLI-3 could be utilized by peroxidases to increase the impermeability of the ECM (extracellular matrix) in the worm intestine, analogous with how peroxidases use ROS generated by Ce-Duox1/BLI-3 to cross-link the cuticle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Thein1">[47]</xref>. There is some evidence for NADPH oxidases contributing to barrier function in the mosquito gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Kumar1">[48]</xref>. Another possibility is that ROS generated by Ce-Duox1/BLI-3, is turned into a more potent antimicrobial, as is known to happen in other systems, including the oral and respiratory mucosa of animals, in which DUOXs generate the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> necessary for lactoperoxidase (LPO) to oxidize thiocyanate to create the microcidal compound hypothiocyanite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Forteza1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Geiszt1">[50]</xref>.</p><p>Our susceptibility analysis indicated that the genetic interactions between <italic>skn-1</italic> and <italic>bli-3</italic> are different on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> than on <italic>E. faecalis</italic>. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002453-g007">Figure 7</xref> demonstrated that in the absence of Ce-Duox1/BLI-3, and only on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, SKN-1 is activating a transcriptional program that is harmful to the worm, but in the presence of Ce-Duox1/BLI-3, SKN-1 is protective, as expected. On <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, in contrast, the presence of SKN-1 is protective in both the <italic>bli-3</italic> and wild-type backgrounds. Perhaps the explanation for the difference lies in the fact that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is actively manipulating the host innate immune response through production of redox-active factors such as pyocyanin. In previous work using human respiratory epithelial cells, pyocyanin production by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was shown to cause increased oxidative stress by potentiating the intracellular production of superoxide in the host cells. Pyocyanin, like Ce-Duox1/BLI-3 uses NADPH and molecular oxygen to create ROS, so these host and pathogen factors are potentially competing for the same substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Rada1">[27]</xref>. We postulate that intracellular superoxide production by pyocyanin, in contrast to the extracellular production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by Ce-Duox1/BLI-3, activates a different SKN-1 transcriptional program that is very harmful to the worm. In a previous investigation, different oxidative stressors caused significant differences in SKN-1's transcriptional program, so this idea is not with out precedent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Oliveira1">[10]</xref>. This hypothesis could explain the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002453-g007">Figure 7B</xref>. When Ce-Duox1/BLI-3 is present, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced activates SKN-1 to carry out a protective response. It may also inhibit pyocyanin activity by decreasing availability of NADPH and oxygen. Loss of <italic>skn-1</italic> is detrimental, but loss of <italic>bli-3</italic> when <italic>skn-1</italic> is present allows this transcription factor to be influenced by the ROS generated by the pathogen resulting in a transcriptional program that is actively harmful to the host. Testing this hypothesis will require further study.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that the Nrf-family transcription factor SKN-1 is induced by exposure to pathogen and has a protective function during infection. We additionally showed that components of the p38 MAPK pathway, including NSY-1, SEK-1 and PMK-1, are necessary for this response. Finally, ROS produced by the dual oxidase Ce-Duox1/BLI-3 in response to pathogen was shown to trigger SKN-1 activity. Because Ce-Duox1/BLI-3 plays an important role in activating p38 MAPK signaling and SKN-1 activity, defining how this dual oxidase's activity is triggered will be an important area of future investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were grown and maintained as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002453-Hope1">[51]</xref>.
