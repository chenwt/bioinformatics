Better productivity, overall increased in fruit quality and taste, resilience to chilled storage and resistance to internal browning are among the key advantages of the MD-2 as compared with its previous predecessor, the Smooth Cayenne. Here, we present the genome sequence of the MD-2 pineapple (<italic>Ananas comosus</italic> (L.) Merr.) by using the hybrid sequencing technology from two highly reputable platforms, i.e. the PacBio long sequencing reads and the accurate Illumina short reads. Our draft genome achieved 99.6% genome coverage with 27,017 predicted protein-coding genes while 45.21% of the genome was identified as repetitive elements. Furthermore, differential expression of ripening RNASeq library of pineapple fruits revealed ethylene-related transcripts, believed to be involved in regulating the process of non-climacteric pineapple fruit ripening. The MD-2 pineapple draft genome serves as an example of how a complex heterozygous genome is amenable to whole genome sequencing by using a hybrid technology that is both economical and accurate. The genome will make genomic applications more feasible as a medium to understand complex biological processes specific to pineapple.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>pineapple</kwd><kwd>plant genome</kwd><kwd>fruit ripening</kwd><kwd>hybrid assembly</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="SEC1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The MD-2 is one of the best tasting pineapple varieties, that is, not only good in terms of its flesh flavour, but also in its overall fruit appearance resulting in an increase in its marketing value. Taxonomically, the pineapple is derived from the Bromeliaceae family, under the order of Poales, which includes the grass, sedges and cattail family. The family hosts 56 genera with approximately 2,600 species and many of them are ornamental. In the family, pineapple is the only species with an active global trade for its flavourful fruits. The species is usually diploid with 2<italic>n</italic> = =50<xref rid="dsw026-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> and with an estimated haploid genome size of 526 Mb.<xref rid="dsw026-B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Since the plant is self-incompatible and usually parthenocarpic, the plant is commonly propagated vegetatively. This method of cultural system is known to increase its heterozygosity and development of an inbred pure line is difficult if not impossible. The high level of heterozygosity in pineapple is a challenge with regards to decoding its whole genome. Nevertheless, with the advances in sequencing technology and bioinformatics software, sequencing a complex heterozygous genome such as the pineapple is now feasible.</p><p>The fruit is known to be non-climacteric, as it does not have the accompanied burst of ethylene production and respiration spike during ripening, as normally observed in climacteric fruits such as banana and tomato. More importantly, the fruit will not improve its flavour once harvested and post-harvest exposure to external ethylene application will only assist in degreening its skin but will not improve its palate. Current understanding of fruit ripening regulation is limited mainly to the climacteric fruits. By the virtue of the genomic tool available for the model plant (i.e. tomato), many of the key regulator to achieve ripening has been elucidated.<xref rid="dsw026-B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> In parallel, increasing number of studies are now devoted to understand the non-climacteric fruit, and various fruits have been proposed as the model plant to decipher non-climacteric fruit ripening. Several different hormones had been recognized in regulating fruit ripening.<xref rid="dsw026-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Nonetheless, the focus in the study of ripening has always been the ethylene hormone, as it is known to be produced abundantly during the process and its suppression deems to inhibit ripening of many fruit species.<xref rid="dsw026-B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dsw026-B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Altogether, these results have been inconclusive as to what control the climacteric switch in plant and no single model has been proposed to represent the regulation of non-climacteric fruit ripening.<xref rid="dsw026-B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Many hypotheses have been proposed as to why the non-climacteric fruit can still ripen without the ethylene burst.</p><p>In pineapple, general pathways and transcripts involved in its ripening process have been recognized through microarray analysis<xref rid="dsw026-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and comparative expressed-sequence-tag (EST) analysis,<xref rid="dsw026-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> respectively. Moreover, assembly of pineapple fruit transcriptome RNASeq data has enriched transcriptomic database significantly.<xref rid="dsw026-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> But, thus far, the role of ethylene or other hormones in the ripening process of pineapple fruit is still vague. This information is highly crucial as it leads to the revelation of the intricate regulation of ripening process in pineapple fruits, which ultimately enables us to better control its quality based on its economic preferences. With the advances in genomic sequencing technology, decoding a genome has become a routine procedure. However, the challenge lies in the assembly and in making sense of the big data being produced. Recently, the genome of pineapple has been published but the sample used to assemble the genome was derived from pineapple variety F153. This sequencing project, we have embarked on, is independent of the recently published genome assembly by Ming et al.<xref rid="dsw026-B11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> of the F153 pineapple variety. In this paper, we report the sequence of the commercially important MD-2 pineapple which was assembled using predominantly error corrected long PacBio reads. With the challenges of repetitive and complex multi-allelic region of plant genomes, we believe that the long sequencing read technology is able to tackle the problem and to provide a complete genome assembly as it was shown with the human genome.<xref rid="dsw026-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> It is our motivation, to solve the complex heterozygous genome of pineapple using the long sequencing read technology, but due to its low input and high error rate, the technology still requires error correction before it can be used directly in genome assembly, especially at medium coverage (i.e. less than &#x000d7;30 coverage). In order to achieve this, we borrowed the accuracy from Illumina short reads to improve the long PacBio reads using novoLR package<xref rid="dsw026-B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> from Novocraft to perform the error correction. The genome serves as an example of how hybrid sequencing technology is feasible to assemble complex plant genome such as the pineapple.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2"><title>2. Materials and methods</title><sec id="SEC2.1"><title>2.1. Plant materials</title><p>The cultivated MD-2 pineapple was provided by the Malaysian Pineapple Industry Board. The variety was originally developed through a series of pineapple breeding programme and was initially released to Del Monte Fresh Produce Hawaii Inc for evaluation and commercialization. The variety was derived from a cross of another two distinct Pineapple Research Institute hybrids, namely 58-1184 and 59-443<xref rid="dsw026-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> which contribute to its high Cayenne genetic background in MD-2.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2.2"><title>2.2. Sample preparation and sequencing</title><p>Sample preparations for sequencing using Illumina and PacBio platforms were as in Redwan et al.<xref rid="dsw026-B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> DNA sample extracted from pineapple leaves were processed for sequencing library preparation using TruSeq PCR-Free kit (Illumina) with 350 and 550 bp average insert sizes according to manufacturer protocol. The sequencing service and library preparation were provided by Macrogen, Korea. The two libraries were sequenced using HiSeq platform (Illumina), each on a single lane using 100 bp paired-end sequencing format. In addition, 750 bp average insert size sequencing library was also prepared in-house with minor modification to the manufacturer protocol. The library was then sequenced on the MiSeq platform (Illumina) using the 300 bp paired-end sequencing format. All the sequence reads obtained from Illumina platforms were quality trimmed and length filtered using fqtrim software (available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/fqtrim/">http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/fqtrim/</ext-link> (9 June 2016 date last accessed)) to a minimum quality of Q20 and 50 bp in length. In conjunction, all of the Illumina adaptors were included in the parameter for fqtrim to perform adaptor trimming. Altogether, the three libraries provided 81.28 Gb of trimmed and filtered sequencing data which translated to &#x000d7;154.7 coverage of the pineapple genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/dnares/dsw026/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1a</ext-link>).</p><p>Library preparation for PacBio sequencing was performed on high-quality genomic DNA using P4-C2 and P5-C3 sequencing chemistry and library preparation according to PacBio Sample Net-Shared Protocol available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pacb.com/">http://www.pacb.com/</ext-link> (9 June 2016 date last accessed). The 20 kb library was sequenced using PacBio RSII platform with 32 SMRT&#x000ae; cells. Final data of 14.85 Gb sequencing reads was pre-processed by SMRTBellCleaner&#x02122; software from Novocraft to align and trim SMRTbell&#x02122; adaptor from the filtered subreads of PacBio. This reduced the total long reads to 11.78 Gb in total size which was error corrected using the 350 and 750 bp sequencing library of Illumina short reads (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/dnares/dsw026/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1b</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC2.3"><title>2.3.

Based on the taxid file of the contigs identity obtained from the similarity search and the gc distribution, the final results obtained were plotted using R-script <italic>makeblobplot.R</italic> from the Blobology software. Based on the taxon-annotated GC-coverage plots (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/dnares/dsw026/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>), the majority of contigs sampled formed only a single &#x02018;blob&#x02019; represented mostly by Poales, the order taxonomical classification of pineapple. The majority of the sampled contigs had GC-content in between 20% and 60%.

Error correction of long PacBio reads</title><p>Advancement in long-read sequencing technology such as from PacBio has proven to alleviate many of the difficulties in assembly plant genomes. However, direct use of PacBio in genome assembly is not possible at low to medium sequencing coverage, due to the innate high error rate of single-pass sequence reads. Thus, in order to improve the accuracy of the PacBio, high accuracy short reads library from 350 to 750 bp average insert size were used by using novoLR&#x02122; package<xref rid="dsw026-B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> developed by Novocraft. The programme is divided into two parts; pre-processing of the PacBio reads by novoLRcleaver&#x02122; and aligning and variant calling by novoAlign&#x02122; and novoLRcorrector&#x02122;, respectively. Error correction began by mapping the short reads onto the long reads using the novoAlign&#x02122; programme and variant calling was performed using novoLRcorrector&#x02122; to produce error corrected PacBio reads. After error correction, the number of error-corrected read base was further reduced to 56% (8.34 Gb) of the initial total subreads produced (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/dnares/dsw026/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1b</ext-link>). Much of the data was lost because any subreads that were a replicate of each other (i.e. derived from the same DNA template) were removed by novoLRcleaver&#x02122; and only the longest replicates were chosen to represent the template. This is because reads at the same start and end will not help in improving the contiguity of the genome assembly; rather it would further complicate assembly process with the minor variants it may carry due to random error rate innate to PacBio sequencing profile. As the sequencing library preparation improved in terms of the template DNA fragment size (by increasing the BP start to 9,000 bp), more read base survived the novoLRcleaver&#x02122; process, as there were less shorter templates (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/dnares/dsw026/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1b</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC2.5"><title>2.5. Genome assembly</title><p>The genome of MD-2 pineapple was assembled using only the &#x000d7;15.9 (8.34 Gb) of error corrected PacBio sequence reads, with highest read length of 27,913 bp and average read length of 4,684 bp. Assembly was performed using Celera Assembler software version 8.3rc1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wgs-assembler.sourceforge.net/">http://wgs-assembler.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>) (9 June 2016, date last accessed) with parameters as summarized in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/dnares/dsw026/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link>. The first assembly produced a draft with a total size that was 48% larger than the haploid genome size of pineapple and N50 of 25,277 bp. The expanded genome size from the assembly was due to the failure of the software to resolve the double haplotype that existed in the genome due to its high heterozygosity rate. An overlap-based assembly as adopted in Celera Assembler should be able to resolve low heterozygosity rate as it allows tolerant mismatch in the discovery of overlaps among the sequence reads. However, with higher allele differences between the haplotype, assembler may produce different composites of the polymorphic paths into the assembly,<xref rid="dsw026-B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> leading to the construction of different unitigs representing the variants observed and thus causing an inflated assembly.</p><p>In order to reduce the redundancy that may be present in the assembly, contigs were binned into two based on length cut-off of 25,000 bp. The bin with contigs smaller than 25,000 bp were then mapped to another bin containing contigs larger than 25,000 bp using GMAP<xref rid="dsw026-B19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> with default parameter and any shorter contigs with hits and target coverage of more than 80% were removed from the assembly. In addition, the error corrected PacBio reads were also mapped to the assembly to remove contigs with an average coverage of less than one, as it may represent a spurious combination of the polymorphic block not present in the genome.<xref rid="dsw026-B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Mapping with the error-corrected PacBio reads onto the genome was performed using Blasr<xref rid="dsw026-B20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> with parameter &#x02018;-bestn 5 &#x02013;minPctIdentity 90 &#x02013;placeRepeatsRandomly&#x02019;. At this point, the assembly did not improve much, with less than 16% reduction of the total size assembly compared with the original assembly. Furthermore, all of the Illumina short reads from the three libraries were mapped to the genome using novoAlign&#x02122; with parameter &#x02018;-t 20,3 &#x02013;hlimit 6 -H 20 -p 5,20 -r All 50&#x02019; producing a BAM alignment file. The mapping quality of the short reads was then accessed from the alignment file and the assembly was then disjointed at low-quality mapping site (Q-score of less than 10). Subsequently, the same method to reduce redundancy by a similar search as above was carried out again for the second time to the fragmented contigs but with length cut-off of 1,000 bp. Once again, the short reads were mapped to the draft using the same parameter for scaffolding purpose via BESST software<xref rid="dsw026-B21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> after the previous fragmentation. Thereupon, the draft assembly achieved the total size of 508 Mb, which was 96.6% of the estimated genome size of a pineapple and improved N50 of 34,762 bp.</p><p>The contiguity of the draft was further improved using multiple scaffold software for different sequence data. First, SSPACE-LongRead<xref rid="dsw026-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> software was used to scaffold the draft using error corrected PacBio reads, then Quiver tool (default parameter) via SMRT analysis was used to perform consensus calling using uncorrected PacBio reads, followed by another round of scaffolding using in-house PacBio long transcripts sequence data of pineapple using GMAP as aligner and L_RNA_Scaffolder<xref rid="dsw026-B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> for scaffolding. The draft was then further improved using SSPACE-LongRead software but in this round, all filtered subreads uncorrected PacBio reads were used. Finally, consensus calling was performed on the final draft using novoLRpolish&#x02122;, utilizing all the trimmed and filtered Illumina short reads, and uncorrected novoLRcleaver&#x02122; processed long PacBio reads. After multiple rounds of scaffolding, the draft assembly improved significantly with N50 of 153,084 bp, maximum scaffold length of 1,287,057 bp and a total assembly size of 524.070 Mb.</p><p>Genome quality assessment was evaluated by remapping short reads, and the long reads error corrected PacBio to the final draft using novoAlign&#x02122; and Blasr, respectively. More than 91% of the short reads mapped to the genome in proper pairs and more than 96% of long PacBio reads mapped to the genome. The high percentage of reads mapped back to the draft suggests that most of the reads were incorporated into the genome and thus most of the genome were assembled. In addition, the genome was also evaluated using Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach (CEGMA)<xref rid="dsw026-B24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> in order to identify the correct exon&#x02013;intron structure of 248 Core Eukaryotic Genes (CEGs) in the assembly.

Results and discussion</title><sec id="SEC3.1"><title>3.1. Sequencing and assembly</title><p>Sequencing of the MD-2 pineapple was carried out using the two forefront sequencing platforms, Illumina and PacBio, to produce short and long sequencing reads, respectively. Genomic DNA was obtained from leaf tissues and was sequenced using the Illumina platform in three libraries, each with different average insert sizes; 350, 550 and 750 bp. The first two libraries each produced 42 Gbp and 46 Gbp of 100 paired-end reads, respectively, and the latter produced 9 Gbp of 300 bp paired-end reads. All of the reads were trimmed to yield a final coverage of &#x000d7;154. Sequencing of 20 kb template size library on the PacBio platform produced 14.85 Gb sequence data. After error correction, the data was reduced to 8.34 Gb, which translated to a &#x000d7;15.9 of high accuracy long sequencing reads of the pineapple genome. Maximum read length before the assembly was 37,591 bp which was reduced to 27,913 bp after error correction. Two approaches were taken to find the most optimum assembly: <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of only error corrected long PacBio reads using the well-known, Celera Assembler<xref rid="dsw026-B53" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref> and the recent strategy of long reads assembly-based mapping on the <italic>de-bruijn</italic> assembled short reads contigs, implemented in DBG2OLC.<xref rid="dsw026-B54" ref-type="bibr"><sup>54</sup></xref> After comprehensive comparison between the two assemblies, the Celera assembly was selected as it contained more CEGs as assessed with CEGMA and better mapability of the pineapple transcripts obtained from the NCBI database and in-house database (<xref ref-type="table" rid="dsw026-T1">Table 1</xref>). Although DBG2OLC strategy produced larger N50, Celera assembly is superior in terms of its accuracy which is what we considered to be more important. After contiguity improvement using multiple software for scaffolding, the final Celera assembly contained 8,448 scaffolds covering 99.6% of the genome with 901 scaffolds (i.e. 50% of the assembly) at a length of at least 153,084 bp (i.e. N50). The CEGMA<sup>24</sup> assessment found 245 out of 248 (98.8%) CEGs with 93.2% of the matches were with alignment spanning more than 70% (i.e. complete). In addition, more than 95% of the short reads mapped to the genome in a proper pair and 96% of the long PacBio reads mapped uniquely to the genome. Earlier before the advancement of next-generation sequencing, sequencing a heterozygous sample was thought to be impossible. Nowadays, with massive parallel sequencing technology of the second-generation sequencing such as Illumina and the long sequencing technology such as the PacBio platform, <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the heterozygous diploid sample is feasible.

This method is made possible by phasing out the haplotype that was not present in the sequencing data of an F1 progeny which was derived from a cross between the sequenced sample and another variety. With &#x000d7;400 Illumina reads, &#x000d7;2 Moleculo synthetic long reads, &#x000d7;1 454 reads, &#x000d7;5 PacBio single-molecule long reads and 9,400 BACs, the assembly achieved scaffold N50 of 11.8 Mb and genome coverage of 72.6%. Similar to other short-reads-based assemblies, the assembly also falls short in assembling the repeats, leading to the reduced genome coverage. Nevertheless, the assembly provides as an intact reference for numerous genome studies in pineapple. In comparison to our genome assembly, our draft which was assembled using the only &#x000d7;15.4 of error-corrected long PacBio reads and &#x000d7;154 of Illumina reads (only for error-correction and scaffolding) is inferior in term of contiguity but is able to achieve higher genome coverage and contained a higher number of CEGs.

Moreover, genome validation using the COMPASS tool showed that more than 89.7% of the F153 assembly was assembled in our genome. In addition, yet again the DBG2OLC assembly was not any superior to the CELERA assembly in term of coverage from the COMPASS metrics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="dsw026-T2">Table 2</xref>). Despite of our larger assembly size, most of our assembled scaffolds were validated by the F153 assembly as shown by the validity metrics and parsimony. Due to our larger assembly size in comparison to F153 assembly, the validity metric scored higher than one, which denoted that there were more alignments of the assembly onto the reference than the total length of the reference itself. In addition, the parsimony metrics of 1.8 inferred that there was a slightly more of the assembled length than the total alignment length that can form the continuous coverage on the reference (i.e. coverage island).

However, due to a limited number of long reads to resolve the repeats, the scaffolds were not been able to be merged longer. Interestingly, at the regions where there high coverage mapping of our assembly onto the F153 assembly, there was no mapping found from the DBG2OLC scaffold. This showed that the region had been eliminated during assembly in DBG2OLC which altogether may reduce its complexity so as to enable the better contiguity as shown by its longer N50.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3.3"><title>3.3.

Strong evidence in previous studies have been shown to support whole genome duplication among the Poales in at least a single event after divergent from commelinid.<xref rid="dsw026-B68" ref-type="bibr"><sup>68</sup></xref> It is interesting to note that across taxa, the largest gene reduction was observed in pineapple. In parallel of pineapple&#x02019;s low gene density (33% reduction as compared with 430 Mb rice genome), genome-wide gene reduction unique to the species may have occurred. This hypothesis can be investigated through comparative genomic by synteny analysis but with the level of contiguity presented in this draft, this sort of analysis is computer-intensive and difficult for inference as the scaffolds are not presented at the chromosome size. In addition, the divergent time between <italic>A. comosus</italic> and the grass family was estimated to be circa 110.38 Myr and the split of the commelinid was estimated to be around 128 Myr, in accordance with the commelinid divergent time estimated in previous study.<xref rid="dsw026-B69" ref-type="bibr"><sup>69</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="SEC3.6"><title>3.6. Role of ethylene in pineapple fruit ripening</title><p>In the study of fruit ripening, ethylene has been the focal point in dissecting this complex process, as the hormone is emitted abundantly during ripening. But this is only true with the climacteric fruits and the role of the hormone has only been clearly deciphered in fruits that release and respond to the hormone to induce their ripening process (i.e. climacteric fruits). In non-climacteric fruits, there are still large gaps of knowledge and arguments on the role of ethylene in this group of fruits which do not produce and response to ethylene during their ripening process. In bridging this gap, we performed differential expression analysis of the mature pineapple fruits RNASeq libraries differing in their level of ripening as determined by their skin colour. Overall, 99 genes were differentially expressed (&#x0003e;2-fold) at a significant level of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/dnares/dsw026/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 4</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/dnares/dsw026/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 4</ext-link>), but for the sake of brevity, the focus is given only to ethylene-related transcripts.</p><p>Among the differentially regulated transcripts identified, four of the seven transcripts categorized under transcription regulator were related to ethylene and these were the <italic>ERF109</italic>, <italic>ERF3</italic>, <italic>ERF008</italic> and <italic>TEM1 AP2/</italic>ERF and B3 domain transcription repression. The presence of differentially regulated ethylene-related transcription factors in pineapple fruit supports the current notion of the involvement of ethylene in non-climacteric fruit ripening, despite the absence of ethylene burst during its ripening process.<xref rid="dsw026-B70" ref-type="bibr"><sup>70</sup></xref> In addition, a transcript, <italic>ACMD2_01443</italic>, with homology to <italic>ACO1</italic> (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase 1) gene was also down-regulated. The product of this gene is known to be the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of ethylene together with the <italic>ACS</italic> (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) gene. The <italic>ACS</italic> gene were present in the genome in seven copies, but none were differentially regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsw026-F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Similar observation of <italic>ACO</italic> gene down-regulation was made in other non-climacteric fruits, namely strawberry<xref rid="dsw026-B70" ref-type="bibr"><sup>70</sup></xref> and grape.<xref rid="dsw026-B71" ref-type="bibr"><sup>71</sup></xref> In climacteric fruits, <italic>ACO</italic> expression can be varied, with a different copy of the <italic>ACO</italic> genes up-regulated and down-regulated significantly through ripening. The various expression pattern of <italic>ACO</italic> copies during ripening of climacteric fruits were denoted to different copies of the <italic>ACO</italic> gene required to maintain system I and to induce system II.<xref rid="dsw026-B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>

</p><p>Recent studies showed that young non-climacteric fruit of strawberry and citrus produced ethylene burst prior to ripening and then it gradually subsided as ripening continues.<xref rid="dsw026-B70" ref-type="bibr"><sup>70</sup></xref> The ethylene burst occurred was in concomitant with the high <italic>ACO</italic> expression and thus, the gene may be responsible for the transient peak in non-climacteric fruit ripening. It is interesting to investigate whether the down-regulation of <italic>ACO</italic> gene observed in pineapple and the peak observed in green mature fruit followed the same ethylene production pattern. Further physiological study of pineapple fruit ripening is required to support the hypothesis. It is important to note that not all fruits in the same climacteric pattern carry the same mechanism to achieve ripening, as some differences may occur. For example, although most of the climacteric fruits have varied expression pattern of the <italic>ACO</italic> copies during ripening, differential expression analysis of pear fruit revealed that all four copies of the <italic>ACO</italic> gene were up-regulated.<xref rid="dsw026-B72" ref-type="bibr"><sup>72</sup></xref> But the key to their similarity is that the high expression of the <italic>ACO</italic> gene occurred in concomitant with the ethylene burst and is maintained through until the fruit ripens. The similar key for the non-climacteric fruit to achieve ripening is hoped to be deciphered in the near future.</p><p>There are two hypotheses, as to why the non-climacteric fruits do not undergo auto-induced system II ethylene. First, an investigation using two melon varieties with differing climacteric pattern suggests blockage in the auto-induced synthesis of ethylene.<xref rid="dsw026-B73" ref-type="bibr"><sup>73</sup></xref> This hypothesis cannot be inferred in other genomes as the loci causing the blockage is not yet elucidated but it is known that it does not relate to ethylene controlling enzyme (i.e. <italic>ACS</italic>, <italic>ACO</italic>) and ethylene receptor gene (<italic>ERS</italic>) based on genetic mapping.<xref rid="dsw026-B73" ref-type="bibr"><sup>73</sup></xref> Second, the study of the strawberry fruit ripening proposes that the non-climacteric fruits function with type-II ethylene receptor, and thus do not require abundant ethylene because the ethylene negative regulators, <italic>CTR</italic> is loosely bound by the type-II ethylene receptor (i.e. as compared with type I in climacteric fruit). Thus, only minimal amount of ethylene is required to release the <italic>CTR</italic> from negatively regulating the ethylene response pathway.<xref rid="dsw026-B70" ref-type="bibr"><sup>70</sup></xref> In the pineapple genome, there were five copies of the type-II ethylene receptor (<italic>ETR2</italic>) and six copies of type-I ethylene receptor (a single <italic>ETR1</italic> copy and five of <italic>ERS1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dsw026-F7">Fig. 7</xref>). However, unlike in strawberry, none of the ethylene receptors mentioned above were differentially regulated. Nonetheless, most of them were expressed during the ripening process and one copy of <italic>ETR2</italic> gene had constantly high Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million value in comparison to all other receptors. Similarly, no significant changes of the <italic>ETR2</italic> expression was observed during ripening of capsicum fruit but another variant of type-II ethylene receptor <italic>ETR4</italic> were found constantly abundant throughout ripening of the fruit and upon exposure to ethylene inhibitor the expression decreased significantly and the ripening was delayed.<xref rid="dsw026-B74" ref-type="bibr"><sup>74</sup></xref> In grape <italic>ETR2</italic> expression increased as ripening progressing in concomitant with the type-I ethylene receptor, <italic>ETR1</italic><italic>.</italic><xref rid="dsw026-B71" ref-type="bibr"><sup>71</sup></xref> Although it is inconclusive to determine the contribution of <italic>ETR2</italic> in inducing ethylene response pathway in pineapple, its high expression in both green and yellow mature fruit over the type-1 receptor suggested its importance to achieve ripening. Non-climacteric ripening may not require the ethylene burst to be maintained throughout the ripening process, but the initial burst as observed in strawberry and citrus may probably be sufficient to utilize similar ethylene response pathway and to promote ethylene-dependent genes to achieve ripening.
<fig id="dsw026-F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Regulation of ethylene production, from left is class I, auto-inhibition and class II auto-catalytic and level of expression of ethylene receptors during ripening of pineapple fruit. In class I, during the basal level of ethylene production, ethylene response pathway does not occur as the negative regulator (<italic>CTR</italic>) is bound and activated by the ethylene receptors, which lead to subsequent degradation of <italic>EIN2</italic>, <italic>EIN3</italic> and <italic>EIL1</italic> through ubiquitination by SCP complex and 26 proteosome. In class II, the presence of the hormone will further induce its production, leading to ethylene spike observed during floral senescence and fruit ripening process. Most importantly, the binding of ethylene at its receptors will release and inactivate the <italic>CTR</italic>, promoting cleavage of carboxyl end of <italic>EIN2</italic> to the nucleus and activate the nuclear transcription factor <italic>EIN3/EIL1</italic> and <italic>ERF1</italic>, which induce the ethylene responsive genes. Two types of ethylene receptors have been identified at the ER lumen. It is hypothesized that non-climacteric fruits rely on type-II ethylene receptor, which binds to <italic>CTR</italic> more loosely compared with type-I. Thus, only minimal amount of ethylene required to release the negative regulator, <italic>CTR</italic>. On the left is the heatmap of the transcripts with homology to ethylene receptors. None of the ethylene receptors were differentially expressed, but one transcript with homology to ETR2, type II ethylene receptors was the highest expression in green mature fruit.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="dsw026f7p"/></fig>
</p><p>In conclusion, the MD-2 pineapple draft genome presented here serves as another milestone in the sequencing technology. Sequencing a heterozygous genome is proven feasible by combining the long PacBio reads with the highly accurate Illumina short reads as they complement each other. The short reads even though they are highly accurate, they are not been able to resolve large tandem repeats that may exist in the genome. Similarly, the long reads even though they are long and may extend through the large repeats and complex region, at low sequencing outputs its accuracy hinders its use independently. Transcriptomic study of ripening pineapple fruit with the assistance of the draft genome as a reference suggests a similar role of ethylene in the regulation of ripening in non-climacteric tropical pineapple fruit. The availability of pineapple draft genome will revamp pineapple research as more molecular applications are now feasible to achieve greater understanding in the biology of pineapple.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data availability</title><p>This Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession LSRQ00000000.
