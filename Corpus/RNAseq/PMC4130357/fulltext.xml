Here we identify recurrent rearrangements between estrogen receptor gene <italic>ESR1</italic> and its neighbor <italic>CCDC170</italic>, which are enriched in the more aggressive and endocrine-resistant luminal-B tumors, through large-scale analyses of breast cancer transcriptome and copy number alterations. Further screening of 200 ER+ breast cancers identifies eight <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> positive tumors. These fusions encode N-terminally truncated CCDC170 proteins (&#x00394;CCDC170). When introduced into ER+ breast cancer cells, &#x00394;CCDC170 leads to markedly increased cell motility and anchorage-independent growth, reduced endocrine sensitivity, and enhanced xenograft tumor formation. Mechanistic studies suggest that &#x00394;CCDC170 engages Gab1 signalosome to potentiate growth factor signaling and enhance cell motility. Together, this study identifies neoplastic <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> fusions in a more aggressive subset of ER+ breast cancer, which suggests a new concept of ER pathobiology in breast cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The crucial role of recurrent gene fusions in the development of solid tumors has been recently appreciated after several milestone discoveries<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. In particular, the discovery of an <italic>EML4-ALK</italic> fusion in &#x0223c;4% of lung cancer has led to development of an effective drug with stunning clinical impacts<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has greatly enhanced gene fusion discovery in solid tumors, which has led to the identification of a <italic>VTI1A-TCF7L2</italic> fusion in 3% of colon cancers<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, a <italic>BCOR-CCNB3</italic> fusion in 4% of bone sarcomas<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, and a <italic>FGFR-TACC</italic> fusion in 3% of glioblastomas<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Although low in percentage, these neoplastic gene fusions will likely advance the genetic subtyping of solid tumors that may be curable by targeting them. In breast cancer, a recent RNA sequencing (RNAseq) study reported multiple fusions of the <italic>MAST</italic> and <italic>NOTCH</italic> family genes; whereas individual gene fusions appear to rarely recur<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Another genome sequencing study revealed a <italic>MAGI3-AKT3</italic> gene fusion in 3% of breast cancers that is enriched in triple-negative tumors<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. To date, the role of recurrent fusions in estrogen-receptor (ER) positive breast cancers is ill-understood. ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancers can be classified into the &#x0201c;luminal A&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;luminal B&#x0201d; subtypes. While luminal A tumors can be effectively treated by endocrine therapy against the ER, the luminal B subtype tumors are more aggressive with a higher risk of early relapse with endocrine therapy<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. It has been unclear what drives these tumors to be more aggressive, and there are limited options for treating this type of cancer. These issues may be effectively addressed by uncovering the genetic aberrations that drive the development of these tumors.</p><p id="P3">In this study, we develop an integrative pipeline called &#x0201c;Fusion Zoom&#x0201d; to detect recurrent gene fusions from RNAseq and genomic datasets. We postulate that the detection of pathological gene fusions would be greatly improved by applying more sensitive parameters to comprehensively capture the authentic fusion sequences from the RNAseq data, and by integrating distinct types of genomic data to prioritize the driving fusion events. Based on the observation that gene rearrangements are frequently associated with intragenic copy number aberrations (or &#x0201c;unbalanced&#x0201d; breakpoints), we previously formulated a fusion breakpoint principle to describe the characteristic intragenic copy number changes delineating recurrent fusion genes<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, which empowers the bioinformatics analysis to catalog meaningful fusion genes from copy number data. To facilitate high-throughput biological interpretation of candidate fusions, we also developed a Concept Signature (ConSig) analysis that nominates biologically important genes underlying cancer by assessing their association with molecular concepts characteristic of cancer genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://consig.cagenome.org">http://consig.cagenome.org</ext-link>)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Based on these principles, here we develop a pipeline that detects recurrent chimeras potentially encoding in-frame protein products from RNAseq data, catalogs the unbalanced breakpoints at the genomic loci of these fusion partner genes from copy number data, and prioritizes pathological gene fusions through the ConSig analysis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, see Methods). We apply this approach to the RNAseq and copy number datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and identify neoplastic fusion events between the estrogen receptor gene <italic>ESR1</italic> and the adjacent gene <italic>CCDC170</italic> in a subset of ER+ breast cancers that is preferentially found in luminal B tumors.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Integrative analysis revealed a recurrent <italic>ESR1</italic> rearrangement</title><p id="P4">Using the Fusion Zoom pipeline, we analyzed the RNAseq data of 795 invasive breast tumors and 107 paired normal breast tissues from TCGA. A total of 113,510 putative gene fusions were detected, among which 2,790 fusions were found to be tumor-specific and recurrent in this cohort of patients (present in &#x02265;2 tumors). Among these recurrent fusion candidates, 1,783 are found to have the potential to encode in-frame protein products (see Methods). Interestingly, the vast majority of these recurrent chimeras were from genes that are less than 500 kb apart (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), whereas distant gene fusions rarely recurred in more than 1% of breast tumors (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Chimeras from adjacent genes are generally considered as non-genomic transcription-induced chimeras (TICs) resulting from intergenic splicing<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Interestingly our analysis of TCGA copy number data (SNP6.0) for 865 breast tumors (most of these tumors have matched RNAseq data) did reveal somatic unbalanced breakpoints within a subset of tumors expressing chimeras, suggesting that some of these fusions could be the consequence of DNA rearrangements. To further reveal the most frequent and pathologically relevant fusions, we classified the 1,783 fusion candidates based on the presence of recurrent unbalanced breakpoints (see Methods), and then prioritized these candidates based on their frequency of detection in breast tumors and by ConSig score of fusion genes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). This analysis nominated two lead candidates, <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> and <italic>P2RY6-ARHGEF17</italic>, among which <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> is most frequently associated with unbalanced breakpoints among all candidates expressed in &#x0003e;1% of breast tumors (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Next, we examined the expression of both candidates in a panel of 30 breast cancer cell lines by Nanostring analysis, which applies nanoparticles to detect the abundance of target transcripts from total RNA<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. This assay detected high levels of <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> expression in some but not all of these cell lines (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). The three <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic>-positive cell lines, MCF7, ZR-75-1, and HCC1428, are all ER<sup>+</sup> and derived from metastatic breast tumors. The sizes of the fusion variants detected in these cell lines are different, suggesting that different genomic regions are involved in the fusion events (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). In addition, none of the benign breast epithelial cell lines or pooled normal breast tissues harbors the <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> fusion. These data suggest that <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> may be an authentic recurrent gene fusion. <italic>P2RY6-ARHGEF17</italic> was expressed at a modest level in many of the breast cancer cell lines analyzed (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). We speculated that this is most likely a TIC and thus did not study it further.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title><italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> is expressed in more aggressive ER<sup>+</sup> tumors</title><p id="P6"><italic>ESR1</italic> encodes the estrogen receptor, whereas <italic>CCDC170</italic> encodes a protein with unknown function. <italic>CCDC170</italic> is broadly expressed at modest levels in human tissues, with the fallopian tube to be the highest expressing organ (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). In normal breast tissues, <italic>CCDC170</italic> is expressed at a moderate level. To date there is no report about the role of <italic>CCDC170</italic> in mammary gland biology. The observed fusions between <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>CCDC170</italic> joins the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region of <italic>ESR1</italic> upstream to the coding region of <italic>CCDC170</italic>, enabling the expression of truncated <italic>CCDC170</italic> under the promoter of the <italic>ESR1</italic> gene. To more accurately capture the <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> chimerical reads from RNAseq data, we reconstructed all possible variant sequences by randomly combining each of the exons of <italic>ESR1</italic> with that of <italic>CCDC170</italic>. Aligning these putative sequences with the RNAseq data for 990 tumors (released to date by TCGA) revealed 21 <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> positive breast tumors (all of which are ER<sup>+</sup>, except one indeterminate case). About 55% of these positive tumors showed copy number gains between the <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>CCDC170</italic> loci as shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1c</xref> (also see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Analysis of clinicopathological data<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> suggest that this fusion is preferentially present in the luminal B rather than the luminal A subtype (Fisher's exact test, p&#x0003c;0.01, see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). In contrast, wild-type (wt) <italic>CCDC170</italic> is broadly expressed in ER<sup>+</sup> breast tumors, with no significant difference between these two luminal subtypes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The expression of wt<italic>CCDC170</italic> in breast cancer cell lines is almost exclusive to ER+ lines (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). This is consistent with the previous report about its co-expression with <italic>ER</italic><sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. We then tested the presence of <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> in 200 ER<sup>+</sup> breast tumors by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), using primers from exon 2 of <italic>ESR1</italic> and exon 10 of <italic>CCDC170</italic>, which can detect most fusion variations. Among these tumors, eight showed strong expression of <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> (4%), which were verified by capillary sequencing (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). In contrast, no expression of these fusion variants was detected in the available paired adjacent normal breast tissues, suggesting that the fusion between <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>CCDC170</italic> is highly tumor-specific (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To examine the association of <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> with the luminal B subtype, we assayed Ki67 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the ER+ cases assessed by RT-PCR for <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic>. Ki67 is a proliferation biomarker, and a high Ki67 index has been used in the clinic to classify luminal B tumors (with a cutoff of 13&#x0223c;15% positivity)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Among the 200 ER+ cases, 193 cases had evaluable tissue sections for Ki67 IHC analysis. The IHC results showed that <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic>-positive cases have significantly higher Ki67 scores than negative cases (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Using 15% positivity as cutoff, 80 tumors have high Ki67 index, among which 6 cases are fusion-positive (7.5%); among the 113 Ki67-low tumors, only one tumor is fusion-positive (0.9%). Fisher's exact test suggests a significant enrichment of fusion-positive cases in Ki67 high tumors (p=0.02). This data support the association of <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> with the more aggressive luminal B subtype.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> genomic rearrangements and protein products</title><p id="P8"><italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>CCDC170</italic> are located 69 kb apart on chromosome 6 with <italic>CCDC170</italic> positioned 5&#x02032; of <italic>ESR1</italic>. This placement prevents strong cis-splicing events that frequently happen between neighboring genes placed in forward order. To further verify the genomic origin of <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> in the cell lines and tumors showing strong expression of the chimeras, we carried out genomic PCR using tiling primers designed for the specific <italic>ESR1</italic> or <italic>CCDC170</italic> intron regions suspected to harbor the rearrangement based on the fusion variant in each index case revealed by RT-PCR (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), and the amplified products were further analyzed by capillary sequencing. Using this approach, the genomic fusion points in all 3 fusion-positive cell lines and 5 out of 8 strong fusion-positive tumors have been successfully identified (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). The sequencing results revealed distinct genomic fusion points in different cell lines and tumors. The MCF7 cells showed a duplication of the fusion junction, whereas the remaining cases showed 1-10 base-pair homology between the <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>CCDC170</italic> sequences at the rearrangement junctions (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We then examined the structure of the four major fusion variants (E2-E6, E2-E7, E2-E8, and E2-E10) detected in both breast cancer cell lines and tumors, in which exon 2 of <italic>ESR1</italic> is fused to exon 6, 7, 8, or 10 of <italic>CCDC170</italic>. The common theme of these fusion variants appears to create different-sized N-terminally <italic>truncated</italic> CCDC170 proteins (&#x00394;CCDC170), while <italic>ESR1</italic> does not contribute to any of the fusion amino acid sequence (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). To identify the protein products of the four major fusion variants, we ectopically expressed the putative open-reading frames (ORFs) of these variants in MCF10A human breast epithelial cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Western blot analysis using a commercial polyclonal antibody against the C-terminus of CCDC170 detected the predicted 41kDa (E2-E6), 39kDa (E2-E7), 30kDa (E2-E8), or 14kDa (E2-E10) &#x00394;CCDC170 bands specific to the transduced MCF10A cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). In addition, we expressed the E2-E7 and E2-E10 ORFs in the fusion-negative T47D breast cancer cells (ER<sup>+</sup>), and detected proteins of the same sizes. Next, we performed Western blot analysis to detect the endogenously expressed &#x00394;CCDC170 proteins in the <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic>-positive cell lines. We were able to readily detect the 14kDa E2-E10 protein expressed by the HCC1428 cells, the identity of which has been verified by specific knockdown of the E2-E10 fusion using an siRNA against this fusion junction. We were unable to conclusively detect the endogenous proteins expressed by the ZR-75-1 or MCF7 cell lines presumably due to the presence of cross-reactive proteins or low expression levels respectively (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> endows more aggressive phenotypes</title><p id="P10">Next, we sought to examine the oncogenic potential of the &#x00394;CCDC170 proteins generated by the four <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> fusion variants in the MCF10A breast epithelial cells. Impressively, ectopically expressing the ORF of each of these fusion variants dramatically increased the migration and invasion capabilities as shown by the Boyden chamber assay (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 c-d</xref>). In addition, the E2-E7 and E2-E10 variants also induced a moderate but significant increase in cell proliferation and colony forming ability, as measured by MTT assay (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>) and clonogenic assay (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>) respectively. Soft agar colony formation assays did not show an increase in anchorage-independent growth of the engineered MCF10A cells, whereas 3D culture of these cells in Matrigel revealed impaired acini morphogenesis (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>). Cell cycle analysis revealed an increase in S-G2/M phase cells, and a decrease in G0/G1 phase cells in all models (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). As MCF10A cells do not express wt<italic>CCDC170</italic> (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>), the observed changes are likely to be independent of wt<italic>CCDC170</italic>. To investigate the role of <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> in ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer cells, we examined the phenotypic changes of T47D breast cancer cells ectopically expressing the E2-E7 or E2-E10 fusions or the wt<italic>CCDC170</italic> (as a control). T47D is a luminal breast cancer cell line that is highly dependent on estrogen<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Our data show that while both E2-E7 and E2-E10 fusions significantly increased cell motility, anchorage-independent growth, and colony forming ability of T47D cells, the wt<italic>CCDC170</italic> did not (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 a-c</xref>). Further, both the E2-E7 and E2-E10 variants rendered the T47D cells less sensitive to estrogen deprivation and 4-hydroxytamoxifen treatment (4-OHT, the active metabolite of tamoxifen used <italic>in vitro</italic>) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 d-e</xref>). Of note, T47D cells typically do not proliferate when deprived of estrogen, whereas &#x00394;CCDC170 transduced T47D cells continue to grow in the absence of estrogen and irrespective of tamoxifen treatment (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Moreover, &#x00394;CCDC170 enhanced the ER transcriptional activity in the presence of estrogen but not with endocrine therapy (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>), suggesting that the fusion-mediated endocrine-sensitivity changes are unlikely due to the restoration of ER activity. To further examine the oncogenic potential of &#x00394;CCDC170 in the <italic>in vivo</italic> context, we transplanted the T47D cells expressing the &#x00394;CCDC170 variants or vector control into female athymic nude mice implanted with estradiol (E2) pellets. Impressively, in contrast to the slow growth kinetics of the tumor in the vector control group, a profound increase in tumor growth was observed in the transduced xenograft models expressing E2-E7 or E2-E10 ORFs (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>).

This cell line was chosen for the knockdown model as the E2-E10 variant is amenable to the design of fusion-specific siRNA and is the only variant expressed by this cell line. In addition, the protein product of this variant is readily detectable by the available antibody, which can be used to examine the knockdown efficiency. As shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>, this siRNA effectively and specifically knocks down the E2-E10 fusion variant.

To further exclude the siRNA off-target effects in HCC1428 cells, we performed rescue experiments by ectopically expressing the E2-E10 fusion variant in this line.

Among the top upregulated pathways in <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic>-positive tumors, the signaling gene sets along the c-Met/Gab1/PI3K-AKT axis appear to be most relevant to the observed phenotypes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11a</xref>). Of particular interest is the upregulation of the Gab1 signalosome (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Gab1 is a key docking protein that enhances the downstream signaling of c-Met and many other receptor tyrosine kinases<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, and is also a key scaffold protein involved in the formation of invadopodia<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.

Interestingly, when &#x00394;CCDC170 variants were overexpressed in MCF10A or T47D cells, Gab1 was also upregulated; conversely, repression of &#x00394;CCDC170 reduced Gab1 protein level in HCC1428 cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). In contrast, c-Met protein levels were not increased in the MCF10A and T47D cells expressing &#x00394;CCDC170, and were not affected by E2-E10 knockdown in HCC1428 cells.</p><p id="P13">Next, we performed Western blot analysis to examine the impact of &#x00394;CCDC170 expression on Gab1 downstream signaling molecules (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11c</xref>). This revealed the positive correlation of phospho AKT, ERK, and p38 with &#x00394;CCDC170 expression, the extent of which varies between different models (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). To test if &#x00394;CCDC170 expression can result in hyperactive growth factor signaling irrespective of endocrine condition, the T47D cell models were deprived of estrogen for 48h and serum-starved for 24h, and then treated with vehicle, E2, or tamoxifen. Interestingly, sustained phosphorylation of AKT and ERK was observed in the T47D cells expressing &#x00394;CCDC170 even after withdrawal of estrogen and serum, and this effect was not significantly altered by the administration of estrogen or tamoxifen (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). This suggests that the hyperactive growth factor signaling observed with &#x00394;CCDC170 expression may not be attributed to the estrogen-regulated non-genomic ER activity known to modulate growth factor signaling<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Further, increased phosphorylation of the Serine 167 residue on ER&#x003b1; was observed with &#x00394;CCDC170 expression.

Further, Gab1 knockdown also diminished the fusion-driven cell motility in both MCF10A and T47D cells, supporting the importance of Gab1 signaling in the fusion-driven invasive program (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 e-f</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">The genetic makeup and underlying biology contributing to the highly proliferative and aggressive phenotype of the luminal B breast tumors is not well understood. In this study, we have identified a recurrent genomic rearrangement event between the <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>CCDC170</italic> loci, and provided strong molecular and functional evidence that this fusion is enriched in luminal B tumors and promotes more aggressive oncogenic phenotypes. Our finding of <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> is an example of gain-of-function mutation, wherein <italic>CCDC170</italic> is fused to <italic>ESR1</italic> and utilizes the constitutively active promoter of <italic>ER</italic> to drive the expression of a truncated form of <italic>CCDC170</italic> gene. The truncation of the CCDC170 protein resulting from this fusion may twist the biology of this protein and generate a phenotype distinct from the wild-type protein. Of note, <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> is also detected by two previous studies interrogating different RNAseq datasets as a candidate fusion in breast cancer which further support its recurrence<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. However, these studies did not provide any data on the genomic event underlying this fusion, or its pathobiology and clinical relevance in breast cancer. Our integrative bioinformatics analysis provided multiple clues to lock in on this fusion as a recurrent, pathological, genomic fusion event from the large number of putative fusions detected by RNAseq. We then validated the genomic rearrangements generating this fusion by genomic PCR, characterized its protein products, elucidated its pathological role and engaged mechanism, and verified its enrichment in the more aggressive luminal B subtype. While it remains to be answered whether such enrichment could be attributable to the increased genomic instability characteristic of luminal B tumors that may promote the formation of this fusion, our biological data show that <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> endows ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer cells with more aggressive phenotypes, such as enhanced cell migration, invasion, anchorage-independent growth, and reduced endocrine sensitivity. These properties are consistent with the behavior of luminal B tumors. In addition, we also observed markedly increased ki67, the luminal B marker, in the T47D xenograft tumors overexpressing &#x00394;CCDC170 variants. Moreover, our &#x0201c;knockdown/rescue&#x0201d; studies of the E2-E10 fusion expressed in the HCC1428 cell line, which encodes the smallest truncated version of CCDC170 that are retained in all fusion variants, provided a proof of concept for the function of the endogenous <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> fusions expressed in breast cancers. Further mechanistic studies suggest that this fusion may engage Gab1 signaling to enhance cell motility and augment the downstream signaling of growth factor receptors<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. More important, the enhancement of growth factor signaling driven by this fusion appears to be sustained even after withdrawal of serum, and is not affected by endocrine treatment. Together, these findings may shed light on the genetic aberrations underlying the more aggressive and fatal ER+ breast tumors.</p><p id="P15">Our RT-PCR analysis of ER+ breast tumor tissues revealed 8 out of 200 tumors as <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic>-positive cases with strong expression of this fusion (4%). Of note, besides these cases, we also observed weak expression of <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> in an additional 10% of ER<sup>+</sup> breast tumors, which are distinguishable from the strong positives (see methods). These weak cases show a slightly increased Ki67 index comparing to fusion-negative breast tumors but this difference is not statistically significant (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). We speculate that these may be the result of random weak trans-splicing events between <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>CCDC170</italic>, considering the vicinity of the two genes. In fact, such trans-splicing events are not unique to this fusion<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Oncogenic gene fusions resulting from distant translocations are often found to be expressed at a low level in normal tissues, such as the <italic>EML4-ALK</italic><sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, <italic>NPM-ALK</italic><sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, <italic>JAZF1-JJAZ1</italic><sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, and <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> fusions<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. It is thought that high-level expressions coincide with gene rearrangements, whereas low-level expressions are likely to be trans-splicing events<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility of <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> rearrangements in a small subset of cancer cells in rare cases. Thus further investigation is needed to elucidate their clinical significance.</p><p id="P16">Another interesting question about this fusion is how such cryptic rearrangements could be generated. As <italic>CCDC170</italic> is located to the 5&#x02032; of <italic>ESR1</italic> on the same DNA strand, it is unlikely that such rearrangements are generated by deletions or inversions, which would require <italic>CCDC170</italic> to be at the 3&#x02032; of <italic>ESR1</italic>, or on the opposite strand, respectively. Considering the frequent duplications between the two genes in fusion-positive tumors, one possible mechanism of these cryptic rearrangements could be tandem duplication, which is defined as the occurrence of two identical sequences, one following the other, in a chromosome segment. Tandem duplication has been found to cause other gene fusions in cancer<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>-<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. If this mechanism is responsible for <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> fusions, <italic>ESR1</italic> expression would not be disrupted as such rearrangements are likely to retain a copy of the wild-type <italic>ESR1</italic> while forming the fusion gene (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 12a</xref>), as reported for other gene fusions generated by tandem duplication<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Indeed, the expression of <italic>ESR1</italic> in <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic>-positive tumors is similar to that of fusion-negative ER+ breast tumors (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 12b</xref>). In addition to tandem duplication, more complex mechanisms such as insertions may be responsible in the positive cases that do not exhibit duplications between the <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>CCDC170</italic> loci (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Chimeras from adjacent genes account for a vast majority of chimera sequences in cancer transcriptome<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Our finding of the <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> gene fusions supports the possibility of chromosomal rearrangements between adjacent genes generating recurrent gene fusions. Such cryptic genetic changes are not generally detectable by conventional cytogenetic approaches, and the resulting chimeras are usually submerged in the overwhelming number of TICs<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. This finding suggests that special attention should be paid to the possible genomic origin of adjacent chimeras in the discovery of gene fusions from RNA sequencing data. To our knowledge, <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> could be the most important recurrent gene fusion yet reported in ER+ breast cancers. This discovery may shed new light on the special genetic aberrations underlying a subset of more aggressive ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancers, and offers a new diagnostic strategy to identify this group of patients for more appropriate treatments. Further studies are needed to comprehensively investigate the oncogenic process initiated by the &#x00394;CCDC170 proteins resulting from this fusion and elucidate their role in breast cancer endocrine resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Analyses of RNAseq and copy number data</title><p id="P18">The copy number and RNAseq (Illumina HiSeq, paired-end) data for breast tumors used in this study were from TCGA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">http://cancergenome.nih.gov/</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cghub.ucsc.edu">https://cghub.ucsc.edu</ext-link>). Paired-end RNA sequences for 795 breast tumors and 107 paired normal breast tumors were aligned to human genome build 19 using the Tophat 2.0 fusion junction mapper<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Using our Perl script pipeline called &#x0201c;Fusion Zoom&#x0201d;, the putative fusion junctions were mapped to human exons (derived from UCSC gene and Ensemble gene) to identify chimerical sequences. The putative gene fusions are required to be supported by a minimum of one read that maps to the exon junctions of the two fusion genes. This criterion was expected to filter out most artifactual gene fusions randomly ligated during the sequencing procedure. This is based on the fact that authentic gene fusion junctions are usually formed by exon boundaries of partnering genes, whereas the fusion junctions of these artifactual fusions are unlikely to coincide with exon boundaries<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Putative fusion sequences were then constructed and aligned against human genome and transcriptome using the accurate aligner BLAST. The chimeric sequences that can mostly align to a wild-type genomic or transcript sequence were disregarded. After such filtering, a total of 68,611 chimeras with &#x0003e;2 median number of reads across all tumors were identified. A total of 2790 putative fusions were identified as somatic and recurrent (present in more than one breast tumors). Among these, 1783 putative fusions were found to have the potential to encode in-frame protein products. Here the in-frame analysis detects a fusion that either results in an in-frame chimerical protein, or combines the untranslated 5&#x02032; UTR of the 5&#x02032; partner with the full-length ORF of the 3&#x02032; partner. This is computed based on the reading-frames of the respective UCSC and Ensemble wild-type transcripts. The ORF analysis based on the reading frames of exons of the partner genes cannot predict all the de novo ORFs generated by the fusions. Here we required the candidate fusion to present an in-frame fusion variant in at least one sample. This step filtered out about 1000 candidates that never present any in-frame variant in any single sample, which are less likely to be functionally relevant. Of note, this approach cannot detect a truncated ORF initiated by an internal ATG site (such as in <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> fusions). However, in rare cases, the TCGA positive tumor appears to express the <italic>ESR1-CCDC170</italic> variant that involves more 5&#x02032; exons of <italic>ESR1</italic>, thus generating a reading frame with a small fragment of <italic>ESR1</italic> ORF in-frame fused to truncated <italic>CCDC170</italic> ORF.

These level 3 data are generated by circular binary segmentation<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. The genomic position of each copy number transition was mapped with the genomic regions of all human genes. The genomic region of each human gene was designated as the starting of the transcript variant most approaching the 5&#x02032; of the gene, and the end of the variant most approaching the 3&#x02032; of the gene. The &#x0201c;broken&#x0201d; genes with intragenic copy number breakpoints were classified into candidate 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; partners based on the association of these unbalanced breakpoints with gene placements. 5&#x02032; amplified genes or 3&#x02032; deleted genes were considered as potential 5&#x02032; partners, while 5&#x02032; deleted or 3&#x02032; amplified genes were considered as potential 3&#x02032; partners according to the fusion breakpoint principle<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.
