Several cellular mechanisms are known to be important for its survival, particularly DNA repair and xenobiotic detoxification, yet genomic screens indicate that additional cellular components may be involved. Elucidating these components has value in either identifying key processes that can be modulated to improve chemotherapeutic efficacy or may be altered in some cancers to confer chemoresistance. We therefore set out to reevaluate our prior <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAi screening data by comparison to gene expression arrays in order to determine if we could identify any novel processes in alkylation damage survival. We noted a consistent conservation of alkylation survival pathways across platforms and species when the analysis was conducted on a pathway/process level rather than at an individual gene level. Better results were obtained when combining gene lists from two datasets (RNAi screen plus microarray) prior to analysis. In addition to previously identified DNA damage responses (p53 signaling and Nucleotide Excision Repair), DNA-mRNA-protein metabolism (transcription/translation) and proteasome machinery, we also noted a highly conserved cross-species requirement for NRF2, glutathione (GSH)-mediated drug detoxification and Endoplasmic Reticulum stress (ER stress)/Unfolded Protein Responses (UPR) in cells exposed to alkylation. The requirement for GSH, NRF2 and UPR in alkylation survival was validated by metabolomics, protein studies and functional cell assays. From this we conclude that RNAi/gene expression fusion is a valid strategy to rapidly identify key processes that may be extendable to other contexts beyond damage survival.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K22ES012264</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5742-4387</contrib-id><name><surname>Bishop</surname><given-names>Alexander J.

Clinically, the most commonly used alkylating agents are nitrogen mustards and other chemotherapeutics such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide and temozolomide. On the other hand, prototypical alkylating agents such as methyl-methanesulfonate (MMS) and ethyl-methanesulfonate are advantageous to <italic>in vitro</italic> studies as they do not require bioactivation [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Previously, we used RNA interference (RNAi) screening in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells to identify genes and pathways necessary to survive MMS [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Here, we wanted to ask whether it is possible to extend those studies and identify additional pathways that are conserved from fly to mammals by integrating RNAi screening data with MMS-induced gene expression changes.</p><p>Towards this goal we used data from our aforementioned <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome-wide RNAi screen to identify genes required to survive MMS [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and generated complementary gene expression data in fruitfly cells (<italic>Kc167</italic>), mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and human cancer cells (MDA-MB231 cells). This rich dataset provided the opportunity to determine the feasibility of fusing phenome and transcriptome data in response to a single stimulus thereby revealing key biological process on a systems level. Noteworthy, this type of complementary analysis has been a longstanding challenge in the field; different publications have reported no significant overlap between the genes that confer a phenotype (the phenome) when knocked out/down and those that are transcriptionally regulated (the transcriptome) in the same context [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153970.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. With our datasets, no gene enrichment (direct ortholog comparison) was seen either across species for gene expressions or within species between gene expression response and RNAi screen data. However, a consistent conservation of alkylation responses across platforms and species was observed at a pathway/process level, and a stronger enrichment stood out when combining the two datasets (RNAi screen plus microarray) prior to analysis. With this, we were able identify the same pathways we previously reported and validated when we evaluated our RNAi screening results [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] as well as additional responses. Our analysis indicated significant changes in DNA-to-protein metabolism (transcription, translation) and proteasome-mediated degradation, glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism as well as a highly conserved NRF2 and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress)/unfolded protein responses (UPR). The GSH pathway metabolic changes were confirmed by the use of metabolomics in fly and mouse cells. We then went on to evaluate the conservation of response of these pathways and whether modulating them impacted MMS survival in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell lines and tissue cultures</title><p>The <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> embryonic cell line <italic>Kc167</italic> was grown in Schneider medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin at 22&#x000b0;C in a humidified incubator.

Total RNA samples (1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g) were used for sequencing library preparation according to Illumina TruSeq Total RNA Sample Preparation Guide (Illumina Cat. #: RS-122-2201). Each library was bar-coded and then pooled for cluster generation and sequencing run with 100bp single-end (SE) sequencing protocol. Short read sequences from RNAseq were first aligned to UCSC hg19 genome build using TopHat2 algorithm and then quantified for gene expression by HTSeq [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] to obtain raw read counts per gene and then converted to RPKM (Read Per Kilobase of gene length per Million reads of the library) according to gene length and total mapped read count per sample. Log2-transfromed RPKM measurement were used as gene expression level, and genes with low-read counts (determined by examining read counts in non-exonic regions) were removed. Additionally, genes with low expression (RPKM &#x0003c; 2) in both MMS and untreated conditions were filtered out. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at a p&#x0003c;0.05 (T-test control vs MMS-treated) and fold&#x0003e;2 or &#x0003c;-2 in at least one time point were selected as MMS-altered genes.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the Ingenuity Systems (IPA, Ingenuity Pathway Analyzer, Qiagen), and enrichment significance was calculated using the right-tailed Fisher Exact Test. Ingenuity analysis was complemented with the publicly available DAVID Bioinformatics Functional Annotation tools set as: i) Pathways; ii) KEGG and Reactome databases.

Only 78 (52 up and 26 down regulated) out of 957 RNAi screen hits displayed altered gene expression in at least one time point in Kc167 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153970.s003">S1B&#x02013;S1D Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153970.s003">S1 Table</xref>). Comparing the genes identified by RNAi or gene expression revealed only a minimal overlap (4.1%, e.g. 78/1890 genes identified by both assays, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; Fisher&#x02019;s exact, P &#x02264; 0.73).

In the RNAi/microarray overlap, 29 out of 52 RNAi hits with upregulated expression were previously tested and 21 validated (21/29, e.g. 72% validation), including <italic>p53</italic>, the GSH metabolic enzymes <italic>Gclc</italic> and <italic>GstE3</italic>, the chaperones <italic>Hsp70Bc</italic>, <italic>Hsp70Bb</italic>, and the thioredoxin <italic>TrxT</italic> (from [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). Of note, this is about twice the validation rate observed when just examining RNAi screen hits alone [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. We also noted that of the 78 overlapping genes, MMS-induced expressions displayed a robust fold-change in microarrays while MMS downregulations were closer to the fold-change cut-off (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153970.s001">S1C Fig</xref>; detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153970.s003">S1 Table</xref>). Because of this observation the pathways associated with these downregulated genes were not further investigated. Of note, these 52 up- and 26 downregulated genes do not consistently enrich any particular pathway terms when analyzed by PEA.</p><p>Previously we had noted that there was a significant conservation for the pathways necessary to survive MMS across species, if not at an individual gene level [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. We therefore evaluated whether we might see a similar conservation at a pathway level, which was not present at an individual gene level. Pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) suggested that a majority of the genes altered in each platform participate in different cellular processes, which might explain the lack of overlap observed at a gene level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>, see PEA genes-in-pathway details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153970.s004">S2 Table</xref>). Again, no significant overlap (6.1%; 4/66 pathways, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) was observed in the pathways identified from either the expression or RNAi screen data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; Fisher&#x02019;s exact P &#x02264; 0.44).

The fusion strategy entails the combined lists of RNAi hits with DEG lists from the microarray experiments (upregulated genes in this case) prior to running PEA. Pathway terms detected by fusion significantly overlapped with the pathways identified independently by either DEG or RNAi hits; e.g. 33/41 (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test p = 0.007) and 18/29 (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test p = 0.004) pathways associated with RNAi hits and MMS upregulated genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153970.s004">S2 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153970.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).

Towards this objective we evaluated the integration of our findings from fly cells with MMS induced gene expression responses in normal primary mammalian MEFs and human cancer cells. We first examined the degree of overlap between MMS gene expression changes across species but found there was no consistency in the orthologs of differentially expressed genes (DEGs); there was only ~ 0.2% overlap irrespective on comparing fly (red font) human (black font) or mouse (data not shown) DEG orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

In contrast though, pathway analysis was very informative and we were able to confirm that 7 pathway terms that can be simplified into NRF2 and GSH metabolism, p53 and GADD45 DNA damage responses and UPR/ER stress pathways are significantly conserved across species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g005">Fig 5A</xref>; upregulated genes are detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153970.s006">S4 Table</xref>).

To confirm this result we first performed mass-spectrum metabolomics in MEFs following MMS exposure. While fly cells were unable to upregulate or maintain their GSH and GSSG levels in response to MMS, a 5 to 20-fold increase in the GSH precursor gamma-glutamyl-cysteine (gamma-GC) was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Gamma-GC is a product of the NRF2 target enzyme <italic>GCLC</italic>. Interestingly, we also observed a ~300-500-fold accumulation of methyl-glutathione (methyl-GS), likely a product of phase-II detoxification of MMS by GSTs, in MMS-treated fly cells. This suggests that <italic>de novo</italic> GSH biosynthesis is driven by depletion of GSH pools used for MMS detoxification. This GSH response is conserved in MEFs, which seems to be better able to promote control of GSH synthesis by accumulating more GSH and GSSG (2-3-fold increases) and less methyl-GS (60 to 100-fold increase at 8 and 24 h, respectively) when compared to fly cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g005">Fig 5D</xref>).</p><p>MMS induced NRF2 activation in MDA-MB231 cells was first evaluated by using the ARE-luciferase reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g005">Fig 5E</xref>).

Finally, to demonstrate the importance of the NRF2 pathway in MMS survival we found that we were able to promote MMS resistance by inducing NRF2; to achieve this we depleted the NRF2 negative regulator KEAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g005">Fig 5G</xref>; effect of KEAP1 siRNA on NRF2 activity is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). To complement this observation we then used the A549 lung cancer cell line, which is known to harbor an inactivating mutation in KEAP1 gene [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A549 cells display a constitutively increased ARE-luciferase reporter activity as compared to MDA-MB231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g005">Fig 5E</xref>) and an MMS IC50 level twice (75 &#x003bc;g/mL) than those observed in MDA-MB231 or MEF (~35 &#x003bc;g/mL).</p><p>To further demonstrate the importance of the NRF2/UPR pathway in alkylation survival we modulated the GSH response. GSH <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis by the GCLC/GCLM enzyme complex can be inhibited by BSO. BSO treatment caused substantial potentiation of MMS toxicity in normal MEF, MDA-MB231 as well as A549 cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Conversely, supplementing glutathione levels by providing the rate limiting precursor cysteine in the form of NAC completely blocked MMS toxicity in all cell lines tested. As such, our results indicate that the metabolite GSH is a major requirement for MMS survival as predicted in our cross-species analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). To evaluate the ER stress/UPR response to MMS, we evaluated the ER stress sensor chaperone BIP/GRP78 and the signal transducer CHOP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g005">Fig 5H</xref>) in MEFs and MDA-MB231. In response to MMS we observed increases in levels of both proteins. To demonstrate the importance ER stress in MMS survival we overexpressed GRP78, a key ER chaperone that inhibits ER sensor activation, which conferred protection against MMS toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153970.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). These fly-to-mammalian data comparisons therefore confirmed the biology systems predictions that NRF2-GSH xenobiotics detoxification and UPR pathways are cross-species conserved survival responses to alkylation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Discussion</title><p>Forward genetic screens in model organisms have provided the basis of much of our foundational knowledge of gene function [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153970.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The availability of RNAi platforms have provided the potential to comprehensively interrogate the role of all genes in a particular context. However, these genome scale studies result in additional complications, particularly the volume of genes being identified. Furthermore, the level of false positives (usually ~40%) and false negatives (unknown amount) [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153970.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153970.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] is a significant impediment to leveraging the full potential of these genomic screens. Theoretically, a complementary genomic assay could facilitate prioritization of which genes and pathways are key to the phenotype being screened. One of the most easily implemented genomic platforms currently available is gene expression analysis, be that through microarray or sequencing technologies. Conceptually, one might expect that the comparison of two or more genomic scale analyses of the same biology could help prioritize key genes for follow-up studies. However, this type of complementary analysis (gene expression plus RNAi screening data) has been explored previously to facilitate genomic knockout or RNAi screening analysis without success due to a lack of overlap between survival gene hits and those that are transcriptionally regulated in the same biological context [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153970.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Similar to these prior reports [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153970.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], we did not find a significant overlap in the genes that confer a phenotype and those that are dynamically expressed in the same context. We also noted that many of the pathways significantly enriched in either RNAi screening or gene expression analyses also largely differed. However, this did not preclude some genes being dynamically expressed in response to MMS in pathways identified from RNAi screening or conversely some genes conferring sensitivity to MMS in the pathways identified in the gene expression analysis. The fusion of the data from these two platforms therefore improved the enrichment in a majority of these pathways, including those previously validated as being necessary for MMS survival [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This occurs because fusion of these different data adds additional nodes to specific networks/pathways, thus highlighting which pathways are most likely to validate following further examination. Importantly, while gene level comparison across species was uninformative, fusion followed by PEA was a powerful means to compare data across evolutionary distant species such as fly to human. This observation suggests that different cells, even from different species, share similar pathways/processes to respond to alkylation damage, though modulating different individual genes (or their orthologs) within a conserved pathway to achieve this effect. Inherent to these observations is the concept that the regulation of pathway activity by the dynamic expression of a gene does not indicate that these same genes are essential to that process. Conversely, the proteins that are sensitive to RNAi knockdown and are key for pathway activity may not be the same genes in that are dynamically expressed. This is exemplified by <italic>Hsf</italic> and <italic>cnc/NRF2</italic>, two master regulators of the UPR and NRF2 responses mostly regulated at the posttranslational level [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153970.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153970.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], whose knockdown caused sensitivity to MMS, but gene expressions were not altered. In addition, fusion provides improved gene enrichments by better covering both gene expression changes and posttranslational-regulated RNAi hits with a given pathway and thus consists an interesting strategy for improve pathway identification that may have wider utility.</p><p>To validate the results of our fusion strategy and its utility in comparative biology analysis we focused on a relatively underexplored component of alkylation damage survival. Alkylating agents are electrophilic compounds that can react with cysteine groups such as is found in KEAP1. Once these cysteine groups are altered, KEAP1 can no longer bind NRF2 and target it for degradation. NRF2 can then accumulate and promote transcription of antioxidant and detoxification genes following its translocation into the nucleus [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153970.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We found that NRF2 upregulates <italic>GCLC</italic> to replenish GSH pools that are depleted by the formation of methyl-GSH during MMS detoxification. Consequently, depletion of GSH potentiates alkylation toxicity. Substantiating our results others have reported that GSH depletion potentiates chemotherapy toxicity or that up-regulation of the NRF2 or GSH system confers chemoresistance [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Interestingly, the GSH precursor NAC blocks alkylation associated nephrotoxicity [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153970.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], though our data from normal cells such as MEFs and the conservation of NRF2-GSH response would predict NAC also to cause an undesired protection of cancer cells. GSH also can facilitate chemoresistance by serving as a cofactor for MRP2-mediated drug efflux [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] or GSTs to detoxify xenobiotics such as alkylators [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Here, we connected NRF2 and GSH in the context of alkylating drugs response, and showed that this is a well-conserved process across evolutionary distant organisms. This raise concerns about the use of NRF2 inhibition in combination cancer therapies due to possible off-target toxicity [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Our results also indicated that the UPR is also key in determining alkylation survival, and enhancing the folding capability of ER via overexpression of the chaperone GRP78 conferred resistance to alkylation. Although not herein identified, alkylation of nascent proteins within the ER may be the mechanism underlying the ER stress induction by alkylators [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Of note, studies with the alkylation-like chemotherapeutic cisplatin suggest that it may not be widespread protein alkylation that induces UPR, but rather conjugation of key proteins such as the GRP94, HSP90 and calreticulin within the ER [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. ER stress promotes adaptive responses or cell death, depending on the duration of the stimulus and which ER sensors are activated [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153970.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. While ATF6 and IRE1a ER sensors are first responders to unfolded proteins and generally promote production of chaperones, ER biogenesis, proteolysis and secretion, thus enhancing ER folding capacity [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153970.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. On the other hand, PERK responds to high and persistent unfolded cargo and inhibits global mRNA translation via eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation leading to apoptosis via ATF4-CHOP axis [<xref rid="pone.0153970.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153970.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The complex and differential mechanisms associated with ER sensors activation by chemotherapies requires more in depth investigation in order to understand how modulating ER stress sensors might optimize or hamper alkylation toxicity to normal or tumor contexts.</p><p>In summary, our data show that it is possible to fuse fly RNAi and gene expression data at a pathway level, but not gene level, in order to better identify cellular responses to a cytotoxic stimuli. Further we show that this fusion concept and be extended from fly to more complex transcriptomes, such as mammalian. RNAi and gene expression combination analysis (e.g. fusion) are able to differentiate dynamically from non-dynamically expressed survival responses, as well as provide a better overview and gene enrichment with pathways. Besides the classical and expected DDR pathways, we validated the activation of NRF2 and UPR as two conserved alkylation responses, which are possibly a consequence of MMS proteotoxicity and a cellular attempt of drug detoxification. These DNA repair independent mechanisms are likely relevant to both normal and cancer cell responses to alkylating agents and possibly other genotoxic chemotherapeutics. It is very likely that this fusion strategy can be applied to other contexts where both RNAi and gene expression data are available. Further, as we better develop pathway analysis tools and develop databases of genes that are either capable of dynamic expression or responsive to RNAi, we should be better able to use bioinformatics to minimize false positive results and improve potential false negative results that need to be retested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153970.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Time course of MMS-induced gene expression alterations in Kc167 cells.</title><p>(A) Description of MMS upregulated genes over 8, 24 and 72 h treatments in fly Kc167 cells.
