A better understanding of the host immune response to helminths could provide new avenues to promote parasite clearance and/or alleviate infection-associated morbidity. Murine resistin-like molecules (RELM) exhibit pleiotropic functions following helminth infection including modulating the host immune response; however, the relevance of human RELM proteins in helminth infection is unknown. To examine the function of human resistin (hResistin), we utilized transgenic mice expressing the human resistin gene (h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup>). Following infection with the helminth <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic> (<italic>Nb</italic>), hResistin expression was significantly upregulated in infected tissue. Compared to control h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mice, h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup> mice suffered from exacerbated <italic>Nb</italic>-induced inflammation characterized by weight loss and increased infiltration of inflammatory monocytes in the lung, along with elevated <italic>Nb</italic> egg burdens and delayed parasite expulsion. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of the infected tissue revealed that hResistin promoted expression of proinflammatory cytokines and genes downstream of toll-like receptor signaling. Moreover, hResistin preferentially bound lung monocytes, and exogenous treatment of mice with recombinant hResistin promoted monocyte recruitment and proinflammatory cytokine expression. In human studies, increased serum resistin was associated with higher parasite load in individuals infected with soil-transmitted helminths or filarial nematode <italic>Wuchereria bancrofti</italic>, and was positively correlated with proinflammatory cytokines. Together, these studies identify human resistin as a detrimental factor induced by multiple helminth infections, where it promotes proinflammatory cytokines and impedes parasite clearance. Targeting the resistin/proinflammatory cytokine immune axis may provide new diagnostic or treatment strategies for helminth infection and associated immune-mediated pathology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Parasitic helminths, which infect an estimated two billion people worldwide, represent a significant global public health problem. Infection is associated with life-long morbidity including growth retardation and organ failure. Despite these debilitating conditions, there are currently no successful vaccines against helminths. Further, great variability in the host immune response to helminths exists, with the ability of some individuals to develop immunity, while others are susceptible when re-exposed or maintain life-long chronic infections. Identifying new factors that are differentially expressed in immune versus susceptible individuals could provide new targeting strategies for diagnosis or treatment of helminth infection. Here, we identify an important immunoregulatory function for human resistin in helminth infection. Employing transgenic mice in which the human resistin gene was inserted, we show that human resistin is induced by infection with the helminth <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic>, where it promotes excessive inflammation and impedes parasite killing. Moreover, analysis of clinical samples from two cohorts of individuals infected with filarial nematodes or soil-transmitted helminths revealed increased resistin and serum proinflammatory cytokines compared to putatively immune individuals. Together, these studies suggest that human resistin is a detrimental cytokine that is expressed in multiple helminth infections, mediates pathogenic inflammation, and delays parasite clearance.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>These studies were supported by the NIH (1R01AI091759-01A1 to MGN; P01DK49210 to MAL), by the Division of Intramural Research (DIR) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (to CS and TBN), UCR School of Medicine initial complement and Academic Senate grant to MGN, the Health Research Council of New Zealand (to GLG) and the Wellcome Trust (088862/Z/09/Z to PJC).

Infection with lymphatic-dwelling filarial nematodes can result in lymphedema and elephantiasis, while soil-transmitted helminths (STH) can cause anemia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage or blockage, growth retardation and cognitive impairment. In human gastrointestinal helminth infections, although most infections have shown mild alterations to pathology, severe infections can result in colitis and dysentery <xref rid="ppat.1004579-MacDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Clearance of helminth infection has relied solely on anthelmintic drugs, including diethylcarbamazine, albendazole and ivermectin; however, there is currently no vaccine against human helminth pathogens and the rate of reinfection remains high. In mouse models, the T helper type 2 (Th2) immune response is essential in immunity to helminths, with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, innate lymphoid cells, eosinophils and basophils as the major producers of the Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13 <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Min1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004579-Voehringer1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In mice lacking IL-4, IL-13 or their receptors, there is impaired clearance of helminths, including the soil-transmitted helminth <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic> (<italic>Nb</italic>) and filarial nematodes <xref rid="ppat.1004579-LeGoff1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Urban1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In addition to mediating immunity to helminths, Th2 cytokines are critically involved in suppressing infection-induced immunopathology. For instance, <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> infection is lethal in IL-4R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and following <italic>Nb</italic> infection, IL-4R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice suffer from exacerbated inflammation in the lungs compared to wild-type mice <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Herbert1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The balance between Th2 cytokines and type 1 proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1;, is also an important consideration for the outcome of helminth infection as these cytokine pathways are counter-regulatory. For example, inhibition of IFN&#x003b3; promotes expulsion of <italic>Trichuris muris</italic> by allowing the development of a protective Th2 immune response <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Urban2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In filarial nematode infection, severe lymphatic pathology is associated with increased IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; and conversely decreased IL-4 <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Babu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Through promoting type 1 inflammatory cytokines, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling can negatively impact the host immune response to helminths by delaying parasite expulsion and promoting immune-mediated pathology <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Babu2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Helmby1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Identifying factors that regulate the balance between type 1 and type 2 cytokines may offer new immune targeting strategies to promote protective immunity or ameliorate infection-associated pathology.</p><p>Resistin is a member of the resistin-like molecule (RELM) family of cysteine-rich secreted proteins that are conserved in humans and mice. In mice, there are four RELM proteins (resistin, RELM&#x003b1;, RELM&#x003b2;, and RELM&#x003b3;), however, there are only two RELM proteins in humans (resistin and RELM&#x003b2;) <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Among the murine RELM proteins, RELM&#x003b1; and RELM&#x003b2; proteins are potently induced following helminth infection. Studies from our lab and others have shown that RELM&#x003b1; suppresses Th2 cytokine responses induced by <italic>S. mansoni</italic> or <italic>Nb</italic><xref rid="ppat.1004579-Nair1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Pesce1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. On the other hand, the function of RELM&#x003b2; during helminth infection may be dependent on the helminth parasite. For example, RELM&#x003b2; induced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell production of IFN&#x003b3; but had no effect on worm expulsion during <italic>T. muris</italic> infection <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Nair2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In response to <italic>Nb</italic> or <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic> however, RELM&#x003b2; was an effector molecule that could interact with the parasite and promote expulsion. Other studies have shown that RELM&#x003b2; can bind to and inhibit the sensory function of <italic>Strongyloides stercoralis</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1004579-Artis1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. These studies, however, have only examined murine RELM proteins and to date, none have investigated the role of human RELM proteins such as resistin in helminth infection.</p><p>Murine resistin was initially identified as a hormone secreted by adipocytes that caused insulin resistance, a disorder that can result in type 2 diabetes <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Steppan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Interestingly, although human resistin and mouse resistin have high sequence homology, resistin in humans is predominantly expressed by monocytes and macrophages and not adipocytes <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Jung1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In addition to diabetes, human resistin is also elevated in several inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Migita1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Reilly1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Indeed, in an inflammatory environment promoted by LPS stimulation, human resistin was upregulated and contributed to inflammation and insulin resistance <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004579-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Human resistin also mediated lung cancer cell migration, differentiation of osteoclasts <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Kuo1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and VEGF-mediated angiogenesis <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Despite the many studies focusing on resistin in metabolic disorders and cancer, its function during infection is currently unknown. In human studies with filarial-infected individuals, <italic>Brugia malayi</italic> antigen increased resistin mRNA in human monocytes, particularly when these monocytes were isolated from filarial-infected humans <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Benomar1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, prompting our investigation of the function of human resistin in helminth infection.</p><p>To examine the role of human resistin in helminth infection, we employed transgenic mice that express human resistin. These mice are deficient in murine resistin, and engineered to include the hResistin gene and its entire regulatory region (h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup>) <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In the original study, h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup> mice exhibited a similar hResistin expression pattern as that observed in humans. Additionally, h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup> mice suffered from increased insulin resistance following LPS-induced endotoxemia. These results suggested that hResistin might be functional in mice, and that h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup> mice provide a useful tool to study how hResistin expression is regulated and its function <italic>in vivo</italic>. Following <italic>Nb</italic> infection, we show that hResistin is significantly upregulated by macrophages in the infected lungs and intestine of h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup> mice. Compared to littermate control mice that did not express hResistin (h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), infected h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup> mice suffered from exacerbated infection-induced inflammation, including increased weight loss and elevated monocyte infiltration in the lung. We performed RNAseq analysis to identify differentially expressed genes that may be responsible for hResistin-mediated effects. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that hResistin induced global gene ontology pathways that were associated with the inflammatory response, chemokine signaling and TLR signaling. Additionally, exogenous treatment of na&#x000ef;ve mice with recombinant human resistin could recapitulate the monocyte responses and gene expression profile observed in h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup> mice, confirming that human resistin directly promotes these inflammatory pathways <italic>in vivo</italic>. Functionally, hResistin-mediated stimulation of the inflammatory immune response led to increased parasite egg burdens and delayed worm expulsion. Finally, in human studies, we observed that patients infected with STH or the filarial nematode <italic>Wuchereria bancrofti</italic> had elevated serum resistin, and that resistin was positively correlated with parasite burden and serum proinflammatory cytokines. Taken together, our findings suggest that human resistin expression is an innate response to multiple helminths, where it promotes monocyte recruitment and a type 1 proinflammatory cytokine environment, leading to impaired helminth clearance and exacerbated infection-associated inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>hResistin is upregulated in macrophages following <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic> infection</title><p>To study the function of human resistin in helminth infection, we utilized mice in which the human resistin gene along with its entire regulatory region was inserted using a bacterial artificial chromosome onto a murine resistin knockout background (h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup>).

Interestingly, infection of h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup> mice resulted in a greater number of genes upregulated (2805) with almost double the number of DEGs (4552) as h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004579-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, middle). This suggests that hResistin has a significant impact on infection-induced gene expression changes in the lung. To assess infection-induced genes that were differentially expressed in response to hResistin, we compared <italic>Nb</italic>-infected h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>&#x02212;</sup> with h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004579-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, right). We identified 540 genes upregulated in the h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup> group and 441 genes downregulated for a total of 981 DEG. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the most significantly different gene ontology (GO) categories included the immune response, followed by the inflammatory response and defense response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004579-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Heatmap analysis revealed that almost all the GO-defined immune response genes and defense genes were upregulated in the h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup> group, suggesting a potent immune-stimulatory function for human resistin. For example, the gene <italic>Tnfrsf1b</italic>, a receptor for the proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#x003b1; was highly upregulated in the h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup> group. KEGG pathways were used to further specify the differentially expressed categories based on molecular interactions and functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004579-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Specifically, two of the most upregulated pathways were chemokine signaling and TLR signaling. The chemokine signaling genes included <italic>Ccr2</italic> and <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, which are known to contribute to monocyte recruitment <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Boring1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Taub1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

In contrast, the pathways that were downregulated by hResistin were not associated with the immune response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004579.s004">S1 Table</xref>). Instead, we observed the downregulation of metabolic pathways such as arachidonic acid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. Both of these metabolic pathways have been associated with Th2 cytokine-activated alternatively activated macrophages <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Odegaard1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, which are protective in metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance or regulation of acute inflammation by Th2 cytokines <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Lehrke2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The downregulation of these protective pathways by hResistin are consistent with the exacerbated inflammation observed in h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup> mice.

After STH infections, filariasis is the second most prevalent nematode infection, affecting an estimated 120 million people worldwide <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Hotez1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. We examined serum samples collected from 44 filarial-infected individuals and 17 non-infected endemic normal individuals from the <italic>Wuchereria bancrofti</italic>-endemic island of Mauke in the south Pacific, where levels of circulating microfilariae were previously quantified in the blood <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Cuenco1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Weller1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. We observed that circulating resistin levels were increased in infected microfilaremic individuals by almost three-fold compared to the non-infected endemic normal population (average 6749 pg/mL in endemic normal versus 21361 pg/mL in infected individuals) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004579-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>). Microfilarial counts were also positively associated with resistin and TNF&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004579-g008">Fig. 8E</xref>). Finally, elevated resistin was associated with higher concentration of IL-6, CCL2 and TNF&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004579-g008">Fig. 8F</xref>) and inflammatory factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1004579-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that the resistin/proinflammatory cytokine immune axis we identified in mice is also present in human nematode infections. Protective immunity to helminths is typically associated with type 2 cytokine responses <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Anthony1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, therefore we investigated if resistin expression was inversely correlated with parasite-specific type 2 immune responses in the microfilarial-positive patients. There was no significant correlation between resistin expression and parasite-specific antibody titers of the Th2-associated isotype IgG4, nor did we observe significant correlations with IL-5 or IL-10 cytokine production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004579.s006">S3 Table</xref>). This suggests that the downstream effects of resistin are independent of type 2 cytokines, and instead involve proinflammatory cytokine induction. Taken together, these human studies support a model where resistin is an innate response to multiple helminths that is correlated with elevated inflammatory cytokines and impaired parasite clearance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Some of the earliest studies of RELM proteins identified these as potently induced genes in mouse helminth infection models <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Loke1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Optimal expression of RELM&#x003b1; and RELM&#x003b2; in helminth infection is dependent on Th2 cytokines <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Loke1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Herbert2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Recent studies, however, have reported that other stimuli, such as bacterial infections and presumably LPS, can induce RELM&#x003b1; and RELM&#x003b2; gene expression <xref rid="ppat.1004579-He1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Osborne1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Similarly, human resistin expression is induced in a variety of inflammatory settings including endotoxemia, metabolic disorders and cancer <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Lehrke1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Kuo1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Qatanani1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. However, the function of human resistin in infection has not been defined. Here, we combined studies utilizing a transgenic mouse model and human data to demonstrate that human resistin is induced following both STH and filarial nematode infection, where it promotes a proinflammatory cytokine environment. In the mouse model, the effects of resistin were detrimental to the host, and data from both the mouse and human studies demonstrated a positive correlation between resistin, proinflammatory cytokines and parasite burdens.</p><p>Previous studies showed that resistin mRNA was upregulated in macrophages from filarial-infected patients following exposure to filarial antigen <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Babu3" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Semnani1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup> mice and the serum of STH and filarial nematode-infected individuals, we demonstrate that resistin protein is significantly elevated in the infected tissue and systemically in the circulation. Although many studies have shown that LPS can induce resistin expression both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, our data implicates resistin expression as a common innate response to multiple helminth infections. This suggests that hResistin is not only functionally relevant during type 1 inflammatory settings induced by bacterial antigens or metabolic disorders, but may have functional consequences during a Th2-biased helminth immune response.</p><p>Human resistin did not significantly alter the Th2 cytokine gene expression, or associated Th2 cell activation. Instead, we demonstrate through genome-wide transcriptional profiling and functional studies that resistin promoted the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and the establishment of an innate proinflammatory cytokine environment, including increased expression of TLR-signaling associated genes and monocyte chemoattractants. This is consistent with previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies utilizing human monocyte/macrophages <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Gan1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004579-Tarkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In a co-culture system with endothelial and smooth muscle cells, resistin induced the expression of monocyte chemoattractants including CCL2, which led to increased monocyte migration <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Pirvulescu1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Given that <italic>Nb</italic> infection of the lung causes dramatic injury and hemorrhage (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004579-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), it is likely that there is activation of endothelial and smooth muscle cells to produce monocyte chemoattractants. Indeed, lung monocyte infiltration in the h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup> mice was associated with significantly elevated expression of CCL2, and serum resistin concentration in both STH and filarial nematode-infected individuals was positively correlated with CCL2. Interestingly, <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment of na&#x000ef;ve mice with recombinant resistin led to rapid monocyte recruitment that preceded increased expression of monocyte chemoattractants. This suggests that monocytes are directly recruited by resistin and in turn begin to express chemokines as part of a positive feedback loop to increase inflammation.</p><p>Previous studies have identified several putative receptors for human resistin <italic>in vitro</italic>, including TLR-4 and CAP1, which can also induce NF-&#x003ba;B dependent induction of proinflammatory cytokines TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2; <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Benomar1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Tarkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Our RNA sequencing studies revealed that human resistin promoted expression of TLR-4 (and other TLRs), but not CAP1. Additionally, direct injection of recombinant human resistin in na&#x000ef;ve mice resulted in a marked increase in inflammatory genes downstream of TLR signaling, including IRF7. This suggests that resistin may act through TLR-4 and not CAP1 during <italic>Nb</italic> infection, and the importance of CAP1 in resistin-mediated effects may be more significant in metabolic disorders.</p><p>Altogether, our data suggest that resistin expression could have significant implications for the disease outcome of helminth-infected individuals. In humans, increased resistin expression could be predictive of impaired immunity to helminths or exacerbated inflammation following infection. Recent studies have shown that filarial nematode and STH-infected individuals demonstrate increased circulating microbial products <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Anuradha1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004579-George1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. It is possible that this endotoxemic phenotype promotes resistin expression, which in turn acts to increase the proinflammatory cytokine environment. In filarial nematode infection, the establishment of chronic infections typically involves the downmodulation of innate and adaptive immune responses <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Babu4" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Therefore, it is somewhat surprising that there was a significant and positive correlation between microfilarial burdens, resistin and proinflammatory cytokines in the chronically-infected patients. It is possible that the resistin-mediated effects on proinflammatory cytokines operate independently of regulatory mechanisms such as regulatory T cells and IL-10 that also contribute to chronicity of infection. One debilitating consequence of filarial nematode infections is the development of lymphatic dysfunction, lymphedema and ultimately elephantiasis. This pathology has been associated with elevated TLR signaling <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Babu2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and resistin may initiate this by overcoming the suppressive mechanisms that typically occur in filarial infections. Although there were not sufficient filarial nematode-infected individuals with lymphatic pathology in our cohort to test this hypothesis, our data suggest that future studies examining resistin correlation with lymphatic pathology may be warranted. Additionally, our studies of the transgenic mouse model and STH-infected children have provided a useful framework for longitudinal studies to examine whether high resistin expression leads to an increased likelihood of infection with STH. In summary, our studies contribute to the growing evidence of the pleiotropic effects of human resistin in several human diseases, and demonstrate a critical function for this protein in helminth infection. We show that expression of human resistin in mice recruits inflammatory monocytes to the site of infection, promotes type 1 inflammation, and is correlated with increased STH and filarial nematode burden in humans. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the ability of the human resistin to impair immunity to helminths and promote inflammatory responses that may mediate pathology. Targeting resistin may therefore provide new approaches to host-directed treatment strategies for helminth infection and amelioration of the associated immune-mediated pathology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>Human resistin transgenic mice (h<italic>Retn</italic>Tg<sup>+</sup>) were generated as previously described by Mitchell Lazar <xref rid="ppat.1004579-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.
