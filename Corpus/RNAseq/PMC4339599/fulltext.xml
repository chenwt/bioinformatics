To analyse glume development and metabolism related to grain filling, parallel transcript and metabolite profiling in glumes and endosperm were performed, showing that glume metabolism and development adjusts to changing grain demands, reflected by specific signatures of metabolite and transcript abundances. Before high endosperm sink strength is established by storage product accumulation, glumes form early, intermediary sink organs, shifting then to remobilizing and exporting source organs. Metabolic and transcriptional transitions occur at two phases: first, at the onset of endosperm filling, as a consequence of endosperm sink activity and assimilate depletion in endosperm and vascular tissues; second, at late grain filling, by developmental ageing and senescence. Regulation of and transition between phases are probably governed by specific NAC and WRKY transcription factors, and both abscisic and jasmonic acid, and are accompanied by changed expression of specific nitrogen transporters. Expression and metabolite profiling suggest glume-specific mechanisms of assimilate conversion and translocation. In summary, grain filling and endosperm sink strength coordinate phase changes in glumes via metabolic, hormonal, and transcriptional control.

Vegetative organs in barley and wheat are photosynthetically active, providing carbohydrates until late grain filling. By contrast, 60&#x02013;90% of grain N originates from remobilization out of vegetative organs (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Hirel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Among the photosynthetically active tissues, glumes hold an exceptional role, as the organs nearest the grains. In wheat, glumes have a unique cellular and chloroplast distribution associated with their particular metabolism and supporting grain maturation (<xref rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr">Waters <italic>et al.</italic>, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Lopes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Up to 30% of photosynthates imported into grains derive from photosynthetic activity of glumes (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Grundbacher, 1963</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Most N derived from other source tissues is not directly transported into developing grains, but instead transported through and eventually converted within glumes (<xref rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr">Waters <italic>et al.</italic>, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Simpson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1983</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Compared to flag leaves, glumes senesce late and thus could be important for N translocation during later grain filling. Thereby, the capacity of glumes to convert and translocate N during senescence is an important trait to assess in breeding for higher grain protein content.</p><p content-type="indent">To fulfil these tasks, glume metabolism must be coordinated with the different phases of grain development. In barley endosperm, cellularization begins around 4 days after pollination (DAP) and is completed 1&#x02013;2 days later. The pre-storage/cellularization phase, from anthesis to 6 DAP, and the storage phase, starting at 8&#x02013;10 DAP, are separated by a transition stage characterized by transcriptional reprogramming and a switch into storage mode (<xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">Sreenivasulu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Between 8 and 10 DAP, the endosperm starts accumulating storage products, develops high sink strength for sucrose and N, and enters the linear phase of dry matter accumulation between 10 and 20 DAP (<xref rid="CIT0078" ref-type="bibr">Weschke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Physiological maturity is reached around 24 DAP followed by desiccation.</p><p content-type="indent">Endosperm phase changes are accompanied by differences in sink strength, which affect metabolism, remobilization, and transport of resources into and from vegetative organs. As would be expected, central metabolism in glumes is coordinated with such changes during grain filling (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Lopes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). There is a lack of detailed knowledge about this cross-talk at the molecular level, and of metabolic and transcriptional adjustments according to the specific demands of grains. The remobilization of assimilates and reserves during seed filling is highly regulated (<xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The WRKY (contains the WRKY amino acid signature at the N-terminus and zinc-finger structure at the C-terminus) and NAC (<italic>N</italic>AM, <italic>A</italic>TAF1,2, <italic>C</italic>UC) transcription factors are involved in regulating remobilization and senescence (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Balazadeh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Breeze <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Fischer, 2012</xref>). In barley, specific members of the NAC transcription factor gene family are co-regulated with senescence-associated genes in senescing flag leaves (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Gregersen and Holm, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Christiansen and Gregersen, 2014</xref>). In wheat the NAC transcription factor Gpc-B1 accelerates senescence and increases nutrient remobilization from leaves (<xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">Uauy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Remobilized N from protein degradation has to be transported across membranes by specific transporters (<xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Tegeder and Rentsch, 2010</xref>). Members of the amino acid transporter family (ATF) and nitrate/peptide transporter family (NPF) are key components in remobilization, and functionally characterized transporters are expressed in tissue and development specific-manners. AtAAP1 is involved in amino acid uptake into embryos (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Hirner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Sanders <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), AtAAP8 is involved in amino acid uptake into endosperm (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), and AtPTR5 is preferentially expressed during early seed development (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Komarova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Barley HvPTR1 transports peptides from endosperm to growing embryos during germination (<xref rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr">West <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Transporters involved in amino acid uptake into cells have mainly been characterized (<xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">Tegeder, 2012</xref>), but recently AtBAT1 (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">D&#x000fc;ndar and Bush, 2009</xref>) and AtSIAR1 (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Ladwig <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) have been shown to export amino acids out of cells with apparently opposing functions. While AtBAT1 shows preferential expression in sink tissues (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">D&#x000fc;ndar, 2009</xref>), AtSIAR1 expression is associated with source tissues, and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants have lower contents and disturbed homeostasis of amino acids in siliques (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Ladwig <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">The aim of this study was to analyse temporal changes of transcript and metabolite abundances in glumes and endosperm during barley grain development. Such parallel profiling allows a correlation of shifts in glume metabolism and remobilization events with distinct phases of grain development.

At transcript levels it was characterized by a further decrease of photosynthesis, glycolysis, and starch biosynthesis, whereas chlorophyll, lipid, and amino acid degradation increased together with proteolysis, mETC activity, and transport processes. Several genes involved in the final steps of amino acid biosynthesis were steadily downregulated, while others were upregulated, especially at later stages, such as homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase and pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase, which are probably engaged in Tyr, Phe, and Pro degradation.</p><p content-type="indent">To conclude, upon the first metabolic transition (8 DAP), glumes are converted into remobilizing and transporting organs for assimilates, providing for grain filling. The second transition (18 DAP) assigns developmental ageing and senescence. The period between is the main storage phase. It is obviously important that glumes remain fully functional at this stage. Sequential arrangements reflect the cascades of sink-induced remobilization at 8 DAP and developmental ageing after 14 DAP.</p></sec><sec id="s24"><title>Regulation of glume metabolic transitions</title><p>NAC and WRKY transcription factors are frequently involved in signalling senescence (<xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">Uauy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0082" ref-type="bibr">Zentgraf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Breeze <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Christiansen and Gregersen, 2014</xref>).

Induced L-alanine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (Ala:OG-AT) and GS1 together may convert Ala by Ala:OG-AT to Glu and further to Gln by GS1 using amino groups from protein/amino acid degradation. Gln could then either be exported or converted to Asn by Gln-ASN, one of the most upregulated genes at 24 DAP (150-fold). This would mobilize N as Asn at the expense of Ala and amino N. Gln-ASN is important for remobilizing N during senescence of <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> leaves (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">De Michele <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In rice and tobacco, Gln-ASN is located in vascular tissues (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Gaufichon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Assuming such a location in glumes suggests that Asn is preferentially synthesized in vascular tissue for export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>).

Upregulated Cys and Met biosynthesis contributes to possible conversion of amino N from Ser, Asp, and sulphur to phloem-mobile <italic>S</italic>-methyl-methionine (SMM), (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Bourgis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). The pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref>), involves additional enzymes, like aspartate kinase and methionine-<italic>S</italic>-methyltransferase, which were also upregulated in glumes. Similar mechanisms are suggested for synthesis and transport of SMM within barley nucellar projections to translocate reduced sulphur from senescing tissue into endosperm (<xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Thiel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Differential transcription indicated degradation of phospholipids by phosphatidylcholine phospholipase D and glycero-<italic>P</italic>-diesterase, in glumes already at 8 DAP, together with biosynthesis of long-chain fatty acids by acyl-activating enzyme and very-long-chain fatty acid-condensing enzyme. However, degradation of mono- and triacylglycerides (TCGs) did not occur before 18 DAP, indicated by upregulated mono- and triacylglycerol lipases. These processes are probably involved in mobilizing C from membrane lipids into phloem-mobile sucrose (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Kaup <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">Troncoso-Ponce <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). To conclude, in glumes, phospholipids from chloroplasts are degraded early, accompanied by <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis of TCGs. Accordingly, levels of stearate and palmitate increased in glumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). During developmental senescence TCGs are degraded and C is converted to phloem-mobile sucrose or respired by mETC. Alternatively, acetyl-CoA could be converted into amino acids and to SMM for export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">In glumes, mitochondrial metabolism was upregulated at early grain filling involving TCA cycle activity, mETC, and ATP synthesis and transport, consistent with increased levels of citrate, isocitrate, and succinate. As expected, most ATP generated in mitochondria is needed to energize transport of sugars, amino acids, and peptides. Accordingly, respective transporters were co-induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Similarly, in senescing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves, mitochondrial respiration has to supply ATP and C skeletons to redistribute N (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;rtensteiner and Feller, 2002</xref>). Several mitochondrial genes were only upregulated later on, involving respiration and mETC (cytochrome c oxidase, electron transfer flavoprotein, NADH dehydrogenase) and energy dissipation (alternative oxidase). These genes are probably involved in developmental senescence and amino acid degradation, also upregulated at the transcript level at 24 DAP. Mitochondrial alternative oxidase could balance senescence-related stress responses from excess degradation of sugars and/or amino acids as shown in legume embryos with perturbed metabolism (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Gregersen and Holm, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">Weigelt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">Weigelt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Ara&#x000fa;jo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Our results show that development of barley glumes after anthesis is separated into three phases associated with grain development, and these mark the transition from sink to source tissue. Until 8 DAP, glumes are growing and photosynthetically active tissues accumulating dry weight, total N, and free amino acids. Furthermore, decreasing levels of starch and glycolytic metabolites as well as the corresponding transcripts are observed. Between 8 and 10 DAP, coinciding with the beginning of storage protein synthesis in grains, total N and free amino acids decrease significantly, which probably represents relocation of nutrients to meet the demands of developing grains. Concentrations of free amino acids in endosperm and grain vasculature decrease at this stage, which could signal increasing N demand to glumes and trigger remobilization. Accordingly, expression of specific transporters in glumes is upregulated together with enzymes from the TCA cycle and mETC providing energy for transport. After 18 DAP, glumes undergo developmental ageing and senescence, involving chlorophyll degradation by PAO, specific proteases, and N transporters. Transition between these phases is probably governed by transcription factors from the NAC and WRKY families and influenced by ABA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s27"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>Supplementary data can be found at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>
