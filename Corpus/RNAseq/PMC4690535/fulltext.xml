Both result ultimately from a deficiency of functional pancreatic insulin-producing beta cells. Beta cells proliferate in humans during a brief temporal window beginning around the time of birth, with peak beta cell labeling indices achieving approximately 2% in first year of life<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. In embryonic life and after early childhood, beta cell replication rates are very low. While beta cell expansion seems an obvious therapeutic approach to beta cell deficiency, adult human beta cells have proven recalcitrant to such efforts<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Hence, there remains an urgent need for diabetes therapeutic agents that can induce regeneration and expansion of adult human beta cells <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Here, we report the results of a high-throughput small molecule screen (HTS) revealing a novel class of human beta cell mitogenic compounds, analogues of the small molecule, harmine. We also define dual specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase-1a (DYRK1A) as the likely target of harmine, and the Nuclear Factors of activated T-cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors as likely mediators of human beta cell proliferation as well as beta cell differentiation. These observations suggest that harmine analogues (&#x0201c;harmalogs&#x0201d;) may have unique therapeutic promise for human diabetes therapy. Enhancing potency and beta cell specificity are important future challenges.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Biological Sciences</kwd><kwd>Drug Discovery</kwd><kwd>Drug Screening</kwd><kwd>High-Throughput Screening</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Reasoning that the growth-mediating MYC family of proteins are essential normal drivers of cell growth for many tissues<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, that they lie downstream of many normal, developmental and regenerative mitogenic signaling pathways<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, that c-MYC is an essential driver of proliferation in Ins1 and RINm5F rat pancreatic beta cell lines<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, that c-MYC can drive human beta cell proliferation<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, and that the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter may consequently serve as a downstream &#x0201c;sensor&#x0201d; for multiple diverse upstream signals leading to proliferation, we developed a luciferase-based small molecule high-throughput screening (HTS) platform to detect molecules that directly or indirectly activate the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1, Online Methods</xref></bold>).</p><p id="P3">We generated multiple stable cell lines expressing a luciferase reporter under control of the human <italic>MYC</italic> promoter (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1, Online Methods</xref></bold>). Among these, the human hepatocyte cell line HepG2 yielded most robust luciferase responses and the least variability in pilot HTS screens, and was selected for further screening using two small molecule libraries (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref></bold>): a 2300 compound FDA library and a 100,000 compound &#x0201c;L1&#x0201d; library. Of the 102,300 compounds, 4500 scored &#x0003e;3 for median absolute deviation (MAD)<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> for luciferase activation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref></bold>). Among these, the 86 that generated the greatest normalized percent activation (NPA &#x0003e;7.5%)<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> were assessed for their ability both to induce c-MYC protein expression in HepG2 cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref></bold>) and to induce BrdU incorporation in dispersed rat pancreatic beta cells <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>). Only one compound, harmine, induced both mild c-MYC increments and substantial BrdU incorporation into rat beta cells. Harmine also induced notable BrdU as well as Ki67 labeling in human beta cells, with the frequent appearance of double nuclei, suggesting recent cell division (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1d&#x02212;g</xref></bold>).</p><p id="P4">Harmine is a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to the kinase pocket of DYRK1A, but also can inhibit other DYRK family members, monoamine oxidases (MAOs) and cdc-like kinases (CLKs). We therefore surveyed additional harmalogs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Harmaline and harmane, (inhibitors of MAO but not DYRK1A) did not induce proliferation; conversely, the <underline>In</underline>hibitor of <underline>DY</underline>RK1A, (INDY, a DYRK1A inhibitor but not an MAO inhibitor), activated proliferation in both rat and human beta cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b&#x02212;d</xref></bold>), also yielding Ki67<sup>+</sup> and BrdU<sup>+</sup> doublets (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). Harmine and INDY both also induced phosphorylation of histone-H3, a third marker of cell cycle transition (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref></bold>). Effective harmine and INDY doses were in the 1-15 &#x003bc;M range, with higher doses being detrimental (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2e&#x02212;h</xref></bold>). WS6, a previously described small molecule beta cell proliferogen<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, had little effect on human beta cell proliferation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref></bold>). Ki67 labeling induced by harmine was unaffected by glucose concentration (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 2c</xref></bold>). Collectively, these observations suggested that DYRK1A or the closely related kinases, DYRK1B, DYRK2 or CLKs 1 and 4, are the relevant targets of harmine and INDY. Harmine and INDY also activated proliferation in alpha and ductal cells, with no detectable proliferation in delta or PP cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref></bold>).</p><p id="P5">TUNEL and p-&#x003b3;-H2AX labeling revealed no evidence of beta cell death or DNA damage in response to harmine or INDY (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref></bold>). Islet <italic>INS</italic> mRNA expression was increased; islet insulin content and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion were normal; of note, the transcription factors PDX1, NKX6.1, MAFA were increased at the mRNA, protein and beta cell immunocytochemical levels (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref></bold>).</p><p id="P6">To determine whether calcineurin-NFAT signaling<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> might mediate the proliferative effects of harmalogs in beta cells, we blocked the NFAT-calcineurin interaction with the NFAT inhibitor, VIVIT, and inhibited calcineurin activity with FK-506. Both inhibitors attenuated Ki67 labeling in rat and human beta cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref></bold>), suggesting that harmine and INDY proliferative effects may be mediated by calcineurin-NFAT signaling. We therefore surveyed NFAT family members in human beta cells. As predicted by rodent beta cells<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and human beta cell RNAseq<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, NFATs are also detectable in the cytoplasm in quiescent human beta cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref></bold>). Both harmine and INDY induce nuclear translocation of all four endogenous NFATs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 6</xref></bold>). Concordantly, adenovirally expressed NFAT2 (gene name <italic>NFATC1</italic>) is readily apparent in the cytoplasm in vehicle-treated beta cells, but shifted to a predominantly nuclear location within harmine- and INDY-treated beta cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref></bold>).</p><p id="P7">To further explore whether DYRK1A is a relevant regulator of proliferation in human beta cells, we adenovirally overexpressed DYRK1A in human islets. Notably, DYRK1A was detectable in normal quiescent human islets and could be effectively overexpressed, appearing in the nuclear compartment (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref></bold>); its overexpression competitively attenuated harmine- and INDY-induced human beta cell proliferation. Conversely, reducing endogenous DYRK1A using an adenoviral shRNA directed against human <italic>DYRK1A</italic> led to a three-fold increase in human beta proliferation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref></bold>).</p><p id="P8">Harmine and INDY occupy the ATP pocket in DYRK1A, forming two hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Lys<sup>188</sup> and the backbone of Leu<sup>241</sup>, with hydrogen bond acceptor groups in the correct orientation to form these interactions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref></bold>)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Conversely, harmalogs that lack DYRK1A inhibitory activity and beta cell mitogenic activity (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref></bold>) are expected to fail to bind within the ATP binding pocket of DYRK1A because they lack one of the hydrogen bond acceptor groups (harmane, norharmane), or because the hydrogen bond acceptor groups are not correctly positioned (harmaline, harmalol) due to their non-planar conformation.</p><p id="P9">Since the HTS was based on <italic>MYC</italic> activation in HepG2 cells, we next asked whether harmine-induced proliferation in human islets required c-MYC activity. Harmine induced a reproducible but mild (two-fold) increase in c-MYC protein in human islets, and the c-MYC inhibitor, 1RH<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, inhibited harmine-induced proliferation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a&#x02212;d</xref></bold>). Further, adenoviral-Cre-mediated excision of <italic>Myc</italic> from islets of <italic>Myc<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic> mice<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> attenuated harmine-induced proliferation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8e&#x02212;h</xref></bold>). Thus, harmine-induced proliferation depends in part on c-MYC activation. Next, searching for additional downstream cell cycle mediators of harmalog action, we performed an mRNA screen of G1/S cell cycle control molecules, confirmed by immunoblot and immunocytochemistry, that revealed increases in relevant cyclins and cdks (eg., cyclins A, E, CDK1, FOXM1, and CDC25A, E2Fs1 and 2) and reductions in cell cycle inhibitors (notably p15<sup>INK4</sup>, p16<sup>INK4</sup> and p57<sup>CIP2</sup>) in response to harmine and INDY, (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref></bold>).</p><p id="P10">Finally, we used three different <italic>in vivo</italic> models to assess the ability of harmine to activate proliferation, augment beta cell mass and enhance glycemic control. In the first, a partial pancreatectomy (PPX) model, harmine treatment induced Ki67 labeling in mouse beta cells in both sham-operated mice and in mice subjected to PPX, with most robust proliferation in the beta cells of PPX mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a&#x02212;c</xref></bold>). In the PPX model, regeneration of beta cell mass was substantially more rapid in the harmine-treated mice than in the controls, reaching near-normal values in only 14 days. In the second model, a euglycemic NOD-SCID mouse model, BrdU and Ki67 labeling increased 2-3-fold in human beta cells transplanted into the renal capsule of harmine-treated vs. control euglycemic mice, without evidence of beta cell death (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d&#x02212;h</xref></bold>). In the third model, a marginal mass human islet transplant model in streptozotocin-diabetic NODSCID mice, harmine treatment also resulted in near normal glycemic control, as assessed both by postprandial and fasting glucose values as well as by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance challenge (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i&#x02212;j</xref></bold>).</p><p id="P11">Harmine and INDY induce human beta cells to enter cell cycle, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, with beta cell labeling indices that are in the range that occur physiologically in humans during in the first year of life, and a range that may be relevant to therapeutic beta cell expansion<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Harmine not only induces markers of proliferation in rat, mouse and human beta cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, it also increases beta cell mass and regeneration in a mouse PPX model, and enhances glycemic control and beta cell proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic> in two additional standard human islet transplant models, one euglycemic and one diabetic. Further, and unexpectedly, harmine induces production of the important beta cell transcription factors, NKX6.1, PDX1, and MAFA. It appears that harmalogs may act through the calcium-mediated, calcineurin-driven pathway, activating key cell cycle molecules such as c-MYC, CDK1, cyclins A and D, FOXM1, E2Fs, and CDC25A, as well as repressing important cell cycle inhibitors such as p15<sup>INK4</sup>, p16<sup>INK4</sup> and p57<sup>CIP</sup> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref></bold>). In parallel, calcineurin-NFAT signaling has also been shown to be essential in mouse genetic models of beta cell growth and differentiation<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">That DYRK1A inhibition can lead to beta cell expansion is surprising. Another group has reported that <italic>Dyrk1a</italic> haploinsufficiency in mice results in attenuated beta cell mass and glucose intolerance<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>; conversely transgenic <italic>Dyrk1a</italic> overexpression led to accentuated beta cell size, mass and proliferation as well as enhanced glucose tolerance<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Potential explanations for this paradox may include differences in species, age, timing of expression (developmental phenotypes in mice vs. adult treatment), duration of treatment (days in human islets, vs. permanently and constitutively in mouse genetic models), CNS targeting (the murine constructs affect all tissues), possible dominant-positive effects of heterozygous loss, and/or differences between drug-induced conformational changes in a given protein vs. ablation or overexpression of the same protein. Perhaps most importantly, <italic>Dyrk1a</italic> is an unusually complex gene, with up to 17 exons (nomenclature for <italic>Dyrk1a</italic> exons varies), and at least nine different splice variants, only one exon of which was eliminated in the gene disruption studies<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Unraveling the products, cell type-specific isoforms and effects of harmalogs on these various isoforms will require further study.</p><p id="P13">These studies support a role for DYRK1A as the relevant target of the harmalogs, and likely exclude closely related kinases such as DYRK1B, DYRK2, DYRK3, DYRK4, and CLKs1-4. For example, DYRKs 3 and 4, and CLKs 2 and 3 are unlikely targets, since harmalogs are weak inhibitors of these, leaving DYRK1A, DYRK1B, DYRK2, CLK1 and CLK4 as the remaining likely candidates. These cannot easily be distinguished on pharmacologic grounds, since available inhibitors largely overlap. However, the complimentary observations that overexpression <italic>DYRK1A</italic> blocks, and silencing of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> mimics, the mitogenic effects of harmine and INDY on human beta cells make DYRK1A the prime candidate for a harmalog target. Nonetheless, further specificity studies are warranted.</p><p id="P14">Since DYRK and CLK family members are widely distributed, existing harmalogs likely will have off-target effects<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. For example, harmine derived from plant extracts is a CNS stimulant<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, and activates proliferation in some non-beta islet cell types (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref></bold>). Also, harmine is a PPAR-&#x003b3; activator and mediator of adipogenesis in mice, and leads to enhanced glucose sensitivity and disposal in obese, diabetic db/db mice<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Beta cell proliferation, mass and function were not examined in that study. Thus, as is the case for all potential beta cell therapeutics<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>-<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, there is an urgent need to develop strategies to target harmalogs specifically to the beta cell.</p><p id="P15">In addition, understanding and optimizing the duration and dosing of future potential harmalogs will be important: excessive (~50-150x) <italic>Myc</italic> expression in mice has adverse consequences, leading to beta cell transformation, death and diabetes<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Cell death serves as an evolutionary fail-safe mechanism that prevents accidental unrestrained production of c-MYC and tumor growth in all tissues<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. The observations that harmine causes only modest, two-fold, increases in c-MYC, that proliferation induced by harmine in human beta cells (~1-1.5%) is similar to that observed in neonatal life<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, and that the duration of physiologic proliferation in humans is confined to the first year or few years of life<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> provide room for optimism. The absence of evidence of beta cell death, DNA damage or de-differentiation in response to harmalogs is also encouraging.</p><p id="P16">In summary, harmalogs are able to induce adult human beta cell cycle entry at rates that are in the physiologic and potentially therapeutic range. Further approaches to optimizing the potency of the harmalog backbone, of unequivocally defining its molecular target(s), and of developing methods to direct it specifically to the beta cell are important future challenges.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1" specific-use="web-only"><title>ONLINE METHODS</title><sec id="S2"><title>General experimental approaches</title><p id="P17">No samples, mice or data points were excluded from the reported analyses.
