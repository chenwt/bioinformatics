Surface proteins or variant surface antigens (VSA) have been identified so far in three species infecting humans: <italic>Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax and P. knowlesi</italic>, as well as in the rodent malaria parasites <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>and <italic>P. yoelii </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These proteins are implicated in antigenic variation and immune evasion, as well as parasite accumulation or sequestration in host tissues; features which may be critical in determining the outcome of malaria reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Since VSAs are recognized by antibodies, they are also likely to be important targets for a protective immune response eg. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In most <italic>Plasmodium </italic>species VSAs are encoded by multi-gene families, usually located in sub-telomeric chromosome regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, several VSA gene families have been identified such as <italic>var, rif, stevor </italic>and <italic>surf </italic>reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Among them, the best characterized is the <italic>var </italic>gene family encoding <italic>Pf</italic>EMP1 proteins, which is implicated in both antigenic variation and sequestration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This family consists of 60 genes that can be grouped into several families (A-E) according to chromosomal location, coding and non-intergenic sequences, direction of transcription, and domain arrangements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Similarly, the <italic>rif </italic>genes, the largest multi-copy gene family in <italic>P. falciparum </italic>(circa 150-200 genes), has been divided into subgroups A and B on the basis of sequence similarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]
. A- and B-type RIFINs have different sub-cellular localizations, in that only the A-type RIFINs appear to be exported towards the surface of iRBCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, A-type RIFINs may be more likely to play a role in the host/parasite relationship during the blood stages of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</p><p><italic>Plasmodium </italic>interspersed repeat (<italic>pir</italic>) genes have been identified in <italic>Plasmodium vivax </italic>(<italic>vir</italic>), <italic>P. knowlesi </italic>(<italic>kir</italic>), <italic>P. berghei </italic>(<italic>bir</italic>), <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>(<italic>cir</italic>), and <italic>P. yoelii </italic>(<italic>yir</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Together, <italic>pirs </italic>form the largest multi-gene family identified to date in <italic>Plasmodium </italic>species, and occupy up to 5% of the parasite genome. On completion of the <italic>P. vivax </italic>Salvador I genome sequence, a total of 12 <italic>vir </italic>sub-families were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Similarly, 5 sub-families have been identified within the <italic>yir </italic>repertoire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, so far no function has been ascribed to the subgroups of <italic>yir </italic>and <italic>vir </italic>families.</p><p>Microarray studies carried out on <italic>P. vivax </italic>and <italic>P. yoelii </italic>suggest that approximately 50% of the <italic>yir </italic>and <italic>vir </italic>repertoires are expressed in a population of iRBCs during infection, with no evidence of preferential transcription according to their chromosomal location or phylogenetic sub-groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Surprisingly, considering the large proportion of <italic>yir </italic>genes transcribed in the parasite population, only 1-3 <italic>yirs </italic>are transcribed in a single iRBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This suggests that transcription of these genes is under tight control. The function(s) of PIR proteins, however, remain unknown.</p><p>Rodent malarias offer the only feasible system in which the contribution of PIR proteins to immune evasion and to sequestration and pathology can be examined. Of these, <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>is the only rodent species that naturally produces a chronic infection in mice. These chronic infections are likely to be perpetuated by antigenic variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]; however, the antigens involved have not yet been determined. <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>also exhibits other important features observed in human <italic>Plasmodium </italic>infections, including rosetting and adhesion to host endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and thus is an ideal model in which to investigate the role of PIR proteins.</p><p>The <italic>cir </italic>genes comprise the largest gene family in <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>, and are located in sub-telomeric regions of chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Recently, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis indicated that <italic>cir </italic>genes may have tissue specific patterns of expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, as such techniques are not gene specific, they are only able to provide clues about general <italic>cir </italic>expression. Furthermore, very little is known about the function of CIRs in stimulating or evading host immunity during <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>infection.</p><p>Here we describe two major sub-families within the <italic>cir </italic>repertoire of the recently completed <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>AS genome. Using an approach similar to that applied to the RIFIN repertoire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], we found both conserved and sub-family specific amino acid motifs, and predict functional divergence between the proteins from different CIR sub-families.</p><p>We have analyzed in detail the expression of the entire <italic>cir </italic>repertoire via RNA sequencing (Illumina RNA-seq) and microarray. Up to 40% of the <italic>cir </italic>gene repertoire was expressed in the parasite population during infection, and dominant <italic>cir </italic>transcripts could be identified, with some differences in the pattern of expression between the <italic>cir </italic>subgroups. Finally, we found specific <italic>cir </italic>genes were expressed at different time points during asexual blood stages. Together these data will allow future investigation of the CIR family to elucidate their roles in the host/pathogen relationship.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and was approved by the Ethical Committee of the MRC National Institute for Medical Research, and the British Home Office (PPL: 80/2538).</p></sec><sec><title>Annotation of <italic>cir </italic>genes</title><p><italic>cir </italic>genes were annotated using Artemis release 11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] onto the eight-fold coverage assembly of the <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi </italic>AS genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

Upon addition of more divergent <italic>cir </italic>genes to the repertoire, 16 sequences aligned poorly with the majority of CIRs and were excluded from the analysis (tabulated in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1b</xref>). These included the three partial CIRs, eight CIR sequences with low C- or N-terminal similarity to other members of the repertoire, two CIRs encoded by genes with an atypical structure and three sequences which had been identified as <italic>cir</italic>-like genes, containing some but not all features of <italic>cir </italic>genes.</p><p>The sequence similarity of the alignment was determined using Plotcon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].

Approximately a third of the residues in each insertion sequence were hydrophobic and very few basic residues were present. Notably, both sequences included two conserved cysteine residues.</p><p>The two RIFIN sub-families have been shown to display different sub-cellular localizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and thus A- and B-type RIFINs may have different functions.

To investigate whether the members of each major CIR sub-type could also have functionally diverged, the alignment of 183 CIRs was split into the two major sub-families, between which Rate- and Conservation- Shifting Sites were compared (RSS and CSS, respectively), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].

Significant CSS and RSS sites are plotted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>. 77 RSS (15.4% of all positions) and 158 CSS (31.8% of all positions) were identified along the alignment, strongly suggesting that functional divergence between the CIR sub-families may have occurred according to the criteria generated with protein families of known function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Funshift analysis of CIR sub-families A and B</bold>.

For this, mRNA was purified from <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi </italic>AS iRBCs at the late trophozoite stage from four BALB/c mice and sequenced using Illumina/Solexa technology [Array Express accession number: E-ERAD-25 and ENA Study Accession Number: ERP000983]. Results obtained from intergenic regions allowed the determination of a threshold of detection, above which a gene was considered significantly expressed in each sample (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>). Accordingly, the expression of up to 40% of <italic>cir </italic>genes could be detected in each sample analyzed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold><italic>cir </italic>gene expression during infection</bold>.

Regions of overlap are dark grey.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-13-125-4"/></fig><p>In addition, mRNA was also sequenced from parasites passaged in two C57BL/6 mice. Both the BALB/c and C57BL/6 inbred strains of mice are commonly used hosts for <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>infection (for example: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]), thus it was important to determine whether either host genetic background could influence <italic>cir </italic>expression. While in the C57BL/6 samples only 17% and 12% of the <italic>cir </italic>repertoire were expressed above background, these lower values were at least partly the result of a higher RPKM cutoff due to relatively high expression of annotated introns and thus probably do not reflect differences in <italic>cir </italic>expression between BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice.</p><p>A list of the ten most highly expressed <italic>cir </italic>genes was established for each sample (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). As their expression was most highly detected in a population of parasites (either due to higher levels of expression in selected iRBCs or expression in a higher number of iRBCs), these will henceforth be referred to as "dominant <italic>cir</italic>s". When we compared the lists of dominant <italic>cir</italic>s thus established, it was evident that most of these genes (&#x0003e; 60%) were different between the samples analyzed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). This indicates that the relative level of <italic>cir </italic>transcripts may vary from one mouse to another; which could reflect antigenic variation, immune selection of iRBCs or sampling differences upon infection of the mice. Whilst the overall level of <italic>cir </italic>expression was significantly lower than for other parasite genes (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; D = 0.6742, P-value &#x0003c; 2.2e-16, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>), the dominant <italic>cir </italic>transcripts were found amongst the most highly expressed parasite genes.</p><p>Surprisingly, the same gene (PCHAS_110030) was expressed more than ten fold higher than any other <italic>cir </italic>genes in all the BALB/c samples analyzed. Similarly, three other <italic>cir</italic>s (PCHAS_140140, PCHAS_070130, and PCHAS_000430) were also dominant in these four samples. Furthermore, all of these genes, except PCHAS_140140, were dominant in at least one of the two C57BL/6 mice studied (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). This indicates that some <italic>cir </italic>genes are consistently highly represented in a population of <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi AS </italic>parasites at the late trophozoite stage during the peak of parasitemia (8 days post infection).</p><p>To evaluate whether there was a relationship between CIR sub-families and functions, a comparison of their expression patterns was undertaken. In our analysis, more of the expressed <italic>cir</italic>s belonged to sub-family B (on average, 57.2% &#x000b1; 4.7% were B-type <italic>cir</italic>s and 42.3% &#x000b1; 4.7% were A-types; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>).

When the expression levels of <italic>cir </italic>genes from each sub-family were compared, no statistically significant differences could be detected (K-S test, P = 0.46). It thus seems that the overall level of expression between <italic>cir </italic>genes belonging to sub-families A and B was similar.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of A- and B-type <italic>cir </italic>expression during <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>infection</bold>.

Of the total 96 unique <italic>cir </italic>genes represented on the array, 49 showed clear transcriptional activation throughout the IDC. Each <italic>cir </italic>showed a single peak of transcription in line with previous reports that in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, genes are only activated once during the IDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Importantly, not all <italic>cir </italic>genes were activated at the same time but rather showed progressive transcriptional activation throughout the IDC with approximately one third of the analyzed <italic>cir</italic>s respectively showing peak transcriptional activity at the ring, trophozoite and schizont stages. Similar observations have also been made in <italic>P. vivax</italic>, where members of the <italic>vir </italic>gene family showed a comparable transcription pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Transcriptional profile of 49 detected <italic>cir </italic>genes throughout the IDC</bold>. 49 <italic>cir </italic>transcripts could be detected by microarray, which are listed along with sub-family classifications, next to their pattern of expression throughout the IDC, A).

However, many members of each sub-family could be detected at every time point. These data also strongly suggest that different <italic>cir</italic>s are indeed transcribed at different stages of parasite development in the erythrocyte in line with their products having different functions.</p><p>Interestingly, several of the dominant <italic>cir </italic>transcripts from the RNA sequencing experiments were also detected in this microarray timecourse, despite the fact that this material was obtained from separate <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>infections. These <italic>cir</italic>s were: PCHAS_110030, PCHAS_140140, PCHAS_110020, PCHAS_001090, PCHAS_070130, PCHAS_000110 and PCHAS_000120, which comprised approximately a third of the dominant <italic>cir</italic>s identified by RNA sequencing analysis. In addition, as each time point represents the material from a single mouse, the progression of <italic>cir </italic>transcription appeared to be conserved in the mice that were infected with a single starting parasite population and would suggest that limited switching occurs within a single cycle of asexual development. Importantly, the peak timing of expression of these <italic>cirs </italic>detected by microarray is consistent with the parasite stage used for the RNA sequencing analysis, further supporting the notion that the timing of expression of different CIR is conserved in different independent infections.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In total, 196 <italic>cir </italic>genes have been identified and annotated in the <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>genome. The <italic>cir </italic>genes distribute into two major groups, according to sequence similarity. Many <italic>cir</italic>s from both sub-families are transcribed during <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>infection, although dominant <italic>cir </italic>transcripts are present. Differences between the sub-families, such as sub-family specific amino acid motifs and altered residue conservation, particularly within the predicted TM domain, indicate that the two sub-families could be functionally divergent. Recombination of <italic>cir </italic>genes may have occurred within the <italic>cir </italic>repertoire, consistent with that observed in other <italic>Plasmodium </italic>multi-gene families including <italic>var </italic>and <italic>sicavar </italic>(for example: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]).</p><p>Similar to the VIR and YIR gene families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we confirm that there are also sub-groups within the CIR repertoire in agreement with Ebbinghaus and Krucken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. As each of the major groups defined here represented almost half of the CIRs, we defined these as the sub-families: A, comprising the more divergent CIRs; and B, containing more conserved CIRs. These CIR sub-families could each be further sub-divided into smaller clades. Despite the different analysis of CIRs recently described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], the same groups could be identified within our network (as clade A1 and sub-family B), indicating that the sequences in each of these groups are indeed highly similar to each other. While the overall conservation of PIRs across species is relatively low, some evidence exists for sub-families being shared between <italic>P. yoelii </italic>and <italic>P. berghei </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], as well as <italic>P. chabaudi, P. yoelii </italic>and <italic>P. berghei </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] suggesting common functions.</p><p>The extensive sequence variation often seen in multi-gene families like <italic>var, rif </italic>and <italic>stevor </italic>in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, or the <italic>pir</italic>s in <italic>P. vivax </italic>and rodent malaria parasites, is thought to reflect that these genes are under immune pressure (eg. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]). In our analysis however, we have identified 14 conserved amino acid motifs, suggesting that some parts of the CIR sequences are under constraints important for the biological functions of these proteins. While some motifs were found in the majority of CIRs, motifs unique to each of the two sub-families were also detected. This divergence of conserved amino acid sequence motifs in the different sub-groups presents strong evidence that the different CIR sub-types may indeed carry out distinct but related functions in the parasite, as suggested also for PIR and RIFIN sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Since the CIR A sub-family contained the most divergent CIRs, these proteins may be exposed to stronger selective pressure, and it is possible that their diverse nature enables immune evasion <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In line with the functional diversification of CIR subtypes A and B, some CIRs belonging to sub-type A possessed a unique amino acid motif (motif 8) at the beginning of the predicted TM domain. This, in addition to different conservation of proline residues and other amino acids within the predicted TM domains of each sub-family, suggests that CIR sub-family A proteins may have a functionally different TM domain than the B-type CIRs, perhaps altering which membrane the proteins are able to span.</p><p>Janssen and colleagues have predicted that <italic>rif </italic>and <italic>stevor </italic>could be ancestral to the <italic>pir </italic>genes due to similarities in terms of size, amino acid motifs and conservation of the first intron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The observations that the CIR repertoire could be separated into two major sub-types namely thanks to an insertion within CIR sub-type A, a section of which contained two highly conserved cysteine residues [similar to RIFIN sub-type A, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]], is strong evidence that the CIR family displays further parallels to the RIFINs. The variation we observed in the number and position of cysteine residues in the two CIR sub-families could significantly impact on the overall protein tertiary structure, and thereby function. As predicted for the A and B type RIFINs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], we found high proportions of rate and conservation shifting sites between the two major CIR sub-families, providing further support for the idea of functional divergence.</p><p>Transcriptional differences in both in amount as well as timing can indicate functional differences between related genes. Until now, only Northern blot, degenerate PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses have been used to give indications of <italic>cir </italic>gene expression during <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Here, we have used both mRNA sequencing as well as microarray studies to obtain a detailed picture of <italic>cir </italic>transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>. The expression of up to 40% of the <italic>cir </italic>genes could be detected during an infection. Different <italic>cir</italic>s were transcribed at different times during the IDC of the parasite, with distinct <italic>cir</italic>s being transcribed in ring, trophozoite and schizont stages. The timing of transcription for a specific <italic>cir </italic>appeared to be conserved from one animal to another (as seen in the microarray experiments) as well as across different experiments (as seen with the good overlap between the genes transcribed in the trophozoite stage as detected by both RNA sequencing and microarray), suggesting that CIRs may carry out distinct ring-, trophozoite-or schizont-specific functions. This is further supported by the observation that <italic>pir </italic>transcription follows a similar pattern in both <italic>P. vivax </italic>and <italic>P. yoelii</italic>, where 59% of the <italic>vir</italic>s and 42% of the <italic>yir</italic>s were expressed respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Whilst most <italic>cir </italic>genes were transcribed at lower levels than other parasite genes, this most likely reflects differences in the proportion of parasites that actually express a particular <italic>cir</italic>, resulting in populations of iRBCs each expressing different <italic>cir </italic>genes. This would be consistent with observations made for <italic>vir</italic>s, <italic>yir</italic>s and <italic>var</italic>s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>], that individual iRBCs transcribe only one or a small number of these genes. It is therefore of particular interest that three <italic>cir </italic>genes were represented at relatively high levels in all six samples analyzed by RNA sequencing (PCHAS_110030, PCHAS_070130, and PCHAS_000430), with PCHAS_110030 being detected at a level more than 10 fold higher than any other <italic>cir </italic>in all the samples analyzed. In a classic model of antigenic variation, it would be expected that a single or relatively small number of a gene family would be transcribed in any population, with other members of the gene family being transcribed at much lower levels. This is exactly what we have detected during <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>infection.</p><p>While our data suggest that <italic>cir</italic>s belonging to sub-family A are more highly transcribed than those belonging to sub-family B, these differences are relatively small. At this stage there it is not clear whether there is a preference for the transcription of A or B sub-families. What is evident though, is that both A and B sub-family members were transcribed at the peak of a blood-stage <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>infection. Considering that the sequence analysis carried out here strongly suggests functional differences between the two sub-types, the expression of both sub-families may indicate that A and B-type CIRs provide complementary but non-overlapping roles at different stages during infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have here presented a thorough analysis of the <italic>cir </italic>repertoire, highlighting similarities between these genes and other multi-gene families. The two CIR sub-families have been predicted to have different functions, as shown for the RIFINs of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Whilst these function(s) remain unknown, the large number of <italic>cir </italic>genes and their expression throughout the IDC indicates that CIR proteins are likely to play key roles in the biology of the parasite. These may include antigenic variation and immune evasion. Our application of RNA sequencing during <italic>P. chabaudi </italic>infection has enabled the detection of dominant <italic>cir </italic>transcripts for the first time, supporting such roles. Further application of these methodologies may elucidate the functions of CIR proteins and help to clarify the roles that members of the CIR sub-families play during infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JL<sup>(1st author) </sup>carried out the <italic>cir </italic>gene annotation in collaboration with UB, AP and MB; carried out the bioinformatic analyses, supervised by AJ; prepared RNA samples for RNAseq and drafted the manuscript in collaboration with TB.
