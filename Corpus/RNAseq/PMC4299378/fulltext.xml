proteome information is essential. Despite great progress in proteomics technologies, thorough
interrogation of the proteome from quantity-limited biological samples is hampered by inefficiencies
during processing. To address these challenges, here we introduce a novel protocol using
paramagnetic beads, termed Single-Pot Solid-Phase-enhanced Sample Preparation (SP3). SP3 provides a
rapid and unbiased means of proteomic sample preparation in a single tube that facilitates
ultrasensitive analysis by outperforming existing protocols in terms of efficiency, scalability,
speed, throughput, and flexibility. To illustrate these benefits, characterization of 1,000 HeLa
cells and single <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos is used to establish that SP3 provides an
enhanced platform for profiling proteomes derived from sub-microgram amounts of material. These data
present a first view of developmental stage-specific proteome dynamics in
<italic>Drosophila</italic> at a single-embryo resolution, permitting characterization of
inter-individual expression variation. Together, the findings of this work position SP3 as a
superior protocol that facilitates exciting new directions in multiple areas of proteomics ranging
from developmental biology to clinical applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>paramagnetic beads</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>quantification</kwd><kwd>sample preparation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Diversity and complexity in cellular proteomes have driven the development of a broad range of
protocols to improve analyses by mass spectrometry (MS). In traditional bottom-up experiments, these
methods are optimized to enhance the depth of proteome coverage through generation of conditions
favorable for proteolytic digestion and sample recovery (Le&#x000f3;n <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>,
<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Tanca <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and have led to charting of the near-complete proteomes of
various mammalian cell lines (Beck <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Moghaddas Gholami <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Branca <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).
However, performance in proteomic experiments drops steeply when protein amounts are limited, due to
inefficiencies related to sample processing and instrument sensitivity. Although recent innovations
in mass spectrometric instrumentation have accelerated the speed and sensitivity of proteome
analysis (Hebert <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>),
further improvements can be obtained by emphasizing the optimization, simplification, and
miniaturization of sample preparation.</p><p>To enhance sample processing, agents that aid in cell disruption and solubilization such as
detergents and chaotropes are often utilized. Problematically, the majority of these additives are
incompatible with proteolysis and MS analysis and thus necessitate removal using ultrafiltration
(Wisniewski <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and
bead-based (Bereman <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>;
Hengel <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) or precipitation
approaches, each of which increase handling and subsequent loss of material. As MS-based proteomics
drives toward the analysis of rare and quantity-limited samples, ultrasensitive workflows that
eliminate these losses are essential (Altelaar &#x00026; Heck, <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). This has led to the development of methodologies that minimize handling and promote
high sample recovery (Ethier &#x00026; Hou, <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Umar
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b58" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Waanders

<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b70" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, these
protocols have limited flexibility due to several shortcomings, including reagent incompatibilities
(detergents, chaotropes, salts), the required use of detergent alternatives (e.g., amphipols),
restrictions related to absolute sample volume, throughput, and excessive handling. Subsequently,
these workflows have typically been limited to processing of absolute material quantities
&#x0003e;&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g or achieve reduced proteome coverage (&#x0223c;2,000 total
proteins) when examining sub-microgram amounts of protein. These drawbacks have largely precluded
the use of proteomics in applications where high reproducibility, sensitivity, and throughput are
necessary, such as in clinical studies or population screening.</p><p>The rapid expansion of next-generation sequencing has prompted the development of methods
amenable to high-throughput genome library preparation that are greatly facilitated by the
application of paramagnetic beads in manual and roboticized platforms (DeAngelis
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Wilkening
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, paramagnetic
bead usage is not common in general proteomics, although they have been employed in specialized
applications for covalent coupling or affinity purification of proteins, immobilized proteolysis
(Fan <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and for the
enrichment of post-translationally modified peptides (Yeh <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b65" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Zeng <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b68" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Recent technologies based on nanodiamond particles have illustrated the
depletion of contaminating substances and enhancement of compartment-specific proteomics (Chen
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Pham
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Building on technology
developments pioneered by solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) (DeAngelis
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) and nanodiamond
technologies (Chen <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), and
with the goal of enhancing and simplifying generic proteomics sample processing, we have developed
SP3. SP3 is a novel single-tube proteomics workflow that provides efficient unbiased binding of
proteins and peptides, enabling rapid and efficient completion of common proteomics workflows in a
high-throughput manner.</p><p>In this study, SP3 is applied to a variety of conventional and ultrasensitive proteomics
applications. Based on the observation that SP3 provided an enhanced platform for handling
sub-microgram amounts of material determined from in-depth proteome profiling HeLa cells, we applied
SP3 to examine embryonic development using <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. While a wealth of
gene expression data exists for <italic>Drosophila</italic>, its proteome dynamics during
development has been the focus of relatively few studies (Carmena, <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). With an SP3-based approach, the proteome here is profiled to a depth of
&#x0003e;&#x000a0;6,000 proteins, of the predicted 18,000 proteins in the <italic>Drosophila</italic>
genome, from pooled embryos at 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;h (stages 5&#x02013;7) and 10&#x02013;12&#x000a0;h
(stages 13&#x02013;15) of development. This analysis was extended to capture dynamics in an
ultrasensitive screen at a single-embryo resolution. These data represent the largest catalog of the
<italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo proteome to date, while providing unparalleled sensitivity for
quantitative comparisons that have the potential to reveal novel inter-individual proteome variance.
Furthermore, the use of SP3 in these studies illustrates its potential advantages in other areas of
developmental and clinical biology where reproducible in-depth quantitative analysis is required to
explain inter-individual variation with scarce sample amounts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Here, we demonstrate for the first time that proteins and peptides can be immobilized on the
hydrophilic surface of carboxylate-coated paramagnetic beads in an unbiased fashion, initiated by
the introduction of an organic additive, and by a mechanism similar to hydrophilic interaction
chromatography (HILIC) (Alpert, <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>) or electrostatic
repulsion hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ERLIC) (Alpert, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>A). The addition of an organic solvent to
an aqueous solution containing paramagnetic beads promotes trapping of proteins and peptides in a
solvation layer on the hydrophilic surface of the beads. This interaction can be adjusted through
modulation of the solution pH, where an acidic solution promotes HILIC-style binding, and basic
conditions are similar to ERLIC with repulsion driven by the negatively charged carboxylate group on
the bead surface. We have observed this mechanism to be effective utilizing beads from a range of
manufacturers (Supplementary Fig S1A).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>SP3 provides an efficient means for preparing protein and peptide samples for MS

(Supplementary Fig S1B and C) with a combination of solutions to efficiently remove contaminating
agents, such as detergents and chaotropes. We have found that a combination of rinses with
70% ethanol and 100% acetonitrile provides optimal removal of a range of reagents
common to proteomics (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>B). After rinsing, proteins and
peptides are eluted into an aqueous solution. At this stage, purified proteins can be directly used
in a variety of downstream protocols, such as fractionation or digestion. Employing a similar
workflow, peptide mixtures can be immobilized and rinsed on the surface of the paramagnetic beads.
SP3 of peptide mixtures accomplishes both cleanup and concentration, eliminating the need for common
de-salting and rotary evaporation steps. Subsequently, eluted peptide mixtures can be immediately
subjected to MS analysis. Alternatively, peptides can be selectively eluted in a stepwise manner
through modulation of the acetonitrile concentration and fractionated off-bead using ERLIC or HILIC
conditions prior to MS analysis. Preceding fractionation or peptide SP3, peptides may also be
chemically labeled. Each SP3 process (protein and peptide) is rapid, requiring just 15&#x000a0;min
(excluding digestion times), and can be completed entirely in parallel with no increase in process
time, even when scaling to a 96-well format. Furthermore, all steps in a conventional proteomics
protocol (cell lysis, protein cleanup and digestion, peptide labeling, desalting, fractionation, and
concentration) can be completed entirely in a single tube with SP3, maximizing throughput while
minimizing potential sample loss.</p><p>To illustrate the efficiency and utility of SP3 in comparison with conventional methods for
protein manipulation, we employed a whole-cell lysate prepared in 1% SDS-containing buffer
derived from the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. SDS&#x02013;PAGE analysis of
SP3-treated lysates showed no discernible protein loss when compared with untreated controls
(Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>C). In contrast, when utilizing conditions previously
described to promote protein binding to nanodiamond particles through modulation of the solution pH
or bead concentration (Chen <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Pham <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>),
interestingly reduced interaction with the paramagnetic beads used with SP3 was observed
(Supplementary Fig S2A and B). Non-specific losses that limit protein recovery were not observed
when compared to precipitation conditions as employed in SPRI for oligonucleotides, as well as a
common ultrafiltration-based approach (filter-aided sample preparation, FASP) (Wisniewski
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="b64" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>) (Supplementary Fig S2C and D). Protein enrichment with SP3 was observed to
be efficient in both concentrated and dilute solutions (Supplementary Fig S3A and B), as well as in
the presence of harsh sample solubilization matrices, including 10% SDS and Laemmli loading
buffer, conditions incompatible with ultrafiltration membranes, and nanodiamond enrichment
(Supplementary Fig S3C and D).</p><p>After proteolysis, peptide mixtures are commonly handled in a variety of downstream workflows
targeted at cleanup, concentration, or labeling. These protocols use a diverse range of reagents and
necessitate numerous processing steps. Simplification of these procedures while maintaining their
benefits is essential for ultrasensitive proteomics. To illustrate the enhanced completion of these
procedures with SP3, we employed peptide mixtures derived from a trypsin-LysC-digested yeast protein
lysate. MS analysis of SP3-treated peptide mixtures showed no apparent peptide loss when compared
with control samples prepared using a conventional StageTip procedure (Rappsilber
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>D). Improved peptide recovery was observable when comparing SP3 conditions to
pH, high bead concentration, or precipitation conditions utilized in nanodiamond and SPRI approaches
(Supplementary Fig S4A&#x02013;C). In addition, there was no discernible difference between
chromatograms from MS analysis of replicate enrichments (Supplementary Fig S4D), indicating that
these benefits did not come at the cost of reproducibility.</p><p>Prior to, or as part of, cleanup and concentration procedures, it is common to chemically label
peptide mixtures with stable isotopes to facilitate quantitative comparisons between treatment and
control conditions. The two most frequently applied chemical labeling approaches, reductive
dimethylation (Boersema <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>)
and isobaric mass tagging (Thompson <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Ross <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), are
based on amine-reactive chemistry and thus have specific buffer and solution composition
requirements. Using a peptide mixture derived from a yeast whole-cell lysate, along with a simple
modification to the SP3 protocol (Supplementary Fig S5A), &#x0003e;&#x000a0;98% efficiency of
labeling with both dimethyl and tandem mass tags (TMT) (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>A) was observed. The reproducibility of the labeling and enrichment reactions was found to
be high as illustrated by the minimal deviation from a fold change of zero for peptides in TMT
6-plex experiments of biological replicate samples (Supplementary Fig S5B). Biological
reproducibility was also found to be high even when handling sub-microgram amounts of material in an
SP3-based single-tube workflow. This was demonstrated by the high reproducibility in protein
quantification (mean Pearson correlation: 0.89) (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>B) when
comparing mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) and neural progenitor (NP) cells in 10 biological
replicates, each starting from 5,000 cells prepared in 1% SDS-containing buffer as input.
Together, these data indicate that SP3 provides a means for simple and efficient completion of a
variety of established quantitative proteomics workflows.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>SP3 facilitates efficient and reproducible chemical isotope labeling of peptide

</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="msb0010-0757-f2"/></fig><p>A significant amount of effort in proteomics is focused on achieving in-depth proteome coverage
both in abundant and in quantity-limited applications. To assess performance with in-depth proteome
profiling in abundant samples, we analyzed a yeast whole-cell lysate (&#x0223c;10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of
protein from a lysis prepared in 1% SDS-containing buffer) treated with SP3 or filter-aided
sample preparation (FASP) prior to high-pH reversed-phase fractionation. Combining biological
duplicates, comparable coverage between SP3 and FASP was observed, with a total of 3,944 and 4,008
proteins identified (Supplementary Fig S6A), mapping to 39,211 and 43,318 unique peptides,
respectively. This identity extended to reproducibility between individual replicates (Supplementary
Fig S6A), protein abundance distributions (Supplementary Fig S6B), and intensity-based absolute
quantification (iBAQ) (Schwanh&#x000e4;usser <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) assignments (Supplementary Fig S6C). Moreover, there was no discernible bias
in properties of the peptides captured with each protocol, as indicated by charge state
(Supplementary Fig S7A), molecular mass (Supplementary Fig S7B), isoelectric point (Supplementary
Fig S7C), grand average hydropathy (GRAVY) (Kyte &#x00026; Doolittle, <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>) distributions (Supplementary Fig S7D), and amino acid content (Supplementary Fig S7E).
Interestingly, although we observed an expected recovery of &#x0223c;50% of starting material
in FASP compared with SP3 (Supplementary Fig S2C) (Wisniewski <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b64" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>), this did not adversely affect the depth of proteome
coverage. This indicates that the differences in recovery between the protocols are indeed
non-specific in nature and that the amount of starting material was sufficient to overcome these
losses. Therefore, it can be concluded that SP3 has no observable bias and is compatible with
total-proteome characterization when compared with a widely employed method, FASP.</p><p>One of the primary strengths of the SP3 approach is the ability to provide scalable protein and
peptide recovery in a single-tube workflow, maximizing potential efficiency for ultrasensitive
applications. Previous attempts at analyzing small amounts of material have faced challenges during
sample processing and have frequently relied on the preparation of large cell populations diluted to
working concentrations (typically in the range of approximately 1,000&#x02013;5,000 cells) after
lysis and digestion (Altelaar &#x00026; Heck, <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Instead,
here we assessed the performance of SP3 for in-depth proteome analysis starting from sub-microgram
amounts of material. Specifically, replicate HeLa cell lysates from populations totaling 500,000,
50,000, 5,000, and 1,000 cells were prepared using a simplified detergent-based lysis coupled to the
single-tube SP3 protocol.</p><p>After fractionation with high-pH reversed-phase HPLC, high-pH reversed-phase StageTip, SP3
fractionation (ERLIC-style), or single-shot injections, efficient protein and peptide recovery was
observed across a wide quantity range determined by base-peak chromatogram complexities and
intensities (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>A). This resulted in high depth of proteome
coverage based on unique peptide identifications in single-shot and fraction injections of low
abundance samples (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>B). Strikingly, even when starting
from 1,000 cells, we reliably identified &#x0003e;&#x000a0;15,000 unique peptides (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>B). However, the 1,000 cell samples approached the limit in
sensitivity of the MS hardware, resulting in a loss of total proteome coverage and sample intensity,
and subsequently in a skewed distribution of iBAQ values (Supplementary Fig S8A). In contrast, there
was no observable difference in the abundance profiles (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>C, Supplementary Fig S8A) between the 50,000 (25% injected) and 5,000 cell
single-shot samples, likely stemming from saturation in the instrument sampling rate (Supplementary
Fig S8B). This highlights the similarity of the captured proteomes in contrast to the difference in
starting material.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>SP3 is compatible with and enhances ultrasensitive proteome analysis</title><p><list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>SP3 facilitates enhanced depth of coverage in quantity-limited samples.

is yet accepted as a &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; for proteomics. Although FASP has seen widespread
utility for sample processing, the requirement for modifications to overcome losses associated with
the method has limited its utility in ultrasensitive screens (Wisniewski
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b63" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>,<xref rid="b64" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Erde <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). To benchmark SP3 in relation to current state-of-the-art high-efficiency proteomics
methods, we compared with the data as presented by the recently described integrated Stage-Tip (iST)
protocol (Kulak <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).
Although not as flexible as FASP in terms of reagents, iST boasts excellent performance in handling
of minute quantities of material. In the original paper, this is highlighted in an ultrasensitive
analysis of limited numbers of HeLa cells (Supplementary Fig S1D in Kulak
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>). Comparing the numbers of identified peptides, the depth of coverage
obtained with 10,000 cells by the iST protocol requires just 5,000 cells with the SP3 approach.
Interestingly, we observed an increase of &#x0223c;5,000 unique peptide identifications when
analyzing equivalent cell numbers (1,000 cells) with SP3 compared to the iST data. It is noteworthy
that although both protocols focus on the minimization of processing volumes and encapsulation of
all steps in a single device, the reversed-phase nature of the iST method imparts the limitations of
conventional proteomics methods on the technology (e.g., inability to use detergents such as SDS or
solvents such as trifluoroethanol (TFE) during lysis). In contrast, SP3 does not suffer from any of
the limitations that hinder ultrasensitive proteomics methods, and as a result, we were able to
utilize 1% SDS to enhance cell lysis and protein solubilization, potentially explaining the
increased numbers of identified peptides.</p><p>To capitalize on the benefits of the SP3 approach, it was applied in a whole-proteome analysis of
<italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos at 2&#x02013;4 and 10&#x02013;12&#x000a0;h after egg lay (AEL).
Previous proteomics analyses of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos have necessitated the use of
milligrams of material, equating to hundreds of individual embryos combined across multiple stages
of embryogenesis (Brunner <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Zhai &#x00026; Vill&#x000e9;n, <xref rid="b69" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Gouw
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). This experimental
design limits the resolution of the analysis by eliminating stage-specific developmental dynamics as
well as averaging out variability between individuals. We applied a modified SDS-TFE-lysis protocol
designed to eliminate the need for physical disruption (e.g., bead milling or beating, Dounce
homogenization), in combination with a single-tube SP3 workflow to 60 embryos, and identified a
total of 5,632 unique gene products, including prominent developmental factors, such as
<italic>bicoid</italic>, <italic>hunchback</italic>, and <italic>nanos</italic> (harvested between 2

number of polyadenylated RNA species to be between 5,000 and 7,000 (Levy &#x00026; Manning, <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>), and the number of gene products in the range of

expression kinetics at a single-embryo resolution (Sun <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This was facilitated by the large size of the

significantly smaller (&#x0003c;&#x000a0;500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) individual <italic>Drosophila</italic>

lysis and capture of the resultant material was essential. The flexibility of SP3 allowed for the
use of the harsh solution-based SDS-TFE protocol in combination with sonication to provide efficient
and reproducible lysis, and eliminated the need for physical disruption methods (e.g., bead beating)
that would result in unacceptable material losses when handling a single embryo. From a collection
of 11 biological replicates per stage (22 total samples), coverage of a total of 2,938 unique genes
was obtained (97.8% of genes covered in pooled samples) (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>A). While we estimate a single embryo contains just &#x0223c;200 ng of protein, significant
complexity is observable within each single-shot analysis (Supplementary Fig S10A), leading to a
high sampling rate (Supplementary Fig S10B).</p><p>Although a portion of the embryo proteome is missed due to the low quantity of starting protein
(Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>A), the similarity in depth of coverage of identified
gene products compared with previous stage-specific studies (Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>B) utilizing considerably larger amounts of material indicates that SP3-based single-embryo
analyses provide sufficient information for comparative experiments. Quantitatively, the data
revealed few differences from the pooled samples, where averaging of embryos would be expected to
minimize variation (Supplementary Table S2). Nominal deviations in reproducibility (single: 0.69,

transcription (<italic>Ref1, pzg</italic>) were enriched. In both stages, new proteins whose

similarity with the expression maps and to allow more precise molecular staging of each individual.
Based on the quantified proteins from the single embryos, few significant differences in fold change

show differential expression (determined as the maximum difference in fold change that generated a

displayed expression profiles similar to 2&#x02013;2.5 and 3&#x02013;3.5&#x000a0;h samples could be

expression pattern could also be detected at the RNA level (Supplementary Fig S13E). Of these 25
proteins, 10 were associated with the maternal-to-zygotic transition. This developmental process
directly overlaps with the 2- to 4-h collection window. From these 10 proteins, nine had expression
profiles available in the section data. A total of eight of these exhibited the expected
directionality in expression also observed in the protein data based on knowledge of the
maternal-to-zygotic transition (Supplementary Fig S13F, maternal: CG3663, iPLA2-VIA; zygotic: Nrt,

be validated with the knowledge of cellular processes or expression dynamics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we have presented a novel concept for proteomics that simplifies and streamlines a
range of conventional handling procedures common to MS-based protein analysis experiments. SP3
affords efficient completion of numerous proteomics protocols combining all steps from cell lysis to
fractionated peptide samples ready for MS analysis in a single-tube workflow. As such, SP3 offers
several advantages compared with current state-of-the-art proteomics technologies in the areas of
flexibility, scalability, and throughput. Importantly, SP3 combines these benefits into a single
platform, effectively simplifying sample preparation and eliminating the need for significant
protocol optimization prior to proteome analysis. The data presented in this work demonstrate the
feasibility of performing ultrasensitive, high-throughput analyses of challenging biological
specimens with the SP3 approach, opening new avenues of research to the proteomics community.</p><p>The diverse nature of the proteome necessitates the use of an equally broad set of reagents for
its preparation. This is especially important when handling difficult matrices, such as tissues,
where harsh denaturants are essential. The flexibility and benefits of using these reagents are
demonstrated throughout this work, where all experiments in yeast, human, mouse, and
<italic>Drosophila</italic> were performed in the presence of 1% (or greater) concentrations
of SDS. As a result, SP3 provides unmatched flexibility in catering reagent conditions to enhance
analysis of protein subsets (e.g., membrane) or total proteome mixtures. Although protocols such as
FASP offer the ability to use a broad set of reagents, this is limited by the compatibility of the
filter unit membrane. An added advantage of SP3 is that these benefits extend to the peptide level,
where proteolysis-enhancing reagents (e.g., urea, deoxycholate) can be used without protocol
modification due to their removal during SP3 treatment. This circumvents the need for tedious acid
precipitation or phase-transfer protocols for detergent removal, or dilution and desalting steps in
the case of urea.</p><p>Notably, the flexibility of the SP3 protocol also applies and was proven to be essential to
ultrasensitive applications in this study. Although mammalian cells can be easily lysed with SDS
treatment, yeast and embryo samples present a significant challenge and are conventionally tackled
using physical disruption methods (e.g., bead beating, Dounce homogenization). In the
<italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo work data presented in this study, single-embryo screening
required the use of a high-efficiency, lossless lysis protocol that could not rely on disruption
with physical means due to the limited sample quantity and the inefficiency of these methods. In our
hands, effective and reproducible lysis could only be obtained with a combination of detergents and
organic solvents. This reagent combination renders the lysate incompatible with numerous processing
protocols, including the recently published, state-of-the-art iST approach (Kulak
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>The extension of this harsh treatment method to an ultrasensitive application further highlights
the robustness of SP3. Due to the losses associated with the removal of contaminants (e.g.,
detergents used to aid in unbiased and complete protein solubilization), they are typically excluded
in ultrasensitive processing methods. Although acid-labile detergents and amphipols (Ning
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) offer an attractive
alternative to conventional detergents, they nevertheless require removal with acid precipitation or
phase transfer prior to MS analysis. These extra processing steps increase the potential for protein
and peptide loss and limit the sensitivity of low-quantity samples. The ability of SP3 to scale from
pools of 60 to single embryos without method adaptation renders it unique in this aspect among
proteomics protocols and facilitated acquisition of an entirely novel dataset targeting
<italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis.</p><p>In addition to challenges concerning protein extraction and processing, SP3 provided essential
enhancements for quantitative handling of proteins and peptides. As efficient extraction from a
single embryo yields only an estimated 200&#x000a0;ng of protein, scalable and lossless processing is
vital. The reproducibility of these extraction and processing steps is paramount for minimizing
technical noise that can dominate inter-sample signal when working with limited quantities of
material. SP3 exhibited high performance in all of these critical areas, demonstrated by in-depth
profiling of HeLa samples originating from as few as 1,000 cells, and unmatched depth of coverage in
pooled and single embryos. Impressively, the results in the HeLa analyses were obtained from samples
starting from the indicated low cell numbers, which is in contrast with the common practice of
examining a diluted sample of material obtained from a larger pooled lysate derived from millions of
cells (Altelaar &#x00026; Heck, <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Preparation of samples
in this manner can mask variability and losses introduced during lysis and early handling steps. By
working directly with minute cell numbers, the results presented here are directly extendable to
true experimental situations where 1,000 cells may be the entire available quantity. Adaptation of
SP3 to microfluidic platforms where losses to plastic ware are eliminated can potentially decrease
this workable cell number further.</p><p>With the ever-increasing demand for methods compatible with the analysis of large sample cohorts
in tissue libraries, or populations of genetically distinct individuals, coupling the flexibility
and sensitivity of SP3 to high-throughput situations would be of significant advantage. Although

(Kulak <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) methods are
theoretically scalable to 96-well format, these protocols can require specialized equipment (iST)
and lengthy processing (FASP) or perform poorly with small quantities of sample (FASP, SDS-Gels).
The <italic>Drosophila</italic> single-embryo data presented in this study directly benefitted from
an SP3 method that combined flexibility, sensitivity, and throughput. In addition to the rapid
completion of SP3 (15&#x000a0;min for protein or peptide enrichment), single embryos were processed
in parallel in a 96-well format. This facilitated processing a large number of individual embryos
for analysis, affording an increase in statistical power. Importantly, this high-throughput
processing did not result in reduced reproducibility, even when handling limited sample quantities
(single embryos, mESCs, NP cells) and coupled to a chemical isotope labeling protocol (reductive
dimethylation). This minimization of variance promoted examination of true biological divergence
between the developmental stages examined.</p><p>Exploiting these advantages, we examined proteome dynamics during <italic>Drosophila</italic>
embryogenesis. Using just 60 embryos of starting material, we annotated &#x0003e;&#x000a0;60%
of gene products that are potentially expressed at any given stage of development. This represents
the greatest depth of profiling of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteome during development and
is a significant step toward proteome annotation in this fundamental model organism. Importantly,
this depth of coverage was achieved using a significantly reduced number of embryos, eliminating the
need to harvest hundreds to perform in-depth proteome profiling. This sensitivity afforded
completion of an entirely novel screen of proteome dynamics in single embryos. By completing
differential proteome analysis at this resolution, we have developed a new paradigm with which
<italic>Drosophila</italic> screens can be completed. Despite the low sample input, the SP3 approach
successfully met or exceeded proteome coverage of previous works without sacrificing quantitative
accuracy or resolution between individuals. The ability to probe the proteome to a significant depth
from small pools or individual embryos opens new avenues for proteomics research in
<italic>Drosophila</italic>, where sampling limitations have previously placed restrictions on
proteome examination with MS.</p><p>In addition to the identifications, the quantitative stage-specific data revealed significant
diversity in protein abundance between embryos collected in 2- to 4- and 10- to 12-h (AEL)
collection windows. Due to the early developmental stage, we identify proteins with increased
abundance in the 2- to 4-h windows that are involved in the formation and maintenance of the
embryos, such as <italic>yl</italic> (Schonbaum <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) and <italic>ptx</italic> (Tootle <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and in the progression of early embryo development, such as
<italic>polo</italic>. <italic>Polo</italic> is a multifunction kinase whose activity is required
during mitosis, and thus, its expression is highest in regions where cells are proliferating.
Mutants of <italic>polo</italic> have been identified through maternal effect screens and illustrate
the necessity for its partial activity prior to and after the transition to zygotic expression
(Glover, <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). We also capture the maternally deposited,
actin-binding protein Homer. Expression of <italic>homer</italic> has been described to have a
redundant function to <italic>bifocal</italic> in maintaining posterior localization of
<italic>osk</italic> gene products, a critical process for embryonic patterning in the early embryo
(Babu <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Another posterior
localized protein, Vasa, was also identified as enriched in the 2- to 4-h stage. In the early
embryo, expression of <italic>vas</italic> has been linked to the formation of the posterior germ
plasm that will eventually lead to the formation of germ cells (Mahowald, <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). The enrichment of proteins with characterized roles in early development
highlights the ability of the SP3 method to reveal protein dynamics at a single-embryo
resolution.</p><p>From embryos in the 10- to 12-h stage, we observed increased abundance for proteins associated
with a wide array of cellular processes. In this candidate list, we identify prominent regulatory
proteins, such as Putzig, that plays a role in regulating the expression of Notch, an important
factor for controlling proliferation during development (Kugler &#x00026; Nagel, <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the Ref-1 (Aly) proteins
also identified here have similarly been implicated in Notch signaling during embryo patterning
(Neves &#x00026; Priess, <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). We also observed enrichment of
the protein product of the <italic>glo</italic> gene that has been shown to regulate
<italic>nanos</italic> expression, an essential factor in early development during embryo patterning
(Kalifa <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Although the
RNA expression profiles of patterning factors like <italic>glo</italic> extend across multiple
developmental stages, the differences in their protein levels suggest potential post-transcriptional
regulation. Future investigation into post-translational patterns of modifications can potentially
aid in determining the relation between the transcriptional and translational status of these
proteins.</p><p>In addition to proteins regulating transcription and translation, a substantial fraction of the
proteins enriched in 10- to 12-h collections were associated with pathways related to neural
development. Specifically, we identified many proteins with roles in axon targeting and development
of the central nervous system (CNS) (<italic>Fas2, Ama, hts, Nrg, Nrt, pod-1, fax, lamins</italic>).
Interestingly, the products of <italic>Fas2, Nrt, Ama,</italic> and <italic>Nrg</italic> all
function as cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs) on the surface of axons. <italic>Nrt</italic> and
<italic>Ama</italic> have been described to function together in a junction complex to regulate axon
guidance (Zeev-Ben-Mordehai <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b67" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). <italic>Ama</italic> and <italic>fax</italic> have also been described as dominant
enhancers that augment the mutant phenotype of Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl), promoting disruption
of the central nervous system (Hill <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Liebl, <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). <italic>Fas2</italic> and
<italic>Nrg</italic> have both been implicated in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) signaling, the expression of which is essential for cell differentiation and development
(Islam, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Mao &#x00026; Freeman, <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The products of the <italic>hts</italic> and <italic>pod-1</italic> genes
have both been described to play a role in axon guidance, operating through cytoskeletal or
trans-membrane associations (Rothenberg <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Ohler <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Lastly, the Jupiter protein also has a potential role in these developmental
processes, suggested by its high, localized expression in axons (Karpova
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Development of the
neural system begins at &#x0223c;4.5&#x000a0;h with the migration of neural precursor cells to the
interior of the embryo (Scott &#x00026; O'Farrell, <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). Correspondingly, the majority of these candidate genes exhibit high gene expression
during this transition (Graveley <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), consistent with the trends in protein abundance observed here.</p><p>In addition to cellular regulation, these data could be associated with the patterns of protein
expression related to developmental processes. Shifts in candidate expression associated with the
MZT based on transcript (Arbeitman <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) or protein (Gouw <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) data were easily distinguishable at the single-embryo level between stages.
Interestingly, this diversity could also be observed between individuals collected within a single
stage (2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;h) for genes such as <italic>bnb, Nrt, yl,</italic> and
<italic>Nplp2</italic>. In addition, we also observed differential abundance in proteins such as
Kugelkern, which is known to be present throughout early embryogenesis, switching from a maternally
deposited isoform to a zygotic form thereafter (Guilgur <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Therefore, even in this small developmental window,
biologically valid abundance diversity relating to cellular shifts can be captured.</p><p>Aside from those involved in the MZT, the majority of the candidate proteins identified in the
inter-individual screens exhibit high expression in the early embryo in RNAseq experiments (Graveley
<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Although the biological
functions of many of the detected candidates are as yet uncharacterized, a variety of proteins
implicated in cellular developmental processes, such as neurogenesis, are identified. In combination
with histones themselves, we observed differential expression of the histone splicing and uptake
regulatory protein, Slbp. Slbp is known to regulate the progression through S-phase in the cell
cycle, and the increasing expression profile observed here fits with the requirement for Slbp in
early development (Lanzotti &#x00026; Kupsco, <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). We also
observed dynamic abundance in the essential transcriptional regulatory protein Bap60. The
<italic>Bap60</italic> gene is expressed from both maternal and zygotic expression transcripts and
increases throughout development (M&#x000f6;ller <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>, <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), corresponding with the protein abundance profiles observed here. Together,
these data highlight the quantitative resolution of single-embryo analyses with SP3, as well as
demonstrating the potential for new applications in screening of closely related individuals, such
as isogenic libraries where expression differences are expected to be small.</p><p>The findings of this work have important implications toward advancing the development of
proteomics as a supplementary tool for understanding complex biological systems, in particular for
integrative studies combining proteome data with that from multiple streams, such as genomics,
transcriptomics, and metabolomics. Of particular note is the increased sensitivity provided by SP3
that reduces the absolute sample requirements for proteomics, permitting splitting of material to
acquire sample-matched data. As MS instrumentation continues to advance and gains in sensitivity are
made, we expect that integration of SP3 with these cutting-edge platforms will push proteomics
toward achieving complete proteome profiling from ultrasensitive samples. In the future, we envision
extension of these analyses to screening of individuals within genetic libraries, clinical fluid or
tissue samples (before or after paraffin embedding), or previously inaccessible ultrasensitive
applications. These extensions will be further aided by the cost efficiency of SP3
(&#x0003c;&#x000a0;1 cent per assay based on consumable cost), extending its global reach in research
studies. The compatibility and ease of adaption of SP3 protocols to robotics or microfluidic
platforms will decrease these costs further, while increasing throughput and automation. This
collection of benefits positions SP3 as an incredibly robust single-tube proteomics method
integrating all steps from cell lysis to peptide fractionation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Paramagnetic beads</title><p>In all experiments with SP3, we utilize commercially available beads that carry a carboxylate

collected during 2-h windows and aged at 25&#x000b0;C to the appropriate stage [2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;h,

bleach) for 2&#x000a0;min, washed with PBT (PBS with 0.1% Triton), and air-dried at room

Single embryos in PCR tubes were re-suspended in 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of lysis buffer containing

cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail-EDTA (Roche), 5&#x000a0;mM EDTA, 5&#x000a0;mM EGTA, 10&#x000a0;mM

in a Bioruptor (Diagenode) for 10 cycles (30&#x000a0;s on, 30&#x000a0;s off) on the setting
&#x02018;high&#x02019;. The Bioruptor was operated in the absence of active cooling to allow the water
bath to heat and facilitate lysis and shearing of chromatin. To neutralize the lysis solution,
0.75&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of 0.1% formic acid was added. Samples were then heated at 95&#x000b0;C

concentration of 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l. Unless otherwise noted, all reactions are carried

capacity of 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of beads per 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of protein determined above, it is
beneficial to retain the absolute bead concentration at values
&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l in solution to promote bead aggregation as the

placed on a magnetic rack for a further 2&#x000a0;min. While on the magnet, the supernatant was
removed and discarded. The beads were rinsed through addition of 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of 70%
absolute ethanol, incubated for 30&#x000a0;s, and the supernatant discarded. This step was repeated
one further time. Beads were then rinsed one further time with 180&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of 100%
acetonitrile, incubated for 30&#x000a0;s, and the supernatant discarded. All rinses were carried out
while tubes were mounted on the magnetic rack. Rinsed beads were then reconstituted in aqueous

5&#x000a0;min at room temperature to elute proteins. The composition of the elution buffer can be

bead&#x02013;peptide solutions were pipette mixed to re-suspend the beads that had settled during the

To each tube, 100% acetonitrile was added to achieve a final concentration
&#x0003e;&#x000a0;95% (e.g., 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of bead-protein mixture +

was discarded, and the beads rinsed one time with 180&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of 100% acetonitrile.
Rinsed beads were reconstituted in an aqueous solution (typically H<sub>2</sub>O) containing
2% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The volume used for elution can be catered for the downstream
