However, the rules governing its establishment and maintenance remain elusive. Here, we present data demonstrating that active transcription regulates levels of genomic methylation. We identified a novel RNA arising from the <italic>CEBPA</italic> gene locus critical in regulating the local DNA methylation profile. This RNA binds to DNMT1 and prevents <italic>CEBPA</italic> gene locus methylation. Deep sequencing of transcripts associated with DNMT1 combined with genome-scale methylation and expression profiling extended the generality of this finding to numerous gene loci. Collectively, these results delineate the nature of DNMT1-RNA interactions and suggest strategies for gene selective demethylation of therapeutic targets in disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">DNA methylation is a key epigenetic signature implicated in transcriptional regulation, genomic imprinting, and silencing of repetitive DNA elements<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and it occurs predominantly within CpG dinucleotides. CpG dinucleotides are underrepresented in the mammalian genome (~1%) and tend to cluster within CpG islands located in the vicinity of the transcription start sites (TSSs) of the majority (~70%) of human protein-coding genes<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. While the bulk of genome is methylated at 70&#x02013;80% of its CpGs, CpG islands are mostly unmethylated in somatic cells<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. This modification is mediated by the members of the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) family conventionally classified as <italic>de novo</italic> (DNMT3a-b) and <italic>maintenance</italic> (DNMT1). In terms of epigenetic inheritance, DNMT1 has the unique ability to identify the hemimethylated portion of newly replicated DNA. This feature may explain how DNMT1-mediated methylation could be an epigenetic mechanism maintaining the <italic>status quo</italic>. However, it certainly does not explain how DNA methylation is altered, particularly in disease states.</p><p id="P4">To examine how transcription may regulate the levels of genomic methylation, we investigated methylation dynamics of the well-studied methylation-sensitive gene <italic>CEBPA</italic><sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, including the potential involvement of noncoding (nc) RNAs originating within <italic>CEBPA</italic> locus. Recent discoveries of functional ncRNAs have provided new regulatory clues to the control of epigenetic marks. Particularly, long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to regulate gene expression by interacting with chromatin modifiers, modulating transcription factor activity and competing for miRNA binding<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. One unexplored aspect of regulation of gene locus DNA methylation was the possible involvement of transcripts encoded within the region.</p><p id="P5">We identified a functional RNA arising from the <italic>CEBPA</italic> locus (<italic>ecCEBPA</italic>) that regulates <italic>CEBPA</italic> methylation. This RNA interacts with DNMT1, resulting in prevention of <italic>CEBPA</italic> gene methylation and robust <italic>CEBPA</italic> mRNA production. We show that such functional DNMT1-RNA association occurs in numerous gene loci. We thus propose a novel regulatory mechanism of gene methylation governed by RNAs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Characterization of <italic>ecCEBPA</italic></title><p id="P6">Noncoding transcripts arising from the promoter and the downstream regions of coding genes can affect expression of the corresponding genes<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. We searched and identified transcripts upstream and downstream of the intronless <italic>CEBPA</italic> gene. Strand specific RT-PCR (data not shown) and Northern blot analysis of RNAs from four leukemic cell lines, probing the region immediately after the <italic>CEBPA</italic> polyadenylation site, revealed the presence of a major band of ~4.5 kb in HL-60 and U937 (where <italic>CEPBA</italic> is expressed), but not in K562 or Jurkat cell lines (where <italic>CEBPA</italic> is expressed at low or undetectable levels) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). The identified transcript is distinct from the ~2.6 kb signal, detected with a <italic>CEBPA</italic> coding region probe, and correlates with <italic>CEBPA</italic> mRNA expression. Unlike polyadenylated <italic>CEBPA</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), this non-polyadenylated transcript is enriched in the nuclear fraction (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a, b</xref>) suggesting functional roles independent of protein coding potential.</p><p id="P7">We termed this nuclear non-polyadenylated <italic>CEBPA</italic> ncRNA <italic>&#x0201c;extra-coding (ec) CEBPA&#x0201d;,</italic> since it does encompass the entire mRNA sequence in the same-sense orientation (shown by primer extension and 5&#x02032;3&#x02032;RACE; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information (SI)</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1c, d</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis confirmed concordant expression between extra-coding and coding transcripts, in both cellular and nuclear RNAs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, e</xref>). Similar correlation was observed in all tested human tissues (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). Importantly, <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> synthesis precedes the expression of its overlapping mRNA in the S phase (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">SI and Supplementary Fig. 1f, g</xref>) and is regulated by both RNA polymerase II and III (RNAP II and III; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">SI and Supplementary Fig. h&#x02013;p</xref>) as described for other loci<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>ecCEBPA</italic> inhibits DNA methylation and facilitates <italic>CEBPA</italic> expression</title><p id="P8">To examine the functional role of <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> in regulation of <italic>CEBPA</italic> transcription, we performed both loss and gain-of-function experiments. Knock-down of <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> in U937 cell line (up to a 4-fold decrease) achieved by small hairpin (sh) RNAs targeting <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> (but not <italic>CEBPA</italic> mRNA) led to a decrease of <italic>CEBPA</italic> mRNA expression of similar magnitude (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>), suggesting that <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> may regulate <italic>CEBPA</italic> expression. Silencing of the <italic>CEBPA</italic> gene can be associated with DNA methylation of the promoter<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. To examine if there was a connection between <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> and methylation of the <italic>CEBPA</italic> locus, we analyzed methylation within the distal promoter (located at &#x02212;0.8&#x02013;0.6 kb from the <italic>CEBPA</italic> TSS; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> knockdown led to a significant increase in DNA methylation compared to the non-targeting control (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To investigate whether enforced expression of the <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> was sufficient to inhibit DNA methylation, the downstream region of the <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> (R1; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) was overexpressed in K562 cells expressing <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> and <italic>CEBPA</italic> mRNA at low to undetectable levels (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b, d</xref>). Overexpression of only part of the <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> was dictated by the necessity to distinguish the methylation pattern of the endogenous <italic>CEBPA</italic> locus from that of the ectopically expressed construct.</p><p id="P10">Ectopic expression of the <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> (R1) resulted in greater than 3-fold increase in mRNA expression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>) whereas overexpression of an unrelated region (UR; located 45 kb downstream) and regions immediately outside the <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> boundaries did not affect mRNA levels (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b&#x02013;d</xref>). Moreover, concomitant decrease of DNA methylation in three tested regions within the <italic>CEBPA</italic> gene, distal promoter, coding region, and 3&#x02032;UTR, accompanied overexpression of <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> but not of the UR (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2e, f</xref>). Interestingly, comparative analysis of DNA methylation changes imposed by <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> overexpression versus the hypomethylating agent 5&#x02032;-Azacytidine (5-Aza-CR), together with genome-scale analysis (reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, RRBS<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>) of DNA methylation changes imposed by <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> versus UR overexpression, revealed that <italic>ecCEBPA</italic>-mediated demethylation was relatively selective to the <italic>CEBPA</italic> locus (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2g&#x02013;l</xref>). Indeed, increased mRNA expression and changes in methylation status within the loci of the neighboring <italic>CEBPG</italic> and distant <italic>TP73</italic> (on chr1p36) genes were achieved after 5-Aza-CR treatment but not after <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> overexpression (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2g&#x02013;k</xref>). Furthermore, RRBS analysis of promoter and 1<sup>st</sup> exon regions revealed that only ~3.3% of the interrogated loci (396 out of 11844) were hypomethylated at levels similar to the <italic>CEBPA</italic> locus (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2l</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Furthermore, <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> downregulation by the universal RNAPs inhibitor Actynomicin D and RNAPIII-specific inhibitor ML-60218 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2m</xref>) led to a corresponding increase in methylation of the <italic>CEBPA</italic> locus, in synchronized and unsynchronized U937cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f, g</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2n</xref>). Despite comparable decreases in <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> levels in both synchronized and unsynchronized cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>), DNA methylation increase was more prominent in synchronized cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>), suggesting a cell cycle-specific action of the <italic>ecCEBPA</italic>. Similar effect was observed in ML-60218-treated HL-60 cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1i</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2o</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Consistently, we observed an inverse correlation between the <italic>CEBPA</italic> gene locus methylation and the levels of ec<italic>CEBPA</italic> in HL-60, U937 and K562 cell lines (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2p</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Collectively, these data highlight the regulatory role of the <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> in <italic>CEBPA</italic> gene locus methylation, most prominently during the S phase.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>DNMT1 binds to RNA with greater affinity than to DNA</title><p id="P14">The changes in <italic>CEBPA</italic> methylation mediated by <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> prompted us to try to unveil the mechanism through which it is achieved. Among DNMTs, DNMT1 is the one whose expression and enzymatic activity peaks during S phase<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Increased <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> expression occurs during the S phase (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1g</xref>), whereas inhibition of <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> during S phase results in a substantial increase of <italic>CEBPA</italic> locus DNA methylation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f, g</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2n</xref>). We therefore asked whether the presence of <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> during S phase led to RNA interference of DNMT1 activity.</p><p id="P15">To determine if DNMT1 physically associates with <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> we performed RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) with specific anti-DNMT1 antibody (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>).

RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; parts of the <italic>ecCEBPA</italic> were selected by: (i) ability (R2, R5 and R6) and inability (R4) to fold into stem-loop structures<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>; (ii) presence (R2, R5 and R6) or absence (R4) of CpG dinucleotides (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). RNA-DNMT1 complex formation was observed with all RNA oligonucleotides able to fold into stem-loop structures (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c&#x02013;e</xref>). Unlike DNA<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, CpG UpG substitutions, neutral with regard of secondary structures, did not affect binding (mutR2; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). In contrast, mutations abrogating RNA folding ability affected RNA-DNMT1 binding (mut R5; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>).

Illumina paired-end adaptor and PCR primers were used to replace the single read adaptor and primers in the kit.

A linear regression was fitted across all non-zero bins and the slope of the regression was used as a scaling factor (alpha) to normalize the RIP and control libraries. To identify distinct regions specifically bound by DNMT1, all downstream analyses were conducted on a set of regions derived by aggregating overlapping DNMT1 RIP reads into contiguous intervals. Each DNMT1 interval was tested for significance by comparing the number of reads within the interval the number of reads in the same region of the IgG control, multiplied by the previously estimated scaling factor, alpha (exact binomial test, P=0.5).
