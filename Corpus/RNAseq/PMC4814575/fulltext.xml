The dismal condition of the tumour vasculature is attributed to the hypoxic tumour micro-environment and the accompanying inflammation resulting in the production of a broad range of growth modulatory factors including vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), in particular VEGFA (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). VEGFA causes increased vascular leakage by disruption of adherens junctions created through homophilic interactions between vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin molecules expressed on adjacent endothelial cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Vessel normalization by titrating an appropriate level of anti-VEGFA therapy improves the efficacy of irradiation and chemotherapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, sustained anti-VEGFA therapy deteriorates vessel function and may cause increased hypoxia, increased local tumour cell invasion and increased metastatic propensity (for a review, see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The role of VEGFA-induced permeability compared with VEGFA-regulated migration, survival and proliferation of endothelial cells is unknown. Moreover, the signal transduction pathways induced by VEGFA to promote increased vascular permeability have remained unidentified.</p><p>VEGFA exerts its effects via two endothelial cell receptor tyrosine kinases denoted VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). VEGFR1 binds and neutralizes VEGFA, thereby exerting a negative regulatory effect on endothelial cells, while VEGFR2 is essential in all known VEGFA biology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. VEGFR2 becomes activated and phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to VEGFA: Y949, Y1052, Y1057, Y1173 and Y1212 (mouse sequence numbers)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The Y949 phosphosite in VEGFR2 (Y951 in human VEGFR2) presents a specific binding site for the T cell-specific adaptor (TSAd). TSAd is implicated in VEGFA-induced permeability, by regulating VEGFR2-dependent c-Src signalling at endothelial cell junctions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The Y1052/1057 residues, located on the tyrosine kinase activation loop, are required for full kinase activity (see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and references therein). The phosphorylated Y1173 binds phospholipase C&#x003b3;, of importance for endothelial ERK1/2 pathway activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. A phenylalanine knock-in mouse <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y1173F/Y1173F</italic></sup> is embryonically lethal due to arrested endothelial cell development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y1212F/Y1212F</italic></sup> mouse lacks a developmental phenotype on a mixed background<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p><p>The aim of the current study was to examine the consequence of specific suppression of VEGFA-induced permeability on cancer progression. VEGFA-induced molecular extravasation was attenuated in the <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F/Y949F</italic></sup> mouse due to perturbed signalling through the TSAd/c-Src/VE-cadherin pathway resulting in VEGFA-resistant adherens junctions. The Y949F mutation however did not perturb other aspects of VEGFA-regulated vessel biology. The loss of VEGFA-regulated leakage was compatible with vascular development and a morphologically normal vasculature including the presence of fenestrated endothelium in adult organs. Blood flow and blood pressure changes in response to VEGFA were unaffected by the mutation. In cancer, the loss of VEGFA-regulated leakage was manifested as reduced tumour oedema, improved responsiveness to chemotherapy and suppressed metastatic spread due to an arrest in tumour cell intravasation.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>Vegfr2</italic>

To determine the consequence of <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F/Y949F</italic></sup> mutation on VEGFA-induced vascular leakage <italic>in vivo</italic>, we employed two well-established assays, microsphere extravasation in the tracheal vasculature and Miles extravasation assay in the dermis. To induce microsphere extravasation, VEGFA or vehicle was administered by tail vein injection together with fluorescent 30-nm microspheres. VEGFA-induced extravasation of microspheres, lodged beneath the basement membrane in postcapillary venules, was significantly reduced at 60&#x02009;min of circulation in the <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F/Y949F</italic></sup> trachea compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>).

There was also no apparent effect of the mutation on the development and organization of lymphatics (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref> for tracheal lymphatics). The postnatal retinal vasculature develops in a strictly regulated, VEGFA-dependent manner to establish the junctional barrier<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. There was no difference in retinal vascular development between WT and <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F/Y949F</italic></sup> mice as judged by the overall morphology of the vascular network, the abundance of endothelial tip cells and filopodia, and the total vascular area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a&#x02013;d</xref>). Thus, development of the retinal vasculature does not depend on VEGFR2-Y949 signalling. However, the morphology of the VE-cadherin immunostaining differed between the two genotypes. The VE-cadherin pattern at individual junctions was evaluated using established image analysis software<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, classifying junctions in a graded scale from &#x02018;active'&#x02014;that is, being irregular/serrated with vesicular/diffuse appearance&#x02014;to &#x02018;inactive' ones, presenting a straighter and less vesicular morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f,g</xref> for quantification and schematic outline). By this criterion, the WT retinal vasculature displayed a significantly higher prevalence of active adherens junctions compared with the <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F/Y949F</italic></sup> retinal vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>; active junction patches was 58.9&#x00025; (WT) versus 48.1&#x00025; (<italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F/Y949F</italic></sup>); <italic>P</italic>=0.0367, calculated using median&#x00025; in one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test.</p><p>Still, the enhanced barrier morphology in the VEGFR2-Y949F mutant did not interfere with overall vascular morphology or physiology. The adult vascular ultramorphology of the kidney glomeruli and peritubular capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2h</xref>) and the pancreas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>) was normal in the <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F</italic>/Y949F</sup> mouse. Moreover, expression of plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein-1 (PV1), which is required for the formation of diaphragms covering endothelial fenestrae in vessels of endocrine organs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> was not affected by the VEGFR2-Y949F mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2i</xref>).</p><p>To exclude the possibility that vascular leakage arrest in the <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F</italic>/Y949F</sup> mouse was influenced by blood pressure/flow parameters, a series of <italic>in vivo</italic> tests were performed. The resting blood pressure in the descending aorta was monitored continuously while infusing VEGFA or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by tail vein injection. VEGFA, but not PBS, caused a significant drop in blood pressure as an indication of vessel dilation, in both WT and <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F</italic>/Y949F</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2j</xref>). Moreover, blood parameters including arterial gases, oxygen saturation, serum Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> levels, as well as the haematocrit/haemoglobin levels were similar in the WT and Y949F conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).

Pericyte morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2k,l</xref>) and basement membrane coating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2m,n</xref>) were similar between the genotypes.

In the WT, the levels of pY658 VE-cadherin were already high in the PBS-injected mice in agreement with previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, and remained high initially after injection of VEGFA, followed by a gradual decrease possibly due to the action of phosphatases, or to internalization and degradation of VE-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). In the <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F</italic>/Y949F</sup>-derived samples, the pVE-cadherin level was low in the PBS condition and there was no induction with VEGFA injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>).</p><p>Tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src was difficult to detect in the VEGFR2 immunoprecipitates from lung lysate and was therefore examined in total lung lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>).

At D18, the pVEGFR2/VEGFR2 ratios were similar between the genotypes. The results on the pVEGFR2/VEGFR2 levels are likely to reflect the status in the tumour vasculature, as B16F10 cells do not express VEGFR2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).

Moreover, the data indicate that VEGFA signalling is dynamically regulated by VEPTP in solid tumours.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we show that a specific arrest in VEGFA-induced vascular permeability leading to attenuation of molecular extravasation in organs such as the trachea and skin is compatible with normal vascular development, morphology and function. The <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F/Y949F</italic></sup> mouse displayed reduced vascular leakage in several orthotopic tumour models and a significant reduction in metastatic spread of insulinoma and melanoma (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref> for a schematic summary of the results). The enhanced vascular barrier in the <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F/Y949F</italic></sup> mouse led to reduced tumour oedema, allowing for increased chemotherapeutic efficacy. While our data strongly indicate that signalling via pY949-VEGFR2 regulates c-Src activation and VE-cadherin phosphorylation and therefore adherens junction integrity, we do not rule out the involvement of transendothelial pores/vesiculovacuolar organelles in VEGFA-induced vascular permeability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p><p>Induced vascular permeability, also denoted vascular hyperpermeability or vascular leakage, may be acute or chronic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The best studied factors regulating vascular leakage include VEGFA and inflammatory cytokines such as histamine and bradykinin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. An implication from the current study is that VEGFA dominates over inflammatory cytokines in regulating molecular extravasation, in the models studied here. VEGFA was originally identified as a vascular permeability factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, but the physiological role of vascular permeability regulated by VEGFA/VPF has remained unclear. Dvorak and colleagues implicated vascular permeability in the formation of a provisional matrix for the growth of new vessels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Our data do not support an essential role for the VEGFA-driven pathway regulated by VEGFR2 pY949 signalling, in angiogenesis.</p><p>Cheresh and coworkers have shown the critical role for c-Src-pathways in regulation of VEGFA-induced vascular permeability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Our work extends these data by implicating pY949-VEGFR2/TSAd in regulation of c-Src pY418, VE-cadherin pY658 and the stability of adherens junctions. VE-cadherin is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in postcapillary venules compared with arteries/arterioles and regulated through flow-induced activation of c-Src, as judged from immunofluorescent staining of different capillary beds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In this study, we noted a marked reduction in VE-cadherin Y658 phosphorylation in the <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F</italic>/Y949F</sup> lung lysates compared with WT, in agreement with the altered c-Src phosphorylation profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>) and with the persistence of adherens junctions in response to VEGFA, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g&#x02013;j</xref>). However, the complex biology of c-Src precludes a direct cause&#x02013;effect relationship between c-Src pY418 phosphorylation and VE-cadherin/adherens junction stability. We have previously shown that pY418 Src accumulates with relatively slow kinetics <italic>in vivo</italic> and that it translocates to junctions in complex with the adaptor molecule TSAd<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. It is possible that the dynamics of c-Src activation differs between different subcellular compartments such as junctions and focal adhesions. Thus, at focal adhesions, c-Src activity is induced as a consequence of cell adhesion-dependent focal adhesion kinase activation, which also affects vascular permeability most likely by orchestrating cell shape<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. In agreement with the data presented here, focal adhesion kinase (<italic>Ptk2</italic>) gene knockout decreases tumour spread<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Owing to technical constraints imposed by the quality of commercial c-Src antibodies, we have not been able to distinguish different subcellular pY418 Src pools <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, accumulation of pY418 Src in relation to the total c-Src pool was decreased both in <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F</italic>/Y949F</sup> lung endothelial cells and in B16F10 tumours growing in mutant mice.</p><p>VEGFA-induced accumulation of pT308 Akt was similar in the WT and mutant Y949F VEGFR2 conditions. Akt plays an important role in vascular permeability induced by inflammatory cytokines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Akt is critical for the activation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) <italic>in vivo</italic>, by phosphorylation on Ser1176 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), resulting in increased NO production. NO, a potent regulator of the vascular tone, mediates vasodilation by stimulating soluble guanylyl cyclase and increasing cyclic GMP in smooth muscle cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. In this study, we recorded transiently reduced blood pressure indicative of vasodilation in response to VEGFA in the descending aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2j</xref>) in both WT and <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F/Y949F</italic></sup> mice. This result together with the full activation of Akt, judged from the pattern of pT308 Akt accumulation in the mutant, indicate that the NO pathway is intact in the <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F/Y949F</italic></sup> mouse. eNOS has previously been implicated in tumour vascular permeability, and inhibition of eNOS activity by a small caveolin-derived peptide (cavtratin) leads to suppressed tumour vascular permeability and reduced primary tumour growth without affecting blood flow and angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. In contrast, while metastatic spread was suppressed in the <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F/Y949F</italic></sup> mouse, primary tumour growth was only modestly affected.</p><p>We noted reduced phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at phosphosite Y1173 in the <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F/Y949F</italic></sup> lungs and in D12 B16F10 melanoma. Mutation of the human tyrosine residue, Y951 (corresponding to mouse Y949), in a purified recombinant intracellular VEGFR2 domain interferes with protein folding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Whether protein folding is affected also in the full-length VEGFR2 remains to be shown. We noted that the level of phosphorylation of the full-length mouse VEGFR2-Y949F mutant relative to WT VEGFR2 varied during tumour progression. Thus, in B16F10 tumours, the relative level of pY1173 in WT VEGFR2 was higher than for VEGFR2-Y949F at an early stage, whereas the levels were similar at later stages of tumour growth. We propose that the reduced VEGFR2 phosphorylation in the <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F/Y949F</italic></sup> lungs in D12 B16F10 tumours at least in part was a consequence of sustained VEGFR2/VEPTP complex formation. VEPTP is a receptor-type phosphotyrosine phosphatase specifically expressed in endothelial cells and known to have VE-cadherin and Tie2 as direct substrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. VEGFR2 is an indirect substrate for VEPTP, resulting in dephosphorylation of VEGFR2 in complex with Tie2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Here we confirm and extend the data on the important role of VEPTP as an <italic>in vivo</italic> regulator of VEGFR2 activity. VEGFR2/VEPTP complex formation correlated with VEGFR2 pY1173 levels and the extent of oedema. Thus, B16F10 melanomas in WT mice showed low VEGFR2/VEPTP complex formation, high p1173 VEGFR2 levels and prominent oedema. In contrast, melanomas in the <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F/Y949F</italic></sup> mice displayed high VEGFR2/VEPTP complex formation, low p1173 pVEGFR2 levels and reduced oedema. With time, VEPTP/VEGFR2 complex formation decreased in tumours from both WT and <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F/Y949F</italic></sup> mice. Still, the VEGFR2 and c-Src activities were suppressed in the late stage of tumour growth in WT mice, showing a restriction in VEGFA signalling independent of VEPTP. The gradual progression towards lower VEGFR2 phosphotyrosine levels over time is in agreement with models for resistance towards anti-VEGFA neutralizing therapy in cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.</p><p>The extent of tumour oedema correlates to the blood supply, the volume of blood entering the tumour and the lymphatic drainage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>.

Tumours in <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F</italic>/Y949F</sup> mice were less oedematous, which we attribute to the higher vessel integrity in the mutant.

In agreement, the B16F10 tumour-bearing <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F/Y949F</italic></sup> mice were more responsive to treatment with chemotherapy. Complete sealing of junctions to VEGFA, as well as to inflammatory cytokines, as a result of expression of a VE-cadherin/&#x003b1;-catenin fusion protein, leads to a partial reduction in inflammatory cell extravasation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. In contrast, restricting VEGFA-induced permeability alone as in the <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F/Y949F</italic></sup> genotype, failed to suppress inflammatory cell infiltration in RIP1-TAg2 insulinomas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c&#x02013;e</xref>) and B16F10 melanomas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3h&#x02013;j</xref>). While we do not exclude that acute inflammation or other aspects of inflammation not studied here are affected by the VEGFR2 mutation, our data suggest that there is no direct relationship between the capacity to spread metastasis and primary tumour inflammation. Moreover, lodging of circulating tumour cells was unaffected by the mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>) suggesting that the stable <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F</italic>/Y949F</sup> junctions may restrict the ability of tumour cells to enter but not exit the circulation. The caveats of the experimental metastasis model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> (that is, injection of tumour cells in the tail vein followed by lodging of tumour cells in the lung) compared with spontaneous metastasis, limits conclusions however.</p><p>Possibly, factor(s) other than VEGFA may contribute to extravasation of B16F10 cells in the lung; indeed, the <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F</italic>/Y949F</sup> endothelium retains sensitivity to other permeability-inducing factors than VEGFA such as histamine. It is pertinent to ask whether the reduced metastatic spread in the <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F</italic>/Y949F</sup> tumours can be attributed directly to the VEGFA-resistant Y949F junctions, that is, do tumour cells intravasate into the circulation via junctions? Alternatively, were other parameters, established as a consequence of the nonleaky junctions and the reduced oedema, more important? As we did not record significant changes compatible with vascular normalization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, that is, in vascular density, pericyte coating, necrosis or inflammation in the B16F10 melanomas from WT and mutant mice, we propose that the <italic>Vegfr2</italic><sup><italic>Y949F</italic>/Y949F</sup> phenotype primarily depends on the VEGFA-resistant junctions.</p><p>In conclusion, our data suggest that specifically suppressing VEGFA-induced vascular permeability without attenuation of vital aspects of VEGFA biology, for example, endothelial survival and neoangiogenesis, may offer an attractive strategy in future drug development to reduce oedema, to improve therapeutic efficacy and to suppress metastatic spread in cancer.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>Vegfr2</italic>

In the WT, the junction is active, that is, VE-cadherin is not engaged in homophilic interaction, and VEGFA signalling results in c-Src activation at junctions. In the Y949F mutant, VEGFR2 remains in complex with VEPTP and VE-cadherin, promoting junctional quiescence. c-Src may be activated but not at junctions. Lower schematics shows that junctional activation in the WT results in extravasation of cells and molecules, causing tissue oedema as well as metastatic spread via tumour cell intravasation into the blood stream (cells indicated in green). In the Y949F mutant, extravasation and oedema are blocked and metastatic spread is suppressed, while inflammatory cell extravasation is unaffected.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ncomms11017-f7"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="t1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Haemodynamics in WT and <italic>Vegfr2</italic>
