Recently, it has been recognized that embryonic stem cells derived from both mice and humans display two stable yet epigenetically distinct states of pluripotency, na&#x000ef;ve and primed. We now show that nicotinamide-N-methyl transferase (NNMT) and metabolic state regulate pluripotency in hESCs. Specifically, in na&#x000ef;ve hESCs NNMT and its enzymatic product 1-methylnicotinamide (1-MNA) are highly upregulated, and NNMT is required for low SAM levels and H3K27me3 repressive state. NNMT consumes SAM in na&#x000ef;ve cells, making it unavailable for histone methylation that represses Wnt and activates HIF pathway in primed hESCs. These data support the hypothesis that the metabolome regulates the epigenetic landscape of the earliest steps in human development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P3">Pluripotent stem cells are able to self-renew and have the capacity to regenerate all tissues in the body. These cells hold promise for understanding early human development as well as developing therapies in regenerative medicine. Recent findings have revealed that pluripotency does not represent a single defined state; diverse states of pluripotency, with differences in measurable characteristics relating to gene expression, epigenetics and cellular phenotype, provide an experimental system for studying potential key regulators that constrain or expand the developmental capacity of pluripotent cells<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Two stable pluripotent states have been derived in the mouse, and now in humans; preimplantation na&#x000ef;ve and postimplantation primed ESC states<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> . Since na&#x000ef;ve, preimplantation human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) show higher developmental potential than postimplantation, primed hESCs<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, it is critical to understand the key molecular differences between these pluripotent cell types.</p><p id="P4">Metabolic signatures are highly characteristic for a cell and may act as a leading cause for cell fate changes<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Recent data have shown that pluripotent stem cells have a unique metabolic pattern. The na&#x000ef;ve to primed mouse ESC transition accompanies a dramatic metabolic switch from bivalent to highly glycolytic state<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. However, primed state of inert mitochondria rapidly changes to highly respiring mitochondria during further differentiation. It is not yet understood how and why the pluripotent cells enter the highly glycolytic, metabolically cancer-like (Warburg effect) state and how a differentiating cell leaves this state.</p><p id="P5">In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) threonine and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) metabolism are coupled resulting in regulation of histone methylation marks<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Methionine and SAM are also required for the self renewal of hESCs, since depletion of SAM leads to reduced H3K4me3 marks and defects in maintenance of the hESC state<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. SAM therefore is shown to be a key regulator for maintaining ESC undifferentiated state and regulating their differentiation. However, little is known about SAM levels or its regulation during the transition between na&#x000ef;ve and primed human embryonic states. Recent derivation of na&#x000ef;ve human ESCs allows a deeper analysis of the human na&#x000ef;ve to primed transition<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. These studies have already revealed that the epigenetic landscape changes from the na&#x000ef;ve to primed state through increased H3K27me3 repressive methylation marks. However, the regulation of this process or the metabolomics of this transition have not been dissected.</p><p id="P6">We now show that the upregulation of H3K27me3 repressive epigenetic marks during na&#x000ef;ve to primed hESC transition is controlled by the metabolic enzyme, NNMT. Knockdown of NNMT in na&#x000ef;ve hESCs increased H3K27me3 repressive marks in developmental as well as key metabolic genes that regulate the metabolic switch in na&#x000ef;ve to primed transition. CRISPR-Cas9 based NNMT KO na&#x000ef;ve hESC lines show upregulation of SAM, H3K27me3 marks, HIF activation, Wnt repression and a general gene expression shift towards primed stage. These data show that NNMT consumes SAM in na&#x000ef;ve cells, making it unavailable for histone methylation. Histone methylation further regulates the key signaling pathways important for the metabolic changes that are necessary for early human development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><p id="P7">A dramatic metabolic switch occurs in mouse ESCs between pre-implantation (na&#x000ef;ve) and post-implantation (primed) state<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Human na&#x000ef;ve counterpart has been recently toggled or derived from embryos. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the expression signatures of these new cell types confirmed that all derived human na&#x000ef;ve hESCs are in a significantly earlier stage than primed hESCs<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A&#x02013;B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl.Fig.1A&#x02013;C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.Table.1A</xref>). To assess the metabolic profiles of the human na&#x000ef;ve and primed hESCs, we analyzed the cells&#x02019; oxygen consumption rates (OCR) using a SeaHorse extracellular flux analyzer. As seen previously in mouse ESCs<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, we detected an increase in oxygen consumption rate after FCCP injection in the newly derived na&#x000ef;ve hESCs (Elf1<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>; WIN-1<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>) while little increase was observed in primed hESCs (H1, H7) or cells transitioning to primed state (Elf1 AF, WIN1 AF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C&#x02013;F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl.Fig.1E&#x02013;I</xref>). Likewise, cells &#x0201c;toggled&#x0201d; back to a more na&#x000ef;ve state (H1 2iF<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, H1 4iLIF) showed increased OCR in response to FCCP to a level similar to mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig1A,C&#x02013;D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl.Fig1G,J&#x02013;K</xref>). These results indicate that the primed hESCs have a lower mitochondrial respiration capacity than na&#x000ef;ve hESCs.</p><p id="P8">The higher mitochondrial capacity of na&#x000ef;ve hESCs (Elf1) reflects neither more mature mitochondria<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, nor an increase in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number compared to primed hESCs (ElfAF, H7, H1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig.1L&#x02013;M</xref>). Further, no obvious increase in mtDNA mutation frequency was detected in primed compared to na&#x000ef;ve hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl.Fig.1N&#x02013;O</xref>), suggesting that reduction of oxidative respiration in primed hESCs is not caused by a deteriorating mitochondrial genome. However, consistent with the mouse data, RNA-seq data from our study and microarray or RNA-seq data from other studies<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> showed that expression of most mitochondrial electron transport chain complex IV- Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) genes is significantly downregulated in the primed state compared to the na&#x000ef;ve state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.Table1B&#x02013;D</xref>).

Stearic acid and cholesterol are the metabolites that contribute the most to the separation within the first PC, indicating that when ESCs transition from na&#x000ef;ve to primed state, a major switch occurs in the lipid metabolism. A similar trend of na&#x000ef;ve and primed ESC separation is observed in PCA plots of the LC metabolomics data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Suppl.Fig2D</xref>). However, H1 2iF, which is a primed cell line &#x0201c;toggled&#x0201d; towards the na&#x000ef;ve state, and Elf1, the na&#x000ef;ve hESC line, clustered midway between mouse na&#x000ef;ve cell line (R1) and primed cell lines (R1AF, EpiSC, Elf1AF, H7 and H1) in LC analysis, suggesting that H1 2iF and Elf1 have not reached the same na&#x000ef;ve state as observed in mouse, with respect to lipid signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig.2D</xref>).</p><p id="P11">In addition, targeted analysis of metabolites was performed using LC-QQQ-MS with na&#x000ef;ve Elf1 and primed H1 hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.Table.1H&#x02013;I</xref>) and using GC-TOF with naive Elf1 and primed ElfAF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Suppl.Fig.2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl.Table.1J</xref>).

Intermediates prior to PEP can be conserved for biosynthetic purposes: 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) can be diverted to serine and glycine synthesis, which can supply one-carbon units to multiple methylation reactions; dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) can be converted to glycerol, which serves as the backbone of glycerolipids.
