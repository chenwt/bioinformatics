RM55-<italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic> is homozygous for a mutable allele (<italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic>) that specifies black and brown striped seeds; RM30-<italic>R*</italic> is a stable black revertant isoline derived from the mutable line; and RM38-<italic>r</italic> has brown seed coats due to a recessive <italic>r</italic> allele shown to translate a truncated MYB protein. Using long range PCR, 454 sequencing of amplicons, and whole genome re-sequencing, we determined that the variegated RM55-<italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic> line had a 13 kb CACTA subfamily transposon insertion (designated <italic>TgmR*</italic>) at a position 110 bp from the beginning of Intron2 of the <italic>R</italic> locus, Glyma09g36983. Although the MYB encoded by <italic>R</italic> was expressed at only very low levels in older seed coats of the black revertant RM30-<italic>R*</italic> line, it upregulated expression of anthocyanidin synthase genes (<italic>ANS2, ANS3</italic>) to promote the synthesis of anthocyanins. Surprisingly, the RM30-<italic>R*</italic> revertant also carried the 13 kb <italic>TgmR*</italic> insertion in Intron2. Using RNA-Seq, we showed that intron splicing was accurate, albeit at lower levels, despite the presence of the 13 kb <italic>TgmR*</italic> element. As determined by whole genome methylation sequencing, we demonstrate that the <italic>TgmR*</italic> sequence was relatively more methylated in RM30-<italic>R*</italic> than in the mutable RM55-<italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic> progenitor line. The stabilized and more methylated RM30-<italic>R*</italic> revertant line apparently lacks effective binding of a transposae to its subterminal repeats, thus allowing intron splicing to proceed resulting in sufficient MYB protein to stimulate anthocyanin production and thus black seed coats. In this regard, the <italic>TgmR*</italic> element in soybean resembles McClintock's <italic>Spm-</italic>suppressible and change-of-state alleles of maize. This comparison explains the opposite effects of the <italic>TgmR*</italic> element on intron splicing of the MYB gene in which it resides depending on the methylation state of the element.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The research was funded by grants from the United Soybean Board, the Illinois Soybean Association and the USDA.

Because of their antioxidant properties, seeds and vegetables with anthocyanin pigments have added nutritional and health value. Understanding the regulation and expression of all regulatory genes in the anthocyanin metabolic pathway in each major crop plant species is of significance as a model system for gene expression and for improving agronomic and nutritional properties.</p><p>We have identified the molecular basis of some of the classical loci leading to anthocyanin production in soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>) seed and plant parts. The majority of the cultivated soybean varieties have yellow seeds with hila of various colors but ancestral soybeans (<italic>Glycine soja</italic>) have pigmented seed coats. The pigmentation in seed coat, hilum and pubescence (trichome hairs) is determined by three independent loci, <italic>I</italic> (<italic>Inhibitor</italic>), <italic>R</italic>, and <italic>T</italic> (<italic>Tawny</italic>). The <italic>I</italic> locus controls distribution of anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin pigments and comprises the multigenic, inverted repeat region of chalcone synthase (CHS) genes (<italic>CHS1</italic>, <italic>CHS3</italic> and <italic>CHS4</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0111959-Todd1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In its dominant form <italic>I</italic>, silences the expression of all nine CHS gene family via short interfering RNAs in a tissue-specific manner in the seed coat <xref rid="pone.0111959-Tuteja1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Since CHS is the first committed enzyme in the anthocyanin pathway, the <italic>I</italic> genotypes result in yellow seed coats. Colored soybeans have recessive <italic>I</italic> alleles and the various colors of the seed coats are influenced by the <italic>R</italic> and <italic>T</italic> loci. Black (<italic>i,R,T</italic>), imperfect-black (<italic>i,R,t</italic>), brown (<italic>i,r,T</italic>) and buff (<italic>i,r,t</italic>) seed coats. The <italic>T</italic> locus encodes a flavonoid 3&#x02032;hydroxylase (<italic>F3&#x02032;H</italic>) gene, the expression of which drives the synthesis of the anthocyanin cyanidin pathway branch <xref rid="pone.0111959-Zabala1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Recently it has been proposed that <italic>R</italic> maps to a locus encoding a MYB transcription factor which may positively regulate the expression of a <italic>UDP-glucose: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase</italic> (<italic>UF3GT</italic>) gene that functions in the last step of anthocyanin synthesis <xref rid="pone.0111959-Gillman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These authors identified the recessive, brown <italic>r</italic> allele to affect the expression of a seed coat-specific R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene, Glyma09g36983 from the sequenced soybean genome as a strong candidate for the <italic>R</italic> locus. In addition, their qRT-PCR analysis supported a correlation between the mRNA levels of the putative <italic>R</italic> gene and a UDP-glucose: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (<italic>UF3GT</italic>) gene (Glyma08g07130) that catalyzes the glycosylation of cyanidins to anthocyanins. The recessive <italic>r</italic> (brown) allele at Glyma09g36983 contained a single base deletion that would result in a truncated protein and did not upregulate this <italic>UF3GT</italic> gene. Based on a combined analysis of transcriptome and metabolome data, another recent study identified 20 anthocyanin, flavonoid and phenylpropanoid isogenes that were differentially expressed between black (<italic>iRT</italic>) and brown (<italic>irT</italic>) seeded soybean isolines <xref rid="pone.0111959-Kovinich1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This same study suggested that <italic>R</italic> locus candidate might be a transcription factor at the distal end of chromosome Gm09 at or near Glyma09g36840, 120 kb from the Glyma09g36983 MYB factor mapped by Gillman et al <xref rid="pone.0111959-Gillman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>The <italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic> allele of the <italic>R</italic> locus conditions a variegated or mutable distribution of black spots or concentric rings of black pigment superimposed on an otherwise brown seed coat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111959-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This phenotype is sometimes referred to as a striped phenotype. The <italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic> allele present in a plant introduction line was backcrossed for five generations into a brown seeded Clark line with homozygous <italic>i, r, T</italic> genotype to create isoline L72-2040 with <italic>i r<sup>m</sup>, T</italic> genotype and released in 1972 by soybean breeder R.L.

Surprisingly the 13 kb CACTA transposon (designated <italic>TgmR*</italic>) is retained in the <italic>R*</italic> allele of a stable black-seeded revertant isoline. Using quantitative RNA-Seq data from a developmental series of seed coats from the black-seeded RM30-<italic>R</italic>* revertant and the RM38-<italic>r</italic> brown-seeded isoline, we also demonstrate that the MYB factor encoded by the <italic>R</italic> gene appears to induce the expression of anthocyanidin synthase (<italic>ANS</italic>) genes at late stages of seed development in the black RM30-<italic>R*</italic> line. Thus, our data further support Glyma09g3698 as the <italic>R</italic> locus in soybean and show that it regulates <italic>ANS</italic> genes and potentially other genes in the anthocyanin pathway despite a very low level of <italic>R</italic> gene transcripts. The <italic>R</italic> encoded MYB protein possesses four of the amino acids present in the subgroup five of MYB proteins that are involved in anthocyanin regulation by transcriptional activation <xref rid="pone.0111959-Stracke1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Further we show that intron splicing was accurate despite the presence of the 13kb <italic>TgmR*</italic> element in Intron2 of the MYB gene.

The stabilized RM30-<italic>R*</italic> revertant line, which had a higher level of methylation, either lacks the active transpose or it cannot bind to its subterminal repeats, thus allowing intron processing to proceed normally, although at a reduced level, resulting in enough of the MYB protein to stimulate anthocyanin production and thus black seed coats. In this regard, the <italic>TgmR*</italic> element that causes the variegated black and brown seed coats in soybean resembles McClintock's genetically and molecularly characterized <italic>Spm-</italic>suppressible and change of state alleles [reviewed in 12,13].</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Mutable <italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic> and Revertant <italic>R*</italic> Alleles Both Contain a Large Insertion in a MYB Transcription Factor Encoded by Glyma09g36983</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111959-g001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the phenotypes of the lines homozygous for the variegated <italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic> allele (here designated as line RM55-<italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic>) that was repetitively backcrossed into the genetic background of a brown seeded Clark isoline (RM38-<italic>r</italic>) and of a stable revertant <italic>R*</italic> allele (RM30-<italic>R*</italic>).

Successful amplification was achieved with two long PCR primers (R6990FP1 and R6990RPB) and a Long Amplification (LA) PCR method <xref rid="pone.0111959-Zabala2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> (see Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111959.s003">File S1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111959-g002">Figure 2A</xref> shows the two larger &#x0223c;14 kb DNA fragments amplified from RM30-<italic>R*</italic> and RM55-<italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic> and the smaller 929 bp fragments in RM38-<italic>r</italic> and RM55-<italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic>. The 929 bp fragments are the expected size of the DNA sequence between the two oligo DNA primers (FP:R6990FP1and RP:R6990RPB).

The most extensive regions of sequence similarity to <italic>TgmR*</italic> in the Williams 82 genome were found in chromosomes Gm05 and Gm15, where Glyma05g23600 (6,412 nt) and Glyma15g21480 (5,909 nt) reside, respectively.

Thus, this MYB factor has relatively low expression even in the fully functional standard <italic>R</italic> alleles with black seed coats. The lower level of <italic>R</italic> gene expression in RM30-<italic>R*</italic> could be explained by the <italic>TgmR*</italic> insertion in Intron2 reducing functional transcript levels from the allele.

The more prevalent methylated CpG and CHG regions were also higher in comparison to RM55-<italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic>.

This suggests that when the element excises by transposition, a fully functional MYB protein is produced leading to the black sectors on the brown background in the RM55-<italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic> line.</p><p>The brown background in the RM55-<italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic> seed coats being the result of the 14 kb amplicon 13 kb <italic>TgmR*</italic> (ie the 14kb amplicon) is harder to explain especially in light of the fact that we have shown that the revertant RM30-<italic>R*</italic> line containing the 13 kb <italic>TgmR*</italic> element in its intron has black seed coats. This would suggest that the phenotype of the allele (black or brown) is determined by the level of methylation of the <italic>TgmR*</italic> element. When the element residing in Intron2 is less methylated as in the RM55-<italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic>, the sectors are brown implying the MYB gene is not expressed. When <italic>TgmR*</italic> is more methylated, as in the RM30-<italic>R*</italic> allele, the seed coats are black and the MYB gene is expressed as we have shown experimentally. We propose that the mechanism for this phenenomon is similar to that shown for the <italic>Spm</italic>-suppressible alleles of maize in that the phenotype of the affected allele can depend upon where the transposon sits in the gene and whether an active element is present (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0111959-Wessler1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111959-Fedoroff1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>). The CACTA ends of <italic>Spm</italic> elements as well as the Activator (Ac) elements sometimes mimic splicing sites and are recognized as intron ends <xref rid="pone.0111959-Wessler1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111959-Menssen1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In some cases as shown in maize, binding of transposase from an active element will interfere with intron processing if the element is near the Exon-Intron junction leading to the gene not being processed correctly. In the absence of transposase, the introns are processed and the gene is expressed, although sometimes at a lower level. In maize, it has been shown that the autonomous <italic>Spm</italic> element itself can switch between an active state (less methylated with transposase produced) and an inactive state (more methylated and transposase not produced) based on the level of its methylation <xref rid="pone.0111959-Banks1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Thus, in the hypomethylated RM55-<italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic> line, transposase from the <italic>TgmR*</italic> element in the MYB gene or other locations could bind to the element ends and interfere with intron processing leading to the brown background color. On the other hand, in the stable black line RM30-<italic>R*</italic>, the opposite effect occurs as the element is more methylated and transposase is lacking or cannot bind the element termini and interfere with intron processing. Thus, the element is spliced out with the intron and the MYB gene is expressed at a low level leading to activation of the ANS genes and production of the anthocyanin pigments. There is one phenotypic difference between the standard <italic>R</italic> allele and the <italic>R*</italic> allele in the RM30 line in that the hilum region, which is the point of attachment of the seed to the pod, is less pigmented than in the standard <italic>R</italic> allele and retain a brownish cast <xref rid="pone.0111959-Chandlee1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. A genetic difference between the two alleles is that the <italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic> is normally recessive to the standard <italic>R</italic> allele producing progeny with black seed, but it appears to be dominant to the <italic>R*</italic> allele with variegated seed predominating and an increased rate of somatic and germinal mutability results from crossing RM30-<italic>R*</italic> and RM55-<italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic>
<xref rid="pone.0111959-Wang3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The activation <italic>in trans</italic> of the <italic>TgmR*</italic> element within the RM30-<italic>R*</italic> allele by the transposase from the hypomethylated <italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic> allele is consistent with its dominance over the <italic>R*</italic> allele.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Summary</title><p>In conclusion, our results confirm the soybean <italic>R</italic> locus to be Glyma09g36983 and demonstrate that the transcription of the <italic>R</italic> gene in the black seed coats of the RM30-<italic>R</italic>* revertant line, may be hindered by the processing of the very large Intron2 containing the <italic>TgmR</italic>* (13kb) insertion, but it does not render the processed transcript non-functional. Instead, the translated MYB protein drives an increase in transcript accumulation of the <italic>ANS2/3</italic>, <italic>UFGT2</italic> and <italic>AOMT</italic> genes whose products function in the late steps of anthocyanin synthesis, particularly in production of the cyanidin-3-glycoside that accounts for the black pigmentation of the seed coats. In contrast, the observed higher level of transcripts found for the defective <italic>r</italic> allele in RM38-<italic>r</italic> seed coats may translate into truncated peptides that are non-functional and do not activate the transcription of the late anthocyanin pathway genes resulting in brown seeds which reflects accumulation of only proanthocyanidins. The <italic>TgmR*</italic> found in the striped RM55-<italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic> and black-seeded RM30-<italic>R*</italic> isolines is a transposon of a second CACTA subfamily that encodes a full length <italic>Tnp2</italic> transposase gene that may drive the observed instability of the isolines with the <italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic> and <italic>R*</italic> alleles. The level of instability of the RM55-<italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic> and RM30-<italic>R*</italic> isolines is influenced by the total level of C methylation and also methylated C in the CHH context, judging by the bisulfite sequencing results of three genomes. The <italic>TgmR*</italic> element in the variegated RM55-<italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic> line was hypomethylated especially at the subterminal repeat ends compared to the RM30-<italic>R*</italic> element. Stress and other environmental factors may in turn affect the methylation level of the germinal and somatic tissues and consequently lead to the variegated phenotype and affect the stability of the mutable (<italic>r<sup>m</sup></italic>) and revertant (<italic>R*</italic>) alleles by a mechanism similar to that elucidated for CACTA elements in maize including the <italic>Spm</italic>-suppressible alleles first described by Barbara McClintock (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0111959-Wessler1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111959-Fedoroff1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>).

Starting with 1 &#x000b5;g total RNA per sample, RNAseq libraries were constructed with the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina San Diego, CA). These libraries were multiplexed and loaded onto 8-lane flowcells for cluster formation and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000. One of the lanes was loaded with a PhiX Control library that provides a balanced genome for calculation of matrix, phasing and prephasing, which are essential for accurate basecalling.
