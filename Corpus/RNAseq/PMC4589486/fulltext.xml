We performed low-coverage genome and high-coverage exome sequencing of 20 desmoplastic melanomas, followed by targeted sequencing of 293 genes on a validation cohort of 42 cases. A high mutation burden (median 62 mutations/Mb) ranked desmoplastic melanoma among the most highly mutated cancers<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Mutation patterns strongly implicate UV-radiation as the dominant mutagen<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, indicating a superficially located cell of origin. Novel alterations included recurrent promoter mutations of NF-kappa B inhibitor epsilon, <italic>NFKBIE</italic> (IkB&#x003b5;), in 14.5% of samples. Commonly mutated oncogenes in melanomas, in particular <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> and <italic>NRAS<sup>Q61K/R</sup></italic>, were absent.

They most often occur in chronically sun-exposed skin of older individuals. Clinically, they usually present as unpigmented scar-like indurations, delaying their detection. Histologically they are primarily dermal-based tumors composed of a paucicellular proliferation of spindle-shaped cells situated within an abundant desmoplastic stroma and can be easily misdiagnosed. Some desmoplastic melanomas grow extensively along or within nerves, a feature termed neurotropism. Primary melanomas composed predominantly (&#x0003e;90%) of desmoplastic melanoma are classified as &#x0201c;pure desmoplastic melanoma", whereas primary melanomas that exhibit areas characteristic of desmoplastic melanoma amounting to &#x0003c;90% of the tumors (the remainder being composed of non-desmoplastic melanoma), are classified as &#x0201c;mixed desmoplastic melanoma&#x0201d;. Patients with the pure subtype of desmoplastic melanoma have a lower rate of nodal metastasis and better survival<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Despite the fact that desmoplastic melanoma is a deadly and commonly misdiagnosed cancer, there are no known genetic drivers<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Several studies have failed to identify common pathogenic mutations<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. This may be due to the small number of cases analyzed to date as well as the technical limitations of studying tumors like desmoplastic melanoma that exhibit a low ratio of tumor to stromal cells. We sought to characterize the genome-wide mutational landscape of desmoplastic melanoma in order to identify genetic alterations that underlie their unique biology and serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets.</p><p id="P4">Low-coverage genome sequencing (13&#x000d7;) and high-coverage exome sequencing (89&#x000d7;) were performed on a discovery set of 20 fresh-frozen tumors and matched normal DNA (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In addition, we sequenced neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissue from 42 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary desmoplastic melanomas as a validation cohort. Targeted sequencing of 293 genes (216&#x000d7;, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref> for gene list) that included the top candidates nominated from the discovery set was performed on the validation cohort. High-resolution aCGH (180K-1M feature arrays) was performed on samples from both cohorts. Using these approaches, we were able to determine point mutation and copy number information in 62 desmoplastic melanomas.</p><p id="P5">The median number of mutations per megabase was 62 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), ranking desmoplastic melanoma among cancers with the highest known mutation burdens. This contrasts with &#x0201c;conventional&#x0201d; cutaneous melanomas (approximately 15 mutations per megabase<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>) and the majority of solid cancers (approximately 2 mutations per megabase<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>). In desmoplastic melanoma 88% of mutations were C&#x0003e;T transitions and favored di-pyrimidines, implicating UV-radiation as the dominant mutagen (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). There were some notable exceptions to these patterns. Two tumors arose from sun-shielded sites and had the lowest mutation burdens; one of these occurred in a patient in whom we identified a germline <italic>CDKN2A</italic> mutation. Tumors arising in younger patients tended to have lower mutation burdens (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) (p =2&#x000d7;10<sup>-3</sup>, t-test). Pure and mixed desmoplastic melanomas were genetically similar.</p><p id="P6">Overall, desmoplastic melanomas had fewer copy number alterations (CNAs) than other melanoma subtypes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). In spite of the low overall copy number burden, several samples had focal copy number alterations (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figures 2-3</xref>). Focal amplifications affected the following genes: <italic>EGFR</italic>, <italic>CDK4</italic>, <italic>MDM2</italic>, <italic>TERT</italic>, <italic>MAP3K1</italic> (3 cases each); <italic>MET</italic>, <italic>YAP1, NFKBIE</italic> (2 cases each); <italic>CCND1</italic>, <italic>MYC</italic>, and <italic>SOS2</italic> (one case each). Immunohistochemistry for <italic>EGFR</italic>, <italic>CDK4</italic>, <italic>MDM2</italic>, <italic>MET</italic>, <italic>YAP1</italic>, and <italic>CCND1</italic> confirmed increased protein expression in select cases (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Focal deletions affected <italic>CDKN2A</italic> (11 cases) and <italic>NF1</italic> (4 cases). Loss of p16 expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in select cases (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The high mutation burden made it difficult to identify potential driver mutations among the numerous somatic mutations. We searched for recurrent mutations clustering at specific base pairs (hotspots) and genes with a disproportionately high frequency of loss-of-function mutations to identify true driver mutations<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Several tumors harbored the following oncogenic hotspot mutations known to occur in other cancers: <italic>ERBB2<sup>S310F</sup></italic> (n=4); <italic>MAP2K1<sup>P124S/L</sup></italic>, <italic>PTPN11<sup>E76A/K</sup></italic>, <italic>PPP6C<sup>R264C</sup></italic>, and <italic>RAC1<sup>P29S</sup></italic> (n=2); <italic>EZH2<sup>Y641S</sup></italic>, <italic>IDH1<sup>R132C</sup></italic>, <italic>PIK3CA<sup>E542K</sup></italic>, <italic>NRAS<sup>Q61H</sup></italic>, <italic>BRAF<sup>G469E</sup></italic>, <italic>BRAF<sup>G466E</sup></italic>, and <italic>BRAF<sup>D594N</sup></italic> (n=1) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 3-4</xref>). <italic>TERT</italic> promoter mutations were only recently discovered<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>; the relevant region could only be sequenced in a subset of samples, in which 85% (17/20) harbored a mutation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). To identify novel pathogenic mutations, we searched for highly recurrent mutational hotspots that have not been previously characterized. The most recurrent mutational hotspot, observed 9 times, affected the gene <italic>NFKBIE</italic> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). <italic>NFKBIE</italic> also harbored recurrent mutations at another nearby position in two additional instances (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To identify tumor suppressor candidates, we looked for genes that were enriched for loss-of-function mutations, as described in the Methods. Briefly, truncating mutations (nonsense, splice-site, or frame-shift) and missense mutations predicted to be damaging were nominated as candidate driver mutations. Mutations that had undergone loss of heterozygosity were particularly scrutinized. Taking these criteria into account, we determined genes for which the burden of loss-of-function (LOF) exceeded what would be expected by chance by comparing it to LOF burdens generated from permuted data (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). The genes implicated by this approach were <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, <italic>NF1</italic>, <italic>ARID2</italic>, <italic>FSIP1</italic>, <italic>CBL</italic>, <italic>FBXW7</italic>, <italic>CDH2</italic>, <italic>IL36A</italic>, <italic>PAK3</italic>, <italic>RB1</italic>, and <italic>ARID1A</italic> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Using immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that representative mutations affecting <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, <italic>RB1</italic>, and <italic>ARID1A</italic> resulted in concurrent alterations at the protein level (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Our analysis implicated several cancer genes unique or enriched in desmoplastic melanoma. <italic>CBL</italic> is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) for degradation, and its loss is associated with increased RTK signaling<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Germline <italic>CBL</italic> mutations affecting its zinc finger domain are associated with a variety of cancer and developmental disorders, such as Noonan syndrome<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Noonan syndrome can be caused by mutations in other genes, including <italic>PTPN11</italic>, <italic>NRAS</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>, and <italic>BRAF</italic>, all of which have been associated with melanocytic neoplasia<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. In desmoplastic melanoma, <italic>CBL</italic> harbored frequent truncating and damaging missense mutations in the absence of any synonymous mutations (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), indicating that it may act as a tumor suppressor gene. <italic>CBL</italic> mutations are infrequent in published melanoma exome sequencing studies. This could be because non-desmoplastic melanomas generally harbor <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>NRAS</italic><sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> mutations, which functionally reside in the same signaling pathway as <italic>CBL</italic>.</p><p id="P11">Another gene implicated in the MAPK pathway was <italic>MAP3K1</italic><sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. We observed highly focal amplifications of <italic>MAP3K1</italic> in three tumors (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Although genetic alterations of <italic>MAP3K1</italic> have not been reported in melanoma, a Sleeping Beauty screen in a melanoma mouse model driven by <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> identified <italic>MAP3K1</italic> as a melanoma oncogene<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. In that study, tumors with <italic>MAP3K1</italic> insertions arose exclusively in melanocytes that failed to activate the conditional <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> allele, or they arose in <italic>BRAF<sup>WT</sup></italic> control mice, indicating that <italic>MAP3K1</italic> activation can substitute for <italic>BRAF</italic> activation. <italic>MAP3K1</italic> amplifications may therefore represent an equivalent driver mutation in desmoplastic melanoma.</p><p id="P12"><italic>FBXW7</italic> is an E3-ubiquitin ligase responsible for <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>CCNE1</italic> degradation<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Truncating or damaging missense mutations striking the critical WD domains of <italic>FBXW7</italic> are common in several cancers<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. In our cohort, 11% of tumors harbored nonsense or damaging missense mutations, often involving the WD domains, while synonymous and conservative missense mutations were absent (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). <italic>FBXW7</italic> mutations are also present, albeit at a much lower frequency, in published melanoma exome sequencing studies <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Therefore, <italic>FBXW7</italic> is a tumor suppressor across multiple melanoma subtypes with an increased frequency in desmoplastic melanoma.</p><p id="P13"><italic>NFKBIE</italic> (IkB&#x003b5;) inhibits downstream Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF&#x003ba;B) signaling by sequestering NF&#x003ba;B transcription factors in the cytoplasm<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. The <italic>NFKBIE</italic> locus was focally amplified in two samples (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>), and showed recurrent mutations at several nearby hotspots, implicating <italic>NFKBIE</italic> as a candidate oncogene. The clustered mutations are not found in COSMIC nor TCGA studies of any cancer, including sequencing studies of melanomas mostly from intermittently sun-damaged skin. We sequenced <italic>NFKBIE</italic> in an extension cohort of diverse melanomas and found 6 non-desmoplastic melanomas with <italic>NFKBIE</italic> mutations (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary text</xref>). Similar to desmoplastic melanomas, the <italic>NFKBIE</italic>-mutant non-desmoplastic melanomas did not harbor <italic>BRAF</italic> or <italic>NRAS</italic> mutations, and had a very high mutation burden with evidence of UV-radiation induced mutational damage.</p><p id="P14">Overall, we found 20 clustered mutations in 15 tumors (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). Mutations from all cases were validated using at least two sequencing assays (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Figures S7-S9</xref>). Remarkably, five of the 15 tumors had two mutations each, and in all five cases the mutations affected opposing alleles (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref>). Four of the mutations from the 10 tumors with only a single <italic>NFKBIE</italic> mutation had undergone loss of heterozygosity, as evidenced by elevated frequencies of the mutant allele (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Collectively, these results strongly suggest selection for bi-allelic <italic>NFKBIE</italic> mutations.</p><p id="P15">There are two gene models for <italic>NFKBIE</italic>. The main mutational hotspot resided over the coding region of the long isoform and the promoter of the short isoform (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, <italic>NFKBIE</italic> genes track). We mined Illumina Human Bodymap 2.0 RNA-Seq data to determine the tissue distribution of <italic>NFKBIE</italic> isoforms. The short isoform of <italic>NFKBIE</italic> is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, while the long form is restricted to brain tissue (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, <italic>NFKBIE</italic> genes track). Similarly, RNASeq data from the melanoma TCGA project exclusively showed expression of the short isoform (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, Melanoma TCGA RNA-Seq track). We identified two non-desmoplastic melanoma cell lines that harbored <italic>NFKBIE</italic> hotspot mutations (M257 and M375, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> Mutations track).

Some of the alterations found may have clinical implications. For example, there are small-molecule inhibitors directly targeting products of several oncogenes, such as MET, EGFR, ERBB2, IDH1, MAP2K1, PIK3CA, and CDK4. Furthermore, the exorbitantly high mutation burden found in desmoplastic melanomas makes them promising candidates for immune checkpoint blockade therapy<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Finally, the mutational patterns observed in desmoplastic melanoma indicate the ontogeny of these neoplasms. While desmoplastic melanomas typically present as deep-seated cutaneous neoplasms, the overwhelming UV-signature in most desmoplastic melanomas indicate that they arose from a cell in or near the epidermis that accumulated most of its mutation burden prior to dermal invasion.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Online Methods</title><sec id="S2"><title>Sample Collection and microdissection</title><p id="P20">The study protocol was approved by the UCSF's committee on Human Subjects, the Memorial Sloan Kettering institutional review board and human biospecimen utilization committee, and the Sydney Local Health District.

In order to do this, we needed to accurately call gains and losses in the presence of varying stromal cell contamination across samples. Towards this goal, we first used the scaled median absolute deviation (MAD) of the sequential order difference as implemented in the matrixStats package in R to estimate the sample-specific experimental variation. Next, we declared a segment to be gained or lost if the average log2 ratio was at least one sample MAD away from the median segmented values of the autosomal probes in that sample.

Our source code implementing this method is freely available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/etal/lofsigrank">https://github.com/etal/lofsigrank</ext-link>. A brief description of the computation follows.
<list list-type="simple" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P31">Step 1: The overall non-synonymous:synonymous mutation ratio is calculated. In this study, that ratio was 2.13:1.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P32">Step 2: The number of synonymous mutations striking each gene is multiplied by the overall non-synonymous:synonymous mutation ratio, as calculated in Step 1, and subtracted from the total number of mutations striking that gene. Genes for which this resulting number is positive are considered to be enriched for non-synonymous mutations and selected for further analysis.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P33">Step 3: Within each gene, sample, and mutation type, non-synonymous mutation counts are multiplied by their normalized mutant allele frequencies (NMAF). The NMAF is calculated by dividing the mutant allele frequency of a mutation by the median mutant allele frequency of all mutations in a sample. Effectively, the NMAF approximates the clonality and zygosity of a given mutation. Thus, weighing mutations by their NMAF favored fully clonal mutations that had undergone loss of heterozygosity over subclonal or heterozygous mutations.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P34">Step 4: For genes with multiple non-synonymous mutations in a single sample, the NMAFs of all mutations in that specific gene from that single sample are summed and capped at 2. The cap at 2 represents the maximum number of alleles that a single sample can lose. The rationale behind this approach is that multiple mutations striking the same gene in a single sample are likely to affect both alleles but can logically affect no more than both alleles. This approach avoids placing undue emphasis on large genes that accumulate high counts of incidental mutations. To illustrate the utility of this methodology, in this study, <italic>TTN</italic>, the largest gene in the genome, harbored over 100 mutations in a single sample &#x02013; this correction credited that single sample with 2 hits to <italic>TTN</italic> (inactivating both alleles) rather 100+ hits.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P35">Step 5: For each gene, sum the rescaled and capped mutation burdens across all samples, yielding a preliminary measure of the number of alleles impacted by mutations in a gene across all samples. This preliminary measure will be referred to as the number of hits.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P36">Step 6: Determine the deleterious skew of non-synonymous mutations across all mutations in all samples. The frequency of truncating (nonsense, frame-shift, and splice-site) and missense (probably damaging, possibly damaging, or benign) mutations is calculated across all mutations in all samples. For the present study, the breakdown was 8.1% (truncating) and 29.6%/13.6%/16.7% for missense probably/possible/benign &#x02013; the remainder were synonymous mutations.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P37">Step 7: Determine the &#x0201c;truncating mutation&#x0201d; burden for each gene. The frequency of truncating mutations affecting a specific gene across all samples is calculated and divided by the genome-wide average. For example, if a gene has 5 truncating mutations out of 10 total mutations, then the truncating factor would be 0.5/0.081 = 6.17. This factor has a wide range of values.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P38">Step 8: Determine the &#x0201c;missense-probably damaging&#x0201d; burden for each gene. The frequency of probably damaging mutations affecting a gene is calculated as follows: 1 + (missense-pd_gene) &#x02013; (missense-pd_total). For example, if a gene has 5 missense probably damaging mutations out of 10 mutations total then this factor would be as follow: 1 + 0.5 &#x02013; 0.296 = 1.204. This factor has a relatively small range of values.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P39">Step 9: Calculate the loss of function burden as the product of the number of hits and mutation burdens calculated in steps 5 through 8: Multiply the normalized number of hits (step 5) by the truncating mutation burden (step 7) and the probably damaging mutation burden (step 8). As can be seen, the factors in steps 7 and 8 have the potential to magnify the value calculated in step 5 if the mutations affecting a gene were disproportionately damaging as compared to the genome average.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P40">Step 10: Determine significance by simulation. Repeat steps 1-9 on sample/gene/mutation permuted data (recommended 1000 permutations).
