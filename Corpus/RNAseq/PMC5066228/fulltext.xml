We analyzed how Mena11a, an isoform enriched in epithelia and epithelial-like cells, affects Mena-dependent regulation of actin dynamics and cell behavior. While other Mena isoforms promote actin polymerization and drive membrane protrusion, we find that Mena11a decreases actin polymerization and growth factor-stimulated membrane protrusion at lamellipodia. Ectopic Mena11a expression slows mesenchymal-like cell motility, while isoform-specific depletion of endogenous Mena11a in epithelial-like tumor cells perturbs cell:cell junctions and increases membrane protrusion and overall cell motility. Mena11a can dampen membrane protrusion and reduce actin polymerization in the absence of other Mena isoforms, indicating that it is not simply an inactive Mena isoform. We identify a phosphorylation site within 11a that is required for some Mena11a-specific functions. RNA-seq data analysis from patient cohorts demonstrates that the difference between mRNAs encoding constitutive Mena sequences and those containing the 11a exon correlates with metastasis in colorectal cancer, suggesting that 11a exon exclusion contributes to invasive phenotypes and leads to poor clinical outcomes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Cell migration is required for physiological processes such as morphogenesis and wound healing, and is dysregulated in metastatic cancer and other diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.

In developing mouse E15.5 dermis and E15.5 lung, Mena11a localized to cells in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) and lung epithelium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), respectively, but was excluded from surrounding pan-Mena-expressing mesenchyme; Mena11a expression was retained in adult mouse and human epithelial tissues, including mouse epidermis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), mouse bronchioalveolar epithelium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), and human colon epithelium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), while pan-Mena signal was observed in non-epithelial cells in these same tissues.

To investigate whether RNAseq transcriptome data from clinical samples could be used to develop a surrogate metric equivalent to MenaCalc, we acquired exon-level gene expression data from publicly available TCGA data to determine whether the abundance of mRNAs encoding constitutively included Mena exons, Mena11a, or an mRNA-based version of MenaCalc (see Methods) were associated with overall survival. We were unable to find a stable correlation between MenaCalc and overall survival in the TCGA breast cancer cohort (BRCA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, likely due to the short follow-up time (of patients with &#x0003e;10 years follow-up, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;55 alive, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;73 deceased, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 with &#x000bc; cutoff point) in this cohort. We were also unable to detect a significant correlation between MenaCalc levels and metastasis formation in this relatively small cohort of TCGA BRCA patients.</p><p>Since Mena11a is expressed in normal human colon epithelium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), and Mena is upregulated in colorectal adenocarcinomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, we investigated whether MenaCalc levels correlated with overall survival or with annotated clinicopathological characteristics in the TCGA colorectal cancer cohort (COAD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. While we failed to detect a significant correlation between MenaCalc and overall survival, by either Kaplan-Meier analysis or using logistic regression (again, likely because of the relatively short follow-up time and small number of patients in the cohort; &#x0003e;1 year follow-up, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;110 alive, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;33 deceased), patients with distant metastasis (M1) had, on average, significantly higher MenaCalc values compared to patients with no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that MenaCalc (coefficient&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.349, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003), but neither Mena (coefficient&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.176, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.168), nor Mena11a (coefficient&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.033, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.808) alone, was significantly associated with metastasis in the COAD cohort. These data support the idea that MenaCalc is associated with malignant progression in at least some carcinomas.</p><p>Interestingly, gene ontology (GO) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) analyses of genes whose expression levels correlated with those of Mena, Mena11a, or MenaCalc showed that a distinct set of functional annotations were enriched in the MenaCalc, but not the Mena or Mena11a correlating gene lists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The top 50 genes correlating with MenaCalc in the COAD cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), including EMT markers Zeb1 and Zeb2, were enriched in gene sets related to EMT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), and were associated with GO terms such as cell:substrate adhesion (GO:0031589) and cell:matrix adhesion (GO:0007160) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Within the top 150 genes, we find that SNAI2, or Slug, another hallmark EMT gene, correlates with MenaCalc in the COAD cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>); however, we did not find a strong correlation with either Snail or Twist (rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.319 and 0.399, respectively). In contrast, the sets of genes correlating with expression of either Mena or Mena11a alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) did not show any significant enrichment for terms associated with key biological processes involved in EMT, or cancer invasion and metastasis. These findings are consistent with the idea that MenaCalc, which represents the abundance of Mena isoforms lacking the 11a exon, is more associated with pro-metastatic phenotypes than either total Mena or Mena11a levels, and provides insight into why MenaCalc, but not Mena or Mena11a levels, are associated with poor clinical outcome in appropriately powered analyses of multiple breast cancer patient cohorts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mena11a maintains cell-cell junctions by regulating F-actin structure</title><p>Mena11a is enriched in epithelia; we find it preferentially targets to cell:cell contacts <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), and co-localizes with ZO-1 at tight junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>) as well as E-cadherin at adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>) in cultured human breast cancer MCF7 cells.

To assess whether the 11a sequence endows Mena11a with specific functions distinct from Mena, we designed shRNAs targeting the 63 bases of the 11a insertion (sh-1, sh-2, hereafter Mena11a-KD) and paired control shRNAs (sh-1C, sh-2C, hereafter control-KD). In MCF7 cells, Mena11a shRNAs efficiently downregulated Mena11a, but did not affect protein levels of Mena lacking the 11a insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p>To investigate Mena11a-isoform specific function at cell-cell contacts, we used super-resolution three dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) to image monolayers of MCF7 Mena11a-KD cells and control-KD cells that were stained with phalloidin, ZO-1, or E-cadherin to visualize F-actin, tight junctions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>), or adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>), respectively.

We find that Mena11a is not simply an attenuated or less active form of Mena, but is endowed with unique and distinct functions that can be observed in the absence of Mena or other Ena/VASP proteins. Mena11a decreases the abundance of free barbed ends and the F-actin network density in lamellipodia when expressed in MV<sup>D7</sup> cells, which are otherwise Ena/VASP-deficient. Mena11a also fails to promote filopodium formation in MV<sup>D7</sup> spreading cells, a process typically enhanced by, and often dependent upon Ena/VASP proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>In addition to its unique functions, Mena11a also acts antagonistically to Mena in cells expressing both isoforms, potentially by forming mixed Mena/Mena11a heterotetramers. Using both Mena11a isoform-specific depletion and ectopic expression approaches, we found that in cells with endogenous Mena expression, Mena11a co-expression reduces the levels of F-actin barbed ends at the leading edge of lamellipodia and impairs lamellipodial protrusion and stability.</p><p>Other Mena isoforms, particularly the invasion-specific Mena<sup>INV</sup> isoform enhance growth factor elicited lamellipodial protrusion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. In contrast, dampening of elicited lamellipodial protrusion by Mena11a likely arises as a consequence of reduced actin assembly rather than dysregulated signal transduction, as acute EGF-elicited EGFR activation and downstream signaling were unaffected in Mena11a-expressing cells. Furthermore, our findings that MCF7 cells with a 11a-specific depletion exhibit increased NRG-elicited protrusion responses suggest that Mena11a is not absolutely required for signaling through the Her2/3 pathway, which mediates NRG elicited responses, as has been proposed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>.</p><p>Consistent with its enriched expression in epithelia within normal tissues, Mena11a contributes to epithelial phenotype: in epithelial-like breast cancer cells, Mena11a localizes to both tight- and adherens- junctions. Mena11a-specific knockdown perturbs E-cadherin distribution at cell:cell junctions, increases migration and membrane protrusion of MCF7 cells, and causes T47D cells to polarize and elongate, disrupting their normal epithelial cobble stone-like morphology. These data suggest a role for Mena11a in regulating the architecture and behavior of epithelial cells by supporting organized cell-cell contacts and a low migratory phenotype.</p><p>During EMT, expression of Mena11a, but not Mena, is down regulated by changes in alternative splicing programs during this complex phenotypic transition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.

We speculate Mena11a-pS3 attenuates Mena-dependent effects on actin polymerization by adding negative charge in proximity to the actin binding sites in the EVH2 domain, thus allowing specific kinase(s) to selectively regulate Mena11a. Mena11a-S3 is contained within an evolutionarily-conserved sequence that matches consensus phosphorylation motifs for both cAMP-dependent kinase PKA and for CDK5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>, which have roles in regulating actin dynamics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. The role of these and other kinases in regulating Mena11a function is a subject for further investigation; however, the presence of two additional PKA phosphorylation sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref> in the constitutive sequences contained in Mena complicates identification of Mena11a-specific kinases. Interestingly EVL, a Mena paralog, is also alternatively spliced to include a 21 amino acid insertion at an equivalent site between the F-actin binding and tetramerization sites. Although they lack sequence similarity, both inserted sequences are phosphorylated, raising the intriguing possibility that alternative splicing produces discrete pools of Ena/VASP proteins that are differentially regulated by different kinases.</p><p>To extend our understanding of Mena11a relevance to human cancer, we analyzed transcriptome data from multiple cancer cohorts in the Cancer Genome Atlas. While neither Mena nor Mena11a expression alone correlated with clinicopathological features of patients, an mRNA-based MenaCalc metric showed significant correlation with metastasis in colorectal adenocarcinoma patients. While transcriptomic data is not always a suitable surrogate for protein expression, the current results are consistent with previous work demonstrating a significant correlation between protein-based MenaCalc assessment and poor clinical outcome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. A caveat to the mRNA-based MenaCalc metric is potential stromal contamination in patient samples; in comparison, the protein-based MenaCalc metric uses cytokeratin staining to distinguish tumor and stromal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. However, the quantitative measurements for the mRNA-based MenaCalc metric bypass issues arising from signal comparison between two different primary antibodies used in the protein-based MenaCalc metric. Further analysis is necessary to better understand the specificity and sensitivity of both metrics.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings help explain why Mena11a expression promotes an epithelial phenotype and drives formation of tumors with a highly cohesive, well-differentiated appearance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.
