Vertebrates contain two closely-related paralogs with &#x0003e;75% amino acid sequence identity. Early replacement of PTBP1 by PTBP2 during neuronal differentiation causes a concerted set of splicing changes. By comparison, very little is known about the molecular functions or physiological roles of PTBP3, although its expression and conservation throughout the vertebrates suggest a role in haematopoietic cells. To begin to understand its functions we have characterized the mRNA and protein isoform repertoire of PTBP3. Combinatorial alternative splicing events at the 5&#x02032; end of the gene allow for the generation of eight mRNA and three major protein isoforms. Individual mRNAs generate up to three protein isoforms via alternative translation initiation by re-initiation and leaky scanning using downstream AUG codons. The N-terminally truncated PTBP3 isoforms lack nuclear localization signals and/or most of the RRM1 domain and vary in their RNA binding properties and nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution, suggesting that PTBP3 may have major post-transcriptional cytoplasmic roles.

RNA binding proteins are often not dedicated to a single molecular process but can regulate many of the steps in the mRNA life-cycle. Consequently, a characteristic feature of many of these multi-tasking proteins is the ability to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Some of these regulatory proteins are members of close families of paralogs, the members of which show a high degree of redundancy in function but, crucially, which also have differential activity on subsets of transcripts. Cell-type specific switching between expression of different paralogs can be used to regulate programs of post-transcriptional gene expression (reviewed in (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)). A good example of a family of nuclear and cytoplasmic multi-tasking proteins is provided by mammalian Polypyrimidine Tract Binding protein (PTBP1 also known as PTB) and its paralogs PTBP2 (also known as neuronal or brain PTB: nPTB/brPTB) and PTBP3 (also known as Regulator of Differentiation 1: ROD1).</p><p>PTBP1 was originally identified as a protein that could bind to the polypyrimidine tract at the 3&#x02032; splice site of introns (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). It was subsequently shown to be a repressive regulator of splicing (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), although more recent global analyses show that it can both repress or activate splicing dependent on its location of binding (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). PTBP1 also regulates pre-mRNA 3&#x02032; end processing and various cytoplasmic functions, including mRNA localization, stability and translation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Although the steady-state distribution of PTBP1 in many cells is predominantly nuclear, protein kinase A phosphorylation of Ser-16, which is embedded within a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) leads to a redistribution towards the cytoplasm allowing PTBP1 to regulate cytoplasmic functions (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Much is known about the role of switching between PTBP1 and PTBP2 expression during neuronal differentiation and maturation (reviewed in (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)). In non-neuronal cells, PTBP2 expression is switched off, even if the gene is transcribed, by PTBP1 induced skipping of PTBP2 exon 10, which leads to Nonsense Mediated Decay (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). During neuronal differentiation, miR124 downregulates PTBP1 expression, which in turn leads to upregulation of PTBP2 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Although the PTBP2 has similar activity to PTBP1 for many events (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), a coordinated set of splicing events are sensitive to the switch from PTBP1 to PTBP2 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Later in development, PTBP2 expression also decreases and this in turn leads to a second wave of alternative splicing changes characteristic of adult brain and essential for brain development (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>While the functions and developmental roles, particularly in neurons, of PTBP1 and PTBP2 have been well studied the third mammalian paralog, PTBP3 has been relatively neglected. Originally identified as Regulator of Differentiation 1 (ROD1 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)) it has been identified primarily in haematopoietic cells. By analogy with the key role of PTBP2 in neuronal differentiation, we expect that PTBP3 will have an important non-redundant role in the hematopoietic system. Given the high degree of amino acid identity of PTBP3 with PTBP1 and 2, it is expected to be involved in similar molecular functions. Splicing repressor activity of PTBP3 has been demonstrated upon a <italic>FAS</italic> exon 6 splicing reporter (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) while analysis of interacting proteins indicated an unexpected involvement with Nonsense Mediated Decay (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). PTBP1 and PTBP2 also cause skipping of exon 2 of PTBP3, but the functional consequences of this event have been unclear (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). When exon 2 is included, AUG1 (i.e. the first AUG triplet from the 5&#x02032; end of the transcript; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> legend for explanation of AUG numbering) in exon 1 opens a reading frame encoding a 555-amino acid protein with 76% identity to PTBP1 (Supplementary Figure S1). Skipping of the 34 nt exon 2 causes a frameshift and termination of the AUG1 reading frame after only 20 codons. Despite the fact that exon 2 skipped mRNAs have the upstream ORF (uORF) initiating at AUG1, they are not substrates for Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The annotated start codon for transcripts lacking exon 2 (e.g. ENST00000374257) is AUG4 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Indeed, western blot detection of PTBP3 showed proteins of &#x0223c;57 and 50 kDa, the larger of which could correspond to protein initiating at AUG4 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). However, the identity of the 50 kDa band is unclear and no protein of &#x0223c;60 kDa, corresponding to initiation at AUG1, was detected.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Combinatorial alternative splicing of PTBP3.

We show that complex AS at the 5&#x02032; end of <italic>PTBP3</italic> results in the generation of 8 distinct mRNA isoforms, none of which is NMD sensitive. However, the generation of uORFs results in individual mRNA isoforms that generate more than one protein isoform via translation initiation at downstream AUGs by mechanisms of re-initiation and leaky scanning. The resultant PTBP3 protein isoforms are truncated at the N-terminus, differ in the presence of the bipartite NLS and number of intact RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) domains, and in their subcellular localization and RNA binding. Strikingly, a major protein isoform initiates at AUG11, truncating RRM1; this major initiation codon has not been correctly identified in the annotated Refseq, Ensembl, or Gencode isoforms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>DNA constructs</title><p>All PTBP3 expression constructs used the pEGFP-N1 vector.

To determine the extent to which these splicing events occur in haematopoietic cells, we used primers in exons 1 and 5 to carry out RT-PCR analysis of transcripts from the human erythroleukaemia cell line, K562. Expression of 8 mRNA species was detected representing every combination of the annotated alternative splicing events (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lane 1). The alternative 5&#x02032; ss choice in exon 3 alters the transcripts by only 9 nt, whereas inclusion or skipping of exons 2 (34 nt) and/or 4 (170 nt) shifts and prematurely terminates the reading frame initiating at AUG1 in exon 1. We therefore focused on differences in splicing of exon 2 and exon 4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Full length <italic>PTBP3</italic> mRNA only comprises 10% of spliced transcripts, while transcripts with exon 2 skipped and exon 4 included were the most abundant at 48%. Transcripts with exon 4 skipped alone or in combination with exon 2 skipping comprised 13 and 29% of total mRNAs respectively. Analysis of available K562 cell mRNA-Seq datasets agreed with the RT-PCR data. Reads across exon-exon junctions show that most PTBP3 transcripts exclude exon 2, that there is roughly two-fold more use of the 3L 5&#x02032; ss of exon 3 than the 3s site, and that exon 4 is &#x0223c;80% included (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Moreover the RNAseq data shows no further major alternative splicing events downstream of exon 5. Despite the complexity of expressed mRNA isoforms, we detected only two major protein isoforms of &#x0223c;48 and 57 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, lane 4), similar to earlier reports (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>To examine the extent of crossregulation of <italic>PTBP3</italic> splicing, we looked for changes in splicing upon PTBP1/PTBP2 knockdown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">D</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">E</xref>). Upon knockdown of PTBP1, we observed upregulation of PTBP2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, lanes 4,5), demonstrating that the PTBP1 crossregulation of PTBP2 also occurs in K562 cells. Indeed, analysis of <italic>PTBP2</italic> RNA showed an increase in exon 10 inclusion from 30 to 90% upon PTBP1 knockdown (Supplementary Figure S2). Upon combined PTBP1/PTBP2 knockdown, inclusion of <italic>PTBP3</italic> exon 2 increased from 23 to 84%. In contrast, splicing of exon 4 and use of the downstream 5&#x02032; ss in exon 3 did not change significantly, remaining around 60 and 64% respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">D</xref>). Therefore PTBP1 and PTBP2 regulate splicing of exon 2, but not the other splicing events in <italic>PTBP3</italic>. Western blot analysis showed the appearance of a larger PTBP3 protein isoform of &#x0223c;60 kDa upon PTBP1/PTBP2 knockdown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, lanes 5,8). This band, which was undetectable under control conditions (lane 4) represented &#x0223c;1% of total PTBP3 upon PTBP1 knockdown (lane 5) and 16% upon PTBP1/PTBP2 knockdown (lane 8). Knockdown of PTBP3 alone or in combination with PTBP1 and/or PTBP2 confirmed that the 48, 57 and 60 kDa isoforms are PTBP3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, lanes 6, 7, 9). The size of the 60 kDa isoform is consistent with translation of the exon 2 included <italic>PTBP3</italic> mRNA using AUG1 as the initiating codon. Knockdown of PTBP3 had no effect upon expression of either PTBP1 or PTBP2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> lanes 6, 7; note that the apparent increase in PTBP1 levels in lane 6 was not observed in other experiments).</p><p>Skipping of exon 2 (34 nt) and/or exon 4 (170 nt) results in frameshift and introduction of a premature termination codon in the reading frame initiating at AUG1. However, exon 2 and exon 4 skipped transcripts were not stabilized upon UPF1 knockdown indicating that they are not NMD-sensitive (Supplementary Figure S3), in contrast to the regulated splicing events in <italic>PTBP1</italic> and <italic>PTBP2</italic> (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>PTBP3 protein isoforms arise from initiation at alternative AUGs</title><p>The preceding results raise questions about the relationship between the observed PTBP3 mRNA and protein isoforms, as well as the nature of the crossregulatory network between PTBP1, PTBP2 and PTBP3. The predicted translation products from the differentially spliced PTBP3 mRNA transcripts are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. ORFs that can potentially produce PTBP3 proteins are shown in black and uORFs in grey. Only the longest mRNA isoform containing exon 2 and 4 has a PTBP3 encoding ORF commencing at AUG1 in exon 1. For all other isoforms, AUG1 initiates a uORF and potential PTBP3 encoding ORFs initiate at AUGs 4, 10, 11 and 12. Note that the AUGs are numbered according to their location in the longest mRNA isoform, although AUGs 6&#x02013;10 are in exon 4 and so are missing in exon 4 skipped mRNA isoforms. AUG1 is in a good Kozak consensus (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>), is present in all mRNA isoforms and would be expected to be recognized by a scanning 43S initiation complex. Initiation at the downstream AUGs could occur by leaky scanning or translational re-initiation (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Alternative 5&#x02032; ss choice at exon 3, alters the coding sequence by 9 nt, preserving the reading frame and inserting a GVY tripeptide into PTBP3 isoforms initiating at AUG1 or 4. However, when exon 4 is skipped, AUG5, which lies between the two 5&#x02032; ss of exon 3, could potentially initiate a PTBP3 encoding ORF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">D</xref>).

Consistent with this, mutation of AUG1 to UUG1 resulted in complete loss of the larger band and exclusive production of a protein corresponding in size to the previously minor species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These observations agree with the predictions that full length 60 kDa PTBP3 protein is produced from AUG1 in the full length mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Interestingly, the exon 2 skipped construct produced three PTBP3 proteins, the smallest of which was the major product (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane 2, 3C, lane 1, PTBP3&#x00394;2). A series of AUG to UUG mutations pinpointed the initiation codons associated with each of the three proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). The UUG4 mutation abolished the largest band and led to increased amounts of both smaller bands (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, lane 2). This indicates that the largest band arises from initiation at AUG4, consistent with its comigration with the minor AUG4 product from FL PTBP3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lanes 1,2). The minor, intermediate sized band was abolished by the UUG10 mutation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> lane 3) while the most abundant and most rapidly migrating band was abolished by the UUG11 mutation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> lane 4). Concomitant with disappearance of the AUG11 band, a new slightly smaller band appeared in the UUG11 mutant. This was shown to arise from initiation at AUG12 by a double UUG11/UUG12 mutant in which both the AUG11 and AUG12 bands disappeared (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> lane 6). In contrast, the UUG12 mutation alone had no effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, lane 5). These data demonstrate that the most abundant PTBP3 mRNA isoform in K562 cells (PTBP3&#x00394;2) is able to produce the two major 57 and &#x0223c;48 kDa isoforms, as well as a third minor isoform. The only protein isoform that it is unable to generate is the 60 kDa protein initiating at AUG1. Moreover, these data confirm that the PTBP3 isoforms arise from translation initiation at alternative AUGs rather than from protein cleavage.</p><p>Further mutations were used to examine the possible translation initiation mechanism in the exon 2 skipped construct. Strikingly, AUG1 to UUG1 mutation in the PTBP3&#x00394;2 construct abolished the AUG10 and AUG11 proteins, with the major product now initiating at AUG4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> lanes 1,2, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In contrast placing AUG1 in a perfect Kozak consensus (cAUG1, <underline>uggg</underline>ccAUGga to <underline>gcca</underline>ccAUGga) eliminated expression of the AUG4 isoform while leaving expression of the AUG11 isoform intact (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, lane 3 and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Taken together the data in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> indicates that the AUG10 and 11 products arise from re-initiation after translation of the AUG1 uORF while the AUG4 isoform arises from leaky scanning past AUG1 (summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><p>The exon 4 skipped isoform showed very low levels of expression, with exclusive production of the AUG11 protein isoform (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, PTBP3&#x00394;4). The long AUG1 uORF in PTBP3&#x00394;4 overlaps with AUG11 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), excluding the possibility of re-initiation after the AUG1 uORF (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Mutation of AUG1 to a perfect Kozak consensus eliminated AUG11 expression, consistent with a leaky scanning mechanism to locate AUG11 in PTBP3&#x00394;4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>, lane 2). In contrast, the double exon 2, exon 4 skipped PTBP3&#x00394;2&#x00394;4 construct showed efficient and almost exclusive expression of the AUG11 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lane 4). The combined skipping of exon 2 and exon 4 puts AUG1 in the same reading frame with the remainder of PTBP3. Consistent with the idea that AUG11 use results from reinitiation after the AUG1 uORF, mutation of the stop codon of the AUG1 uORF allowed expression exclusively of PTBP3 protein from AUG1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>, fAUG1). This was confirmed by a double mutations in the start and stop codons of the AUG1 uORF, which produced exclusively the AUG11 isoform (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>, fUUG1).</p><p>Taken together, the data of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> show that the major PTBP3 isoforms in K562 cells arise from translation of mRNAs with exon 2 skipping, with initiation at AUG4 and 11, and minor amounts of an AUG10 isoform. Only the FL mRNA isoform with exons 2 and 4 included gives rise to a 60 kDa PTBP3 protein initiating at AUG1. The use of these AUGs and no others is consistent with their Kozak sequence contexts (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). The mutational analysis here indicates that re-initiation and leaky scanning are the major mechanisms that allow expression of the smaller AUG11 and AUG4 PTBP3 isoforms in the exon 2 and 4 skipped mRNAs.</p><p>Having characterized the nature of the PTBP3 isoforms, we were next interested in the possible functional differences. The AUG1 isoform aligns well throughout its length with PTBP1 and PTBP2 (Supplementary Figure S1), while initiation at AUG4 and 11 causes N-terminal truncations that might be expected to alter some functions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The AUG4 isoform lacks 31 N-terminal residues including part of the bipartite NLS (K<sub>14</sub>R<sub>15</sub>) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), as well serine-17, which in PTBP1 is phosphorylated by protein kinase A shifting localization to the cytoplasm (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Initiation at AUG11 has even more dramatic consequences, deleting 103 N-terminal amino acids including the entire N-terminal leader and most of RRM1. Only &#x003b1; helix 2 and &#x003b2; strand 4 of RRM1 remain, so this isoform might be expected to show differences in RNA binding as well as localization.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>RNA binding by PTBP3 isoforms</title><p>To investigate possible differences in RNA binding of the PTBP3 isoforms we prepared recombinant proteins by expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>. RNA binding by all three PTBP3 isoforms was readily detected by UV-crosslinking to a probe from MTDH exon 7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lanes 1, 11, 12, 22, 23, 33)(<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The intensity of UV cross-linking by the AUG11 isoform was greater than that of AUG1 and 4. However, this could be related to differential efficiency of photochemistry rather than real differences in binding. To obtain a semi-quantitative comparison of binding by the three PTBP3 isoforms, we carried out competitive UV-crosslinking with cross-titrations of each pairwise combination of PTBP3 isoforms, maintaining a constant total concentration of PTBP3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The relative crosslinking signal was normalized to the maximum signal for each isoform, to account for any isoform-specific variation in crosslinking efficiency. At the midpoint of the cross-titration the concentration of each isoform is equal (dotted line). Therefore if the crosslinking signal favours one of the isoforms then that protein has higher affinity for the RNA. The most striking observation was that the AUG11 isoform, which lacks most of RRM1, showed no deficiency in crosslinking. Indeed AUG11 crosslinked with higher efficiency than AUG4 and with equal efficiency to the AUG1 isoform.</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>RNA binding and chymoytryptic sensitivity of PTBP3 isoforms.

For these assays we directly compared PTBP3 AUG4 and AUG11 isoforms; we were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of purified AUG1 protein for the full range of comparisons. We also tested an artificial PTBP3 deletion mutant completely lacking RRM1. In agreement with the UV competition cross-linking (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), the AUG11 isoform had a significantly lower <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> than AUG4 for binding to MTDH exon 7 and to PV IRES (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). For the other two RNAs the dissociation constants for the two isoforms were not significantly different. In comparison with the &#x00394;RRM1 protein, AUG11 had significantly lower <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> for binding to MTDH exon 7 and [CUCUCU]<sub>4</sub>, suggesting that the residual part of RRM1 plays a role in RNA binding. The affinities of the &#x00394;RRM1 and AUG11 proteins for the PV IRES were similar, and both had significantly lower <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>s than AUG4. Therefore, for some RNAs, as exemplified by PV IRES, a partial or complete lack of RRM1 leads to higher affinity binding. In contrast, for MTDH exon 7, the AUG11 isoform binds with higher affinity than either AUG4 (with intact RRM1) or &#x00394;RRM1.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Dissociation constants for binding of PTBP3 proteins to different RNAs</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RNA</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AUG4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AUG11</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00394;RRM1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MTDH exon 7</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" rowspan="1" colspan="1">91.5 &#x000b1; 6.6 nM</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.2 &#x000b1; 3.8 nM</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" rowspan="1" colspan="1">91.1 &#x000b1; 4.7 nM</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">[CUCUCU]<sub>4</sub></td><td align="char" char="plusmn" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34.8 &#x000b1; 7.8 nM</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43.7 &#x000b1; 4.8 nM</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" rowspan="1" colspan="1">75.8 &#x000b1; 11.9 nM</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PV IRES</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44.1 &#x000b1; 2.0 nM</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.4 &#x000b1; 5.5 nM</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.6 &#x000b1; 4.7 nM</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EMCV IRES</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.4 &#x000b1; 1.3 nM</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.3 &#x000b1; 0.6 nM</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.5 &#x000b1; 1.1 nM</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">B</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RNA</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AUG4 versus AUG11</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AUG11 versus &#x00394;RRM1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AUG4 versus &#x00394;RRM1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MTDH exon 7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.003</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.001</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.932</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">[CUCUCU]<sub>4</sub></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.169</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.012</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.008</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PV IRES</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.004</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.955</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EMCV IRES</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.083</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.051</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.965</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TFN001"><p><bold>A</bold>; Average Kd &#x000b1; standard deviation. <bold>B</bold>; Statistical significance of difference in binding between pairs of PTBP3 proteins. <italic>P</italic>-values calculated using a Student's <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The higher affinity of AUG11 for some RNAs compared to either AUG4 or &#x00394;RRM1, suggested that the residual part of RRM1 might be able to fold in some way so as to promote RNA binding. As an initial step to probe the structure of the AUG11 protein we carried out limited chymotryptic digestion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Chymotrypsin cleaves adjacent to the aromatic side-chains of tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine. In natively folded globular domains, most of these residues are buried and inaccessible. However, residues in unstructured regions will be accessible for recognition by chymotrypsin. Consistent with this expectation limited treatment of PTBP3 AUG4 with chymotrypsin led to preferential cleavage in the N-terminal leader sequence (Y42/F51, band A) and in the linker between RRMs 2 and 3 (F298, Y308, F314, F320, bands C, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;8). There was no evidence of cleavage within any of the RRM domains. The AUG 11 isoform also showed the cleavages between RRMs 2 and 3 (bands &#x02018;C&#x02019;, lanes 9&#x02013;16). However, AUG11 was also cleaved at positions corresponding to Y116, Y117, Y130 and Y133 in the residual part of RRM1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> lanes 9&#x02013;16, band &#x02018;B&#x02019;). These residues were not accessible in AUG4, where RRM1 is intact, as shown by the lack of band B in lanes 1&#x02013;7. These data suggest that the residual part of RRM1 in the AUG11 isoform does not adopt a stable fold in which the tyrosine residues are inaccessible to chymotrypsin. We considered the possibility that AUG11 might undergo a conformational change upon RNA binding. However, addition of excess [CUCUU]<sub>8</sub> RNA had no effect upon the chymotryptic sensitivity of AUG11 (Supplementary Figure S5).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-4"><title>Localization and splicing activity of PTBP3 protein isoforms</title><p>The AUG4 and AUG11 PTBP3 isoforms both lack the first half of the bipartite NLS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, Supplementary Figure S1). To test whether this affects their localization we used fluorescence microscopy of HeLa cells transfected with expression constructs for GFP-fusions of the PTBP3 isoforms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, GFP) and compared this to endogenous PTBP1 by immunofluorescence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, PTBP1). Full length PTBP3-AUG1 was predominantly nuclear, similar to endogenous PTBP1. However, both PTBP3-AUG4 and PTBP3-AUG11 showed substantial accumulation in the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, middle and lower rows). Western blots of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions also showed that full length PTBP3-AUG1 was predominantly nuclear, while PTBP3-AUG4 and PTBP3-AUG11 showed an even nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). The difference in localization between the isoforms is most likely due to the lack of a complete NLS in the AUG4 and 11 isoforms. We next analysed the nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of PTBP1 and PTBP3 in K562 cells by western blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). While PTBP1 showed the expected predominant nuclear localization, both the AUG4 and AUG11 isoforms of PTBP3 showed a more even distribution between nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Thus, the PTBP3 AUG4 and AUG11 isoforms endogenous to K562 cells show a similar cellular distribution to the transfected constructs in HeLa cells. To analyse the localization of PTBP3 and PTBP1 in a more physiological context, we turned to mouse B-cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">F</xref>). Western blots indicated that B cells contained higher overall levels of PTBP3 than K562 cells (2.4&#x02013;2.7-fold higher, normalized to GAPDH, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Moreover, while the AUG1 isoform was undetectable in K562 cells, it represented 24% of PTBP3 in B-cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Consistent with this, mRNA-Seq data showed that levels of both exon 2 and exon 4 inclusion are higher in B-cells than K562 (Supplementary Figure S6). In contrast, the levels of PTBP1 in B-cells were 70% of the levels in K562 (normalized to GAPDH). Immunofluorescence analysis of mouse B-cells indicated that PTBP1 was restricted to the nuclei of mouse B-cells, but PTBP3 was observed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). Examination of nuclear and cytoplasmic enriched fractions from mouse B-cells by western blots (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>) also indicated that a higher proportion of cytoplasmic PTBP3 than PTBP1. Moreover, the full length AUG1 isoform represented 36% of nuclear PTBP3, but 24% of the cytoplasmic fraction.</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Localization of PTBP3 isoforms.

Since it has been previously shown that the suboptimal codon content of PTBP3 limits expression in our assays, similar to PTBP2 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), the GFP-PTBP3 constructs contained a codon optimized sequence for efficient mammalian expression. As a result, all the proteins were expressed to similar levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). When transfected into HEK-293T cells the <italic>FAS</italic> reporter RNA produces &#x0223c;50% exon 6 inclusion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, lane 1). All of the PTBP1 and PTBP3 isoforms showed splicing repressor activity, increasing exon 6 skipping. However, the PTBP3-AUG11 isoform was slightly weaker than the AUG1 or AUG4 isoforms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, lanes 4&#x02013;6). The lower activity of the AUG11 isoform could be due to reduced nuclear localization. Tagging the PTBP3 isoforms with an additional NLS to direct nuclear localization removed the differences in activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, compare lanes 4&#x02013;6 and 8&#x02013;10), suggesting that in this assay the lower activity of the AUG11 isoform is primarily associated with its localization. The PTBP1 and PTBP3 isoforms showed a very similar trend in activity for the regulation of MTDH exon 7 (Supplementary Figure S7). To directly compare the splicing repressor activity of the PTBP3 isoforms with PTBP1 we carried out <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing of a <italic>FAS</italic> exon 5&#x02013;6&#x02013;7 construct in HeLa nuclear extract (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).

The PTBP3 AUG4 and AUG11 isoforms showed identical repressor activity (lanes 6&#x02013;13, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.37 for all comparisons at the same concentration). We also tested an artificial PTBP3 mutant that completely lacks RRM1. This protein also had identical activity to the natural PTBP3 isoforms, showing that RRM1 is dispensable for regulation of <italic>FAS</italic> splicing.

The original report of PTBP3 (then named ROD1) identified the AUG4 isoform as the likely protein product of an mRNA with exon 2 skipped but exon 4 included, and noted that the N-terminus was truncated compared to PTBP1 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). How AUG4 would be selected for translation initiation, despite the presence of AUG1 in a good Kozak consensus context, was not addressed. Western blots also identified a protein of 50 kDa, but its nature was unclear. Our data show that the 50 kDa protein arises from translation initiation at AUG11 to yield a protein with a truncated RRM1. Notably, although this is the most abundant PTBP3 isoform in K562 and HeLa cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, Supplementary Figure S4) AUG11 has not been annotated as a start codon in any REFSEQ or ENSEMBL isoforms. We also show that a full length PTBP3 protein, corresponding throughout its length to isoform 4 of PTBP1 (Supplementary Figure S1) is the sole translational product of full length PTBP3 mRNA containing exons 2 and 4. This protein is not usually evident in cultured cells such as K562 or HeLa due to the repressive influence of PTBP1 upon PTBP3 exon 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Supplementary Figure S2)(<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, in mouse B-cells, where PTBP1 levels were lower, the AUG1 PTBP3 was readily detectable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). All of the PTBP3 mRNA isoforms contain AUG1 in exon 1. Selection of the AUG4 and AUG11 initiation codons therefore occurs by a mixture of mechanisms other than conventional cap-dependent scanning. Leaky scanning to allow use of AUG4 in FL and &#x00394;2 PTBP3 and of AUG11 in the &#x00394;4 PTBP3 mRNAs was demonstrated by suppression of these products when the AUG1 consensus was improved to a perfect Kozak context. Most of the AUG11 product is produced via reinitiation after translation of uORFs initiating at AUG1 as indicated by the deleterious effects of mutating AUG1. The influences of uORFs as regulators of gene expression (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and of the short peptides encoded by them (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) are increasingly appreciated. The relative importance of the non-conventional mechanisms for translation of AUG4 and 11 PTBP3 isoforms for quantitative regulation of translation, compared to the intrinsic functional differences of the PTBP3 protein isoforms remains to be established.</p><p>We examined potential functional differences between the three PTBP3 isoforms, including RNA binding (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), localization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) and splicing regulation of <italic>FAS</italic> exon 6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The clearest observed difference was in the higher degree of cytoplasmic localization of AUG4 and 11 compared with AUG1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), consistent with truncation of the NLS (Supplementary Figure S1). Surprisingly, the truncation of RRM1 in the AUG11 PTBP3 did not impair binding to several RNA substrates and was actually associated with higher affinity binding to some RNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>), and unimpaired splicing regulatory activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, Supplementary Figure S7). The lack of effect on regulation of <italic>FAS</italic> exon 6 splicing was surprising given that point mutations that impaired RNA contact by RRM1 of PTBP1 led to a &#x0223c;50% loss of activity (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The relatively mild consequences of RRM1 truncation in PTBP3 AUG11 contrast with the severely impaired RNA binding and dominant negative function of an isoform of RbFox2 with a truncation of its single RRM domain (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>A clearer view of the functional differences between PTBP3 isoforms requires better knowledge of the cellular functions and molecular targets of PTBP3. Our analyses were based on the expectation, informed by the high level of sequence identity (Supplementary Figure S1) that PTBP3 will play similar roles to PTBP1 in regulation of splicing in the nucleus. The greater cytoplasmic accumulation of the AUG4 and AUG11 PTBP3 isoforms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) suggest that it might have even more prominent cytoplasmic roles in mRNA stability and translation than PTBP1 (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Moreover, by analogy with the unique non-redundant roles of PTBP2 in neurons (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), we expect that PTBP3 will also have unique specialized roles, presumably in cells of the haematopoietic system. In an initial screen for endogenous PTBP3 targets in K562 cells, we tested the response of 17 known PTBP1 targets (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) to knockdown of PTBP3, alone or in combination with PTBP1 and PTBP2 (Supplementary Figure S8, Supplementary Table S1). Only three events responded to PTBP3 knockdown, including MTDH exon 7 (Supplementary Figure S7), although in each case the magnitude of change was small. In a further unbiased attempt to identify PTBP3 functions in splicing and translation regulation in K562 cells, we analysed the global consequences of PTBP3 knockdown using splice sensitive HJAY microarrays (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and the polyosome:monosome ratio of cytoplasmic mRNAs. However, we found no significant changes in transcript levels, alternative splicing or polysome loading (PW and CWJS, unpublished observation). PTBP3 was reported to influence NMD in HEK293 cells (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, we observed no changes in transcript levels that would be consistent with such a role in K562 cells. Our data therefore indicates that PTBP3 does not play an important non-redundant role in K562 cells, despite the similar levels of PTBP1 and PTBP3 mRNAs and the readily detectable PTBP3 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)). Consistent with this, western blots with reference recombinant PTBP1 and PTBP3 protein, indicated that PTBP1 is present at levels &#x0223c;20-fold higher than PTBP3 in K562 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>)).</p><p>A recently published &#x02018;draft map&#x02019; of the human proteome indicated that PTBP3 is most highly expressed in B-cells and T-cells (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), with relatively lower levels of PTBP1 and 2 in B-cells. In agreement with this, we observed higher levels of PTBP3 relative to PTBP1 in B-cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Moreover, the high levels of the full length AUG1 PTBP3 isoform (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>), indicate relaxation of the PTBP1 repression of full-length PTBP3 isoform expression. This suggests that PTBP3 plays important non-redundant roles in B-cells. We are currently in the process of generating mice in which PTBP3 can be conditionally ablated in lymphoid cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data on the diversity of PTBP3 mRNA isoforms and the ways in which they can initiate translation has been informative in developing a strategy for design of a PTBP3 knockout that should lack the ability to generate any functional proteins. The phenotypes of these mice should indicate the cell-types and developmental stages at which PTBP3 plays key non-redundant roles. We will then be better placed to examine in detail the functional differences in the isoforms of PTBP3.</p><p>PTBP1 and 2 both promote skipping of PTBP3 exon 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), but unlike the regulated splicing events in PTBP1 (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and PTBP2 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), this splicing event does not downregulate PTBP3 mRNA levels (Supplementary Figure S3). Translation initiation by leaky scanning and/or reinitiation is expected to be less efficient than scanning to the cap-proximal AUG (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Nevertheless, it is notable that PTBP1/PTBP2 knockdown led to the appearance of the full length AUG1 PTBP3 isoform without a major increase in the quantity of PTBP3 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This suggests that other post-transcriptional mechanisms might operate to limit the expression of PTBP3 outside the appropriate cell type. These mechanisms might include the influence of micro-RNAs, the suboptimal codon content of PTBP3 (mammalian expression constructs used here were codon optimized, as had previously been carried out for PTBP2 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)), and also its GC-rich 5&#x02032; UTR, which contains predicted G-quadruplex structures which can render translation particularly sensitive to the availability of helicases (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Future investigations will focus on both the physiological roles of PTBP3 as well as the various ways in which its expression is regulated. Finally, although the PTBP1/PTBP2 regulated splicing of PTBP3 does not act as an ON/OFF switch, it will be interesting to investigate the extent to which this event is a target of other splicing regulators in lymphoid cell splicing regulatory networks (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). We anticipate that a change in the balance of PTBP3 versus PTBP1 activity will play an important role in lymphoid cell physiology perhaps analogous to the interplay between hnRNPL and hnRNPLL during T-cell activation (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SEC5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkv429/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p>
