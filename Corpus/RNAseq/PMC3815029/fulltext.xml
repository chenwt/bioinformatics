The intracellular bacterial pathogen <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (<italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium) is known to regulate expression of some sRNAs during colonization of fibroblasts. Here, we characterize a previously unknown sRNA encoded in the <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium pSLT virulence plasmid that is specifically up-regulated by non-growing dormant bacteria persisting inside fibroblasts. This sRNA was inferred in microarray expression analyses, which unraveled enhanced transcriptional activity in the <italic>PSLT047- PSLT046</italic> (<italic>mig5</italic>) intergenic region. The sRNA transcript was further identified as a 597-nucleotide molecule, which we named IesR-1, for &#x02018;<underline>I</underline>ntracellular-<underline>e</underline>xpressed-<underline>sR</underline>NA-1&#x02032;. IesR-1 expression is low in bacteria growing in axenic cultures across a variety of experimental conditions but displays a marked increase (&#x0223c;200&#x02013;300 fold) following bacterial entry into fibroblasts. Remarkably, induction of IesR-1 expression is not prominent in bacteria proliferating within epithelial cells. IesR-1 deletion affects the control of bacterial growth in defined fibroblast cell lines and impairs virulence in a mouse infection model. Expression analyses performed in the <italic>PSLT047-iesR-1</italic>-<italic>PSLT046</italic> (<italic>mig5</italic>) region support a <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory mechanism of IesR-1 as antisense RNA over the <italic>PSLT047</italic> transcript involving interaction at their respective 3&#x02032; ends and modulation of PSLT047 protein levels. This model is sustained by the scarce production of PSLT047 protein observed in non-growing intracellular bacteria and the high amount of PSLT047 protein produced by bacteria carrying a truncated IesR-1 version with separated 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; regions. Taken together, these data reveal that <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium sRNAs encoded in the pSLT virulence plasmid respond to a state of persistence inside the host cell. As exemplified by IesR-1, some of these sRNAs may contribute to diminish the relative levels of proteins, such as PSLT047, which are probably dispensable for the intracellular lifestyle.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants BIO2010-18885 and Consolider-CSD2008-00013-INTERMODS from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; and, PIE-201320E020 from the &#x02018;Agencia Estatal CSIC&#x02019; (to F.G.-P.).

Computational algorithms designed for sRNA discovery in bacteria have mainly relied on the search within IGRs for conserved, relatively short sequences, flanked by orphan promoters and Rho-independent terminators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Hershberg1">[4]</xref>. Direct cloning of small RNAs and high-density microarray and RNA-seq approaches have unraveled the sRNAome of different bacterial species, including pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Ferrara1">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Vogel1">[9]</xref>. sRNAs can interact to either nucleic acid-binding proteins modulating their regulatory activity by titration or to target mRNAs by direct base-pairing complementarity. The latter include <italic>cis</italic>-acting sRNAs, codified in the same genetic region but in antisense orientation to their target mRNAs and <italic>trans</italic>-acting sRNAs, which are transcribed elsewhere in the chromosome and require the RNA chaperone Hfq to assist sRNA binding to multiple mRNA targets. Target sites in <italic>trans</italic>-regulated mRNAs have been most often found in the 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) of the transcript. This binding results in the modulation (positive or negative) of the mRNA stability and/or translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Waters1">[1]</xref>.</p><p>sRNAs have been identified in intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella enterica, Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, among others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-ToledoArana2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Arnvig1">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Santiviago1">[15]</xref>. These pathogens reprogram the transcriptome/proteome to successfully survive in the harsh environment encountered within host cells. Transcriptional reprogramming involves adaptive mechanisms, including adjustment of the sRNAs levels. A recent study has shown increased expression of defined sRNAs in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) when this pathogen invade fibroblasts, a host cell type in which intracellular bacteria establish a non-proliferative state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Ortega1">[16]</xref>. Induction of sRNAs by intracellular S. Typhimurium has also been reported in macrophage-like cells, as it is the case of OxyS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-PadalonBrauch1">[17]</xref>, an sRNA previously shown to be up-regulated in response to oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Altuvia1">[18]</xref>. Although most mutants lacking defined sRNAs often show mild phenotypes, a few sRNA-defective mutants display impaired virulence in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Gong1">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Mann1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Santiviago1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Mraheil1">[19]</xref>. Mutants lacking IsrM are impaired for invasion of epithelial cells and exhibit reduced proliferation in macrophage-like cells. The absence of IsrM also affects the capacity of S. Typhimurium to growth in mouse organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Gong1">[11]</xref>. It is also known that mutants defective in IstR or SroA exhibit reduced fitness in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Santiviago1">[15]</xref>. Mechanistically, the sRNA IsrM affects post-transcriptionally the expression of the virulence factor HilE and the secreted effector SopA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Gong1">[11]</xref>. Decreased translocation of the protein effector SptP into epithelial cells was also linked to a defect in the sRNA IsrJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-PadalonBrauch1">[17]</xref>. Whether additional S. Typhimurium sRNAs contribute to other aspects of the host-pathogen interplay, such as that occurring during non-proliferative persistent infections, is at present unknown.</p><p>Some pathogens have developed strategies to undergo a persistent infection in specific host cell types, which allow them to evade host immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Blaser1">[20]</xref>. In humans, some intracellular pathogens as <italic>S. enterica</italic> serovar Typhi, <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis,</italic> are prone to cause this type of infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Monack1">[21]</xref>. <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium is a suitable model for persistent infection given the ability of this pathogen to cause chronic infections in resistant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Broz1">[22]</xref>. Recent work has shown that <italic>S</italic>.

This study demonstrated that some sRNAs are specifically expressed along the intracellular infection process. Whether some of these sRNA play a dedicated role in modulating growth of the pathogen inside the host cell has not been yet interrogated.</p><p>The genome of the <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium virulent strain SL1344 comprises a 4.9 Mb chromosome and a 94 Kb virulence plasmid named pSLT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Kroger1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-McClelland1">[25]</xref>. Genetic mobile elements, including plasmids, frequently comprise non-coding RNA loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Thomason1">[26]</xref>.

Conjugal transfer of pSLT is also controlled by a <italic>cis</italic>-acting sRNA, namely FinP, which negatively regulates translation of the adjacent <italic>traJ</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Koraimann1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Frost1">[29]</xref>. Most studies on sRNAs have been however conducted in the chromosome, overlooking the possible presence of these molecules in the virulence plasmid. A notable exception was a comprehensive RNAseq study focused in deciphering the transcriptional map of <italic>Salmonella</italic> plasmids during the early stationary phase of growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Kroger1">[6]</xref>. The expression of these RNAs during infection conditions was, however, not examined.</p><p>In this work, we searched for novel sRNAs in the <italic>Salmonella</italic> virulence plasmid pSLT using microarray data obtained from intracellular bacteria that colonize fibroblasts. We selected a novel sRNA exhibiting significant expression in non-growing intracellular wild type bacteria. Further analysis of the locus displaying such transcriptional activity revealed the presence of an antisense sRNA positioned between <italic>PSLT047</italic> and <italic>PSLT046</italic> (<italic>mig5</italic>) genes. The expression of this sRNA, which we named IesR-1, for &#x02018;<underline>I</underline>ntracellular-<underline>e</underline>xpressed-<underline>sR</underline>NA-1&#x02032;, was low in most of the laboratory growth conditions tested while increased dramatically in non-growing intracellular bacteria. Manipulation of the relative levels of IesR-1 also led to alteration of virulence in the mouse typhoid model. Collectively, the data obtained in this work support a model involving a <italic>cis</italic>-acting mechanism of IesR-1 over <italic>PSLT047</italic> with interaction at their respective 3&#x02032; ends, a phenomenon that could modulate PSLT047 translation.

Circular RACE involves T4-mediated RNA self-ligation followed an RT-PCR using gene-specific outwards primers. RNA samples were treated or not with the Tobbaco Acid Pyrophosphatase (TAP), which specifically cleaves the pyrophosphate bond of the 5&#x02032;-terminal resulting in a 5&#x02032;-monophosphorylated terminus that may be ligated to a 3&#x02032;-hydroxylated terminus using T4 RNA ligase. This procedure distinguishes primary transcripts, the targets of the TAP, respect processed monophosphorylated RNAs. Thus, primary RNA species are enriched in the TAP&#x02212; treated RNA fraction as compared to the non-treated when assessing RT-PCR products in RACE assays. The method was used in this work with the following modifications. Briefly, reactions were performed on RNAs extracted from bacteria grown in LB until OD at 600 nm reached a value of 0.2. Six &#x000b5;g of RNA were treated with Turbo DNA free (Life Technologies) to avoid any false positive products. The RNA was divided in two aliquots. Both aliquots were incubated for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C with the corresponding buffer in presence or absence of TAP (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) respectively.

Besides non-growing intracellular bacteria, a sample consisting of bacteria grown to stationary phase in LB broth was included to distinguish transcriptional profiles linked genuinely to the &#x02018;non-proliferative intracellular lifestyle&#x02019;.

The PSLT046 protein, of 246 aa, has a transmembrane region and is predicted to contain a &#x02018;carbonic anhydrase&#x02019; domain (Pro_CA, Pfam PF00484). Like in PSLT047, the function of PSLT046 remains unknown. Interestingly, the CNB1344-0995 probe was designed to hybridize with a molecule transcribed from the strand complementary to that containing <italic>PSLT046</italic> and <italic>PSLT047</italic>. The genomic organization of this locus therefore rules out the possibility that the detected transcript signal of the CNB1344-0995 probe could derive from a long UTR from the flanking genes. To precisely depict the transcriptional map of the <italic>PSLT047</italic>-<italic>PSLT046</italic>(<italic>mig5</italic>) region, we used a modified version of the method involving Rapid-amplification of cDNAs ends (RACE), so-called &#x02018;circular RACE&#x02019;, which allows simultaneous identification of 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends within the same RNA molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-ToledoArana2">[8]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, see Material and Methods for details).

For the <italic>PSLT046</italic> (<italic>mig5</italic>) gene, most of the sequenced clones corresponded to a 960 nt mRNA while a longer version that spanned until coordinates 56.7 kb of the pSLT plasmid was identified in a few remaining clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). For the <italic>PSLT047</italic> gene and the putative sRNA encoded in the IGR-0995, several clones whose sequences differed in the 3&#x02032; end were characterized, being the longest of these sequences of 740- and 597-nt, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The majority of the sequenced clones covered the non-overlapping sequence of these two transcripts. In turn, the sequence coverage of the overlapping region in the sequenced clones of both genes (<italic>PSLT047</italic> and that encoding the putative new sRNA) progressively decreased at their respective 3&#x02032; ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). This result could not be ascribed to the processivity of the reverse transcriptase or the natural instability of the 3&#x02032;-end of bacterial transcripts as longer transcripts could be accurately mapped in the same assay [see PSLT048 (<italic>tlpA</italic>) and <italic>PSLT046</italic> (<italic>mig5</italic>) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g001">Figure 1D</xref>]. A closer analysis to the IGR-0995 sequence predicted at the 5&#x02032; end a sigma-70 dependent promoter that partially overlaps with the predicted promoter of <italic>PSLT046</italic> (<italic>mig5</italic>) and a stem-loop structure compatible with a Rho-independent terminator at the 3&#x02032; end of this putative sRNA (data not shown). Bioinformatics tools as Translate or ORFinder predict in the 597 nt sequence of IGR-0995 two ORFs encoding hypothetical polypeptides of 46 and 52 aa (data not shown). Putative Shine-Dalgarno sites of low score precede these two ORFs and BLAST searches reveal that none of these two polypeptides has homologs in databases (data not shown).

NRK-49F rat fibroblasts, the host cells in which the Salgenomics microarray was used to obtain genome expression data of non-growing dormant intracellular bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-NunezHernandez1">[23]</xref>, were infected to that purpose. Intracellular bacteria were collected at 1, 8 and 24 h post-infection and the transcript levels measured by RT-qPCR. IesR-1 levels increased notoriously upon infection of NRK-49F cells compared to the bacteria of the inoculum used to infect the fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Such induction became remarkably conspicuous as the infection progressed, showing an increase of &#x0223c;300-fold at 24 h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Such exacerbated expression of IesR-1 was also observed in non-growing bacteria persisting within BJ5-ta human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The pronounced expression of IesR-1 in intracellular bacteria was also corroborated by Northern blot analysis, which demonstrated the presence of two IesR-1 transcripts, of &#x0223c;600 nt and &#x0223c;275 nt, exclusively in samples prepared from intracellular bacteria at 24 h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). To differentiate whether the up-regulation of IesR-1 in non-growing dormant intracellular bacteria was linked to this particular physiological state of the pathogen or to the host cell type that was infected, IesR-1 expression was monitored in the <italic>phoP</italic> mutant overgrowing in fibroblasts and in wild-type bacteria proliferating within HeLa epithelial cells. In none of these two cases a pronounced up-regulation of IesR-1 as in non-growing intracellular bacteria was observed although the <italic>phoP</italic> mutant produced higher levels of the sRNA (&#x0223c;5-fold) at 24 h post-infection compared to bacteria present in the inoculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This finding led us to discern whether IesR-1 could be subjected to regulation by the PhoP-PhoQ system. We analyzed relative levels of transcript conforming the <italic>PSLT047-iesR-1-pSLT046</italic> (<italic>mig5</italic>) region in wild-type, <italic>phoP</italic> and a <italic>phoP</italic><sup>c</sup> strain carrying a constitutively active PhoP-PhoQ system. While <italic>PSLT046</italic> (<italic>mig5</italic>) was clearly regulated by PhoP-PhoQ, no changes in expression were observed for IesR-1 among the strains tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0077939.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

Typhimurium has been reported to respond to the intracellular environment, we sought to determine whether an alteration in IesR-1 levels could lead to changes in the capacity of bacteria to invade or persist inside fibroblasts or to impair infection of susceptible mice. To inactivate IesR-1 but simultaneously avoid polar effects on the overlapping 3&#x02032; end of <italic>PSLT047</italic> or the 5&#x02032; promoter region of <italic>PSLT046</italic> (<italic>mig5</italic>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), we replaced a region spanning the first 209 nt of the IesR 5&#x02032;end with a chloramphenicol-resistance cassette (<italic>cat</italic>) flanked by two FRT sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0077939.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). We then checked the expression of the flanking genes as well as the 3&#x02032;-remnant of IesR-1 using strand-specific primers for reverse transcription followed by RT-qPCR. Wild-type, the aforementioned mutant strain (&#x00394;<italic>iesR-1</italic>/5&#x02032;::<italic>cat</italic>) and a deletion strain in which the <italic>cat</italic> cassette was eliminated by FLP-mediated recombination of FRT sites (&#x00394;<italic>iesR-1</italic>/5&#x02032;), were included in this RT-qPCR assay. A polar effect was observed in the &#x00394;<italic>iesR-1</italic>/5&#x02032;::<italic>cat</italic> strain, as the remaining 3&#x02032; region of <italic>iesR-1</italic> was dramatically induced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0077939.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). This effect was most likely due either to the presence of a cryptic driver in the <italic>cat</italic> cassette or to a read-through of the RNA polymerase as no increased transcription of the 3&#x02032; region of <italic>iesR-1</italic> was observed in the clean &#x00394;<italic>iesR-1</italic>/5&#x02032; mutant lacking the resistance cassette (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0077939.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). This finding suggested that the natural promoter of <italic>iesR-1</italic> still drives transcription of the remaining of this sRNA that is produced by the clean &#x00394;<italic>iesR-1</italic>/5&#x02032; mutant. Since the genomic organization of this plasmid region made not feasible the construction of clean deletion mutants lacking the entire IesR-1 molecule, we included both &#x00394;<italic>iesR-1</italic>/5&#x02032;::<italic>cat</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>iesR-1</italic>/5&#x02032; strains in the infection assays.</p><p>Wild-type and &#x00394;<italic>iesR-1</italic>/5&#x02032; strains were used in <italic>in vitro</italic> infection assays with rat and human fibroblasts (NRK-49F and BJ-5ta cell lines, respectively) and human HeLa epithelial cells. Except for BJ-5ta fibroblasts, in which the lack of IesR-1 was linked to a decrease of &#x0223c;2-fold in the invasion rate, no significant differences were observed in the rest of cell lines used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Concerning intracellular phenotypes, the only observed change was also observed in BJ-5ta human fibroblasts, in which the lack of IesR-1 correlated to an increase of &#x0223c;3-fold in the intracellular proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Since only minor alterations were observed in the <italic>in vitro</italic> infection models, we tested these strains in the mouse typhoid model. Previous studies reported a strong correlation between <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium functions required for maintaining a persistent state within fibroblasts and their relative contribution to virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-GarciaCalderon1">[43]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Linehan1">[46]</xref>. So, we hypothesized a probable role in virulence of IesR-1, strongly up-regulated by non-growing intracellular bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We then examined the fitness of &#x00394;<italic>iesR-1</italic>/5&#x02032;::<italic>cat</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>iesR-1</italic>/5&#x02032; strains in BALB/c mice using competitive infections upon intraperitoneal challenge. The &#x00394;<italic>iesR-1</italic>/5&#x02032;::<italic>cat</italic> mutant displayed a decreased fitness compared to wild-type bacteria (competitive index, CI &#x0223c; 0.33) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This result suggested that either the overexpression of the 3&#x02032; region, the lack of the 5&#x02032; region, or a combination of both, might attenuate virulence. Similar results were obtained when infecting mice by the oral route (results not shown). Interestingly, the &#x00394;<italic>iesR-1</italic>/5&#x02032;::<italic>cat</italic> mutant also displayed decreased fitness when mixed with &#x00394;<italic>iesR-1</italic>/5&#x02032; mutant bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Since both strains are devoid of an identical 5&#x02032; region of IesR-1, this finding indicates that an increased expression of the 3&#x02032; region of IesR-1 might impair virulence. Competition experiments were also performed with the &#x00394;<italic>iesR-1</italic>/5&#x02032; strain expressing <italic>in trans</italic> two versions of IesR-1: one encompassing the entire 597 nt molecule, MD2277 (&#x00394;<italic>iesR-1</italic>/5&#x02032;, <italic>cat</italic>::PLtetO <italic>iesR</italic> ); and, the other carrying only the first 208 nt of the 5&#x02032; region, MD2276 (&#x00394;<italic>iesR-1</italic>/5&#x02032;, <italic>cat</italic>::PLtetO <italic>iesR</italic>-5&#x02032;). Expression of these IesR-1 molecules was verified by RT-PCR (data not shown).

Since IesR-1 partially overlaps with the 3&#x02032;UTR of the <italic>PSLT047</italic> transcript, we hypothesized on a possible antisense regulatory mechanism. Our previous results indicated that IesR-1 is selectively induced in non-growing dormant intracellular bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). An inverse correlation between IesR-1 levels and its putative <italic>cis</italic>-regulated target would suggest a negative post-transcriptional regulation at the level of target mRNA stability. To test this, we monitored the expression pattern of <italic>PSLT047</italic> and <italic>iesR-1</italic> transcripts in different growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

These results indicated that IesR-1 could have either no influence or, alternatively, a positive effect on PSLT047 mRNA stability. In this scenario, post-transcriptional control at the level of PSLT047 translation could also occur. When analyzed in non-growing intracellular bacteria, we observed that PSLT047 protein levels dropped significantly compared to extracellular bacteria in the inoculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Experiments with two strains carrying the <italic>PSLT047</italic>-3xFLAG tagged allele but differing in the integrity of the IesR-1 molecule provided additional support to the model involving interaction between 3&#x02032; regions of IesR-1 and the <italic>PSLT047</italic> transcript with effects in PSLT047 protein levels.

Here, we analyzed a novel <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium sRNA encoded in the pSLT virulence plasmid that we named IesR-1. Besides FinP, IesR-1 would be the second example of a pSLT-encoded sRNA that, in this case, could have evolved to modulate the growth rate of the pathogen inside the eukaryotic cell.

Indeed, we failed to detect up-regulation of IesR-1 in extracellular bacteria growing in either ISM or PCN defined media, considered to mimic the conditions of the vacuole inhabited by intracellular bacteria. This result indicates that intracellular signals resulting from host cell-microbe interaction entail a higher level of complexity, and that such a particular condition could be hardly accomplished by current <italic>in vitro</italic>-culturing reagents. The persistence-dependent expression of IesR-1 was confirmed in fibroblast from different sources (human and rat origin) although it was not so evident in <italic>phoP</italic> mutant bacteria actively proliferating within host cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These results open the question of whether IesR-1 expression is regulated in response to specific signal(s) implicated in quorum sensing and/or adaptive responses linked to environmental stresses existing in the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole.</p><p>The identification of IesR-1 as a novel sRNA was confirmed by circular RACE experiments and further cloning of amplicons enriched in the pyrophosphatase-treated fractions as well as Northern blot. The RACE experiments allowed to accurately map the 5&#x02032;-end of the primary transcripts. Regarding the 3&#x02032; end, the transcripts showed a marked heterogeneity among the sequenced clones, which is likely to result from read-through of transcriptional terminators and/or degradation by 3&#x02032;-exonucleases. This is a particularly prominent feature in the overlapping region between <italic>PSLT047</italic> and <italic>iesR-1</italic> transcripts, for which we got clones with gradually decreasing lengths. This result could indicate an RNase III-mediated post-transcriptional endonucleolytic processing of an hypothetical <italic>PSLT047</italic>-<italic>iesR-1</italic> duplex. Alternatively, such heterogeneity in the 3&#x02032; ends could also be explained by the fall off of the reverse transcriptase as a result of encountering dsRNA tracks with variable size made of the <italic>PSLT047-iesR-1</italic> hybrid RNAs. Regardless of the situation, our results are consistent with a <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulation of IesR-1 over the <italic>PSLT047</italic> transcript by an interaction of their respective 3&#x02032;-ends. This postulate is also sustained by the increased production of the PSLT047 protein following the interruption of the IesR-1 molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0077939-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Such convergent genetic configuration between an sRNA and the 3&#x02032; UTR of its target has been previously documented. Thus, the GadY sRNA of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> overlaps with the 3&#x02032;UTR of GadX, a transcriptional regulator of acid response. This interaction leads to an RNase III-mediated processing of the GadX-GadW duplex, which in turn favors the accumulation of GadX transcript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Opdyke1">[50]</xref>. Conversely, the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> RatA sRNA overlaps with the 3&#x02032;UTR of <italic>txpA</italic>, which codes for a toxic peptide that promotes cell lysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Silvaggi1">[51]</xref>. This interaction impedes <italic>txpA</italic> transcript accumulation, thus avoiding cell lysis. Nevertheless, the data obtained with IesR-1 are more consistent with a regulatory mode over PSLT047 acting on its translation rate.</p><p>The presence of antisense transcripts in mobile genetic elements (such as plasmids) is frequently associated to type I toxin-antitoxin systems (TAS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Thomason1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Gerdes1">[27]</xref>. These systems contribute to maintain stability of plasmids during bacterial propagation by the post-segregational killing of plasmid-free daughter bacteria. Interestingly, the 3&#x02032; end of IesR-1 shows high homology to an intergenic region (Sbal223_609 to Sbal223_610) from <italic>Shewanella baltica</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0077939.s004">Figure S4</xref>), in which Sbal223_609 is annotated as a putative toxin. This observation suggests a possible horizontal gene transfer between <italic>Shewanella baltica</italic> and <italic>S. enterica</italic> and raises the tempting idea of a possible toxin-antitoxin system conformed by PSLT047 and IesR-1. Such a scenario is reminiscent to the <italic>par</italic> stability determinant of <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> encoded in the pAD1 plasmid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Greenfield1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Greenfield2">[53]</xref>. RNA I and RNA II are two sRNAs transcribed in opposite orientations that constitute the toxin and antitoxin of the <italic>par</italic> post-segregational killing system, respectively. Interestingly, the interaction of RNA I and II involves the binding at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends in a two-step mechanism, with an initial kissing interaction between the transcriptional terminator stem-loops of both RNAs followed by the pairing of the complementary direct repeat sequences and the complete hybridization of the 5&#x02032; nucleotides to stabilize the complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Greenfield2">[53]</xref>. The binding of RNA II antitoxin has been shown to inhibit ribosome binding to RNA I, thus impeding an efficient toxin translation initiation and cell killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Greenfield1">[52]</xref>. In this regard, it would be of interest to investigate whether IesR-1 could control negatively PSLT047 translation by a similar mechanism. Moreover, we cannot discard the possibility that IesR-1 could regulate expression of other genes located elsewhere in the chromosome and/or the pSLT plasmid <italic>via</italic> a <italic>trans</italic>-antisense mechanism based on the non-overlapping 5&#x02032; region. Transcriptomics performed in wild-type and &#x00394;<italic>iesR-1</italic>/5&#x02032; strains growing in the most optimal extracellular condition for IesR-1 expression, non-shaking-stationary phase in LB broth, did not result in any conclusive target (data not shown). This observation could imply that the 5&#x02032; moiety of IesR-1 does not play a significant role in determining target specificity. On the other hand, it cannot be ruled out that IesR-1 does exert its function exclusively in intracellular bacteria, therefore with no possibility of target identification in extracellular bacteria. Alternatively, IesR-1 might influence translation of pre-existing mRNAs. Similar comparative transcriptomics in intracellular bacteria might provide clues on these aspects, however such study means a real technical challenge, as purification of enough total RNA from two independent strains staying in a dormant non-growing state within the fibroblast requires a large effort. Given our interest in deciphering the biological role of IesR-1, we are currently considering this possibility.</p><p>Lastly, the data obtained in the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> infection models reveal a feature repeatedly observed for many sRNAs. The lack of the regulatory molecule may result in minor alterations in the capacity of the pathogen to cause infection due to the fine-tuning that most of these sRNA molecules perform in the activity or relative level of their respective targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Masse1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Gottesman1">[55]</xref>. Some sRNAs &#x02018;share&#x02019; targets, so the absence of a particular sRNA can be compensated by the action of other sRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Papenfort1">[3]</xref>. In the case of IesR-1, our data allow to tentatively assign relevance to a probable coordinated production of &#x02018;both&#x02019;, the antisense IesR-1 and the PSLT047 transcript. The overexpression of the 3&#x02032; region of IesR-1 or the expression in trans of the entire IesR-1 molecule led to negative phenotypes consistent with such idea. Further studies could consider the tempting hypothesis of a coordinated expression of both RNA molecules by intracellular bacteria leading subsequently to an inverse correlation between PSLT047 protein levels and IesR-1 expression. The PSLT047-IesR-1 pair could, in this regard, behave as a type I toxin-antitoxin system resembling others implicated in bacterial growth arrest and persistence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Ramage1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0077939-Gerdes2">[57]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0077939.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Sequences (5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032;) of the oligonucleotide probes CNB1344-0963 and CNB1344-0995 mapping in IGRs of the </bold><bold><italic>S.</italic></bold><bold> Typhimurium pSLT virulence plasmid.</bold> These two probes revealed increased transcriptional activity in their respective IGRs in non-growing intracellular bacteria located inside fibroblasts.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0077939.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0077939.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p><bold>The non-coding sRNA IesR-1 is not regulated by the PhoP-PhoQ system.</bold> RT quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays performed on <italic>iesR-1</italic> and its flanking genes in wild-type bacteria (14028 s), an isogenic <italic>phoP</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic>, and constitutively active <italic>phoP-24</italic> mutant.
