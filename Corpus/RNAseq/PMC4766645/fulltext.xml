To date, <italic>S. viridis</italic> has primarily been used to further our understanding of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, but is also an ideal system for the study of biomass crops, which are almost exclusively C<sub>4</sub> panicoid grasses. Biogenesis of stem tissue, its cell wall composition, and soluble sugar content are important determinants of bioenergy crop yields. Here we show that a developing <italic>S. viridis</italic> internode is a valuable experimental system for gene discovery in relation to these important bioenergy feedstock traits.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The rate of maximal stem biomass accumulation in <italic>S. viridis</italic> A10 under long day growth was at the half-head emergence developmental stage. At this stage of development, internode 5 (of 7) was found to be rapidly expanding with an active meristem, a zone of cell expansion (primary cell walls), a transitional zone where cell expansion ceased and secondary cell wall deposition was initiated, and a mature zone that was actively accumulating soluble sugars. A simple method for identifying these zones was established allowing rapid dissection and snap-freezing for RNAseq analysis. A transcriptome profile was generated for each zone showing a transition from cell division and nucleic acid synthesis/processing in the meristem, to metabolism, energy synthesis, and primary cell wall synthesis in the cell expansion zone, to secondary cell wall synthesis in the transitional zone, to sugar transport, and photosynthesis in the mature zone.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The identification of these zones has provided a valuable experimental system for investigating key bioenergy traits, including meristematic activity, cell wall biosynthesis, and soluble sugar accumulation, in a C4 panicoid grass that has genetic resources, a short life cycle, and small stature allowing controlled experimental conditions in growth cabinets.

The support of the research community for this model is evidenced by the first <italic>Setaria</italic> conference held in Beijing in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Reported uses of <italic>Setaria viridis</italic> to date have focused on the collection of natural diversity panels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], the development of mapping populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and crossing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] techniques, and generation of molecular resources such as transformation vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and notably a genome sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Most research using these resources has been directed towards the study of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis and associated leaf development and cellular differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; however, <italic>S. viridis</italic> is also a valuable model species for the study of biomass crops, which are almost exclusively C<sub>4</sub> panicoid grasses (e.g. giant miscanthus (<italic>Miscanthus x giganteus</italic>), switchgrass (<italic>Panicum virgatum</italic>), sugarcane (<italic>Saccharum officinarum</italic>), maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>), and sorghum (<italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>)) sharing a highly similar lineage to <italic>Setaria</italic>. Whilst photosynthesis is an important determinant of crop biomass yield, knowledge of the factors controlling biogenesis of stem sink tissue, its cell wall composition, and soluble sugar content are crucial for the improvement of forage and bioenergy crop quality and yields.</p><p>The main agricultural products of forage and bioenergy crops are soluble sugars and the cell wall fractions of culms, which are used as a source of feed or fuel. To maximise yields, larger culm volumes with high sugar content and easily hydrolysed cell wall polymers are required. The cell wall composition of <italic>S. viridis</italic> has been shown to be consistent with that of major bioenergy crops with equivalent conversion rates of cellulose to fermentable sugars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. No study of soluble sugar levels in <italic>S. viridis</italic> culms has been published; however, Brix concentrations of up to ten can be achieved (Martin et al. unpublished observations), which is equivalent to that of mid-range sweet sorghum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and sugarcane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] crops. <italic>Setaria viridis</italic> culms therefore possess attributes that suggest they would be a valuable C<sub>4</sub> model system for the study of not only cell wall synthesis and stem development but also sugar accumulation in C<sub>4</sub> panicoid grass culms.</p><p>A grass culm consists of multiple repeating phytomeric units, comprised of a node and an internode. Stalks develop and elongate acropetally, whilst individual internodes develop and elongate basipetally with a sigmoidal elongation pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. At the midway stage in its development, an internode will contain an active intercalary meristem at its base, acropetally followed by a cell expansion zone, before transitioning into mature cells towards the top. Based on early physiological studies of oat culm development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and extensive literature in sugarcane and sweet sorghums, which show the accumulation of sugar in mature internodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the following picture emerges for a developing internode in panicoid grass species. The meristem contains actively dividing cells undergoing mitosis and cell differentiation processes, and the expansion zone contains cells that are actively expanding under turgor whilst synthesising primary cell walls and cell membranes. As the cells mature, secondary cell wall deposition terminates cell expansion and the cells realise their capacity to import and store sugar.</p><p>Here we characterise a developing <italic>S. viridis</italic> internode that contains an active intercalary meristem, rapidly expanding cells with primary cell walls, a transitional zone where secondary cell wall synthesis is initiated, followed by a mature zone where sugar import and storage are occurring. RNA sequencing of tissues from each of these developmental zones provides a framework for gene discovery. Ultimately, genetic manipulation of genes discovered here has the potential to alter sink size by affecting cell division and expansion in the meristematic and cell expansion zones, and to influence the molecular composition of cell wall polymers and soluble sugars by affecting metabolic pathways in the transitional and maturation zones. Whilst there have been other transcript studies conducted in grass stems at various stages of development, including young and mature maize internodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and in bamboo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], this is the first study to characterise and utilise the developmental zones within an elongating internode, and the first whole RNAseq transcriptome dataset for <italic>S. viridis</italic> stem tissue. This experimental system and transcriptomic resource in the C<sub>4</sub> model species, <italic>S. viridis</italic>, will facilitate gene discovery with respect to grass culm development and allow controlled experimental exploration of traits relevant to bioenergy crops such as culm sink size, cell wall composition, and soluble sugar content. The genetic and physiological similarities between <italic>Setaria viridis</italic> and key bioenergy crops will increase the translatability of results into forage and bioenergy crop improvement programmes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To identify a rapidly expanding internode, <italic>S. viridis</italic> plants were grown under highly controlled conditions and seven developmental stages were examined. The fourth developmental stage, half-head emergence, was defined as the point when half of the seed head had emerged from the leaf sheath (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). This was chosen as the developmental stage with the most rapid rate of stem growth, which also corresponded with the most rapid rate of sucrose accumulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). At this developmental stage, the leaf sheath was carefully stripped to expose the stem and its constituent internodes. Internode five, counted from the bottom (considering only internodes &#x02265;5&#x000a0;mm in length), or, interchangeably, the second internode from the top (not including the flag internode), was selected as a rapidly elongating internode containing well-defined elongation and mature zones (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). To ensure this internode was rapidly elongating, the same internode was also measured in mature plants and was shown to increase from an average length of 3.8&#x000a0;cm at harvest (half-head emergence) to 10.2&#x000a0;cm at maturity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Selection of a rapidly elongating internode. <bold>a</bold>

It was also essential to develop a method for visually identifying these zones of internode five so that harvest for RNAseq analysis could be achieved rapidly, without any need for microscopy, and therefore without excessive tissue damage.</p><p>Internodes were photographed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), whilst intact and then embedded in agarose and sectioned longitudinally. Nuclei were stained with DAPI, illuminated with UV light and viewed using a long-pass DAPI filter that allowed red chlorophyll fluorescence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) and blue DAPI fluorescence of nuclei (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c) to be visualised simultaneously. Processing DAPI images allowed nuclei density (a proxy for the number of cells) and also cell size to be plotted along the length of the internode (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). A spike in nuclei density mapped to a well-defined white band at the base of the internode, and this was defined as the meristematic zone (MsZ) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) allowing for rapid identification of this zone. Directly above the meristematic zone, cell size increased and nuclei density decreased, both asymptotically. It was observed that this cell expansion zone was dark green in colour, which was also indicated by the increased red chlorophyll fluorescence observed in longitudinal sections of this region (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). The base of the internode was flexible (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), likely due to the lack of lignified secondary cell walls. The point where the internode became rigid corresponded with the end of the chlorophyll-enriched zone and the approach of nuclei density and cell size towards their asymptote. Both the end of the chlorophyll-enriched zone and the point where the internode became rigid were therefore used as markers to dissect the cell expansion zone (CEZ) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) of the internode without the need to stain or section the tissue. The region of the internode directly above this point, cut to ~85&#x000a0;% the length of the CEZ, was dissected and defined as the transition zone (TZ) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). A zone immediately below the node above internode five, cut at the same length as the CEZ, was dissected as the mature zone (MZ) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Defining meristematic (MsZ), cell expansion (CEZ), transition (TZ), and cell maturation (MZ) zones of internode 5. <bold>a</bold> Internode 5 harvested at the half-head emergence developmental stage with its leaf sheath stripped, alongside an equivalent internode 5 where the lower, flexible zone has been bent to display the differentiation between the upper rigid zone and the lower flexible zone.

The cell expansion zone contained immature vascular bundles with protoxylem and very little cell wall thickenings in any cell types (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e). The transition zone contained fully developed vascular bundles with fully developed xylem, but only modest cell wall thickenings (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f). The mature zone contained fully developed vascular bundles with fully developed xylem and more cell wall thickening than the transitional zone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g). Based on evidence from these images, the dissected zones contained a variety of cell types, but were sufficiently enriched in expanding, transitioning, and mature tissues to reveal differences in metabolite levels and gene expression between each developmental stage.</p><p>Primary metabolites were measured in the four zones of the developing internode to establish carbon pools (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Starch was found only in the developmentally young meristematic and cell expansion zones. The ratio of sucrose to hexoses was high in the meristematic zone, reduced in the growing cell expansion and transitional zones, and increased in the mature zone, which was likely at the beginning of a sugar storage phase as sugar levels rise towards the maximal concentration observed in stage 6 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). High levels of the soluble C<sub>4</sub> acid malate were also measured and correlated strongly with sucrose levels. The role of malate in this developing C<sub>4</sub> internode is unclear; however, it may be involved in a functional C<sub>4</sub> pathway, used as a pH regulator, a storage molecule in vacuoles, or an osmolyte for turgor regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Primary metabolites and cell wall lignin in the developing internode. Starch (measured as molecules of released glucose), glucose, fructose, sucrose, and malate were assayed enzymatically in extracts from the meristem, cell expansion, transition, and mature zones of the fifth internode. Lignin was measured using the acetyl bromide method. All values are mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SE of four biological replicates of pooled material from ten plants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13068_2016_457_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>The lignin content of cell walls was also measured in the cell expansion, transitional, and mature internode zones as an indicator of the presence of primary or secondary cell walls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Very low levels of lignin were observed in the cell expansion zone; however, the cell walls rapidly became lignified in the transitional zone, and continued to accumulate lignin up to the mature zone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This suggested that the cell expansion zone contained primary cell walls, whereas the transitional zone was rapidly synthesising secondary cell walls, and that this synthesis was maintained, up to higher levels in the mature zone where it has, likely, completed lignification.</p><p>Once the developmental status of the four internode zones was established, RNA was extracted, sequenced, mapped (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for mapping details), and expression values calculated. Principal component analysis (PCA) of global gene expression confirmed that each internodal zone had a unique gene expression profile with the meristematic and cell expansion zones clustering separately from the transitional and mature zones (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Very little variation between biological replicates was also observed confirming the reproducibility of the harvesting technique.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Internode zones have unique RNAseq profiles and contain stem- and zone-specific genes. <bold>a</bold> Principal component analysis of FPKM values obtained from RNA sequencing of the MsZ, CEZ, TZ, and MZ of internode 5. <bold>b</bold>

This also revealed a dichotomy between the two younger meristematic and cell expansion zones, and the two older transitional and mature zones. Thousand eight hundred and sixty genes were up-regulated in common in MsZ/CEZ and 983 in TZ/MZ. In comparison, only 52 MsZ/TZ, 157 MsZ/MZ, 213 CEZ/TZ, and 12 CEZ/MZ genes were up-regulated in common (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). The number of up-regulated genes and the number expressed above a threshold of one fragments per kilobase per million reads (FPKM) also showed dichotomy with more being found in younger than older tissues (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). This suggests that greater biological complexity is required for meristematic activity and cell expansion than for the established biological processes of mature tissues including secondary cell wall synthesis and carbon storage.</p><p>Using criteria of gene expression above a level of 80 FPKM (chosen by visually examining read coverage of genes with ~80 FPKM), and a log<sub>2</sub> fold change &#x0003e;2.5 against the whole plant (WP) background transcriptome, 418 &#x02018;stem-enriched&#x02019;, 13 &#x02018;MsZ-enriched&#x02019;, 8 &#x02018;CEZ-enriched&#x02019;, 84 &#x02018;TZ-enriched&#x02019;, and 45 &#x02018;MZ-enriched&#x02019; genes were identified which can be used to identify promoter sequences for the construction of tissue-specific, and likely cell-specific, expression vectors (&#x02018;enriched&#x02019; genes are marked in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p><p>To further characterise the segregation of biological processes within each zone of the developing internode, genes were categorised based on the most recent Mapman ontology, which was updated for this analysis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The meristematic zone was enriched in processes related to cell division and cell cycle including DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis/regulation, confirming that this zone is actively undergoing cell division. The cell expansion zone was enriched in metabolism, energy production, and lipid biosynthesis, which are required to drive cell expansion. The transitional zone was enriched in secondary cell wall biosynthesis-related gene categories including lignin biosynthesis, laccases, cell vesicle transport, MYB, and NAC transcription factors (which are maintained in the mature zone), and amino acid metabolism. The mature zone was enriched in sugar transporters, photosynthesis (which begins to operate, however, not to the levels observed in the whole plant), and flavonoid biosynthesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These transcript profiles confirm that the transcriptional machinery required for stem-specific intercalary meristem cell division and differentiation is active in the meristematic zone; energy-driven cell expansion is active in the cell expansion zone; secondary cell wall synthesis, including transcriptional switches, is active in the transitional zone; and sugar unloading, storage, and possibly synthesis (photosynthesis) is active in the mature zone.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Meristematic, cell expansion, transition, and mature zones are enriched in unique gene families.

In the meristematic zone, gene expression suggested predominantly symplasmic import of photoassimilate and utilisation of starch for cell metabolism and energy production (demand 1), since expression of sugar transporters, including <italic>SWEET</italic>s (sugar effluxers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], <italic>SUT</italic>s (sucrose-H<sup>+</sup> symporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]), <italic>HT</italic>s (hexose transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]), <italic>PLT</italic>s (polyol transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]), and <italic>CWI</italic> (cell wall invertase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]) was low (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Gene expression in the cell expansion zone also suggested that photoassimilate is imported predominantly symplasmically [i.e. low expression of <italic>SWEET</italic>s, <italic>SUT</italic>s, <italic>HT</italic>s, <italic>PLT</italic>s, and <italic>CWI</italic>s and higher expression of plasmodesmatal located proteins (<italic>PDLP</italic>s)] not only in this zone and is directed towards demand 1 (energy/metabolism), but also primary cell wall synthesis, including hemicellulose, pectin, and cell wall protein synthesis (demand 2) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The transitional zone is a pivotal developmental stage switching from predominantly metabolism (demand 1) and symplasmic photoassimilate import to a highly significant up-regulation of genes associated with apoplasmic sugar transport, coupled with a major switch and a re-direction of carbon flow to secondary cell wall synthesis (demand 2) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

Here we have presented the first transcriptomic analysis of this model system in tissue relevant to bioenergy research, at a gene discovery level. We have identified and shown that a developing <italic>S. viridis</italic> internode contains (i) an active meristematic zone that utilises starch and likely symplasmically imported sucrose and malate as a carbon source to drive metabolism, energy production, and synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein, (ii) a zone of cell expansion with predominantly non-lignified primary cell walls which also utilises starch and symplasmically imported sugars, in the form of hexoses to produce energy, driving cell expansion, (iii) a transitional zone where cell expansion ceases, secondary cell wall synthesis is initiated and sugar import switches to a, likely, apoplasmic step, and (iv) a mature zone containing thickened, lignified cell walls, that is actively accumulating and storing carbon in the form of sucrose and malate via the expression of energy-dependent sugar transport genes, suggesting a, likely, apoplasmic step during the unloading of photoassimilate into this tissue.</p><p>Dye feeding experiments in sugarcane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and sorghum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] have shown that 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (CF) moves symplasmically from vascular phloem to storage parenchyma cells in mature stem sink tissues. Interestingly, high expression of energy-dependent sugar transport genes within mature internodes has also been observed, in sorghum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]; however, the protein cellular localisation, and therefore precise role in sugar accumulation within grass stems has not yet been elucidated. The strong expression of <italic>SWEET</italic>, <italic>SUT</italic>, <italic>HT</italic>, <italic>PLT</italic>, and <italic>CWI</italic> genes in mature sink tissue of the <italic>S. viridis</italic> developing internode provides evidence that an apoplasmic step may exist in <italic>Setaria</italic>. Localisation and characterisation of these sugar transport proteins, however, will determine the cellular localisation of a possible apoplasmic unloading step, which may be vascular in origin or located on storage parenchyma cells to facilitate unloading of sugar into the apoplasm for storage and regulation of turgor. Whilst the role of these transporters in phloem unloading and assimilate storage in maturing internodes is yet to be investigated, this experimental system has provided gene candidates and a biological system for protein localisation and phenotyping of gene knockdown lines which will further unravel this biological process that is integral to controlling soluble sugar levels in C<sub>4</sub> panicoid grasses.</p><p>Similarly, the clear transition from primary cell wall synthesis to secondary cell wall synthesis in this system, coupled with gene expression data, has uncovered numerous <italic>S. viridis</italic> gene candidates which can now be manipulated and studied under controlled conditions to further our understanding of cell wall biosynthesis in C<sub>4</sub> grass stems. Cellulose synthase-like (CSL) families A, C, D, F, and H were all switched on in the meristematic and cell expansion zones of the internode, implicating a potential role in cell division and/or primary cell wall synthesis of hemicelluloses. As an example of gene discovery in this system, we will examine the proteins encoded by the CSLF and CSLH gene families. Homologues of CSLF and CSLH have been shown to produce mixed linkage glucans (MLGs) in primary cell walls of barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] during wall expansion, and in secondary cell walls of rice stems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

Similarly, a number of gene isoforms can now be identified within this dataset for the manipulation and characterisation of lignin precursor synthesis, lignin polymerisation, cellulose synthesis, and hemicellulose synthesis, examining genes associated with both primary and secondary cell wall synthesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).
