Because of the extremely unfavorable prognosis of GBM, it is important to develop more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on biologically and clinically relevant subclassification systems. Analyzing a collection of seventeen patient-derived glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) by gene expression profiling, NMR spectroscopy and signal transduction pathway activation, we identified two GSC clusters, one characterized by a pro-neural-like phenotype and the other showing a mesenchymal-like phenotype. Evaluating the levels of proteins differentially expressed by the two GSC clusters in the TCGA GBM sample collection, we found that SRC activation is associated with a GBM subgroup showing better prognosis whereas activation of RPS6, an effector of mTOR pathway, identifies a subgroup with a worse prognosis. The two clusters are also differentiated by NMR spectroscopy profiles suggesting a potential prognostic stratification based on metabolic evaluation. Our data show that the metabolic/proteomic profile of GSCs is informative of the genomic/proteomic GBM landscape, which differs among tumor subtypes and is associated with clinical outcome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents the most common and malignant brain tumor in adults, characterized by a high degree of cellular and genetic heterogeneity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.

GSCs can be isolated to generate cell lines characterized by self-renewing, multipotency, and highly tumorigenic ability and are reported to mirror both the genomic and the gene expression profiles of the original tumor more closely than conventional serum-cultured glioma cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Although the functional criteria defining GSCs are widely accepted, the molecular characteristics of these cells have not been fully identified<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. As expected from the heterogeneous histology of GBM, there is extensive cellular heterogeneity within GSCs as well<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The complex interplay of signaling pathways and the lack of common molecular markers identifying GSCs further complicate the analysis of these cells.</p><p>To further dissect the molecular biology of GBM and seeking for appropriate clinical targets to be exploited for drug treatment, we analyzed our collection of patient-derived GSCs by combining complementary molecular approaches. Taking into account the most variable genes/transcripts, gene expression profiling of GSCs revealed two distinct clusters. These clusters closely overlapped those obtained both from metabolic analysis by NMR spectroscopy and from signal transduction pathway activation, as assessed by reverse-phase protein microarray technology (RPPA). In addition, we analyzed available RPPA data from TCGA to evaluate the capability of proteins differentially expressed in the two GSC clusters to predict patient survival.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Gene expression profiling identifies two distinct phenotypes of GSC lines</title><p>Tumor samples from 55 GBM patients were mechanically dissociated and cultured in stem cell medium. Seventeen of the 55 GBMs (31%) generated GSC lines.

Notably, median overall and progression free survival were significantly shorter in tumors that generated GSC cultures as compared with those that did not<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. GSC lines were expanded and previously validated for their stem cell properties, such as the ability to self-renew, to generate progeny of multiple lineages in differentiating culture conditions and to phenocopy the patient tumor in mouse xenografts. In addition they were characterized for the expression of stem cell markers, including CD133 and SOX2, and for the presence of tumor-specific genetic changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>Gene expression data were collected from all the GSC lines and unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the samples using the 1,000 most variable genes/transcripts (below and above the interquartile range of the full dataset) produced two distinct GSC clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>), reminiscent of the separation into GSf (full stem) and GSr (restricted stem) phenotypes previously reported by G&#x000fc;nther and colleagues, and by Schulte and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.

Chromosomal loci 19p13, 19p12 and, to a somewhat lesser extent, 19q13 were highly enriched in the GSC signature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1b</xref>). All these regions contain a large number of Kr&#x000fc;ppel-Type Zinc Finger proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Region 19q13 has been reported as hypermethylated in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and copy-number-gain has been described in GBM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The GSEA analysis also showed partial overlaps with mesenchymal, proneural and classical GBM sub-signatures established by Verhaak and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, an adult tissue stem-cell signature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, a stromal stem cell signature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and oligodendrocyte differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1c</xref>). Clustering of the GSC expression data using these partial gene lists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>) indicates a higher degree of &#x0201c;stemness&#x0201d; in the GSr-like lines coupled to a more mesenchymal-like phenotype. On the contrary GSf-like lines showed a more proneural/classical-like phenotype with reduced neural differentiation features and higher expression of regions 19p12 and 19p13. In line with this observation, proneural GBM has been recently proposed to arise from a non-stem-cell precursor, in contrast to the other three GBM subtypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p><p>To further characterize our samples and compare them to previously described signatures, a large unified dataset was generated including data from both the Schulte GSf/GSr<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and the Verhaak TCGA GBM studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Genes/probes from the different microarray platforms were integrated through a batch correction procedure using only two global sample types, stem-cell or bulk tumor, i.e. without explicitly assigning a GSf or GSr phenotype to any sample. In the unified dataset, the GSC and GSf/GSr samples reproduce two homogeneous clusters with GSf(-like) or GSr(-like) phenotype, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>), thus confirming the initial phenotype assignment of the GSC clones. Extending the analysis to include also the four subtypes of TCGA GBM samples and clustering by the Verhaak GBM subtype signatures, the GSr/GSr-like and GSf/GSf-like samples distinctly co-clustered with either the mesenchymal (M) or proneural (P)/classical (C) tumor subtypes, respectively (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1a</xref>). Moreover, the overlap between the top 1000 most variable genes in GSf- <italic>vs</italic> GSr-like and the top 1000 most variable genes in GSf/GSr combined dataset, showed that 609 genes are shared between GSf-/GSr-like and GSf/GSr (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1d</xref>). Interestingly, RNAseq analysis of 447 cancer-related genes on 167 TCGA GBM samples, shows a less stringent division between known subgroups when compared to the complete microarray panel (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy reveals two distinct metabolic phenotypes of GSCs</title><p>To identify possible metabolic phenotypes, the 17 GSC lines were assessed by 1D<sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy.

The first cluster, which is characterized by low lipids and high NAA and Gln, includes all GSf-like lines except the GSC line #112, whereas all GSr-like lines are grouped in the second cluster, characterized by high lipids, low Gln and absent NAA. NAA signals were clearly observed only in GSf-like lines, indicating a metabolic fingerprint typical of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). These signals were barely detectable in GSr-like spectra, thus suggesting that the neuronal metabolism, although present, is not prevalent in these lines. The intensity of MLs signal was higher in GSr-like line spectra compared to GSf-like ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B,C</xref>), indicating a prevalent astrocyte/glioma-like metabolism. These two clusters closely superimpose those defined by gene expression analysis with the only exception of GSC line #112 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>), supporting an association of the GSf-like lines with the proneural subtype and of the GSr-like ones with the mesenchymal subtype.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Phosphoproteomic analysis confirms differential metabolic profiles in GSf-like and GSr-like cells</title><p>Genomic and transcriptomic analyses cannot fully account for the translational and post-translational integration of the complex genomic and transcriptomic aberrations accumulated in each tumor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. We recently demonstrated that reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) analysis identifies pathway activation patterns that correlate with the response of GSCs to kinase inhibitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Therefore, we performed RPPA analysis on our collection of GSCs to measure the basal state levels of total and/or phosphorylated forms of diverse proteins involved in regulation of stemness, differentiation, migration, cell cycle, DNA damage, proliferation, cell growth, stress response and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).

A pathway-oriented rather than single-endpoint approach to signaling analysis showed that GSf-like cells have a significant increase in SRC, Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK), and Insulin-like Growth Factor- Receptor (IGF1-R/IR), whereas GSr-like lines displayed increased levels of phosphorylated proteins associated with the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>GSf- and GSr-like classification and clinical correlations</title><p>In a previous study, we demonstrated that the efficiency in establishing a GSC culture is about 30&#x02013;40%, and that the capacity to generate GSCs represents an independent prognostic factor for poor patient survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Thus, we explored possible associations of the GSC subtypes, i.e. GSf-like and GSr-like, with clinical and pathological parameters of the donor patients. Symptom duration prior to diagnosis was significantly shorter, indicative of a more aggressive clinical behaviour, in tumors that generated GSr-like cultures as compared with tumors generating GSf-like cultures (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0422; Mann-Whithey <italic>U</italic> test).

The median overall survival of the donor patients was 10.5 and 8 months for GSf-like and GSr-like tumors, respectively. No significant differences were found between GSf- and GSr-like generating tumors in terms of patient age or sex, tumor location or diameter, and extent of tumor resection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>).

We explored such data, comprising 181 protein analytes on 251 GBM samples, and found that unsupervised clustering failed to produce a consistent partitioning of the sample cohort into the four clearly-defined gene expression subtypes described by Verhaak and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, but rather grouped them into two dominant GBM subtypes (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>). Thus, we asked whether the significantly different endpoints identified in GSf- and GSr-like GSCs by our RPPA analysis, could have prognostic value in the large cohort of GBM samples from TCGA. To this end, we used the Glioblastoma Bio Discovery Portal (GBM-BioDP, see methods section for details) and, as a query input, two gene symbol lists based on RPPA endpoints that were differentially expressed between GSf- and GSr-like GSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S6</xref> and methods section). Focusing on the proteins characterizing the GSf-like subgroup, we found that the levels of activated Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 3 (HER3 pY1289) were higher in P <italic>versus</italic> M subtype (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.00016, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>) confirming a relationship between P and GSf subtypes.

High levels of 4EBP1 pS65 and two distinct phosphorylated forms of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGF-R pY1173 and EGF-R pY992) correlated with a better prognosis only in the P subgroup, whereas high AKT pS473 was markedly associated with poor survival in the same subtype (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>).</p><p>Similarly to the GSf-like signature, to define a GSr-like mPI (mPI<sub>GSr</sub>), we computed a single Cox regression model with all the GSr-like-specific endpoints as covariates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5D</xref>).

Altogether these results indicate that the activation of two GSf-like endpoints, HER3 and SRC, is associated with a GBM subgroup showing better prognosis whereas activation of RPS6, effector of mTOR pathway and GSr-like endpoint, identifies a subgroup with a worse prognosis.</p><p>Finally, based on the subset of GSr- and GSf-like RPPA endpoints which resulted significantly different among the two groups in previous analyses, we tested all possible binary combinations of such analytes that would better stratify TCGA patients into two groups with a significant survival difference. Notably, two specific expression patterns, i.e. i) elevated total SRC or SRC pY527 coupled to low RPS6 pS235-36 and ii) high RPS6 pS235-36 coupled to low total SRC or SRC pY527, allowed us to discriminate two groups of TCGA patients: group with pattern i) displays a significantly better outcome than group with pattern ii) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). These results confirm the potential prognostic role of SRC and RPS6 in a large cohort of GBM patients.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Glioblastomas are genetically heterogeneous tumors, suggesting that a diverse set of gene products may act to regulate their behavior and ultimately their outcome. Molecular classification of GBM is still at the beginning, and there is no general consensus on GBM subtypes. Despite several studies have provided a high resolution picture of GBM molecular landscape and revealed major alterations that may drive disease pathogenesis and biology, dependencies of tumors on altered signaling pathways suitable for direct translation to the clinics have not been yet identified and exploited in this tumor. The availability of GBM stem-like cell (GSC) line models reflecting gene expression patterns and phenotypic characteristics of human GBMs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> more closely than serum-cultured glioma cell lines, may help identifying cues for targeted therapies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Although GSC cultures may represent a valuable tool for obtaining data to be translated onto the clinical setting, their translational power is still debated for at least two limiting factors. The first one is that, using our techniques, we arose GSC cultures from approximately one third of the tumors only. This implies that the GSC paradigm might not be applied in a substantial fraction of patients suffering from GBM but mainly to more aggressive cases, since median overall and progression free survival were significantly shorter in tumors that generated GSC cultures as compared with those that did not<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The second issue relates to cell heterogeneity of individual GBM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and within individual GSC cultures, where mixed populations of GSCs and committed progenitors coexist, both capable of forming GSCs but where only GSCs are clonogenic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Nonetheless, GSC cultures represent a valuable surrogate of their parental tumor and, although bearing intrinsic limitations, they allow molecular interrogation and study of one of deadliest tumors such as GBM.</p><p>In the attempt to find druggable signaling pathways in GBM, we analyzed a collection of 17 patient-derived GSCs by applying independent but complementary molecular approaches. Taking into account the potential bias of information obtained from our limited GSC samples, we compared our observations obtained on GSCs with datasets from large public databases annotated with clinical records. We were able to define two homogeneous subtypes resembling respectively the GSf and GSr groups described by Schulte, though with distinct molecular signatures.</p><p>Comparing genes differentially expressed between the GSf-like and the GSr-like GSC groups with gene sets from the literature, highly significant overlaps were present with two of the Verhaak GBM subtype signatures (mesenchymal and proneural), two stem-cell signatures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, and a gene set related to oligodendrocyte differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The GSf-like and GSr-like clusters are characterized by a &#x0201c;pro-neural-like&#x0201d; and a &#x0201c;mesenchymal-like&#x0201d; expression signature, respectively. However, it should be emphasized that, comparing the molecular signature of our GSCs with that of GBM TCGA, which reflects the bulk tumor, may represent a limiting factor of this analysis.</p><p>Assessing more deeply the genes/transcripts that are differentially expressed between our GSf- and GSr-like lines, we found that genes located in chromosomal loci 19p13, 19p12, and 19q13 were highly enriched in the &#x0201c;GSC signature&#x0201d;. These regions contain a large number of Kruppel-type Zinc Finger transcription factors (ZNFs), which act mostly as chromatin modulating transcription repressor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Several ZNFs have been identified as potential tumor suppressors and have often been found silenced in several tumor types. Deletions along chromosome 19 are common events in several malignancies including ovarian<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and oropharyngeal carcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The relevance of chromosome 19 alterations on the pathogenesis and prognosis of GBM deserves further evaluation.</p><p>To further investigate the signaling pathways differentially activated in GSf and GSr-like subgroups we performed RPPA analysis. We found that GSf-like lines displayed a significant increase in activation of SRC, MAPK and IGF1R/IR pathways. Conversely, GSr-like lines showed increased levels of phosphorylated proteins associated with the EGFR and PI3K/mTOR pathways.</p><p>We then evaluated the expression levels of either GSf- or GSr-like RPPA endpoints in the large cohort of GBM samples from TCGA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and compared them with the proneural and mesenchymal subtypes. Although our data on GSCs do not completely match previous RPPA analysis of TCGA GBM tumors, they confirmed the relevance of mTOR pathway in defining molecular subgroups of GBM.</p><p>A complete correlation between GSf-like and proneural or GSr-like and mesenchymal subtypes was not present for all common RPPA endpoints, probably due to the different complexity of the systems (i.e. GBM tumors <italic>versus</italic> GSC lines) however, some of the RPPA analytes shared between TCGA and our data, displayed significant correlations with the clinical outcome of GBM patients. In particular, the GSf-like signature is characterized by the presence of active HER3, previously associated with CD133<sup>+</sup> GBM stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> and recently proposed as a potential target in GBM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The GSf-like signature is also characterized by activation of proteins involved in the focal adhesion signaling axis, which is known to be driven by integrins, a hallmark of GBM stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. The activation of HER3 and focal adhesion pathways confers a survival advantage to GBM patients in the TCGA cohort. This observation suggests that GSf-like GSCs might harbor phenotypical and molecular characteristics reminiscent of normal neural stem cells with migratory habit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Conversely, the GSr-like signature is characterized by a strong activation of downstream targets of the EGFR and PI3K/mTOR pathway, which plays a critical role in cancer and, in particular, in GBM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Interestingly, although the expression or activation of EGFR failed to correlate with the outcome in TCGA data, the presence of elevated levels of specific phosphorylation sites of both EGFR and RPS6, significantly associated with poor prognosis in the same cohort of GBM patients. Therefore, the GSr-like signature might be distinctive of a subset of metabolically active GSCs with high resistance to chemo- and radio-therapy hence negatively influencing the survival of GBM patients. Indeed, when classifying TCGA patients based on combined expression patterns of the two RPPA endpoints typical of either the GSf- and GSr-like phenotype (i.e. SRC and RPS6, respectively), patients with GSr-like features display a significantly shorter overall survival. Despite the small sample size of our cohort, these results are in line with the clinical data of our patients producing lines of either GSf- or GSr-like groups.</p><p>Finally, the GSf-like and GSr-like clusters were clearly confirmed by NMR metabolic profiling. The GSf-like subtype, characterized by metabolites involved in the production of neurotransmitters such as NAA and GABA, is suggestive of a prevalent neuronal metabolism. The GSr-like subtype, characterized by lack of NAA and GABA and by high mobile lipids (MLs), is indicative of a prevalent astroglial-like metabolism. These metabolic profiles corroborate the association of the GSf-like group with the pro-neural GBM subtype resulting from independent gene expression analysis and with a different prognosis. In the clinical practice, NMR spectroscopy is mainly used to differentiate GBM from lower grade gliomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Hallmarks of GBM are high choline/NAA and choline/creatinine ratios, and a lactate/lipid peak, which reflects tumor necrosis. Currently, NMR spectroscopy is not used to stratify GBM patients for prognostic purposes. In experimental settings, high glutamate signal has been correlated to IDH1 wild-type GBM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. In this study we showed that, at least in a subgroup of patients, the metabolic features of GBM cells, as assessed by NMR analysis, may be informative of the genomic/proteomic landscape of the tumor, and ultimately of the GBM subtype and clinical outcome. Finally, here we provide evidence that combined measurement of levels of two proteins, namely phospho-SRC and phospho-RPS6, may be informative on the outcome of GBM patients. Further investigation with increased sample size could confirm our observations providing important information on the pathogenesis of human GBM and eventually leading to an improvement of GBM diagnosis and to an indication for most appropriate therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Patients, diagnosis, and tumor characterization</title><p>Tumor tissue samples were collected from adult patients with GBM tumors (WHO grade IV) undergoing complete or partial surgical resection at the Institute of Neurosurgery, Catholic University School of Medicine in Rome.

Based on this subset of RPPA endpoints, we tested all possible binary combinations of GSf- and GSr-like analytes using median expression level cut-offs, e.g. patients having expression values above the median for either SRC or SRC pY527 or HER3 pY1289 and simultaneous lower than median levels of either RPS6 pS235-36 or EGFR pY1173 were assigned the GSF-like group while patients with opposite pattern were considered as GSr-like.
