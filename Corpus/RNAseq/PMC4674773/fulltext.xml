Here we show a regulatory circuit that prevents excessive HSC self-renewal by upregulation of miR-193b upon self-renewal promoting thrombopoietin (TPO)-MPL-STAT5 signalling. In turn, miR-193b restricts cytokine signalling, by targeting the receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT. We generated a miR-193b knockout mouse model to unravel the physiological function of miR-193b in haematopoiesis. <italic>MiR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice show a selective gradual enrichment of functional HSCs, which are fully competent in multilineage blood reconstitution upon transplantation. The absence of miR-193b causes an accelerated expansion of HSCs, without altering cell cycle or survival, but by decelerating differentiation. Conversely, ectopic miR-193b expression restricts long-term repopulating HSC expansion and blood reconstitution. MiR-193b-deficient haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells exhibit increased basal and cytokine-induced STAT5 and AKT signalling. This STAT5-induced microRNA provides a negative feedback for excessive signalling to restrict uncontrolled HSC expansion.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms9928-i1.jpg"/>MicroRNAs regulate haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) development to ensure the correct generation of blood cells.

They simultaneously target various mRNAs and thereby fine-tune entire gene expression networks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The necessity of miRs for normal long-term repopulating haematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) function became apparent by the haematopoietic-specific deletion of <italic>Dicer</italic>, an essential nuclease for the generation of mature miRs, leading to the loss of their life-long self-renewal ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

In particular, we assessed miRs downstream of TPO-induced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5A/B<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The STAT5A/B signalling pathway is activated by cytokine receptors, such as myeloproliferative leukemia (MPL), c-KIT and the receptors of interleukin 3, granulocyte&#x02013;macrophage colony-stimulating factor and erythropoietin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. LT-HSCs require STAT5A/B activity for self-renewal and maintenance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Constitutively active STAT5A/B promotes marked LT-HSC expansion and the subsequent development of a myeloproliferative syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Therefore, STAT5A/B signalling needs fine-tuning for normal LT-HSC self-renewal.</p><p>In this study, we identify miR-193b as a regulatory feedback molecule restricting excessive HSC self-renewal upon the activation of the self-renewal-promoting TPO-MPL-STAT5 signalling. To execute this function, miR-193b restricts cytokine signalling by targeting the tyrosine kinase c-KIT. In turn, miR-193b-deficient haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from miR-193b knockout mice exhibited increased basal and cytokine-induced STAT5 and AKT signalling, thereby promoting the consecutive expansion of HSCs. This STAT5-regulated miR balances cytokine signalling via the STAT5 and AKT pathways, providing a negative feedback for excessive signalling to restrict uncontrolled HSC expansion.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> expansion of LT-HSCs in the absence of miR-193b</title><p>To identify miRs that are extrinsically regulated by the self-renewal-promoting signalling axis comprising TPO, its receptor MPL and the transcription factors STAT5A/B, we compared miR expression patterns in LT-HSCs of STAT5A/B-deficient and wild-type (WT) control mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> that were stimulated with TPO or kept unstimulated, by quantitative PCR (qPCR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The differential miR pattern revealed five miRs that were &#x0003e;2-fold upregulated by TPO only in the presence of STAT5A/B: miR-193b, miR-132, miR-125a, miR-331-5p and miR-669a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). We focused on the function of the intergenic miR-193b in haematopoiesis, because miR-193b is selectively expressed in LT-HSCs and to a lesser extend in multipotent progenitors (MPPs), but not in lineage-committed progenitors and mature blood cells, as shown by us (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>) and others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Furthermore, haematopoietic stress induced by the cytokine storm 10 days after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment upregulated miR-193b expression in LT-HSCs (about 2.5-fold in comparison to steady-state). Although the induction of miR-193b expression was even more pronounced in lineage-committed progenitors and mature blood cells than in LT-HSCs caused by 5-FU treatment, the expression level in these committed cells was still 1,000 times lower than in LT-HSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Recently, we demonstrated that STAT5A/B binds to the miR-193b promoter in the murine mammary gland<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Here we could show that STAT5A/B is required for the cytokine-induced miR-193b transcription in LT-HSCs.</p><p>To unravel the function of miR-193b in haematopoiesis, we generated miR-193b knock-out mice, which were viable without visible abnormalities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. First we investigated the steady-state haematopoiesis of 2- to 3-month-old <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice. Compared with WT mice, no significant differences (according to <italic>t</italic>-tests) were observed in the mature blood cell lineages in peripheral blood, bone marrow (BM) or spleen of <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a&#x02013;c</xref>). The percentage and number of defined BM progenitor cells were also unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d,e</xref>). However, <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice over 6 months of age displayed an unexpected increase in LT-HSCs in the LSK (Lineage<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Sca1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>c-KIT<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), whereas total LSK cell numbers were not altered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). The accumulation of LT-HSCs increased with age, as 1-year-old mice showed a 1:1 ratio of LT-HSCs and MPPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Yet, we only determined the LT-HSC frequency by their well-established marker phenotype, but we needed to confirm their true identity by their long-term blood reconstitution ability. To corroborate that <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> LT-HSCs were fully functional, we performed a competitive transplantation of LT-HSCs from 1-year-old miR-193b-deficient or WT mice into recipients and then monitored donor blood reconstitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The miR-193b-deficient LT-HSCs reconstituted equally well as WT LT-HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>) and exhibited normal production of T, B and myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2g</xref>). Strikingly, when we analysed the distribution of LT-HSC and progenitor cells in primary recipient BM, we determined a more than twofold increase in phenotypic LT-HSC numbers in the absence of miR-193b in comparison to the WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Although donor cell engraftment in the BM was only slightly enhanced in the absence of miR-193b (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>), overall BM donor cellularity was markedly increased, thereby suggesting that <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> LT-HSCs self-renew extensively after transplantation stress to repopulate the recipient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2h</xref>). We further challenged the self-renewal ability of miR-193b-deficient LT-HSCs by transplanting unfractionated BM cells from primary recipients into secondary recipient mice. Again, both the WT and knockout group reconstituted the secondary recipients almost equally well, which clearly indicated that miR-193b-deficient LT-HSCs were fully functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). When we gated for LT-HSCs in the BM of secondary recipients, we again measured an increased proportion and number of LT-HSCs in those recipients that received <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Assessing the donor-derived HSPC distribution in primary and secondary recipient BM, we observed a consistent increase in <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> LT-HSCs and subsequent increase in LSK cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h,i</xref>). Although no difference was found in the primary recipients of either <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> or <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> LT-HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>), secondary recipient BM accumulated <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> LT-HSCs and LSK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i</xref>). This proves that the self-renewal of LT-HSCs leading to an enlarged compartment of competent LT-HSCs is intrinsically promoted in the absence of miR-193b. Of note, the recipients that received the <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> donor cells displayed a slightly lower donor cell chimerism in the BM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f,h</xref>), indicating that although they received more LT-HSCs from primary recipients and again showed an enhanced self-renewal and expansion of LT-HSCs, the ability of these LT-HSCs to produce the same output on mature cells seemed altered. Whether this is due to a delay in differentiation of LT-HSCs or an altered clonal fitness remains to be clarified.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>More miR-193b-deficient LT-HSCs are in active cell cycle</title><p>Most LT-HSCs are quiescent (G0 phase) in homeostasis. The expansion of the LT-HSC population may indicate that an increased proportion of LT-HSCs are actively cycling in the absence of miR-193b. Therefore, we examined the cell-cycle phases in 2- to 3-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Indeed, there were a significant higher proportion of LT-HSCs and MPPs in cell-cycle (Ki67<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) in <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The continuous observation of individual LT-HSCs by time-lapse microscopy-based cell tracking<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> allowed us to determine the time of entry into the first division once cells were exposed to <italic>in vitro</italic> culture. The <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> LT-HSCs displayed an earlier time point of division compared with WT controls under minimal (stem cell factor (SCF) only) and self-renewal-promoting (TPO and SCF) cytokine conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Next, we functionally confirmed these findings by repetitively treating mice with 5-FU, which eliminates proliferating cells. Quiescent LT-HSCs only become susceptible to 5-FU during haematopoietic stress, driving them into cycle. We injected 5-FU into <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> and <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> mice once a week, until the mice suffered from fatal haematopoietic failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Although most of the WT mice died after the third round of 5-FU injections, all miR-193b-deficient mice died already after two subsequent injections, most likely because the hyperproliferative LT-HSCs were quickly extinguished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). These results show at the phenotypic, molecular and functional level that the absence of miR-193b leads to an intrinsically controlled expansion of fully functional LT-HSCs, as they exhibit reduced quiescence and increased self-renewal.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>MiR-193b controls HSPC expansion by altering differentiation</title><p>We then assessed the immediate consequences of the absence of miR-193b on the function and fate of LT-HSCs. First, we measured the expansion of LT-HSCs in liquid culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and found that LT-HSCs from <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice gave rise to a twofold increase in cell numbers over a 7-day-period compared with WT LT-HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Conversely, lentiviral expression of miR-193b in LT-HSCs led to a dramatic reduction of miR-193b-expressing progeny over time, whereas the percentages of control vector transduced cells or of cells lentivirally expressing the unrelated miRs-132/212 remained largely constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">4a</xref>). Of note, ectopic expression of miR-193b in GMPs did not influence their expansion, and the percentage of transduced cells did not change over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>), indicating a distinct function of miR-193b in LT-HSCs. The increased expansion of LT-HSCs and their progeny leading to elevated levels of mature blood cells may be explained by increased proliferation, reduced apoptosis or delayed differentiation. To dissect these various cell fates at a single-cell resolution, we monitored the individual LT-HSCs and their progeny of miR-193b-deficient and WT mice using video-microscopy-based cell tracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Interestingly, the absence of miR-193b had no influence on cell-cycle duration in dividing LT-HSCs and their progeny for many generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Moreover, there was no decrease of cell death events in the absence of miR-193b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). To verify that the absence of miR-193b does not influence the cell-cycle duration of HSPCs, we determined HSPC proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic> by pulsing <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> and <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> mice with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 4&#x02009;h. Accordingly, there was no difference in the cell-cycle distribution in LT-HSCs, MPPs, GMPs or MEPs, which further confirmed that the absence of miR-193b does not shorten the cell cycle of HSPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>). These results show that the absence of miR-193b increases the number of LT-HSCs in active cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), but does not alter the cell-cycle progression of proliferating LT-HSCs or their progeny during steady-state haematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>We asked whether <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> LT-HSCs show a delayed differentiation that causes an accumulation of highly proliferative progenitors. Therefore, we determined distinct differentiation stages of LT-HSCs that were cultured for several days via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>). After 5 days of culture, 25&#x00025; of WT cells expressed markers similar to GMP-like cells (CD117<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD16/32<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>). Meanwhile, most miR-193b-deficient cells remained more immature (CD117<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD16/32<sup>&#x02212;</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3i,j</xref>). Overall, the increased expansion of cells from <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> LT-HSCs was due to a delay in differentiation and not a change in proliferation or survival.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Increased cytokine signalling in miR-193b<sup>

</sup> LT-HSCs</title><p>Next, we aimed to assess the molecular mechanism by which miR-193b restrains HSPC expansion and LT-HSC self-renewal.

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of these regulated genes using DAVID<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis suggested the involvement of altered cell signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3 and 4</xref>). This result guided us to investigate major signalling pathways that are activated by cytokines, such as Janus kinase/STAT, PI3K/AKT (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/thymoma viral proto-oncogene) and MAPK/ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase). Phosphoflow cytometry of phosphorylated STAT3, STAT5, AKT and ERK revealed an increase in the basal signalling levels of STAT5 and AKT in <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> BM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The hyperactivation of signal transduction, particularly of STAT5 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), may lead to the observed expansion of LT-HSCs in miR-193b-deficient mice. Therefore, we assessed tonic and cytokine-activated signalling in LT-HSCs using phosphoflow cytometry. Although tonic signalling levels after cytokine starvation were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>), STAT5 and AKT phosphorylation were 2- and 1.5-fold stronger after cytokine stimulation, respectively, in miR-193b-deficient LT-HSCs compared with WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Next, we determined the kinetics of STAT5 and AKT signalling in temporal relation to miR-193b expression in LT-HSCs upon cytokine stimulation, and investigated changes in STAT5 and AKT signalling in the absence of miR-193b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). After a rapid induction already at 5&#x02009;min of stimulation, the levels of pSTAT5 and pAKT further increased to a maximum at 20&#x02009;min in LT-HSCs from <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> and <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice. pSTAT5 and pAKT levels remained constant for 60&#x02009;min before declining again at 120&#x02009;min. Intriguingly, <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> LT-HSCs showed an overshooting activation of pSTAT5 at 20&#x02009;min, that did not decline as much as the pSTAT5 levels in <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> LT-HSCs at 120&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). <italic>MiR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> LT-HSCs showed a higher induction of pAKT at 20&#x02009;min, which remained above the pAKT levels of <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> LT-HSCs until 120&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). The expression of miR-193b was instantly induced by cytokine stimulation and showed the strongest expression at 60&#x02009;min after stimulation before it already declined at 120&#x02009;min. Importantly, already 20&#x02009;min after stimulation there was a twofold increase in miR-193b expression in comparison to unstimulated LT-HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p><p>These results underline that the cytokine-induced activation of STAT5 leads to the rapid upregulation of the miR-193b as a STAT5-dependent miR, and the time shift between maximum pSTAT5 (at 20&#x02009;min) and maximum miR-193b expression (at 60&#x02009;min) would be expected from a transcribed target gene of STAT5. However, in the absence of miR-193b there is an overshooting pSTAT5 and pAKT activation signal, which would have been dampened in the presence of the already increased miR-193b levels at 20&#x02009;min. Furthermore, the activation of STAT5 and AKT persisted longer in the absence of miR-193b, which suggests a negative regulation of the signalling kinetics by the miR-193b.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>MiR-193b targets c-KIT and thereby modulates signalling</title><p>The increased signalling output may be caused by kinase hyperactivation. Therefore, we applied PamGene array technology to quantitatively compare the activity of hundreds of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases in the BM cells of <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> and <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> mice in an unbiased way.

However, we clearly determined specific changes in a small group of peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 5</xref>). One peptide found to be hyperphosphorylated was a target of c-KIT, the receptor of the cytokine SCF and an essential receptor tyrosine kinase in haematopoiesis.

Indeed, there was a 30&#x00025; reduction of c-Kit mRNA expression in LT-HSCs ectopically expressing miR-193b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). More importantly, we determined a 40&#x00025; reduction of c-KIT surface expression on HSPCs that expressed miR-193b in comparison to control vector transduced cells, measured by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>).

Reduced cell expansion and lack of blood reconstitution following transplantation with LT-HSCs overexpressing miR-193b resembles the phenotype of LT-HSCs harbouring dysfunctional c-KIT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.

We then assessed the expansion of double-transduced cells in culture. Although cells expressing miR-193b and a control vector nearly disappeared over the course 7 days, miR-193b-expressing cells co-transduced with c-KIT expanded in culture, thereby rescuing the miR-193b-mediated effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). These results show that STAT5-activated miR-193b regulates c-KIT expression, probably among other important factors, and thereby subsequently influences signalling networks to control the fate of LT-HSCs.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Two prominent signalling pathways guiding LT-HSC self-renewal and proliferation, STAT5A/B and PI3K/AKT, are hyperactivated in the absence of miR-193b leading to a more active LT-HSC population that expands over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Constitutive active STAT5 signalling induces LT-HSC expansion and finally results in a myeloproliferative disease in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Furthermore, many leukaemogenic alterations (for example, mutated <italic>c-Kit</italic>, <italic>Flt3-ITD</italic> and <italic>BCR-ABL</italic>) require chronically high STAT5 activation for disease development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. PI3K/AKT signalling promotes cell proliferation and survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, and hyperactivation of this pathway results in LT-HSC expansion and exhaustion, and in the development of leukaemia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Furthermore, SCF is essential for the survival and proliferation of all HSPCs, and it transmits its signal after binding to c-KIT leading to STAT5, PI3K/AKT and ERK signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Activating c-KIT mutations, which are common in acute leukaemias, cause SCF-independent constitutive, dysregulated signalling and eventual uncontrolled expansion of leukaemic blasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Conversely, in mouse models, hypomorphic c-KIT mutations compromise LT-HSCs, which can easily be outcompeted by WT LT-HSCs in transplantations without harsh conditioning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. STAT5 and AKT signalling need to be in tight balance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, and are controlled by negative regulators such as suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.

In this study, we found that miR-193b is an important negative regulator of basal and cytokine-stimulated signalling and hyperactivation in LT-HSCs. Therefore, as miR-193b expression is triggered by STAT5 signalling, this axis represents a classical negative feedback mechanism. Strikingly, although <italic>miR-193b</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> LT-HSCs were more actively cycling and expanding, they did not exhaust and remained fully functional. This aspect distinguishes miR-193b function from other haematopoietic negative regulators, such as PTEN, thereby suggesting that miR-193b is able to fine-tune HSC numbers. The tolerated expansion of LT-HSCs over time might also be supported by our findings that the absence of miR-193b does not change the cell-cycle length in proliferating HSPCs, but rather regulates the decision of active cell-cycle entry versus quiescence.</p><p>It is not surprising that miR-193b is downregulated in leukaemia and other cancer entities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.

Especially, the initiation of pre-cancerous (stem) cells at an early disease stage might be supported by enhanced self-renewal in the absence of the tumour-suppressing miR-193b, as STAT5 activation plays a key role in establishing pre-cancerous clonal dominance in stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.
