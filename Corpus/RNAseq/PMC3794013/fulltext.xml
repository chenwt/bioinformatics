The best recognized neural consequences of HPRT deficiency are defective basal ganglia expression of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) and aberrant DA neuronal function. We have reported that HPRT deficiency leads to dysregulated expression of multiple DA-related developmental functions and cellular signaling defects in a variety of HPRT-deficient cells, including human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. We now describe results of gene expression studies during neuronal differentiation of HPRT-deficient murine ESD3 embryonic stem cells and report that HPRT knockdown causes a marked switch from neuronal to glial gene expression and dysregulates expression of Sox2 and its regulator, genes vital for stem cell pluripotency and for the neuronal/glial cell fate decision. In addition, HPRT deficiency dysregulates many cellular functions controlling cell cycle and proliferation mechanisms, RNA metabolism, DNA replication and repair, replication stress, lysosome function, membrane trafficking, signaling pathway for platelet activation (SPPA) multiple neurotransmission systems and sphingolipid, sulfur and glycan metabolism. We propose that the neural aberrations of HPRT deficiency result from combinatorial effects of these multi-system metabolic errors. Since some of these aberrations are also found in forms of Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease, we predict that some of these systems defects play similar neuropathogenic roles in diverse neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases in common and may therefore provide new experimental opportunities for clarifying pathogenesis and for devising new potential therapeutic targets in developmental and genetic disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>These studies were supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (DK082840), the Lesch Nyhan Disease Children's Research Foundation, the UCSD Department of Pediatrics and the UCSD Academic Senate.

The clinical disorder is characterized by dystonia, choreoathetosis, cognitive deficits and self-injurious behavior, the hallmark feature of LND. The most prominent and well-recognized neurophysiological consequence of HPRT deficiency in the human central nervous system is dysfunction of basal ganglia dopaminergic (DA) neurons and defective development of DA signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Yeh1">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Guibinga1">[5]</xref> that in turn are thought at least partially to cause the aberrant neurological phenotype. The mechanisms connecting the defective purine pathways with neurological defects are not well understood, although most current models of LND pathogenesis assume that aberrant purine metabolism is the proximate cause of the neurological dysfunction through a direct effect of aberrant purine levels on early neural development or on neural function.</p><p>Recent studies in our laboratories have identified molecular neural dysregulatory mechanisms associated with HPRT deficiency that are likely to underlie defective neural development and aberrant function of dopaminergic and possibly other classes of neural cells. These findings point to a complex set of dysregulated functions and pathways that constitute a multi-systems set of pathogenic mechanisms responsible for this monogenic disease. Most relevant have been demonstrations of aberrant expression of key neuronal transcription factors, microRNA expression and defects in purinergic and other cellular signaling functions in a variety of mouse and human cell culture systems including human iPS cells. These defects have included aberrant canonical Wnt/b-catenin signaling and defective presenilin-1 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Kang1">[6]</xref>, dysregulated expression of purinergic receptors with resulting aberrant expression of phospho-CREB and phospho-ERK signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Mastrangelo1">[7]</xref> and aberrant expression of microRNA expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Guibinga2">[8]</xref>. These results have led to the surprising conclusion that the housekeeping HPRT gene serves not only to drive classical metabolic pathways, but also to regulate multiple key neurodevelopmental functions, a previously unrecognized role of a metabolic housekeeping gene. Still largely unstudied is the possibility that the HPRT protein carries out other purine-unrelated pleiotropic effects in other systems.</p><p>In the present study, we have taken advantage of a highly-efficient established protocol for dopaminergic neuronal differentiation of embryonic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Cho1">[9]</xref> and global transcriptome characterization via microarray and RNA-Seq methods to identify transcriptional aberrations in HPRT-knockdown murine ESD3 embryonic stem cells during neuronal differentiation in vitro. We have demonstrated that although wild type (WT) and HPRT-deficient murine ESD3 embryonic stem cells generate dopaminergic neuronal cells with approximately equal efficiency, HPRT-deficient cells show markedly aberrant patterns of expression of genes associated with dopaminergic neurogenesis and function. We performed microarray-based transcriptome analysis of cells at the pre-differentiation embryonic stem cell stage, at the partially differentiated SNM (spherical neural mass) stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Cho1">[9]</xref> and at the fully differentiated neuronal stage. We also used RNA-Seq analysis for a detailed temporal characterization of the transcriptomes of WT and HPRT-knockdown ESD3 cells during the 14-day differentiation of SNM cells to fully differentiated neurons. Through these studies, we have discovered that HPRT deficiency causes aberrant regulation of multiple genetic and metabolic pathways including those that affect stem cell pluripotency and that drive cells in differentiation directions that involve a cell developmental fate choice to develop along neuronal or glial pathways. In addition, we have found multiple additional defects in HPRT-deficient cells, including aberrations related to cell cycle and proliferation mechanisms, RNA metabolism, DNA replication and repair, replication stress, lysosome function, membrane trafficking, signaling pathway for platelet activation (SPPA) multiple neurotransmission systems and sphingolipid, sulfur and glycan metabolism. We therefore hypothesize that the human HPRT-deficiency phenotype may constitute a &#x0201c;systems&#x0201d; disorder that produces broad and powerful dysregulation of many aspects of neurodevelopment by mechanisms possibly stemming from dysregulated pluripotency or inappropriate stem cell entry into aberrant differentiation pathways. If correct, such broad developmental mechanisms represent unexpected functions for a metabolic housekeeping gene.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Preparation of control and HPRT knockdown ESD3 cells</title><p>The HPRT mRNA level in HPRT knockdown cells was down-regulated by approximately 98% compared with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and HPRT protein expression was markedly reduced in HPRT knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

As expected, the pluripotency markers OCT-4 and Nanog became significantly down-regulated in both WT and knockdown cells as they differentiated from the embryonic stage through the SNM stage to the fully differentiated neuronal stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g003">Figure 3A and B</xref>). However, while WT cells also showed efficient down-regulation of the pluripotency and neuronal/glial developmental marker Sox2 during differentiation, expression of Sox2 not only failed to down-regulate in HPRT-knockdown cells but instead was up-regulated at the SNM stage and even further markedly up-regulated at the neuronal stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). As expected, the neuronal marker &#x003b2;-III tubulin showed marked up-regulation in WT cells, particularly in the differentiation step from SNM to the neuronal phenotype. However, the HPRT-knockdown cells failed completely to up-regulate &#x003b2;-III tubulin expression at either the SNM or DA neuronal stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) as did the WT cells. In contrast, the neuronal marker directly relevant to the dopaminergic system; i.e., dopamine transporter (DAT), showed modest up-regulation in WT cells at the neuronal stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) while the HPRT-knockdown cells showed an earlier and much more robust up-regulation at the fully differentiated neuronal stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, regulation of TH was not as clearly or consistently affected by HPRT deficiency. The results for TH transcription were inconsistent and un-interpretable. Briefly, both the wild type and knockdown cells demonstrate alternating levels of increased and decreased expression during the differentiation process (data not shown). We therefore have not yet been able to identify a reproducible regulatory role of HPRT in expression of TH.</p><fig id="pone-0074967-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0074967.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Regulation of pluripotency markers at the embryonic stem cell, SNM and neuronal (DA) stages of neuronal differentiation of WT control and HPRT-knockdown ESD3 cells, as measured by qPCR analysis.</title><p>(A) Expression of Oct-4, showing expected down regulation; (B) expression of Nanog during differentiation; (C) expression of Sox2 during differentiation.

Both markers were found to be readily expressed equally well in the WT and HPRT-knockdown cells at the final stage of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g004">Fig. 4a, b, d, e</xref>). Merged images of TH-positive and &#x003b2;-III tubulin-positive cells demonstrated that a high percentage of cells derived from either the WT or the HPRT-knockdown cells co-express the two neuronal markers with approximately equal efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g004">Fig. 4c, f</xref>).

The similarly efficient generation of TH and &#x003b2;-III tubulin-positive DA neuron-like cells from WT and HPRT-knockdown ESD3 cells is consistent with the fact that human LND brain and brains of HPRT-knockout mice display essentially normal cyto-architecture and contain largely normal numbers and normal distribution of TH-positive neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Visser1">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Egami1">[12]</xref>.

The most highly expressed lysosome genes are related to lysosomal function in sphingolipid and ganglioside metabolism that are active in astroglial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Sandhoff1">[18]</xref>. Similarly, the most highly expressed membrane trafficking genes such as GNS are related to sulfate metabolism in the lysosome and storage disorders.</p><p>The polarization test identifies pathways with subsets responding in opposite directions, thereby resulting possibly in no net shift in overall pathway expression. Polarization often arises in cell signaling, with distinct cell types expressing ligands and receptors, and systematic differences are apparent. Detailed analysis of results illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g007">Fig. 7</xref> have identified a number of such polarized gene expression aberrations (data not presented). WT cells express Notch ligands jagged-2 (JAG2) and deltex-4 (DTX4) whereas HPRT-KD cells express notch 2, notch glycosylation protein Lunatic Fringe (LNFG), and notch signaling partner mastermind-like protein 2 (MAML2). HPRT-KD cells express CXCL12, whose receptor CXCR4 is highly over-expressed in WT cells. HPRT-KD cells also express TGFB2 and TGFB3, whose receptor TGFBR1 is over-expressed in WT cells. Polarization may also reflect pathways that include both activators and deactivators/repressors. For example, in the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, WT cells express protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 7 (PTPN7), which negatively regulates MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Saxena1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Saxena2">[20]</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0074967-t007">Table 7</xref>), whereas HPRT-KD cells over-express MAPK3.

Polarization also arises from expression of alternative subunits. For example, the NOS1 pathway points to HPRT-regulated discordant expression of NMDA glutamate receptors: WT cells express increasing amounts of GRIN2A, whereas HPRT-KD cells express GRIN2C and GRIN3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g007">Fig. 7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Studies of the classical monogenic HPRT-deficiency Lesch Nyhan Disease have largely failed previously to connect the well-understood underlying genetic defect of purine salvage biosynthesis with the development of the neurological defects of dystonia, choreoathetosis, moderate cognitive impairment and compulsive self-mutilation. We have recently identified a number of biochemical and molecular aberrations in HPRT deficiency that point to multiple defects in gene expression and cellular signaling involving expression of DA transcription factors, a variety of signaling pathways and miRNA expression. We have hypothesized that these defects may contribute to severe developmental and functional dysregulation of neural developmental pathways, especially those that determine DA neurogenesis and dopaminergic signaling. We have now used a robust system for <italic>in vitro</italic> neuronal differentiation of iPS and ES cells to identify some mechanisms by which HPRT regulates the molecular and cellular functions during neuronal differentiation of pluripotent murine ESD3 cells. These results establish that the housekeeping gene HPRT carries out functions far more complex than simply driving the metabolic steps of salvage purine biosynthesis and that it also plays very important roles in regulating a large number of developmental and cell signaling pathways that accompany and regulate many aspects of CNS development, most particularly mechanisms that determine neuronal/glial cell fate decisions during neurogenesis. We have used global transcriptomic characterization methods to identify mechanisms that are severely disturbed when HPRT expression is deficient. Although we have not yet fully established a direct causal relationship between these aberrations and the development of the neural dysfunction in the HPRT-deficient mammalian CNS, we have built upon these findings in the murine HPRT deficiency model to develop a working hypothesis that important aspects of impaired development and function of DA and possibly other neural pathways in human HPRT deficiency result from aberrations of many pathways and signaling systems caused by dysregulated differentiation and cell fate decisions made by embryonic stem cells during neurogenesis in the developing embryonic human CNS.</p><p>One major prime candidate for playing a causative factor in defective neural development in HPRT deficiency is an apparently aberrant embryonic cell fate decision that leads to a switch from a neuronal pattern of gene expression to an almost exclusively glial pattern of gene expression. Approximately midway during the ES DA neuronal differentiation process in vitro, HPRT-deficient murine ES cells undergo a major transcriptional switch away from neuronal almost entirely to a glial gene expression program, even as they continue to generate cells with at least some of the principal molecular properties of dopaminergic neurons such as &#x003b2;-III tubulin and TH expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). We note the apparently discrepant results of &#x003b2;-III tubulin expression as determined by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) and immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) techniques. We do not have experimental results that explain that difference, but several previous reports have demonstrated that such discrepancies between mRNA and protein gene product levels are well recognized in some systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Chen1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Pascal1">[22]</xref>. The exact nature of the responsible mechanisms has not been definitively established in these earlier studies, but the differences have been attributed to many possible mechanisms, including actual differences between the transcripts and protein products reflecting the existence of possible alternative differential splicing events leading to multiple isoforms with different mechanisms regulating their protein stability and abundance, probe set definition, technological sensitivity differences, etc.</p><p>Although the switch from neuronal to glial gene expression might be expected to affect the generation or distribution of glial cells and altered myelination and ensheathment functions in HPRT deficiency, there have been until now no major neuronal or glial cyto-architectural aberrations described in HPRT-knockout mice and only occasional but unconfirmed demonstrations of glial or myelination disturbances with peripheral neuropathy in human LND patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Lszl1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Makoukji1">[24]</xref>. Multiple mechanisms may theoretically cooperate to dysregulate gliogenesis and myelination in HPRT deficiency. Wnt signaling plays a vital role in myelination in the mammalian CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Tawk1">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Schebesta1">[32]</xref> and the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin canonical signaling pathway inhibits oligodendrocyte maturation and their myelination function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Jacob1">[30]</xref>, underscoring the possible significance of our previous report of deficient canonical Wnt-1 signaling/&#x003b2;-catenin processing in HPRT-deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Kang1">[6]</xref>. This impaired &#x003b2;-catenin expression may therefore play a role in up-regulating glial gene expression in the HPRT-knockdown ESD3 cells described above. In addition, the dysregulated myelination-associated signaling pathways shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0074967-t004">Table 4</xref> include aberrations of histone deacetylase (HDAC), hedgehog and Notch function, all of which are known to be regulators of myelination and glial function.</p><p>Mice lacking both HDAC1 and HDAC2 exhibit severe myelin deficiency with arrested Schwann cell development and HDAC2 acts in synergy with Sox10 to activate the transcriptional program of myelination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Jacob1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Park1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Wang1">[34]</xref>. Since hedgehog and Notch participate in the regulation of oligodendrocyte function and myelination, their perturbations in HPRT deficiency could contribute to mechanisms producing the neuronal/glial gene expression switch described in the present murine ES cell model system. Hedgehog expression is required for the expression of Olig1 and Olig2 in myelin-forming oligodendrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Nicolay1">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Graham1">[38]</xref> and the aberrant hedgehog expression seen in the HPRT-knockdown ESD3 cells might therefore be expected to alter oligodendrocyte functions and mechanisms of myelination. Similarly, Notch expression is required by oligodendrocytes for production and stabilization of the myelin component myelin basic protein (MBP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Bylund1">[39]</xref>. The increased level of MBP in the HPRT-knockdown cells illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g006">Fig. 6</xref> may therefore be at least partly the result of dysregulated Notch expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0074967-t004">Table 4</xref>) and subsequent to up-regulated expression of MBP. Interestingly, despite the robust aberration of gliogenic gene expression in the differentiating murine ES cells, no major myelination and gliogenesis defects have been described in HPRT deficiency, either in the human or in the HPRT-knockout mouse. Only two studies have reported possible myelination aberrations in HPRT deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Lszl1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Makoukji1">[24]</xref> but the question of gliogenesis and myelination have not been thoroughly examined in HPRT deficiency. Nevertheless, our present studies demonstrate that HPRT is a strong determinant of the neuronal or glial gene expression pattern in murine ES cells during neuronal differentiation. That fact together with dysregulations in multiple other regulatory systems such as notch, hedgehog and HDAC, in HPRT deficiency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0074967-t004">Table 4</xref>), indicates the need for future studies to identify the specific aberrations in these signaling pathways and to determine whether they cause, follow or are merely coincidentally related to the altered patterns of gene expression in HPRT-deficient cells, both in cell culture model systems and in vivo.</p><p>Another surprising defect in differentiating HPRT-deficient murine ES cells is the aberrant regulation of Sox2. The aberrant neuronal/glial developmental switch may be mechanistically related to an altered state of pluripotency and aberrant mechanisms of exit from pluripotency and initiation of neuronal differentiation in HPRT-deficient ESD3 cells, as suggested by the early and progressive up-regulation of Sox2 during neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Sox2, along with Nanog and Oct-3/4, are vital for faithful mammalian embryogenesis, for the maintenance of pluripotency and for aspects of neural development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Ellis1">[40]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Deutsch2">[44]</xref>. Persistent expression of Sox2 is associated with continued proliferative potential of stem cells while down-regulation is characteristic of cells differentiating into post-mitotic neurons. Equally striking is the demonstration that Sox2 over-expression interferes with neurogenesis in both the mouse and the chicken inner-ear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Pinto1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Pinto2">[46]</xref> and that production of neurons from stem cells requires down-regulation of Sox2. Therefore, the persistent and even increasing expression of Sox2 in the differentiating HPRT-deficient ESD3 cells in these studies is consistent with the impaired neurogenesis characteristic of HPRT deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Yeh1">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Guibinga1">[5]</xref>.</p><p>The extreme complexity of this system is underscored by the apparent discrepancy between what seems to comparably efficient generation of differentiated cells with morphological and molecular and properties of DA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g002">Figs. 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g005">5</xref>) and the sharp shift during DA neurogenic differentiation away from a neuronal to a glial pattern of gene expression. While these and our previous studies have identified a degree of aberrant DA neurogenesis in HPRT deficiency, the defect is an impeded, misdirected or inappropriately timed differentiation rather than a block to neurogenesis. The CNS in LND and in HPRT-knockout mice are known to contain normal numbers and distribution of cells with morphological properties of dopaminergic neurons and our own studies show generation from HPRT-deficient murine ES cells of populations of cells which express the DA neuronal markers TH and &#x003b2;-III tubulin cells but which have virtually shut down neuronal gene expression in favor of glial cell gene expression. This apparent discrepancy in HPRT-regulation of DA neurogenesis may be explained partly by the possibility that most cells in a heterogeneous population of differentiated HPRT-deficient DA-neuronal cells have become partially differentiated toward the DA neuronal phenotype, as least far enough along the pathway to express &#x003b2;-III tubulin TH and but are being impeded by HPRT deficiency and are either being re-directed along a glial developmental pathway or are being replaced by glial elements in the cell population that have a growth or survival advantage in the HPRT-deficient milieu.</p><p>An additional intriguing clue to the mechanisms of neuropathogenicity in HPRT deficiency is provided by the broad dysregulatory effect of HPRT deficiency on guanine purine metabolism and thereby on GPCR expression. HPRT deficiency causes broad changes in purine and purine nucleotide levels, including guanine nucleotide levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Garcia1">[47]</xref>, an effect that would be expected to dysregulate the function of many GPCRs and thereby to disturb many cellular signaling transduction events dependent on intact GPCR signaling pathways. We have previously reported that HPRT deficiency leads to defective expression of the GPCR purinergic receptor P2Y1 and that in turn is associated with aberrant pERK and pCREB signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Mastrangelo1">[7]</xref>. Other groups have shown that HPRT alters activities of additional GPCRs including membrane NTPase and adenylate cyclase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Bertelli1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Bertelli2">[49]</xref> The many aberrantly-expressed GPCRs listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0074967-t007">Table 7</xref> include functions associated with neurotransmission and neural development, including Wnt-1 signaling, glutamate receptors, 5HT receptors, GABAergic receptors. These results are consistent with our findings of disturbed function of these neurotransmitter functions as identified in Tables S2&#x02013;4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0074967.s001">File S1</xref>, with aberrant regulation of aspects of DA binding, DA receptor activity, and catechol metabolic processes.

Overall, these studies indicate that HPRT deficiency produces neurotransmission defects more extensive than the well-recognized defects in dopamine transmission and DA neurogenesis.</p><p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074967-g007">Fig. 7</xref>, HPRT deficiency in murine ESD3 cells is associated with impaired cellular activity devoted to an unexpectedly broad set of signaling pathways and metabolic functions that affect cell proliferation, protein synthesis, RNA biosynthesis, DNA replication and repair, enhanced cellular effort devoted to such diverse functions as sphingolipid metabolism and membrane biosynthesis, sulfur and glycan metabolism and to PPAR metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Trapnell1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Trapnell2">[55]</xref> and others. In several of the cell signaling pathways, the wild-type and HPRT-deficient cells express a number of discordant component mechanisms potentially participating in aberrant neuronal development. These systems have not been thoroughly characterized in human HPRT deficiency and their functions and interactions in producing the HPRT neural phenotype are largely unknown.</p><p>An area of potential relevance to HPRT neuropathology is the possibility that HPRT deficiency leads to disruption of normal microRNA expression, thereby leading to aberrant expression of many target genes involved in embryonic development of the mammalian CNS. Defects in miRNA expression would have the effect of providing an efficient mechanism for producing the extremely broad set of downstream defects that characterize HPRT deficiency and the LND neurological phenotype. We have previously reported that HPRT deficiency indeed leads to dysregulation of at least one miRNA (miR181a) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Guibinga2">[8]</xref> and recently we have found preliminary evidence for dysregulated expression of additional miRNAs (unpublished results). Their significance is under study.</p><p>We interpret these combined results to indicate that the housekeeping gene HPRT is a vital neurodevelopmental gene and that it plays a number of important non-&#x0201c;housekeeping&#x0201d; functions. Our studies suggests that HPRT is a determinant in regulating steps in mammalian CNS development possible through combined effects on stem cell pluripotency and neuronal differentiation, on cell fate decisions in neuronal and glial development, on microRNA expression, on GPCR expression, and on multiple additional cellular signaling and metabolic functions. We surmise that HPRT deficiency constitutes a systems disorder and that the pathogenesis of this monogenic but yet very complex neurodevelopmental Mendelian disease results from combinatorial and multigenic defects. We further surmise that these defects are all ultimately the result of aberrant purine metabolism but we cannot exclude the possibility that at least some of the cellular defects may result from other pleiotropic and non-purinergic functions of the HPRT protein. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this is the first time this kind of stem cell developmental gene expression analysis has been carried out in a neurodevelopmental disease and certainly in HPRT deficiency, and we suggest that it is of great value to workers in this field that we have documented the broad transcriptional aberrations induced in many pathways by HPRT deficiency. Our study identifies, for the first time, the many pathways that now can become accessible for deeper functional study and underscores the importance of examining functions in all of these aberrant pathways if we are to understand the very complex mechanisms by which the purine metabolome regulates neurogenesis and its role in the pathogenesis in Lesch Nyhan Disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and neuronal differentiation</title><p>The ESD3 mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) line derived from mouse strain 129s2/SvPas was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and the cells were maintained on primary mouse embryo fibroblast (PMEF) feeder cells in ES medium consisting of Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM)/F12 medium, 20% (v/v) knockout serum replacement (KOSR), 1 mM L-glutamine, 4 ng/ml of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), 1,000U/ml of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids (NEAA), 50 U/ml of penicillin, 50ug/ml of streptomycin and 0.1 mM of 2-mercaptoethanl.

All microarray-based transcriptomic data are accessible through GEO Series accession number (GSE42453), a MIAME compliant database (e.g. ArrayExpress, GEO), as described on the MGED Society website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mged.sourceforge.net/ontologies/">http://mged.sourceforge.net/ontologies/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>RNA-Seq analysis</title><p>For RNA-Seq gene expression analysis of cells during differentiation from SNM to the final neuronal differentiation stage, total RNAs were collected as for microarray analysis during SNM differentiation at days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14. Purified RNAs derived from each time point in each condition were pooled and applied for RNA sequencing in the UCSD Biogem Illumina core facility. Library preparation was performed with TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 of Illumina (San Diego), and the prepared libraries were validated and quantified with Agilent Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara). The RIN was 9.5&#x000b1;0.5. To quantify and qualify the DNA library before sequencing, quantitative PCR and Nanodrop/Bioanalyzer analyses were carried out and the validated library was applied to the HiSeq 2000 sequencer of Illumina for 50 cycles of single lane run. Twenty libraries were applied to four sequencing lanes evenly in a flow cell and five samples in a lane were distinguished by using index libraries. Raw sequencing data (fastq.gz file) were generated by CASAVA 1.8.2 pipeline provided by Illumina and aligned onto NCBI37/mm9 mouse genome using ELAND (Illumina) alignment algorism in the pipeline (txt.gz file).</p><p>Aligned data including all aligned reads, the partial reads, novel gene and exons were imported to Avadis NGS 1.3.1 (Strand Scientific Intelligence, San Francisco). An average of 15 million reads by Illumina tile plot filter were applied to following analysis. The parameters used for finding novel genes and exons included one 10<sup>th</sup> of minimum exon, intron and gene lengths, one 50<sup>th</sup> of minimum exon and gene RPKM (<underline>r</underline>eads aligned <underline>p</underline>er <underline>k</underline>ilobases per <underline>m</underline>illion mapped), one 75<sup>th</sup> of minimum exon RPKM w.r.t. host gene and one 90<sup>th</sup> of maximum intron length, were specified. The normalization algorithm was DESeq (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">http://www.bioconductor.org/</ext-link>). To remove very low signal entities, total detected entities were filtered by gene expression values (upper cut-off 100<sup>th</sup> and lower cut-off 20<sup>th</sup> percentile) and required at least one out of two samples to have values within that range. To detect differential gene expression during neuronal differentiation, changes either &#x02265;1.5 or &#x02265;2.0 fold between control and HPRT knockdown conditions were selected. Analyses of GO, GSEA and signaling pathways were carried out using the Avadis NGS 1.3.1 (Strand Scientific Intelligence) and the PANTHER Classification System (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pantherdb.org/">http://www.pantherdb.org/</ext-link>). All transcriptomic data are MIAME compliant and raw data were deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Trapnell1">[54]</xref> and are accessible through GEO Series accession number (GSE42662), a MIAME compliant database (e.g. ArrayExpress, GEO), as detailed on the MGED Society website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mged.sourceforge.net/ontologies/">http://mged.sourceforge.net/ontologies/</ext-link>).</p><p>Canonical pathways from MSigDB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Liberzon1">[14]</xref> were also analyzed. For this analysis, over 98% of short reads were mapped to NCBI mm9 transcripts using Tophat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Trapnell2">[55]</xref>; gene-level RPKM values were provided by Cufflinks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Trapnell3">[56]</xref>; and gene-level differential expression log-ratios, z-scores, and p-values for knockdown vs. control at each time point were estimated by Cuffdiffs. The day 6 data appeared to be a highly discrepant outlier and were omitted. Pathways were required to have at least 10 observed genes, yielding 802 for testing. For each pathway, two tests were performed: shift-of-mean, for overall up- or down-regulation of the entire pathway, and polarization, for subsets of genes with strong up-regulation and down-regulation within a single pathway. Both tests used parametric statistics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Irizarry1">[15]</xref> and corrected for gene non-independence by permutation.</p><p>The test statistic for shift-of-means was <italic>S</italic> &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; S<italic><sub>gt</sub>z<sub>gt</sub></italic>/(<italic>GT</italic>)<sup>1/2</sup>, where <italic>z<sub>gt</sub></italic>is the z-score for wild-type (WT) vs. knockdown (KD) for gene <italic>g</italic> at time <italic>t</italic>, and the sum is over the <italic>G</italic> genes in a pathway and <italic>T</italic> total time points, and using if the z-scores are independent and identically distributed standard normal, the normalization by (<italic>GT</italic>)<sup>1/2</sup> yields a standard normal. To correct for non-independence, however, we performed all 2<sup>9</sup> sample-level permutations by swapping WT and KD labels within time points, corresponding to negating all z-scores at that time point, but excluded the permutations equivalent to the observed data and to the negation of the observed data. The mean m and variance s<sup>2</sup> of <italic>S</italic> were computed for each pathway individually from the 510 permutations; <italic>S</italic> for each pathway was converted to a z-score (<italic>S</italic>&#x02013;m)/s; and a two-sided p-value for <italic>S</italic>&#x02260;mwas calculated from the standard normal distribution. The p-value for one false discovery was estimated as 1/(number of pathways tested), or 1/802. No pathway was significant at this level, but 9 pathways were significant at two false discoveries, equivalent to a false-discovery rate of 0.22.</p><p>The test statistic for polarization was <italic>P</italic> &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; [S<italic><sub>g</sub></italic> (<italic>z<sub>g</sub></italic>&#x02013;z)<sup>2</sup>&#x02013; (<italic>G</italic>&#x02013;1)]/[2(<italic>G&#x02013;</italic>1)], where the z-score for a gene is <italic>z<sub>g</sub></italic> &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; S<italic><sub>t</sub>z<sub>gt</sub></italic>/<italic>T</italic><sup>1/2</sup>, and the mean dysregulation for a pathway is z &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; S<italic><sub>g</sub>z<sub>g</sub></italic>/<italic>G</italic>. If the <italic>z<sub>gt</sub></italic> values are independent, identically distributed standard normal, then S<italic><sub>g</sub></italic> (<italic>z<sub>g</sub></italic>&#x02013;z)<sup>2</sup> follows a chi-square distribution with <italic>G</italic>&#x02013;1 degrees of freedom; subtracting the mean <italic>G</italic>&#x02013;1 and dividing by variance 2(<italic>G</italic>&#x02013;1) gives a test statistic that approaches a standard normal. To correct for non-independence, the mean m and variance s<sup>2</sup> of <italic>P</italic> were computed for each pathway with permutations; <italic>P</italic> was converted to a z-score as (<italic>P</italic>&#x02013;m)/s; and the one-sided p-value for <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;m was calculated from the standard normal distribution. At one false discovery, 24 pathways were significant, equivalent to a false-discovery rate of 0.042.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>Cells maintained on Matrigel-coated coverslips (BD Biosciences, San Jose, California, USA) were stained and examined as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0074967-Irizarry1">[15]</xref>.
