In both species, high single mutant fitness defect, protein disorder, pleiotropy, protein-protein interaction network degree, and low expression variation were significantly predictive of genetic interaction degree. A comparison of the predicted genetic interaction degrees of <italic>S. pombe </italic>genes to the degrees of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>orthologs revealed functional rewiring of specific biological processes that distinguish these two species. Finally, predicted differences in genetic interaction degree were independently supported by differences in co-expression relationships of the two species.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings show that there are common relationships between gene properties and genetic interaction network topology in two evolutionarily distant species.

However, rare combinations of singly benign genetic variation can lead to synergistic effects, such as synthetic lethality, where mutations in two genes, neither of which is lethal independently, combine to generate an inviable double-mutant phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Because natural variations that distinguish two people occur relatively frequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and complex genetic interactions may underlie most individual phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], understanding the general principles that govern genetic networks may be critical for solving the genotype-to-phenotype problem and implementing personal medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Recently, we tested approximately 5.4 million <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>gene pairs for genetic interactions, mapping an extensive network of more than 100,000 interactions by synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The study discovered both negative genetic interactions, instances in which a double mutant exhibits a more extreme phenotype than the expected combined effect of the single mutants, as well as positive genetic interactions, instances in which a double mutant exhibits a less-pronounced phenotype than expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This study revealed the distribution of genetic interactions with respect to gene function, highlighting a central role for chromatin-related, transcription, and secretory functions. Additionally, it identified several fundamental physiological and evolutionary gene properties that are significantly correlated with genetic interaction degree in the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>genetic interaction network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. For example, we showed that the genetic interaction degree of a gene is highly correlated with single mutant fitness, such that genes with a substantial fitness defect show a large number of genetic interactions.</p><p>While genetic interactions have been the most extensively studied in the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, there is intense interest in developing and applying large-scale screening technologies in other species. For example, large studies have already been completed in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and human cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Although definitive comparative analysis of these networks across species would be premature given the sparsity of known interactions in species other than <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, there have been preliminary comparative studies. In particular, the yeast <italic>S. pombe </italic>provides an attractive setting for this analysis due to the availability of a genome-wide deletion mutant collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and scalable technology for automated genetic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and <italic>S. pombe </italic>are estimated to have diverged approximately 500 million years ago and display markedly different physiological properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] but share 75% of their gene content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The two comparative studies to date estimated approximately 30% conservation of individual negative genetic interactions, but also found substantial differences between the two species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These studies demonstrate the power and necessity of comparative analysis of genetic interaction networks, but have conducted only limited sampling of genetic interactions in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. The properties of these networks that are conserved across species and the rules governing their evolution remain largely open questions, making further characterization of the evolution of genetic interaction networks important.</p><p>In this study, we build predictive models capturing the relationship between gene properties and genetic interaction network connectivity, demonstrating that a small set of properties can accurately predict degree in the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>genetic interaction network. We show that models built from the genome-scale <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>genetic interaction network also successfully predict genetic interaction degree of <italic>S. pombe </italic>genes, the vast majority of which have not previously been screened for interactions. Finally, we use our model to predict differences between the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pombe </italic>and the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>networks, some of which may be reflective of functional rewiring and physiological differences between the species, and show that these differences are independently supported by the divergence of co-expression networks based on comparative analysis of gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Modeling interaction degree in the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>genetic interaction network</title><p>Highly connected genes in the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>genetic interaction network are often associated with slow-growing single mutants, protein products with disordered structure, gene pleiotropy as indicated by multiple Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, high connectivity in the physical interaction network, slower rates of evolution, and low expression variation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>; Materials and methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], as well as a number of other sequence- and experimental-based gene features (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

features that are predictive of negative genetic interaction degree (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Regression trees are built by repeatedly splitting sets of training genes, according to the values of gene features, until genes are sorted into small sets that each contain genes with similar genetic interaction degrees. The hierarchy of gene sets produced is visualized as a binary tree and the final sets of genes are each associated with linear regression models that assign predictions to query genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Bootstrapped subsets of the training data were used to build an ensemble of regression trees; this use of multiple models, bootstrap aggregation, is a typical method for building a robust predictive model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] (Materials and methods).</p><p>To validate our approach, we used our model to predict negative genetic interaction degree for all genes in the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>genetic interaction network (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>; Materials and methods). A high correlation (r = 0.80, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-324</sup>) was observed between predicted and actual genetic interaction degrees of genes not used in training the models, indicating that our model accurately reflects topological features of the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>genetic interaction network (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). A strength of this type of model, in addition to providing degree predictions for previously unseen genes, is that the learned tree structures highlight rules consisting of combinations of gene features that explain variation in degree (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Predicting genetic interaction degree in a distantly related species</title><p>If the rules governing genetic network topology are conserved, then a model based on <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>gene features should be predictive of genetic interaction degree in other organisms. To test this, we examined the same gene features of <italic>S. pombe </italic>genes that we found to be predictive of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>interaction degree, including a quantitative measurement of single mutant fitness defects across the genome (Materials and methods). Surprisingly, comparative analysis of the various features between pairs of orthologs revealed that a number of non-sequence-based features are only modestly conserved between the two yeast species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>; Materials and methods). For example, we found a significant but relatively weak correlation in single mutant fitness (Pearson's r = 0.20, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-8</sup>) between 1,100 one-to-one orthologous gene pairs for which we could derive fitness measurements in both yeasts. The lack of strong conservation of deletion mutant fitness is somewhat surprising given that approximately 80% of <italic>S. pombe </italic>orthologs of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>essential genes have conserved essentiality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, while <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and <italic>S. pombe </italic>share a common set of genes that are indispensable for viability, our findings suggest that the severity of fitness defects imposed by the deletion of orthologous non-essential genes for growth under standard laboratory conditions is not well conserved. Other gene properties, including protein-protein interaction degree, dN/dS, and multifunctionality, exhibit a similar lack of conservation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Cross-species analysis of the predictive model for genetic interactions</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>Pearson correlations between one-to-one <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and <italic>S. pombe </italic>orthologs for their values of gene features.

Within-species predictions for <italic>S. pombe </italic>interaction degrees are not significantly more accurate than predictions made by the cross-species model (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>, left side, compare red and light blue bars). We also note that although a simplistic predictor that maps the degree of a <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>gene directly to its <italic>S. pombe </italic>ortholog provides reasonable performance (Pearson correlation approximately 0.4), this strategy is out-performed by our cross-species model and is limited to conserved genes. Strikingly, the models trained on <italic>S. pombe </italic>interactions and features were also able to predict interaction degree in the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>network with high accuracy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>, right side, compare red and light blue bars). In general, interaction degree predictions for <italic>S. pombe </italic>genes were weaker than <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>interaction degree predictions, which may reflect the limited functional diversity of available <italic>S. pombe </italic>genetic interaction studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Nonetheless, the ability to predict interaction degree using features measured in either yeast species is evidence that relationships between genetic interactions and fundamental physiological and evolutionary properties are generally conserved.</p><p>The strong correlation between single mutant fitness defect and negative genetic interaction degree has the unsurprising consequence that the models are considerably influenced by this feature. To explore the reliance of our model on fitness defect, we constructed two types of bootstrapped regression tree models that were trained on all features except fitness defect. The first of these additional models is trained to predict negative genetic interaction degrees and is able to successfully make both within- and cross-species predictions (Figure S1 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The second model was trained to predict the residual negative genetic interaction degree that remained after subtracting degree predictions made from a regression tree model that was trained on the single feature single mutant fitness defect. The prediction of these residuals by the remaining features was also significant (Figure S2 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). We therefore consider the inclusion of many other features to be a worthwhile part of our model, since they capture aspects of genetic interaction degree that fitness defect alone does not.</p></sec><sec><title>Validating predictions with <italic>S. pombe </italic>whole-genome screens</title><p>As an independent validation of our model, we conducted genome-wide <italic>S. pombe </italic>genetic interaction screens.

Grouping genes with the same observed degree, we found that the distributions of our predictions were reflective of actual degrees (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). For example, the median degree percentile predicted for genes with a degree of one was approximately 0.72, while the median prediction for genes with zero interactions was approximately 0.42. Importantly, the significance of the correlation was robust to the choice of interaction cutoff and persisted for a higher-confidence, sparser network (Materials and methods).</p></sec><sec><title>Identifying network rewiring suggested by cross-species predictions</title><p>Although many individual genes are conserved, yeast genetic interaction networks may have undergone substantial rewiring, as only approximately 30% of the interactions are conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Similarly, a low conservation of genetic interactions has also been observed between <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and <italic>C. elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. To examine the extent of network rewiring, we first inferred interaction degrees for the entire <italic>S. pombe </italic>genome using our cross-species model. Because the predictions do not depend on sequence orthologs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a, c</xref>), they can be used to compare the topologies of the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and <italic>S. pombe </italic>networks even though only a small fraction of the <italic>S. pombe </italic>network has been screened.</p><p>We found several instances where the predicted interaction degree for a given <italic>S. pombe </italic>gene was quite different from the observed degree of its <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>ortholog, suggesting that the gene acquired or lost interactions differentially as the species diverged. To identify larger functional modules that were targets of this rewiring, we grouped functionally related genes according to a catalog of 65 annotated protein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and 545 GO biological process annotations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] (Materials and methods), and compared the median interaction degrees determined for orthologous protein complexes and functional groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>; Figure S3 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Many groups of functionally related genes and several complexes were statistically indistinguishable in terms of network connectivity, indicating that these modules act either as network hubs in both species or non-hubs in both species.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Global analysis of rewiring based on whole-genome predictions in <italic>S. pombe</italic></bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>Points in the scatter plot each represent groups of between 2 and 22 genes whose protein products are in the same protein complex (Materials and methods). Darker color represents complexes that are predicted to have significant rewiring. Generally, genes in complexes that fall on the diagonal are predicted to have conserved degrees, while those that fall off-diagonal show evidence for large degree differences between the two species. Significantly rewired complexes (at a threshold of 0.05) are labeled by their names. <bold>(b) </bold>To validate our predicted rewired genes, we constructed separate networks of co-expression relationships among genes for each yeast species, then labeled genes according to our rewiring designation. Only one-to-one orthologs that are non-essential in both species were included in the networks. Edges in the co-expression network were classified by whether involved genes were both rewired, only one was rewired, or neither was rewired. We then calculated fractions of conserved co-expression relationships between species within each of these classes. <bold>(c) </bold>There is a clear relationship between these classes of edges and their conservation across the two yeast species. For rewiring at four levels of magnitude, we counted the number of conserved edges (among all edges in the union of the two networks). A conserved edge appears in the networks of both species and a non-conserved edge appears in exactly one. The magnitude of rewiring increases along the x-axis for the rewired class (differences of &#x0003e; 30, &#x0003e; 55, &#x0003e; 80, &#x0003e; 105 interactions), but the non-rewired class is defined as the set of ortholog pairs with less than a 30-edge difference in degree. Edges in the two rewired classes consistently showed significantly lower levels of conservation than edges in the non-rewired class (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01, Fisher's exact test). Error bars show the binomial proportion 95% confidence interval. The dashed line is the expected rate of conservation if edges are randomized in one of the co-expression networks. There are 12,472 edges among 509 genes in the conserved-conserved network.

These predicted-rewired groups represent complexes or biological processes that may have evolutionarily diverged in terms of their importance in the genetic interaction network, acting as hubs in one species but not in the other. In particular, we found that 11 of 65 (17%) protein complexes and 44 of 545 (8%) GO biological processes may have undergone significant rewiring (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>; Figure S3 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) at a level of significance expected to identify only 3 and 27 (5%) rewired modules, respectively. For example, components of the dynactin complex are hub genes in the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>genetic interaction network (complex average of 85th percentile; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>) whereas the orthologous genes were predicted to exhibit average connectivity in the <italic>S. pombe </italic>genetic interaction network (complex average of approximately 50th percentile; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). Dynactin, a multi-subunit protein complex known for interacting with dynein and enabling long-range movement along microtubules (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]), has been implicated in a <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>cell cycle checkpoint pathway that arrests cell cycle progression in response to perturbations in cell wall synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A similar checkpoint has not been reported in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, suggesting that the difference in the number of genetic interactions observed across species may reflect a dynactin-specific role in monitoring <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>cell wall integrity.</p><p>In addition to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>-specific genetic interaction hubs, we also identified gene groups predicted to be hubs in the <italic>S. pombe </italic>but not observed as such in the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>genetic network. One such case is the calcineurin-associated protein complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). A difference in network connectivity might reflect a unique role for calcineurin in the regulation of bi-polar growth activation in <italic>S. pombe </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Unlike an <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>cell, which grows predominantly via an actin-dependent budding mechanism, an <italic>S. pombe </italic>cell grows in a highly polarized bi-polar manner from its two ends. Following cell division, cell growth is initiated from the old end first, and later, after completion of S phase, from the newer end that forms at the site of cell septation (referred to as new end take off, or NETO). Calcineurin has been shown to play an important role in the delay of NETO by directly dephosphorylating critical targets involved in microtubule dynamics at the site of cell growth. This mechanism is dependent on activation of Cds1 kinase, best known for its role in the intra-S phase DNA replication checkpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. A connection between the intra-S phase checkpoint and inhibition of bipolar growth activation is so far unique to <italic>S. pombe </italic>and distinct from the checkpoint controls operating in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Additionally, calcineurin is dispensable for growth in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]; in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, its deletion leads to defects in cell growth, cytokinesis, cell polarity, mating, and spindle pole body positioning, which are widespread effects consistent with its hub-like activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>While our method of identifying rewired modules reports several statistically significant differences, we note two caveats in interpreting these results. First, since degrees of genes within functional modules may be systematically poorly predicted, our procedure may incorrectly identify modules as significantly rewired in cases where our test statistic would also have indicated that the within-species difference between predicted and observed degree was significant. Therefore, as a control, a version of this rewiring experiment that compares observed and predicted <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>degrees will enable identification of cases that do not reflect true cross-species rewiring (Figure S4a, b in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Second, due to variations in the experimental protocol for measuring genetic interactions, there are differences in the media on which fitness defects were measured in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and <italic>S. pombe</italic>, which may also contribute to apparent rewiring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Functional properties of genes can be captured by many types of biological networks, so we turned to an independent dataset for confirmation of our rewiring predictions. To enable a comparative analysis of gene expression profiles across the two yeasts, we constructed a species-specific <italic>S. pombe </italic>co-expression network using a previously published approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and large collections of publicly available expression data (Materials and methods), and obtained a previously published <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Each species' network contains 832 genes that are one-to-one orthologs between the two yeasts and connected genes are those pairs that have high co-expression values surpassing a threshold of the 95th percentile. At our selected density of 0.05, there are approximately 17,000 edges in each network. In general, we found evidence of conservation between the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and <italic>S. pombe </italic>networks: co-expression edges between two genes occurred in both networks for 9.2% of the gene pairs that were co-expressed in at least one network. This is about twice the background conservation rate of approximately 4.3%, as determined through comparison to a randomized network produced by a degree-preserving procedure.</p><p>To explore the connection between genes predicted to be rewired in the genetic interaction networks and differences between the co-expression networks, rewiring predictions were overlaid on the co-expression networks. Specifically, all non-essential one-to-one orthologs were classified as either rewired or non-rewired based on our prediction of genetic interaction degree (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). Using this rewiring labeling, we measured the conservation rate of three types of co-expression edges: co-expression edges connecting two non-rewired genes, connecting two rewired genes, and connecting rewired and non-rewired genes.</p><p>We found that co-expression edges involving predicted rewired genes are consistently less conserved than edges with exclusively non-rewired endpoints (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>), a trend that is robust over different co-expression thresholds used for network sparsification (Figure S5 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). For example, when genes whose degrees differ by 55 interactions or more are considered rewired, 6.9% of the co-expression relationships connecting rewired genes are conserved (107 of 1,659), in contrast to the significantly higher 10.1% of co-expression relationships that are conserved between non-rewired genes (1,238 of 12,472, Fisher's exact test <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-6</sup>). This trend grows stronger when considering genes that were predicted to have even larger differences between <italic>S. pombe </italic>and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. This analysis independently confirms predictions of highly rewired genes between the two species and suggests that changes at the level of gene expression regulation are at least one mechanistic factor that contributes to these differences.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although individual interactions and gene-specific properties may not be strongly conserved between species, our findings suggest that these properties influence genetic interaction networks in a similar manner. For example, while the genes important for normal growth may vary, the relationship between a gene's fitness contribution and the genetic interactions it exhibits appears to be conserved. Indeed, models trained on both <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>- and <italic>S.pombe</italic>-derived gene properties were significantly predictive of cross-species genetic interaction degree (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>), suggesting that the general principles governing genetic interaction network structure are retained through evolution. Thus, a complete genetic interaction network for an organism such as <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>should serve as a reference network to guide studies to uncover genetic interactions in more complex systems. Predicting specific pairwise interactions across species is of course the next (more difficult) challenge, but models that can accurately predict the variation in number of interactions across the genome provide a foundation for cross-species interaction analysis. Our results also demonstrate that integrative comparisons leveraging multiple functional genomic datasets across species may be one approach to build confidence in differential network analysis. As more data become available, both the extent and nature of network conservation should reveal how functional conservation and divergence can be recognized and utilized in distantly related species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Gene features</title><p>Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> contains values of gene features for all <italic>S. pombe </italic>genes and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> contains values of gene features for all <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast conservation</title><p>Yeast conservation is a count of how many of 23 different species of Ascomycota fungi possess an ortholog of a given gene.

Following mating and sporulation, haploid meiotic progeny harboring both the <italic>kanMX4 </italic>and <italic>natMX4 </italic>markers are selected and colony sizes are measured after applying standard normalization procedures. We have previously shown that colony sizes derived from these control screens reflect fitness defect of the <italic>kanMX4</italic>-marked single mutant strains that comprise the deletion mutant array. Fitness estimates were based on four control screens as described above and combined with five mutant screens (prz1, res2, SPAC1687.22c, SPCC1682.08, and SPAC6G9.14), which contained the dominant drug-resistance marker (<italic>natMX4</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>fitness defect values, defined quantitatively in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], were published in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and experimental procedures are detailed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. As in the <italic>S. pombe </italic>protocol described above, SGA was used to insert a neutral query marker into mutant strains so that we could observe colony growth for each mutant in the deletion collection under the effects of only the single deletion. Fitness estimates are based on a large number of replicate screens.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein-protein interaction degree</title><p>The protein-protein interaction degree of each gene's protein is the number of physical interactions reported in BioGRID, version 2.0.58 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Interactions considered physical were restricted to those identified by the following terms: Affinity Capture-MS, Affinity Capture-RNA, Affinity Capture-Western, Biochemical Activity, Co-crystal Structure, Co-fractionation, Co-localization, Co-purification, Far Western, FRET, PCA, Protein-peptide, Protein-RNA, Reconstituted Complex, and Two-hybrid.</p></sec><sec><title>Multifunctionality</title><p>Multifunctionality is a measure of the number of GO terms that are annotated to a gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. From GeneDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and Saccharomyces Genome Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] gene association files (download in November 2009) for <italic>S. pombe </italic>and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, respectively, redundant terms - one term from pairs of terms that are considered 'alternative ids' - were removed before totaling the number of GO term annotations for each gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic interaction degrees</title><p>Negative genetic interaction degrees of <italic>S. pombe </italic>genes were derived from interactions reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Only those interactions with S-scores &#x02264; -2.5 were considered. This dataset contains 551 genes that are involved in chromosome function; intentionally included are approximately 100 genes that participate in processes present in both <italic>S. pombe </italic>and human, but importantly, are not present in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>(for example, RNA interference machinery).</p><p>Negative genetic interaction degrees of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>) were collected from the measurements reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], which screened for interactions involving 3,456 array genes, 1,438 of which have <italic>S. pombe </italic>orthologs. As suggested by the authors, only negative interactions with an epsilon value of &#x02264; -0.08 and a <italic>P</italic>-value cutoff &#x0003c; 0.05 were considered. This dataset includes degree measurements for most non-essential genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Orthologs</title><p>Orthology mappings (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>) are from the InParanoid eukaryotic ortholog database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Although the InParanoid algorithm produces clusters, our analysis depends on ortholog pairs. To calculate correlations between <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and <italic>S. pombe </italic>for each of the gene features (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>), only genes in one-to-one orthology mappings were used. When holding out orthologs for degree prediction in a set of 'species-specific' genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>), all genes that had any number of orthologs were removed. Since InParanoid may not report orthologs that other algorithms have detected, we took a conservative approach by additionally removing any genes that had an ortholog in the pombe database GeneDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], which includes manually curated orthologs.</p></sec><sec><title>Models and evaluation</title><p>Our models are bagged regression trees that use the 16 features described above (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>). Breiman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] suggests that using an ensemble of only 25 classifiers can result in nearly all improvement gains that bagging can produce over a single classifier; however, we used 100 trees because the computation required in training is relatively low and we were interested in analyzing the tree structures. Individual trees were trained by MATLAB's classregtree function, which minimizes node impurity according to mean squared error. For each tree, a bootstrap sample was used to select, with replacement, a set of training genes the same size as the set of total genes (therefore each tree is trained on approximately 63.2% of all genes) and held out genes. The final prediction for a single gene of the species used to train the model (that is, the within-species prediction) is the median of all predictions from trees for which the gene was not in the training set (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>). The final prediction for a gene of the species not used to train the model (that is, the cross-species prediction) is the median of predictions from all trees (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>).</p><p>To assess the performance of the model, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and actual degrees of genes with known degrees. To estimate stability of performance, we repeated the model construction and evaluation 25 times and reported predictive ability as the mean Pearson correlation coefficient and its standard deviation across all 25 repetitions for within- and cross-species cases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>S. pombe </italic>genetic interaction screens</title><p>Eight whole-genome <italic>S. pombe </italic>genetic interaction screens were completed using the method described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The query strains were deletion mutants for each of the following genes: SPCC1682.08c, SPBC21D10.12, SPBC13E7.09, SPAC4G8.13c, SPAC3A11.13, SPAC27D7.13c, SPAC22F3.09c, SPAC16A10.07c. The resulting double mutant colonies were processed as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Negative interactions were derived from the scores by applying an interaction cutoff of &#x02264; -0.08 and a <italic>P</italic>-value cutoff of &#x0003c; 0.05. Degree measurements were then derived for all non-essential genes by counting the number of significant interactions across the set of eight queries (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). Significant correlation with the predicted degrees was also observed when a stricter cutoff was applied (interaction score &#x02264; -0.12, <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05 yielded a correlation r = 0.41, <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c; 10<sup>-117</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Rewiring groups and significance assessment</title><p>To make comparisons between degrees of orthologs in the genetic interaction networks of the two yeast species, we considered genetic interaction degree to be predicted percentile for all <italic>S. pombe </italic>genes, while percentiles of actual degrees were used for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>To search for groups of functionally related genes that have been rewired since the divergence of <italic>S. pombe </italic>and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we defined gene groups in two ways. The first simply grouped genes whose protein products form a complex in a set of complexes defined in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>). The number of proteins per complex ranges from 2 to 81, with the vast majority having 6 or fewer proteins.</p><p>The second method for making sets of functionally related genes grouped genes that share a biological process GO term annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S11">11</xref>). We considered GO terms that are annotated to greater than 3 and fewer than 50 genes in either of the two species. Additionally, a group of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>genes was required to have a minimum number of two genes with known genetic interaction degrees; a group of <italic>S. pombe </italic>genes was required to have a minimum of two genes with known fitness defect. Since GO terms tend to be highly redundant, we filtered gene groups so that no pair of groups overlapped by more than 50% of either group's genes.</p><p>To determine orthologous pairs of groups that have significantly different average degrees, we calculated the difference between the median degrees of genes in each species' group, and then compared the differences to a distribution of differences produced from randomly grouped genes. We generated this background by creating groups of randomly selected genes in one species, then identifying orthologous groups in the other species composed of the selected genes' orthologs. A query gene-group pair was compared to a background containing only random gene-group pairs whose group sizes were identical to the query groups. For example, a protein complex of five individual <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>proteins may contain four genes that have <italic>S. pombe </italic>orthologs; this query gene-group pair would be compared with a background of groups with five random <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>genes matched with a group of four of their <italic>S. pombe </italic>orthologs.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparative analysis of co-expression networks</title><p>To independently validate genetic interaction degree differences across species, we performed a comparative analysis of co-expression networks of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and <italic>S. pombe </italic>genes. The <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>network was previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and is based on integration of a large collection of expression datasets. To construct the <italic>S. pombe </italic>network (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>), data from nine expression studies were collected from the GEO database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S13">13</xref>). Genes with missing values for more than 30% of the samples were removed, and the remaining missing values in each dataset were imputed using KNNImpute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Datasets reflecting probe intensities (rather than relative ratios) were log-transformed. After processing, the nine <italic>S. pombe </italic>expression datasets were integrated as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. The naive Bayes approach for dataset integration requires a gold standard set of positives, for which we used direct gene co-annotation to any term in the GO that contained between 2 and 100 genes. <italic>S. pombe </italic>gene annotations were downloaded from the GO website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] in May 2011. All analysis and integration of expression data were completed using the Sleipnir library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>We applied a 95th percentile cutoff to edges in both the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and <italic>S. pombe </italic>co-expression networks, such that only the highest scoring 5% of edges were retained.</p><p>To estimate the overlap between the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and <italic>S. pombe </italic>networks in the absence of biological conservation, we randomized the edges of the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>network and considered the background conservation to be the overlap between this randomized network and the <italic>S. pombe </italic>network. The randomizing procedure repeatedly chose two random edges and exchanged an endpoint of one edge with an endpoint of the other edge, thus maintaining the degrees of genes in the network. The number of endpoint swaps performed was 20 times the number of edges in the network, which is a sufficient number of swaps to remove the original relationships between genes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>GEO: Gene Expression Omnibus; GO: Gene Ontology; NETO: new end take off; SGA: Synthetic Genetic Array.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>EK, JB, CLM, MC, CB and BJA conceived the study and planned the analysis.
