    "Because colorectal cancer (CRC) stem-like cells (CCS-like cells) contribute to poor patient prognosis, these cells are a potential target for CRC therapy. However, the mechanism underlying the maintenance of CCS-like cell properties remains unclear. Here, we found that patients with advanced stage CRC expressed high levels of polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2). High expression of EZH2 in tumor tissues correlated with poor patient prognosis. Conversely, silencing EZH2 reduced CRC cell proliferation. Surprisingly, EZH2 was more highly expressed in the CCS-like cell subpopulation than in the non-CCS-like cell subpopulation. EZH2 knockdown significantly reduced the CD133+/CD44+ subpopulation, suppressed mammosphere formation, and decreased the expression of self-renewal-related genes and strongly impaired tumor-initiating capacity in a re-implantation mouse model. Gene expression data from 433 human CRC specimens from TCGA database and in vitro results revealed that EZH2 helped maintain CCS-like cell properties by activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. We further revealed that p21cip1-mediated arrest of the cell cycle at G1/S phase is required for EZH2 activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Moreover, the specific EZH2 inhibitor EPZ-6438, a clinical trial drug, prevented CRC progression. Collectively, these findings revealed EZH2 maintaining CCS-like cell characteristics by arresting the cell cycle at the G1/S phase. These results indicate a new approach to CRC therapy."
