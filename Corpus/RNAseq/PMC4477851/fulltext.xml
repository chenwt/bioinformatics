When cell migration goes awry, developmental defects and disease can occur. Problems in cell migration occur not only through failures in motility, but also through failure to recognize and respond to directional cues such as growth factors or ECM. Effective cell migration relies on proper regulation and coordination of actin networks. One such actin population is the branched actin network generated by the Arp2/3 complex (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Pollard, 2007</xref>). Branched actin is found in the lamellipodium and is generated by activation of Arp2/3 by nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs) like SCAR/WAVE and WASP (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Rotty et al., 2013</xref>). Once active, Arp2/3 can nucleate a &#x0201c;daughter&#x0201d; filament at a characteristic angle of &#x0223c;78&#x000b0; from the original &#x0201c;mother filament&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Rouiller et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The process of branched actin generation has been well studied, but less is known about how branched actin is disassembled. Coronin 1B was identified as having debranching activity through antagonizing the branch-stabilizing protein cortactin, as well as destabilizing the branch itself (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Coronin 1B has also been found to regulate ADF/cofilin activity at the leading edge via the slingshot phosphatase (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2007</xref>). Cofilin binds to actin filaments and severs them at low filament occupancy, but in vitro work shows that high occupancy of a filament by cofilin causes Arp2/3 debranching (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2009</xref>). Recently, the cofilin-related protein glia maturation factor (GMF) has been implicated in Arp2/3 regulation (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Gandhi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ydenberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Luan and Nolen, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Unlike cofilin, GMF has no actin binding or severing activity in in vitro assays (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Gandhi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Nakano et al., 2010</xref>). However, addition of yeast GMF1 to prepolymerized branched actin filaments resulted in debranching (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Gandhi et al., 2010</xref>). At high concentrations, GMF can also compete with NPFs for Arp2/3 complex binding, preventing branch formation (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Gandhi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Nakano et al., 2010</xref>). This is thought to occur through one interface on GMF blocking the NPF WCA domain C-helix binding site on the Arp2/3 complex (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ydenberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Luan and Nolen, 2013</xref>). A separate site on GMF is responsible for its debranching activity, which occurs through destabilization of the Arp2/3&#x02013;daughter filament junction (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Luan and Nolen, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ydenberg et al., 2013</xref>). Supporting its role in actin turnover, depletion of GMF has been associated with accumulation of actin patches in yeast and peripheral F-actin in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> S2 cells and border cells (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Nakano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Poukkula et al., 2014</xref>). Recent work in S2 cells shows that GMF localizes to the cell periphery, and its localization appears to increase upon retraction. Furthermore, border cells depleted of GMF have reduced protrusion dynamics early after detachment from the epithelium (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Poukkula et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The two vertebrate GMF isoforms (GMF&#x003b3; and GMF&#x003b2;) are present in a variety of tissues. GMF&#x003b3; is highly expressed in immune cells and vascular endothelium (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2013</xref>), whereas GMF&#x003b2; has high expression in the brain and is ubiquitously expressed in other tissues, as revealed by RNaseq (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2013</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/genes/ENSG00000197045">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/genes/ENSG00000197045</ext-link>). GMF&#x003b3; has previously been implicated in leading edge dynamics, cell migration, and chemotaxis in multiple cell types (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aerbajinai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Lippert and Wilkins, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Poukkula et al., 2014</xref>). Little work has been done on GMF&#x003b2;, despite its homology to GMF&#x003b3;. Here, we provide a systematic analysis of how GMF&#x003b2; affects branched actin, lamellipodial behavior, and directional migration.</p></sec><sec id="s02"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s03"><title>GMF&#x003b2; displays Arp2/3-dependent localization to the leading edge</title><p>GMF&#x003b2; was the only GMF isoform expressed in our IA32 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201501094/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>), but both isoforms share considerable similarity (Fig. S1 B). Because yeast GMF1 and GMF&#x003b3; are reported to bind to the Arp2/3 complex, we reasoned that GMF&#x003b2; should colocalize with branched actin at the leading edge. Indeed, GMF&#x003b2; localized to lamellipodia when visualized by immunostaining for the endogenous protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, top) or by expression of a GMF&#x003b2;-GFP fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, bottom). This localization was lost in IA32 cells depleted of two subunits of the Arp2/3 complex, which lack lamellipodia (Fig. S1 C; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). To ensure that this localization was not an artifact of cell edge ruffling or increased volume at the cell edge, we used ratiometric imaging of cells expressing tRFP (a nonspecific volume marker) and either GFP alone, GMF&#x003b2;-GFP, or a GFP-tagged subunit of Arp2/3 (p34-GFP). With this approach, GFP alone shows no specific edge localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, left two panels; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201501094/DC1" id="supp2">Video 1</ext-link>), whereas both GMF&#x003b2;-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, center; and Video 1) and p34-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, right; and Video 1) show an enhanced lamellipodial signal.</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Small?><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>GMF&#x003b2; localizes to the leading edge of fibroblasts.</bold> (A) GMF&#x003b2; localization by immunofluorescence (IF; top) and in cells expressing GMF&#x003b2;-GFP (bottom).

To synchronize lamellipodia, we used the small molecule inhibitor of Arp2/3, CK-666 (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Nolen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Hetrick et al., 2013</xref>). Cells treated with CK-666 completely lost lamellipodia, which regrew in a synchronized manner upon drug washout (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201501094/DC1" id="supp3">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). Cells remained primarily in the protrusion phase for 10 min after washout, after which retraction and ruffling were observed (unpublished data). Although cortactin returns to the lamellipodia within 1 min of CK-666 washout, GMF&#x003b2; localization is delayed, appearing by 5 min after washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). GMF&#x003b2;&#x02019;s delay in localization suggests that it does not affect the early protrusion phase, and that its localization may be dependent on the age of the branched actin network. This protrusion synchronization protocol was used in combination with contour-erosion&#x02013;based intensity measurements along the lamellipodia (Fig. S1 D) to generate maps of the localization of either GMF&#x003b2;-GFP or GFP alone after 10 min of CK-666 washout (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2007</xref>). While the maximum fluorescence intensity of GFP was measured toward the inside of cells (Fig. S1 E), the maximum GMF&#x003b2;-GFP fluorescence intensity occurred at the edge of cells in a similar pattern to Arp2/3 and actin (Fig. S1 F). These data indicate that GMF&#x003b2; edge localization is specific and dependent on the presence of Arp2/3-branched actin filaments.</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>GMF&#x003b2; is critical for lamellipodial retraction</title><p>We next assessed GMF&#x003b2;&#x02019;s role in lamellipodial dynamics. Using lentiviral expression of an shRNA for GMF&#x003b2;, we created a GMF&#x003b2;-depleted cell line (KD), as well as a GMF&#x003b2;-depleted cell line rescued with an shRNA-resistant GMF&#x003b2;-GFP construct (KDR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). GMF&#x003b2; was barely detectable (&#x0003c;1%) by Western blotting after shRNA expression (Fig. S1 G). An overexpression cell line (OE) was created by lentiviral infection of cells with a GMF&#x003b2;-GFP construct followed by sorting for highly expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The GMF&#x003b2;-depleted cell line displayed a larger spread size with broad lamellipodia in comparison to control cells (CNTL), which could be rescued by expressing shRNA-resistant GMF&#x003b2; (KDR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). Conversely, GMF&#x003b2;-overexpressing cells had a lower spread area and smaller lamellipodia compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). These lamellipodia also behaved differently: GMF&#x003b2;-depleted cells had slower, less dynamic protrusions with little ruffling, whereas GMF&#x003b2;-overexpressing cells had dynamic protrusions with frequent ruffling. We analyzed cells by kymography, which confirmed our visual impressions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). GMF&#x003b2;-depleted cells had a decreased protrusion rate and an increased protrusion distance and duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E&#x02013;G</xref>). More dramatically, depletion of GMF&#x003b2; produced a severe reduction in retraction rate and frequency that could be rescued by reexpression of GMF&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, H and I</xref>). The observed increase in retraction and ruffling behavior in GMF&#x003b2;-overexpressing cells was not due to an actual increase in retraction frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 I</xref>) but instead due to an increase in the distance of each retraction event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 J</xref>). To summarize, GMF&#x003b2;-depleted cells retract slowly and less frequently, but for a longer total distance, whereas GMF&#x003b2;-overexpressing cells retract at the same speed and as frequently as control cells, but for an increased distance per retraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, H&#x02013;J</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Med?><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Changes in GMF&#x003b2; expression level alter cell shape and lamellipodial dynamics.</bold> (A) Western blot showing GMF&#x003b2; expression of created cell lines.

In unsynchronized GMF&#x003b2;-overexpressing cells, however, Arp2/3 intensity remained reduced as in synchronized populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, right). Because synchronization of lamellipodia allows analysis of cells actively engaged in protrusion, our data suggest that GMF&#x003b2;-depleted cells generate branched actin similarly to control cells during this phase. In unsynchronized populations of lamellipodia, we are able to observe cells in mixed states of protrusion and retraction. Because GMF&#x003b2;-depleted cells have an increased accumulation of Arp2/3 complex in an unsynchronized state, this accumulation may be due to a defect in their retraction phase.</p><p>Because we did not observe differences in the width of the branched actin network when GMF&#x003b2; was depleted (despite visible differences in lamellipodia appearance and behavior), we hypothesized that GMF&#x003b2; may instead control the distribution of Arp2/3 laterally.

Using this analysis, we found that GMF&#x003b2;-depleted cells had an increase in Arp2/3-positive cell perimeter compared with control cells, whereas GMF&#x003b2;-overexpressing cells had a reduced Arp2/3-positive cell perimeter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>).</p><p>GMF&#x003b2; is thought to have two branch antagonizing activities: directly destabilizing the existing branch junction and preventing Arp2/3 activation by NPFs (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ydenberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Luan and Nolen, 2013</xref>). The observed changes in Arp2/3 distribution could be due to either or both of these activities. If debranching is a main function of GMF&#x003b2;, then depleting GMF&#x003b2; should lead to observable changes in the branched actin disassembly rate. To measure this, we used CK-666 wash-in to stop creation of new branches while leaving existing branches unaffected (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Hetrick et al., 2013</xref>; Fig. S1 H). Therefore, any decrease in Arp2/3 intensity at the leading edge represents the rate of branch disassembly. Using this technique in cells expressing a GFP-tagged subunit of Arp2/3 (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2012</xref>), we observed an increase in the stability of the Arp2/3 complex upon GMF&#x003b2; depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201501094/DC1" id="supp4">Video 2</ext-link>). This could be observed by measuring both the amount of cell edge positive for Arp2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>) and the intensity of Arp2/3 signal at the edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>). Although we cannot rule out NPF competition using this assay, it is notable that GMF&#x003b2;-overexpressing cells do not display a comparable phenotype to CK-666&#x02013;treated cells. If GMF&#x003b2; is blocking activation of Arp2/3 by NPFs, GMF&#x003b2; overexpression should mimic inhibiting Arp2/3 by CK-666 treatment. While cells treated with CK-666 lose lamellipodia entirely and become dominated by bundled actin structures (Fig. S2 A), GMF&#x003b2;-overexpressing cells retain small dynamic lamellipodia with lower amounts of Arp2/3 complex (Fig. S2 B). Furthermore, if GMF&#x003b2; acts to suppress Arp2/3 activation, we should see an increase in the intensity of Arp2/3 complex signal during the protrusion phase in synchronized GMF&#x003b2;-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, left). Instead, we only observed this increase in intensity when GMF&#x003b2;-depleted cells are unsynchronized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, left). Together, these observations support debranching as the dominant role of GMF&#x003b2; in our cells, and agree with recent in vitro studies showing that GMF had only weak inhibition of nucleation in the presence of the WCA domain of N-WASP, and no inhibition with the WCA domain of WAVE (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Boczkowska et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s06"><title>Mutant GMF&#x003b2; cannot rescue GMF&#x003b2; depletion phenotypes</title><p><xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ydenberg et al. (2013)</xref> created a series of mutations to assess which sites of budding yeast GMF1 were involved in debranching and NPF competition. Two distinct sites were identified: site 1 appears to be required for NPF competition, whereas both sites 1 and 2 are for necessary for debranching. Thus a mutation affecting only debranching could be created. The mutation that caused the largest debranching defect in budding yeast GMF1 was also created in mouse GMF&#x003b3;, where R19, K20, and R22 were changed to alanines and showed defective debranching activity (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ydenberg et al., 2013</xref>). We generated analogous mutations in GMF&#x003b2; (R19A, K20A, and R22A) to test if this mutant could rescue the defects observed in GMF&#x003b2;-depleted fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). We found that this mutant GMF&#x003b2; localized to the leading edge, although less robustly than wild-type (WT) GMF&#x003b2;-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>). We created cell lines with mutant GMF&#x003b2; that were comparable to our existing WT GMF&#x003b2; cell lines. In addition to overexpressing mutant GMF&#x003b2; in cells, a second cell line was made in which endogenous GMF&#x003b2; was depleted by shRNA expression and cells were &#x0201c;rescued&#x0201d; with an shRNA-resistant mutant GMF&#x003b2; (Fig. S2 C). We first compared the overexpression of the mutant GMF&#x003b2; to the overexpression of WT GMF&#x003b2;. In contrast to the overexpression of WT GMF&#x003b2;, overexpression of mutant GMF&#x003b2; increased cell size, reduced lamellipodial retraction rate, and increased Arp2/3-positive cell edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, D, F, and H</xref>). In the depletion-rescue experiment, expression of the mutant GMF&#x003b2; construct did not rescue cell area, retraction rate, or the percentage of Arp2/3-positive cell edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, E, G, and I</xref>). Kymography of protrusion characteristics showed similar, but less pronounced trends in the mutant&#x02019;s inability to rescue depletion of endogenous GMF&#x003b2; or mimic overexpression of WT GMF&#x003b2; (Fig. S2, D&#x02013;I). This suggests that the debranching site of GMF&#x003b2; is critical for its physiological role at the cell edge, and that defects in GMF&#x003b2;-depleted cells result from the loss of debranching activity.</p><fig id="fig4" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Large?><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of a mutant GMF&#x003b2; cannot rescue GMF&#x003b2; depletion.</bold> (A) Sequence alignment of human GMF&#x003b2; (Hs) with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Sc), <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Dm), and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Ce) GMF homologues.

Control cells plated within the same chambers served as internal controls for all experiments, and forward migration index (FMI) was used as a measure of directional motility (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Asokan et al., 2014</xref>). An FMI with 95% confidence intervals (indicated by error bars) encompassing 0 represents the inability to directionally migrate. We tested the ability of GMF&#x003b2;-overexpressing and GMF&#x003b2;-depleted cells to migrate toward soluble cues in the form of a gradient of PDGF (chemotaxis). Consistent with previous findings that Arp2/3-based actin assembly is dispensable for PDGF chemotaxis in fibroblasts (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2012</xref>), both GMF&#x003b2;-overexpressing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>) and GMF&#x003b2;-depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>) cells could migrate up a concentration gradient of PDGF as well as control cells. Next, we assayed GMF&#x003b2;&#x02019;s effect on cells migrating on a gradient of surface-bound ECM (haptotaxis). GMF&#x003b2;-overexpressing cells were unable to haptotax up a gradient of fibronectin in comparison to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Because GMF&#x003b2;-overexpressing cells have less Arp2/3 at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, right), this result agrees with previous data from our laboratory showing that cells depleted of the Arp2/3 complex could not haptotax (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). However, it is important to note that GMF&#x003b2;-overexpressing cells still have lamellipodia containing some Arp2/3, showing that less severe interruption of branched actin can abrogate haptotaxis (Fig. S2 B). Cells depleted of GMF&#x003b2; were also unable to haptotax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>), despite having an increase in both peak Arp2/3 edge intensity and the percentage of Arp2/3-positive cell edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, B and D</xref>). Again, reintroduction of GMF&#x003b2;-GFP into GMF&#x003b2;-depleted cells was able to rescue the defect in haptotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>). These data suggest that the presence of lamellipodia is not sufficient for haptotaxis, and proper regulation of branched actin in the lamellipodia is critical for sensing and/or responding to an ECM gradient.</p><p>This study supports debranching by GMF&#x003b2; as a prominent mechanism in the regulation of branched actin, allowing for appropriate lamellipodial retraction and limiting lateral lamellipodial growth. GMF&#x003b2; does not appear to have significant effects on the protrusion phase of lamellipodial growth, where the effects of NPF competition should be most apparent. GMF&#x003b2; likely acts in concert with other debranching and actin-severing proteins (such as cofilin and coronins), as we observed a partial loss of Arp2/3 complex signal after CK-666 treatment in GMF&#x003b2;-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, F and G</xref>). This implies that there may be a specific fraction of actin branches for which GMF&#x003b2; is crucial for pruning, but other debranching mechanisms may operate in parallel.</p><p>Our observations highlight the importance of the proper regulation of lamellipodia in controlling cell motility. Systems for reinforcing desired lamellipodia and eliminating unproductive lamellipodia are likely crucial for efficient management of actin within the cell and efficient cell migration. Moreover, our results reinforce the critical role that lamellipodia play in sensing and responding to ECM cues. One of the key unanswered questions arising from this work is how GMF&#x003b2; might be regulated. Mechanisms that activate or inhibit GMF&#x003b2;&#x02019;s activity would provide a potent way to regulate lamellipodial behavior and, ultimately, whole cell motility.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s08"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s09"><title>Reagents and materials</title><p>Commercial antibodies were purchased from EMD Millipore (mouse anti-cortactin, rabbit anti-p34-Arc), Sigma-Aldrich (rabbit anti-GMF&#x003b2; [SAB2701114, Western blot; and HPA002954, immunofluorescence]), Takara Bio, Inc.

Cells were imaged for 12 h and then tracked using the Manual Tracking plugin for ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/track/track.html">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/track/track.html</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s19"><title>Cell size analysis</title><p>Phase micrographs of unsynchronized cells were manually outlined in ImageJ and the &#x0201c;measure&#x0201d; function was used to output the total cell area in square micrometers.</p></sec><sec id="s20"><title>CK-666 wash-in</title><p>p34-KDR cells were plated overnight in 8-well chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated with 10 &#x000b5;g/ml fibronectin. Holes were punched through the lid of the chamber slide to allow tubing to be inserted, and this was connected to a syringe filled with CK-666 at 300 &#x000b5;M. An equal volume of CK-666&#x02013;containing media was washed into the existing media in the well to achieve a final concentration of 150 &#x000b5;M. Cells were imaged with epifluorescence in a humidified environmental chamber (37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) on a microscope (IX81; Olympus) using a 60&#x000d7;, 1.49 NA objective lens and a camera (Orca-ER; Hamamatsu Photonics) controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Images were captured at 5-s intervals as drug was applied, and imaging continued for at least 20 min after addition. The resulting live cell movies were analyzed for the percentage of Arp2/3 complex&#x02013;positive edge (see Materials and methods). Because this experiment only allowed us to image a single cell at a time, we also performed a CK-666 wash-in on p34-KDR cells plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips. These cells were treated with CK-666&#x02013;containing media for 1 or 10 min and then fixed immediately. Cells were stained with anti-GFP antibody, mounted, and imaged via confocal microscopy as described previously. p34-GFP intensity was measured from these images using the Edgeratio macro and normalized to the first data point (at &#x02212;3.25 &#x000b5;m from the edge).</p></sec><sec id="s21"><title>Percentage of Arp2/3 complex&#x02013;positive edge analysis</title><p>Maximum-intensity projections of synchronized cells immunostained for the p34 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex were generated as described, and these images were analyzed using a MATLAB (MathWorks) program. K-means clustering was used to automatically segment the cell. A 10-pixel ring around the cell perimeter was defined, and the Arp2/3 signal at least 0.8 standard deviations above the mean was detected. The amount of cell edge marked by this high Arp2/3 signal was divided by the total perimeter of the cell, then multiplied by 100 to calculate the percentage of Arp2/3-positive cell edge.</p></sec><sec id="s22"><title>Directional migration assays</title><p>Directional migration assays were performed as described previously (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In brief, PDMS chambers containing microcapillaries were used to establish a gradient by flowing attractant in the source chamber, and a neutral media in the sink chamber. A constant flow of PDGF was used for the chemotactic gradient, whereas a fibronectin gradient was established for haptotaxis. Control and test cells were plated together in the central chamber containing the gradient, and GFP expression or cell dyes were used to distinguish populations. For chemotaxis experiments, cells were imaged for 24 h using a 20&#x000d7; Olympus objective lens on an inverted microscope (IX81; Olympus) with a humidified environmental chamber (37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) and camera (Orca-ER; Hamamatsu Photonics) controlled by MetaMorph software. For haptotaxis experiments, cells were imaged for 16 h on an incubator microscope system (Vivaview, Olympus; humidified, 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) using a 20&#x000d7; 0.75 NA objective lens with magnification set to 0.5&#x000d7;, which was controlled by MetaMorph. Cells were tracked using the &#x0201c;Manual Tracking&#x0201d; plugin for ImageJ and these tracks were analyzed with the Chemotaxis Tool plugin from Ibidi to obtain forward migration index, persistence, and velocity measurements. Rose plots were generated using the secplot script for MATLAB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/14174-secplot">http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/14174-secplot</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s23"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analysis on generated data were performed using the software Prism (GraphPad Software). Error bars on boxplots represent the 10th&#x02013;90th percentiles. Error bars on xy plots represent the standard error of the mean. Error bars on forward migration index plots represent the 95% confidence intervals. Box plot data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test to determine that individual samples did not come from identical populations. Statistical significance was determined by a Dunn&#x02019;s post-test after the Kruskal-Wallis test was performed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s24"><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows information relevant to GMF&#x003b2; localization and expression in our cell lines, as well as details on the CK-666 wash-in experimental design.
