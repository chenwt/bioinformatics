However, the advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), by decreasing sequencing costs of a factor 1,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], provided the opportunity to sequence the genomes of new organisms (new-models) at different stages of completion. In general, obtaining complete genome sequences for a given organism is immediately followed by the computational and manual annotation of its gene catalog. Genes, in the sense of protein-coding genes, are the major focus of most genome sequencing consortia. Thus, obtaining first a complete transcriptome for an organism, might, in most cases, cover the needs of a specific scientific community. Furthermore, obtaining a good quality reference transcriptome as a first step of a genome sequence project could prove immensely beneficial for gene prediction and annotation.</p><p>The Lepidoptera <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> (Noctuidae) is an intensely studied organism, yet lacking a comprehensive genomic resource. <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>, also known as the Fall Army Worm (FAW) is a noctuid moth, classified as a major crop pest by USDA, INRA and other national agronomic agencies. In the United States and in Brazil, it is a threat to corn but is also found devastating cotton, sorghum and other grass-like crops such as rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Its area of distribution concerns almost the entirety of the American continent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], thus much work has been devoted to study the biology of this insect. In order to improve the tools at our disposal to efficiently understand the biology of <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>, we report here the generation of an NGS-based sequencing of RNA libraries obtained from a large variety and number of tissues and developmental time-points. These libraries have been assembled together in a reference transcriptome, dubbed Sf_TR2012b, comprising around 55,000 sequences available for search through a dedicated database. We further used the Sf_TR2012b assembly to annotate several gene families and study their expression profile. We focused especially on the genes involved in immunity and in olfaction. We validated some of our developmental genes predictions by qPCR to demonstrate that in Sf_TR2012b, some regulated transcripts without clear orthology are <italic>bona fide</italic> functional genes in <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Construction of a reference transcriptome</title><p>The reference transcriptome presented here is named Sf_TR2012b. We incorporated various sources of RNA sequences from 454, Illumina and Sanger sequencing and had to develop a custom pipeline. This assembly is described in details in the Methods section and illustrated in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1. Its assembly has been performed by the software MIRA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and incorporated various sources of RNA sequences obtained from a laboratory strain of <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>. The main source of RNA molecules has been obtained by 454 RNAseq of a library containing cDNA extracted from 27 different samples (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) comprising 14 developmental time-points samples (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, column A) and 13 dissected tissues (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, column B), in order to cover the majority of the mRNA produced by the FAW. First these 454 sequences have been assembled in ~183,000 different clusters, referred to in here, as Sf_GATC_Clusters (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In a subsequent assembly step (see Methods), Sf_GATC_Clusters have been used as input, as well as 10 RNA samples (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, column C), sequenced using the Illumina technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

The final Sf_TR2012b assembly comprises ~55,000 sequences for a total of ~37&#x000a0;M&#x000a0;nt (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Biological samples from which RNA has been extracted for the construction of the reference transcriptome</bold>

We evaluated this improvement by aligning independent Illumina libraries on the different reference transcriptome assemblies using the Bowtie software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. We used 4 .fastq files containing sequences for whole larvae RNA extracted in experimental conditions, which were unrelated to our transcriptome project (N. Volkoff, personal communication), to align the reads against Sf_TR2012b and Sf_GATC_clusters. For all 4 samples, the average of unmapped reads is around 20% when aligned on both assemblies (Sf_GATC_Clusters and Sf_TR2012b) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). However we greatly improved the percentage of uniquely mapped reads from 22% to 45% while decreasing the number of multiple reads from 58% to 32% (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). This indicates that our second step of assembly was particularly effective at eliminating most of the redundancy that one could expect from an organism that is far from being isogenic.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Barplot representing the percentages of multiple hit reads, unmapped reads and uniquely mapped reads, as provided by Bowtie, when aligning an RNAseq library against either the Sf_454_clusters assembly or the Sf_TR2012b assembly.

We thus compared the number of contigs (55,000) and the total size (37&#x000a0;M&#x000a0;nt) of the Sf_TR2012b assembly with 2 other insect models, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>. The <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> transcriptome contains more than 28,000 sequences for a total length of 81&#x000a0;M&#x000a0;nt (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The Drosophila transcripts set is built primarily from computer predictions of the genome sequence and also from permanent curations due to the large Drosophila research community and more than a hundred years of genetics research on this model. Due to the conservation of the majority of genes between insects, we should expect a &#x0201c;complete&#x0201d; transcriptome to come close to this number. A standard approach to construct a reference transcriptome is Sanger sequencing of an EST library. We can find an example of this in public repositories for <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>. We can see that the total size of this assembly is around 11&#x000a0;Mb (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) because of the assembly of Sanger sequences in Unigenes.Then, we seeked to have a better view of the total content of the Sf_TR2012b assembly by performing systematic blastx against nr (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B) to checked whether our RNA sequences were corresponding to bona fide proteins and also to checked whether we had some contaminants. 23,126 (42.1%) of the contigs were matching eukaryotic proteins. Of those, 19,895 (86.0%) contigs are similar to a Heliconius protein (Hmel1-1_Release_20120601), while 9,709 Heliconius proteins (75.7%) are similar to a TR2012b contig.</p><p>Similarly, 21,439 (92.7%) contigs are similar to a Monarch protein (Dp_geneset_OGS2), while 10,887 Danaus Plexippus (72.0%) proteins are similar to a TR2012b contig. Both comparisons have been made using blastx with a threshold of 1e-10 (p-value) without complexity filter.</p><p>We found only 200 contigs (0.4%) matched prokaryotes (archea, bacteria and viruses), making large scale contaminations of our samples highly improbable. What was more surprising was that 57.6% of our RNA sequences didn&#x02019;t match any known protein sequences. Among these 31,650 sequences without hit against the NR databank, 491 include at least one protein domain found with the following algorithms (BlastProDom, FPrintScan, Gene3D, HMMPanther, HMMPfam, HMMSmart, PatternScan, ProfileScan and superfamily). These comparisons have been done using Interproscan (v4.8) directly on the transcript sequences. This low number of hit does not necessarily reflect that the other sequences are spurious, but they may derived from UTR, or the predicted ORF (Interproscan uses getorf from emboss) might be uncompleted or the sequences may contain a frameshift. This is enhanced by the observation that the transcripts without hit are shorter than the transcripts with hits (mean : 526.5, median : 446 versus global mean : 868.7, and global median : 694). Finally, some of the transcripts without any match against NR databank might correspond to lncRNA, as well as transcribed repeat elements.</p><p>For the sequences matching eukaryota, we performed blastx against eukaryotic core gene sets such as the CEGMA (v2.5) geneset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://korflab.ucdavis.edu/datasets/cegma/">http://korflab.ucdavis.edu/datasets/cegma/</ext-link>) and the BUSCO proteins set (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://cegg.unige.ch/OrthoDB7/BUSCO">ftp://cegg.unige.ch/OrthoDB7/BUSCO</ext-link>). We found that 452 among 457 CEGMA proteins (98.9%) are similar to 1831 Sf_TR2012b contigs. Similarly 2961 among 3369 BUSCO drosophila proteins (87.9%) and 3025 among the 3299 BUSCO <italic>Danaus plexippus</italic> proteins (91.7%) were present in the Sf_TR2012b assembly, suggesting that the core components of the FAW transcriptome were present in our assembly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Assessment of Sf_TR2012b quality and usability through gene families annotation</title><p>In order to evaluate the proportion of genes present/absent from our reference transcriptome, we manually annotated different families of genes. Ribosomal proteins (rbp) are mostly conserved among eukaryota and are present as highly expressed small genes throughout most genomes. Thus the percentage of rbp found should be indicative of the minimal requirement for finding most housekeeping genes. We used a set of 81 proteins annotated as rbp in <italic>B. mori</italic> (D. Heckel, personal communication) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2) and searched for homologs in Sf_TR2012b. Out of those 81 sequences, we could find 74 hits matching the complete <italic>B. mori</italic> transcript. For 7 rbp, we found only partial matches (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Thus, we conclude that more than 90% of housekeeping genes are represented in Sf_TR2012b assembly.</p><p>Conversely, we searched for more constrained genes belonging to 3 functional families : homeobox-domain genes (Hox), odorant and pheromone-binding proteins and immune related genes. Hox proteins can be identified with certainty thanks to the conserved signature of their homeodomains even between distantly related species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Within species however, many paralogs can be identified. Contrary to the ribosomal proteins, the expression of genes encoding Hox proteins in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is usually temporally and spatially restricted. Thus we expected these particular proteins to be more difficult to find in our assembled transcriptome due to their underrepresentation in the RNA samples collected, compared to other abundant transcripts such as ribosomal proteins. We used a collection of 105 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> homeodomain protein sequences from the Homeodomain Resource Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] as a tblastn query of our Sf_TR2012b transcriptome assembly. 30 (28.6%) unique <italic>Drosophila</italic> homeodomain orthologs were thus detected (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3, Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C).</p><p>Similarly, we used a set of chemosensory genes previously identified by transcriptome sequencing in the closely related species <italic>S. littoralis</italic>, the cotton leaf worm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and that comprises both highly expressed (odorant-binding proteins, OBPs, and chemosensory proteins, CSPs) and low expressed (chemosensory receptors) genes. Found in abundance in the olfactory organs, OBPs and CSPs are proposed to transport odorants to membrane bound receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Two families of volatile molecule receptors have been described in insects, the olfactory receptors (ORs) and the ionotropic receptors (IRs), these two types being involved in the recognition of different volatile families as demonstrated in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Co-receptors highly conserved among species are required for these receptor functioning: ORco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] is required to form with ORs heterodimers while IR25a and IR8a are proposed to complex with IRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We used a set of 121 chemosensory genes (36 OBPs, 21 CSPs, 47 ORs and 17 IRs) previously identified in <italic>S. littoralis</italic> to search for homologs in the <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> reference transcriptome. 50 (87.7%) of the highly expressed transcripts (OBPs and CSPs) were recovered whereas we could recover only 15 out of 64 <italic>S. littoralis</italic> low expressed chemosensory receptors transcripts (23.4%) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Interestingly, we could identify 11 putative new chemosensory transcripts, bearing the hallmark signal peptide but with no ortholog in S. littoralis, encompassing 7 OBPs, 3 CSPs and one IR). The numbers of OBPs and CSPs annotated in <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>, (38 OBPs and 22 CSPs - Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S4) is within the range of the numbers of OBPs and CSPs usually annotated in Lepidoptera genomes, e.g. in <italic>B. mori</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Only partial sets of ORs and IRs could be identified compared to the numbers of such genes annotated in either <italic>S. littoralis</italic> or <italic>B. mori</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], certainly because of their low expression level. Accordingly, we found many frameshifts and inappropriate stop codons in the predicted ORs. However, the three co-receptors ORco, IR25a and IR8a could all be annotated in <italic>S. frugiperda.</italic> This reflects their high expression levels due to their function as co-receptors.</p><p>Finally, we tried to annotate most of the immune-related genes of FAW using Sf_TR2012b. The invertebrate immune response has been extensively studied in insects and today it is in the insect model, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, that we have the most integrated understanding of this physiological function. Indeed, biochemical, genetic and molecular biology approaches have led to the characterization of the molecular mechanisms involved in (i) pathogen recognition and extra-cellular signaling, (ii) signal transduction through intra-cellular signaling pathways, and (iii) pathogen elimination through the production of effectors molecules and cell activation (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]). We inventoried the components of <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> immune repertoire by comparing Sf_TR2012b with the immune repertoire described for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and other insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and classified them in three groups (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S5). The first one contains transcripts encoding proteins involved in pathogen recognition as well as extracellular molecules associated to signal transduction. The second group contains proteins belonging to intra cellular signaling pathways which control among others the antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral responses and that also play a key role in developmental processes (Toll, Imd, JAK/STAT and JNK). The third group contains an inventory of effectors of the immune response (mainly anti-microbial peptides, AMPs). As summarized in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, we were able to identify in <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> transcriptome most of the components involved in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response (73 out of 79). Two of the missing components were located on the Toll pathway. The first one, Grass is a serine protease involved in the activation of sp&#x000e4;tzle processing enzyme. Grass belongs to a large family of CLIP domain containing proteases. In Sf_TR2012b, we identified 16 such proteases while 15 and 37 were found in the genomes of <italic>B. mori</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, respectively. Therefore, even though Grass might be one of them, we were not able to identify it with certainty. The second one is the Dorsal-related immunity factor, Dif, which, to our knowledge, was characterized only in <italic>Diptera</italic>. Three components of the Imd pathway, the inhibitor of kinase kinase gamma also known as Kenny in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the caspase Dredd and the negative regulatory factor PIRK were not found. The last missing component is the cytokine Upd3, an activator of the JAK/STAT pathway which was also characterized only in Diptera.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

These categories of genes are all necessary to the adaptation of the feeding larva to its environment, whether be its host plant or its panoply of pathogens. Specifically we were interested in investigating the repertoire of genes and their level of expression for each of these categories. Thus, we extracted total RNA corresponding to 6 developmental time-points and 4 experimental dissected tissues to generate a quantitative gene expression dataset by Illumina sequencing (see Methods and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Total RNA has been extracted from the selected samples and sequenced to produce 10&#x000a0;M single-end 50&#x000a0;bp reads (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S2), representing approximately 1.3&#x000d7; coverage of each nucleotide in the reference transcriptome. Levels of expression for each gene in Sf_TR2012b have been measured by 4 indices: total coverage, reads per million (RPM), normalized reads count using limma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] or normalization of reads count using DESeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These four tables of expression are available for download on the homepage of Lepidodb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.inra.fr/lepidodb/downloads/TR2012b">http://www.inra.fr/lepidodb/downloads/TR2012b</ext-link>). We calculated the correlation coefficient (Pearson r) between pairwise samples (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C) and noted that there was much more correlation between L2 early and L3 early stages and between L2 late and L3 late than between both L2 stages or between both L3 stages, indicating that different transcripts expression profiles were defining the beginning and the end of each ecdysis cycle. Interestingly, the L6 late time-point was not correlated with the other larval time-points, probably reflecting the onset of metamorphosis. Less variation was observed between tracheae, antennae and palps and fat body samples, all coming from late larval stages.To identify the genes specific to each of the samples, we used a k-mean clustering method (using the clara function in R), to group together genes with similar expression profiles. We empirically chose 20 as the number of k-mean clusters that was producing categories with enough differences between them. We immediately noticed that one category (cluster 3, see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A-B) comprised most of the transcripts (31,622). This category had a mean expression level of close to 0 RPM. This probably represents most of the rare transcripts coming from the large amount of samples that we dissected and included in our 454 sequencing assembly, in addition to the set of ESTs previously described. The Cluster 1, similarly, had a large number (17,529) of transcripts with low expression and no noticeable specific expression profile. However, most of the other clusters identified groups of genes whose expression was specific of one or two samples (Ex, clusters 2 and 19 on Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). To test whether those clusters made sense, we checked to which clusters rbp and Hox proteins belonged. Compared to the overall distribution of transcripts in the different clusters, rbp proteins are enriched in clusters 2,5,6,7,8,9,13 and 19 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). Except for clusters 2 and 8, all the other clusters show a median level of expression that is high in all samples, even if this level varies from sample to sample. Hox transcripts however are enriched in clusters 2 and 6 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D). The cluster 2 in particular corresponds to genes that have a higher level of expression during embryonic stages compared to any of the other samples, which makes sense given that Hox-domain genes are often transcription factors involved in embryogenesis.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>

We were interested in the specificity of development of <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> compared to other insects. Indeed, <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> is a pest in its larval stage and resistance to common pesticides has become a particularly prevalent issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. We reasoned that identifying developmental genes specific to <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> would provide the community with specific targets for the development of new strategies of pest control. To identify genes involved in the embryonic development of <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>, we focused on the comparison of 2 Illumina RNAseq libraries sequenced from eggs and L2 stage larvae RNA extracts. We used the R framework package DEseq to identify genes that are overexpressed in eggs and no longer in L2 and that are thus required only during embryonic development. 117 genes have been identified with a striking pattern of embryo only expression (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Figure S3). We randomly selected 16 candidates from this list to confirm by quantitative PCR that our candidates correspond to genes that are effectively transcribed in <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> and are effectively transcribed in a regulatory fashion (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A-B). We also chose 2 negative controls with high expression at all stages (elf3 and nucleolar protein 58-like) and an rbp protein (rbpL8) with non detectable expression at all stages. 15/16 tested had a significantly higher expression in embryos than in L2 larvae in qPCR (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C). In addition, we observed that our differential expression measurements by RNAseq and by qPCR are linearly correlated (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D). While some of the genes we selected are well known in other organisms to regulate development (such as even-skipped, rpd3 or ISWI), we also included genes for which no clear orthology was detected. These transcripts, such as joint2_rep_c945, joint2_rep_c7748 and joint2_rep_c1530 might represent Lepidoptera specific embryonic genes important for embryonic development, which makes them interesting targets for the development of new pest control strategies.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>

Interestingly, while most of the OBPs expression was not visible when entire animals were used for RNA extraction (transcript &#x0201c;dilution&#x0201d;), many CSP transcripts could still be highly visible in different samples, suggesting that their expression is not restricted to the olfactory organs.
