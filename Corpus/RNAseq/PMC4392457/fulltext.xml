The majority of urinary tract cancers in the developed world are of urothelial carcinoma (UC) histology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Extensive data characterizing the genetic profile of primary UC has been published and includes The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project which comprehensively describes the molecular features of primary muscle-invasive bladder UC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These studies have identified several recurrent and therapeutically targetable genetic alterations but have focused on primary tumor characterization rather than the metastatic lesions that ultimately cause patient death. In muscle-invasive UC, these alterations include somatic point mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> (35-50%), <italic>PIK3CA</italic> (15-20%) and <italic>FGFR3</italic> (10-15%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Inactivating mutations commonly occur in chromatin remodeling genes, most frequently <italic>MLL2, ARID1A</italic> and <italic>KDM6A,</italic> each of which occur in approximately 25% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, oncogenic somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) have been described including deletion of <italic>RB1</italic> in 14-15% and amplification of <italic>ERBB2</italic> in 5-7% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Copy number loss in chromosome 9 and copy number gain in the q arm of chromosome 8 are common, although their exact biologic significance is uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that <italic>FGFR3</italic> and <italic>KDM6A</italic> mutations are associated with lower grade and stage primary tumors, while <italic>RB1</italic> deletion and <italic>TP53</italic> mutations are more common in high-grade tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. One study used next-generation sequencing to examine alterations in 182 cancer-related genes in a cohort of 35 locally advanced or metastatic UC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The majority of samples analyzed were from the primary tumor and results were broadly similar to what was previously reported in muscle-invasive primary bladder UC cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In this study, we sought to characterize the genome-wide SCNA profile in a cohort of metastatic UC samples. Furthermore, we compared these metastases to primary tumors using SCNA and RNA expression analysis to understand the genetic and transcriptomic differences between these two disease states and to identify changes associated with progression from primary to metastatic disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Details on the site of tumor tissue, normal tissue, age and gender for the 46 individual cases analyzed are outlined in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1. 30 metastatic UC samples were analyzed from lung, node and other sites.

Where available, normal DNA for comparison was extracted from adjacent histopathologically normal lymph nodes, renal parenchyma, seminal vesicle, prostate or lung tissue. Using the same samples, total RNA was extracted when possible using the automated Beckman Coulter Biomek FxP platform and the Agencourt Formapure Kit.</p><p>Copy number analysis for normal, primary tumor and metastatic DNA was performed using MIP array technology (Affymetrix OncoScan FFPE Express 2.0) with 334,183 sequence tag site probes which were used to measure DNA copy number at different loci across the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Probes were spaced at a median of 9&#x000a0;kb between each locus but were distributed closer together at known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Copy number data were processed and normalized by Affymetrix as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Copy numbers were estimated with the NEXUS software and only samples that passed Affymetrix quality control metrics (median absolute pairwise difference [MAPD] value of&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.6) were considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Two micrograms of total RNA from each sample was utilized for sequencing library construction. Complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis and bar-coded sequencing library preparation was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] with the following modifications: Double-stranded cDNA synthesis was performed using random hexamers and cDNA was purified using QiagenTM mini-elute columns. Samples were mixed (six samples per lane of Illumina V3 HiSeq sequencing) and 101 base pair paired-end sequencing was performed. The resultant data was aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) and exon-exon junctions (ensembl v64) with the PRADA pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Non-human sequences were taxonomically characterized using PathSeq, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Gene-level expression values [in reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM)] were generated by RNA-Seq for transcriptomic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The frequency of SCNA across the whole genome was assessed to compare alteration frequencies between primary tumors and metastases. A focused analysis was also performed to look for amplifications/deletions in genes involved in proliferation and cell-cycle control known to commonly harbor oncogenic alterations in UC and for which targeted therapies are currently under investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This focused analysis also examined the frequency of amplifications/deletions in regions found to have statistically significant focal SCNAs using the Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer version 2.0 algorithm (GISTIC2.0) in the TCGA analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>There are no standardised log<sub>2</sub> ratio cut-offs to define low-amplitude copy number gain/loss and high amplitude amplification/deletion. Based on the available published literature, we used a log<sub>2</sub> ratio cut-off of +/&#x02212; 0.25 to define copy number gain/loss and a log<sub>2</sub> ratio cut-off of +/&#x02212; 0.8 to define amplification and deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Normalized copy number data was segmented using GLAD with default parameters available in GenePattern version 3.3.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. GISTIC 2.0 (v2.0.12) was then used to identify regions of the genome that were significantly gained or deleted across a set of samples using a Q-value cutoff &#x0003c;0.25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This algorithm is designed to identify significant driver SCNAs in human cancers by taking into account the frequency and amplitude of the SCNA and comparing it to the background rate of SCNAs across the genome. The algorithm compensates for the different background frequencies of SCNAs of varying length and quantifies the likelihood of copy-number alterations being biologically relevant in the form of a q-value. The software estimated false discovery rates (q-values), as well as potential targets (drivers) within the copy number aberrant regions. Threshold for copy number gain and loss was set at +/&#x02212; 0.25 so that approximately 99% of all segments in normal samples were below this threshold. We defined broad alterations as those spanning &#x0003e;50% of a chromosome arm.</p><p>To infer the relative similarity between the DNA and RNA profiles of normal, primary and metastatic samples, unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed as follows: for the DNA data, hierarchical clustering was performed using the pvclust R package with 1000 bootstrap iterations, Ward&#x02019;s clustering method and otherwise default parameters. The boot strapping procedure estimates how strongly the clusters are supported by data. Bootstrap values are reported as percentages and indicate how often a cluster was observed in the bootstrapping. They are obtained by multiscale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and by normal resampling, i.e. sampling with replacement.</p><p>For RNA data, unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed and RNA-Seq RPKM values were log2&#x02009;+&#x02009;1 transformed. Invariantly expressed genes were removed using the genefilter R package. Using the default settings of this package, we removed 50% of the genes with lowest interquartile range (IQR). Clustering was then performed with the same parameters we used for the DNA data.</p><p>To further test for the clonality of matched primary tumors and metastases, the Clonality testing R package tool developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center was used to analyze the DNA copy number data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This is an R package for testing whether two tumors from the same patient are clonal (metastasis) or independent (synchronous primaries) based on their genome wide copy number profiles.</p><p>For the RNA data, heatmaps and tables of differentially expressed genes in normal bladder vs. primary and metastases and in primary vs. metastases are presented (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2).</p><p>All samples were collected under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, de-identified and approved for use by the DFCI IRB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Focused analysis of 32 selected genes by Iyer et al. described the prevalence and co-occurrence of potentially actionable alterations in a group of 21 genes from signaling pathways known to be relevant in primary UC bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We compared the frequency of amplifications and deletions between primary tumors and metastases in these 21 genes as well as another 11 regions found to have statistically significant focal SCNAs in the TCGA analysis (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A log<sub>2</sub> ratio cut-off of +/&#x02212; 0.8 was used to stringently define gene amplification and deletion, respectively, based on prior published studies as described in the methods section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Overall, there were more amplifications/deletions in these genes in metastases compared with primary tumors (8.6% loci altered vs. 4.5%, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 Fishers exact, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In an individual gene-wise comparison, there were more <italic>E2F3</italic> amplifications in metastases compared with primary tumours (30% vs. 7%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.041 Fishers exact, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In 2 of the 11 patients with matched primary and metastatic tissue, <italic>E2F3</italic> amplifications were present in the metastasis but not in the matched primary tumor. In these cases, there was associated increased <italic>E2F3</italic> RNA expression in the metastasis compared with the matched primary (patients 25 and 169, Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The <italic>SOX4</italic> locus is located close to <italic>E2F3</italic>, is co-amplified in many of these cases, and was identified by TCGA investigators as another potentially biologically relevant gene in this amplicon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Indeed in these two patients (25 and 169) there was a 2-fold increased RNA expression of <italic>SOX4</italic> between the primary and metastasis specimens that paralleled the gene amplification.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>

These findings were further corroborated using the MSKCC clonality tool which suggested a high likelihood that 10 of the 11 paired primary and metastatic tumors had arisen from the same cell of origin rather than from different primary tumors.

Amplification or deletion of genes involved in the RB signalling pathway were seen in 60% (18 of 30) of metastases, which is of interest given the significant activity of CDK4 inhibitors in other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The data also show a higher frequency of <italic>E2F3</italic> amplifications in metastases compared with primary UC and concordant increased <italic>E2F3</italic> RNA expression in patients with <italic>E2F3</italic> amplifications. Prior data from primary UC and other cancers has suggested <italic>E2F3</italic> amplification is associated with higher grade and stage primary tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Whether E2F3 activity is a functional driver of metastatic progression or simply a marker for more aggressive disease is not yet clear. Iyer et al. recently showed <italic>E2F3</italic> amplification is associated with increased expression of several downstream targets in UC suggesting that, when present, this amplification event results in biologic alterations in this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The <italic>SOX4</italic> locus, which is located close to <italic>E2F3,</italic> may also be a biologically relevant gene within this amplicon as it is co-amplified in many of these cases as well as having associated increased RNA expression.</p><p>Overall, there were more amplifications/deletions in metastases compared with primary tumours. This is in keeping with the longstanding model of cumulative genetic change leading to cancer evolution and progression as originally described by Nowell et al. almost 30&#x000a0;years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. More recently Li et al. demonstrated the clonal evolution of primary bladder UC as illustrated by single cell exome analysis from multiple parts of the same tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Of note, there were some instances of amplification in primary tumours that were not present in metastases (e.g. the AHR gene on chromosome 7 in patient 160, Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) suggesting a divergent rather than longitudinal pattern of evolution whereby different clones can form a branched evolutionary tree despite all arising from a common ancestral cell. This is also in keeping with prior data in this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>In 3 of 11 patients for whom primary and metastatic tissue was available, there were amplifications in metastases that were not present in the primary tumors, including at the <italic>ERBB2</italic>, <italic>AKT1, CDK4, CCND1</italic> and <italic>E2F3</italic> loci. Accompanying total RNA sequencing was available in 2 patients and showed corresponding increased expression levels in several of these genes. This discordance between paired primary and metastatic tissue may have clinical relevance in the era of genomic medicine since the genetic information gleaned from analysing primary tumors may not represent the relevant drivers in metastatic disease. For example, if genomic information from the primary tumour was used to inform therapeutic decision-making for patients 63 and 160 (Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), the <italic>AKT1</italic> and <italic>ERBB2</italic> amplifications would not have been evident and these patients would not have been considered for HER2 or AKT-mTOR pathway directed therapies. Studies in colon and lung cancer have found similar instances of discordant SCNAs in cancer-related genes when comparing paired primary and metastatic tissue from the same patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. On the other hand, these studies reported high rates of concordance (&#x0003e;90%) when examining clinically actionable somatic point mutations (including mutations in <italic>EGFR</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic>). The discordance in potentially actionable alterations noted in the data presented here suggest that rates of discordance may differ on a gene-by-gene basis and that discordance in SCNAs may be more common than in somatic point mutations.</p><p>One important limitation of the data is the relatively small number of samples analysed which limited the power of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data can be used to provide an overview of the SCNA landscape in metastatic UC. The intrapatient genomic discrepancies found between primary and metastatic tumours highlights the potential limitations in using archival primary tumour tissue to guide targeted therapy for metastatic disease. Increased frequency of <italic>E2F3</italic> amplification in metastases points to the relevance of the RB pathway in UC with potential therapeutic implications given the ongoing development of multiple CDK inhibitors.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec10"><title>Additional files</title><p>
