Although functionally unitary, recent experiments suggest specialized roles for some ribosomal proteins. Our central thesis is that ribosomal proteins function in a modular fashion to decode genetic information in a context dependent manner. We show through large data analyses that although many ribosomal proteins are essential with consistent effect on growth in different conditions in yeast and similar expression across cell and tissue types in mice and humans, some ribosomal proteins are used in an environment specific manner. The latter set of variable ribosomal proteins further function in a coordinated manner forming modules, which are adapted to different environmental cues in different organisms. We show that these environment specific modules of ribosomal proteins in yeast have differential genetic interactions with other pathways and their 5&#x02019;UTRs show differential signatures of selection in yeast strains, presumably to facilitate adaptation. Similarly, we show that in higher metazoans such as mice and humans, different modules of ribosomal proteins are expressed in different cell types and tissues. A clear example is nervous tissue that uses a ribosomal protein module distinct from the rest of the tissues in both mice and humans. Our results suggest a novel stratification of ribosomal proteins that could have played a role in adaptation, presumably to optimize translation for adaptation to diverse ecological niches and tissue microenvironments.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY-1066293</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA169182-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bhanot</surname><given-names>Gyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001405</institution-id><institution>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12P-0120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>Himanshu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>GB thanks the Aspen Center for Physics (ACP), which was supported by the National Science Foundation grant PHY-1066293, for their hospitality while this work was initiated.

In complex multicellular organisms, in addition to the external environment, tissue specific cell types display specialized mechanisms to regulate phenotype in local tissue environments. Much of the research in biology has been directed towards understanding the basis of the information flow that gives rise to these diverse phenotypes. This has resulted in the identification of many regulatory processes [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] which fine-tune transcriptional expression and modulate the translation of mRNA into proteins [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] in response to external and environmental or tissue specific signaling cues. However, in spite of its essential role in this cellular information flow, the ribosome has always been regarded as an inert participant in the information flow that regulates cellular and tissue states.</p><p>One may ask, &#x0201c;Why is it that, in spite of tantalizing clues to the contrary, this belief in an invariant, environment independent ribosome has not been significantly challenged?&#x0201d; A possible reason might be that the high degree of conservation of ribosomal proteins across the three domains of life, viz., Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya, and the slow evolution rates of ribosomal protein sequences [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] seem sufficient evidence for an essential, invariant ribosome, which plays no regulatory role in cells and tissues or in adaptation and speciation.</p><p>However, thermophiles have ribosomes that function at extreme temperatures, suggesting that the ribosome has been adapting to the environment for over 3 billion years. There are different types of ribosomes in each domain of life, and additionally, the mitochondrial ribosome distinct in composition from the cytosolic ribosome [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is therefore worth investigating whether the cytosolic ribosome has also evolved ways to optimize its composition in response to environmental cues. Testing the ribosomal composition at a protein level is technically challenging, but significant evidence has been accumulating from the study of ribosomal proteins that argues for a variability in the composition of the ribosome [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Deletion experiments in yeast show that different ribosomal proteins have a differential effect on replicative lifespan [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Transcriptional studies in mice [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and humans [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] show tissue specific expression of ribosomal proteins. Specific ribosomal proteins are known to be associated with different types of cancers [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and mutations in specific ribosomal proteins result in a class of disorders called ribosomopathies [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Whereas all these mutations have common effects across development, some cause developmental disorders in specific tissues [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], suggesting tissue specificity of the function of at least some ribosomal proteins.</p><p>To date, most of these effects have been ascribed to extra-ribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, at least some specialized translation by the ribosome is controlled by specific ribosomal proteins [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], showing that the extra-ribosomal nature of such control is not generic. While preliminary, these studies suggest that ribosomes with variable components may exist to optimize translation, depending on environmental and signaling cues [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Analysis of the stoichiometry of ribosomal proteins in yeast and embryonic stem cells has demonstrated differential protein composition of ribosomes in different conditions [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], further substantiating the possibility of ribosomal variability at a protein level.</p><p>In this paper, we question the unitary nature of the ribosome within an organism across environments by analyzing different properties of ribosomal proteins. Does the observed environment and tissue specific variation in ribosomal proteins represent regulation of the ribosome that is important in evolution and or adaptation? In a changing environment, do all ribosomal proteins have similar properties, or are specific ribosomal proteins used in an environment dependent manner? In this paper we begin to address these questions by uncovering evidence from data analyses of yeast deletion [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and interaction [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] datasets, and the ENCODE [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and GTEx [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] expression datasets of mice and humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Yeast Data</title><p>Growth data and associated microarray files for a genome-wide yeast homozygous deletion collection [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] for all environments were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chemogenomics.stanford.edu/supplements/global/download.html">http://chemogenomics.stanford.edu/supplements/global/download.html</ext-link>.

The surprising observation was that across all yeast genes, deletions of ribosomal proteins had the highest differential effect on growth in different environments, i.e. no effect in some environments and strong effect in others. Among the 191 genes with variance <italic>&#x003c3;</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003e; 0.8 across the 293 environments, components of the ribosome were significantly enriched (21/191, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166021.s017">S10 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166021.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).

These 90 pathways and complexes were defined using both a biased (Wikipathways) [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and an unbiased (SGA clustering) [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] approaches (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref>) and included signaling pathways such as the MAPK and Ras/PKA pathway, protein complexes such as the proteasome and ribosome, cellular processes such as chromatin remodeling complexes and vesicular transport machinery, etc. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166021.s009">S2 Table</xref>). Differences in variance of a pathway or a complex between stress and YPD indicate variable roles of its constituents in different conditions. High correlation of constituents of a pathway between stress and YPD would indicate that independent of the essentiality of the pathway; different constituents have similar functions in both conditions. Moreover, a higher variance in YPD compared to stress would indicate that the constituents of the pathway show a more diverse response in YPD but show similar phenotype in stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166021.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Such a co-ordination of stress specific genes has previously been observed [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] in multiple stresses where the whole pathway is essential to respond to the stress. On the other hand, higher variance of the pathway in stress compared to YPD would indicate that different components of the pathway have differential roles in stress and therefore function in a different manner than in YPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166021.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).

Additionally, constituent of these pathways showed high correlation of phenotype across YPD and stress indicating that the functional hierarchy of the genes was conserved (functional homogeneity), but the phenotypic contribution of the module increased during stress, reducing phenotypic variance. In contrast, for the cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins, there was a significantly higher variance in 28 stress environments compared to YPD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166021.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166021.s009">S2 Table</xref>), suggesting that ribosomal proteins are differentially used in the stress condition.

While different ribosomal protein deletions show diverse phenotypic defects, indicating differential use of ribosomal proteins in SK1, the identity of the variable ribosomal proteins was different among the two strains, SK1 and S288c.

This strong overlap of corresponding clusters identified independently through phenotype association (Clusters 1, 2, 3) and double deletion analysis (Clusters A, B, C) further reinforces our claim of the modularity of ribosomal proteins wherein subsets of ribosomal proteins function in a coordinated manner and interact in diverse ways amongst themselves and with other non-ribosomal pathways. Introns and alternate splicing are virtually absent in budding yeast except in some of the genes coding for ribosomal proteins [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Three-fourths of all ribosomal proteins in yeast contain at least one intron and these introns have been associated with regulation of expression of ribosomal proteins and cellular fitness in an environment specific manner [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Similar to our results, Parenteau et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] have shown that while the introns in ribosomal protein genes do not have an effect on fitness in the rich medium YPD but affect fitness in presence of specific drugs. Therefore, enriched genetic interactions of ribosomal proteins in Cluster A with the mRNA processing machinery indicates that alternate splicing could be one of the contributing factors to the observed high phenotypic diversity.</p><p>We observe that ribosomal proteins and their paralogs show diverse genetic interactions. Twenty-one of 59 ribosomal protein paralog pairs present in yeast show identical sequence [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, all the ribosomal protein paralog pairs used in this study differ in at least one amino acid with most paralogous pairs showing a difference of five to 20 amino acids. Only 4 out of 15 paralog ribosomal proteins considered in our study show similar (not identical) genetic interactions, i.e. fall in the same cluster. These are <italic>RPL6A</italic> and <italic>RPL6B</italic>, and <italic>RPL9A</italic> and <italic>RPL9B</italic> in Cluster A and <italic>RPS0A</italic> and <italic>RPS0B</italic>, and <italic>RPS29A</italic> and <italic>RPS29B</italic> in Cluster B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166021.s018">S11 Table</xref>). All the remaining paralogs fall into separate clusters or are in Cluster C, indicating that they have differential genetic interactions. Thus, in spite of sequence similarity amongst paralogs, the regulation of these modules in yeast seems to have evolved since the duplication event to create novel functions for these paralogs. Diverse phenotypes of paralogs of ribosomal proteins have been previously observed [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our results further support this diversification of ribosomal proteins by showing paralogs fall in different ribosomal modules based on their phenotypes in different environments and genetic interactions.</p><p>Positive non-ribosomal interactors of the ribosomal proteins were enriched in chromatin regulators and remodelers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166021.s017">S10 Table</xref>). Under the prevailing unitary ribosome hypothesis, this association is believed to result from a general control of cellular proliferation by epigenetic regulators [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. If this is true and genetic interactions between such a global regulator and different ribosomal proteins have no bearing on their observed phenotypic heterogeneity, then a double deletion of a regulator and a ribosomal protein should have same phenotype as single deletion of the regulator alone in all environments. Furthermore, this phenotype should be uniform for all ribosomal proteins. However, if the genetic interactions have a greater role in regulating the phenotype, then we should observe heterogeneous phenotypic effects of double deletion of the regulator and ribosomal protein in diverse environments. To test this, we experimentally studied the observed positive interaction between the chromatin histone deacetylase <italic>GCN5</italic> and the ribosomal proteins <italic>RPL11B</italic> (Cluster A), <italic>RPL6B</italic> (Cluster B), <italic>RPL38</italic> (Cluster C) and <italic>RPL26B</italic> (Cluster C). <italic>GCN5</italic> regulates transcription of these ribosomal proteins, presumably to control cellular proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. If this were true, then deletion of <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> with deletion of any of these ribosomal proteins should have the same growth phenotype as single deletion of <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic>. Since ribosomal proteins showed diverse phenotypes in oxidative stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166021.g003">Fig 3</xref>), we tested the premise of these genetic interactions by phenotyping double deletions of <italic>GCN5</italic> and ribosomal proteins in YPD, and oxidative stresses menadione and CdCl<sub>2</sub>. While <italic>gcn5&#x00394; rpl38&#x00394;</italic> behaved the same as <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> in menadione, indicating that <italic>GCN5</italic> controls cellular proliferation using <italic>RPL38</italic>, double deletion <italic>gcn5&#x00394; rps6b&#x00394;</italic> resulted in a 20-fold reduced growth compared to either of the single deletions, indicating parallel or independent roles of both the genes in growth. Furthermore, deletion of the remaining ribosomal proteins (<italic>rpl11b&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>rpl26b&#x00394;</italic>) rescued the growth phenotype of <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166021.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This observed antagonistic effect suggests that a more likely scenario is that these ribosomal proteins have a direct functional effect on pathways that are lost as a result of <italic>gcn5&#x00394;</italic> deletion. These results show that in addition to diverse phenotypic effects in different environments, interactions of ribosomal proteins with the upstream regulators have diverse environment-specific functional implications. This varied environmental dependence of genetic interactions of ribosomal protein and <italic>GCN5</italic> indicates that some epigenetic regulators and signaling pathways that interact with the ribosome employ the flexibility of the ribosome to mediate phenotypic choice in diverse environments.</p><fig id="pone.0166021.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0166021.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Genetic interactions of ribosomal proteins with <italic>GCN5</italic>.</title><p>10-fold spot dilutions series (starting with 10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml) of wild type, single and double deletions of <italic>GCN5</italic> with <italic>RPS6B</italic>, <italic>RPL38</italic>, <italic>RPS26B</italic> and <italic>RPL11B</italic> phenotyped in YPD (rich medium) and an oxidative stress, Cadmium chloride (CdCl<sub>2</sub>, 10&#x003bc;M).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0166021.g003"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Differential evolution of ribosomal proteins</title><p>If different subsets of ribosomal proteins are under selection for adaptation to different environmental conditions, there should be a signature of this effect in yeast strains adapted to different environments.

It can be argued that this is merely a unique feature of the yeast ribosome, presumably because of the whole genome duplication event, which might have allowed differential adaptation of duplicated ribosomal proteins. To understand whether the ribosomal modularity observed in yeast extends to higher eukaryotes, we investigated expression levels of ribosomal proteins in mice and humans, which have a single copy of most ribosomal proteins.</p><p>In complex eukaryotes, the analog of adaptation of unicellular organisms like yeast to different environments is adaptation to different cellular and tissue microenvironments. We therefore expect that if our thesis of the modularity of ribosomal proteins is valid beyond single celled eukaryotes, ribosomal proteins should be differentially used across cell types and tissues in mice and humans. In multicellular systems like humans and mice, ribosomal proteins are present in a single copy, whose deletion results in both cellular and organismal lethality. Our hypothesis for complex eukaryotes would then be that ribosomal proteins are expressed at significantly different levels in different tissue microenvironments in mice and humans. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the expression levels of ribosomal proteins in diverse cell types and tissues in human and mouse samples using RNASeq data for mRNA transcript levels from the ENCODE and the GTEx projects.</p><p>A total of 66 ribosomal proteins with consistent transcript expression levels across replicates in the ENCODE data were identified in 110 cell types and tissues in humans (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref>). As previously observed [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], we found that while the majority of ribosomal protein transcripts are highly expressed across diverse tissues and cell types, a few showed low expression levels throughout. It has been shown that ribosomal proteins can show differential expression levels based on the proliferation or turnover rate of the cell type. To normalize such global differences, each ribosomal protein within each tissue was assigned a rank based on its expression level (rank 1 for lowest expression and rank 66 for highest expression, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166021.s014">S7 Table</xref>). Despite being a part of the ribosome, it is known that not all ribosomal proteins are equally expressed in a given tissue. In complex eukaryotes, just as in yeast, some of the ribosomal proteins are involved in ribosomal assembly. However, since this is true for all tissues and cell types, their rank normalized expression levels should be consistent across tissues.</p><p>Hierarchical clustering of all ribosomal proteins expression ranks across all tissues resulted in a single highly correlated cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166021.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). However, our results from yeast show that while some ribosomal proteins are essential and behave similarly across environments, others show high variability. To identify these highly variable ribosomal proteins, the 66 ribosomal proteins were filtered based on their ranks. In each tissue, the expression level ranks of the proteins were stratified into 4 classes: class I (rank 1&#x02013;17), II (17&#x02013;34), III (35&#x02013;51) and IV (51&#x02013;66) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref>). This showed that across tissues, 46 out of 66 ribosomal proteins were classified into the same or adjacent classes, while the remaining 20 were classified into 3 classes for 11 or more tissues types per class (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166021.s014">S7 Table</xref>). These 20 were termed as variable ribosomal proteins and analyzed further. Note that had the rank assignments merely amplified small differences in expression levels (noise) for a given protein across tissues, such stratification would not have been observed. Instead, we would have seen a random assignment of ranks across tissues, which is not what was observed.</p><p>The 20 variable ribosomal proteins spanned mostly classes II, III and IV, i.e. their transcripts were both highly expressed and highly variable across tissues, thereby eliminating technical noise as the cause of the observed variability in ranks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166021.s014">S7 Table</xref>). Hierarchical clustering of the ranks of these 20 proteins across cell types and tissues showed that these proteins assort into distinct groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166021.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). An identical clustering can also be observed in a heat map of Pearson rank correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166021.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, correlation <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In the hierarchical clustering, distinct sets of ribosomal proteins were associated with two discrete clusters of epithelial cells, a cluster of the nervous tissue (tissue from different sections of the brain and spinal cord) and a cluster of human cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166021.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). We note that cell lines cluster separately, indicating that similar to modification of their signaling pathways [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], expression patterns of ribosomal proteins are also rewired in these cell lines compared to other human cells and tissues. To investigate this tissue specific ribosomal modularity further, we separately analyzed the 20 ribosomal proteins in the clusters associated with epithelial and nervous tissues. This again showed that the nervous tissue cluster is quite distinct in its use of variable ribosomal proteins compared to epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166021.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Even though the nervous tissues are known to have a reduced expression of ribosomal proteins compared to other more proliferating tissues, our results show that the ribosomal protein module in the nervous tissue is distinct from that in the epithelial cells. These results show that, analogous to yeast, ribosomes in humans show expression modularity across tissues.</p><fig id="pone.0166021.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0166021.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Clustering of human cell types and tissues based on rank order expression of variable ribosomal proteins in ENCODE data.</title><p>(A) A hierarchical clustered tree of 110 human cell types and tissues (1,000 bootstraps) based on rank order expression of 20 ribosomal proteins in ENCODE data.

For example, the two clusters of epithelial cells did not segregate on the basis of organ of origin, suggesting that modularity of ribosomal proteins plays a role at the resolution of cell types instead of whole organs. To validate our result of modularity of ribosomal proteins in humans and to understand whether this modularity was a property of cell types or is also visible in bulk tissue, we compared the expression patterns of ribosomal proteins using the GTEx dataset. The GTEx data consists of RNAseq analysis of 54 different tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166021.s016">S9 Table</xref>). We extracted expression values of ribosomal proteins from these samples and performed the same analysis as for the ENCODE data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref>). Seventy nine ribosomal proteins passed our filtering criteria and were classified into ranks ranging from 1 for the least expression and 79 for the highest expression in each tissue. These were further stratified into 4 classes: class I (rank 1&#x02013;20), II (21&#x02013;40), III (41&#x02013;60) and IV (61&#x02013;79). We found that ribosomal proteins from the GTEx data showed less variability in classes across tissues compared to the ENCODE data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166021.s016">S9 Table</xref>). Consequently, ribosomal proteins that fell into two or more classes with at least 10 tissues per class were identified as variable ribosomal proteins. A total of 18 ribosomal proteins were identified to be variable, of which 7 were the same as those identified in the ENCODE data, showing a significant overlap (Fisher&#x02019;s Exact test, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.1) between variable ribosomal proteins identified using ENCODE and GTEx data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166021.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

However, bulk tissues did not cluster separately on the basis of variable ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166021.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).

Consequently, only 42 ribosomal proteins in 18 different tissues passed our filtering criteria and were stratified into four classes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166021.s015">S8 Table</xref> for details of classes). As in the human data, while the majority of mice ribosomal proteins showed high expression and invariant classification, 14 of these 42 ribosomal proteins were as variable across tissues (spanning 3 classes in more than 2 tissues). As in ENCODE and GTEx data from humans, mouse brain tissues also formed a unique cluster, indicating that nervous tissue in general uses a distinct module of ribosomal proteins compared to other tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166021.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>).</p><p>We identified <italic>RPL38</italic> as a variable protein in ENCODE and GTEx data in humans as well as ENCODE data in mice (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166021.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166021.g006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166021.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). <italic>RPL38</italic> is the most extensively studied ribosomal protein associated with ribosomal heterogeneity.

We show that, at least in yeast, we see evidence that the 5&#x02019;UTRs of ribosomal proteins that form the modules seem to be under selection pressure, which suggests that they play a role in evolutionary adaptation. We interpret our results as evidence for a hitherto unrecognized ribosomal code, wherein specific ribosomal proteins are used in an environment specific manner in yeast and in cell and tissue specific ways in mice and humans. The existence of such a dynamic modularity of ribosomal proteins is the main finding of this paper. The mechanisms that regulate these modules remain to be elucidated and are outside the scope of this paper.</p><p>Our study also uncovered some general, conserved properties of ribosomal proteins. We find that a subset of variable ribosomal proteins contributes to the plasticity of the ribosome by functioning independently or in concert across different environments by forming modules, defined as sets of proteins functioning in a coordinated manner. This modularity indicates that they have been optimized over the course of evolution based on the need for functional adaptation. We note that only a subset of ribosomal proteins varies among cell types and tissues, with the core ribosome remaining unaffected. Hence cell type specific structural changes resulting from such variation may be difficult to detect.</p><p>One might argue that phenotypic heterogeneity of ribosomal proteins in yeast, identified by the analysis of deletion strains, might be due to dosage compensation by paralogs or to technical artifacts arising due to aneuploidy or altered functionality of nearby genes in ribosomal protein deletion strains. This is highly unlikely as elaborated. Of duplicates retained after the whole genome duplication event in yeast, majority of these genes are ribosomal protein genes [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. While initial growth rate rescue experiments concluded that duplicated ribosomal proteins are functionally redundant [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], various studies since then have shown that many ribosomal protein paralogs have differential effects on various phenotypes, viz. sporulation [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], actin organization [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], bud-site selection [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], replicative lifespan [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and ER stress [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Furthermore, Komili et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] have shown that paralogous ribosomal proteins show diverse phenotypes, have different genetic requirements for their assembly and exhibit paralog specific aberrant localizations in certain backgrounds, and support the existence of a ribosomal code. Recently, Slavov et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] provided empirical evidence for different stoichiometry of ribosomal proteins at a protein level in ribosomes and showed that ribosomal protein stoichiometry is not limited to paralogous ribosomal proteins substituting for each other. Our study supports the existent literature by showing that paralogs of ribosomal proteins show different phenotypic effects across diverse environments and diverse genetic interactions, and fall in different modules. We do not find significant correlation or anti-correlation between paralogs of ribosomal proteins indicating that paralog-specific phenotypic effects are not a determining factor behind the observed modularity.</p><p>Ribosomal proteins have been shown to have extra-ribosomal functions [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and which may influence their behavior in different environments. Since, there are only a few validated examples for extra-ribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins and much of it is an intriguing possibility [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], it is highly unlikely that these proteins would have produced strongly correlated Clusters A and B.</p><p>Similarly, an alternate explanation for the observed phenotypic heterogeneity of ribosomal proteins could be altered gene function of nearby genes or aneuploidy, which might have occurred during generation of ribosomal protein deletion strains [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, again as mentioned above, not only do the deletions of ribosomal proteins show heterogeneous phenotypic effects, these effects are correlated among a large number of ribosomal proteins (38 in Clusters A and B) with significant overlap in these clusters identified from two independent datasets: a single deletion dataset phenotyped across multiple environments and a gene-gene interaction dataset. It is therefore highly improbable that aneuploidy in the ribosomal protein deletion strains, which can affect function of nearby genes or whole chromosomes [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], would result in these significantly correlated clusters in two independent datasets.</p><p>While it may not be true for ribosomal proteins in Clusters A and B, phenotypic heterogeneity and differential genetic interactions of some ribosomal proteins such as in Cluster C, which show independent phenotypic effects and genetic interactions, could be attributed to dosage compensation by paralogs, aneuploidy or suppressor mutations in deletion strains or extra-ribosomal functions. To test these, Steffen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] generated deletions of 107 ribosomal proteins and compared their growth rate with corresponding deletion strains in the yeast deletion collection. It was found that new deletions of 31 ribosomal proteins had better growth than their corresponding strains in yeast deletion collection, suggesting strains in the deletion collection might have carried suppressors mutations. Eleven of these 31 strains are included in our analysis and interestingly, 10 out of these 11 strains are present in Cluster C, with only one in Cluster A. This comparison further affirms that the modules of ribosomal proteins identified in our study are not a result of technical artifacts in the yeast deletion collection and are existent.</p><p>Our findings would argue that, in spite of high sequence conservation [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], the inability of human ribosomal genes to substitute for yeast ribosomal genes [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] is probably because of species specific functioning of ribosomal modules. This, along with differential expression variability of ribosomal proteins in mice and humans, indicates that each species optimizes the optimizes the combinations of ribosomal proteins to adapt to species specific selection pressures, not by substantially altering the sequence of the ribosomal proteins but by regulating their expression in an environment dependent manner using mechanisms yet to be discovered.</p><p>Our results from two independent expression datasets (ENCODE and GTEx) show that the nervous tissues use a unique ribosomal code compared to the rest of the tissues in both mice and humans. While an overall reduced expression of ribosomal proteins in the brain has been observed previously, it has been attributed to the reduced proliferation of nervous cell types. Here, we show that along with a reduced expression, a unique composition of ribosomal proteins is utilized by nervous tissue. These may play a role in the fundamental physiological differences observed between the brain and the rest of the body.</p><p>In mice and humans, recently evolved paralogs <italic>RPL27L</italic>, <italic>RPL22L1</italic>, <italic>RPL7L1</italic>, and <italic>RPL39L</italic>, showed poor but highly tissue specific expression compared to core ribosomal proteins. This suggests that there is an ongoing process of adaptation driving modular ribosomes, with recent paralog proteins still evolving in response to selection pressures on them and on other, more ancient ribosomal proteins and pathways.</p><p>Our results show that ribosome modularity is a dynamic, evolving process which seems to be involved in the evolution of species specific ribosomal proteins, the diversification of their sequences and functions and the creation of novel, species specific ribosomal proteins [<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166021.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] leading to diverse phenotypic adaptations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0166021.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Distribution of signal to noise in human and mouse data from ENCODE.</title><p>ENCODE data was normalized by median subtraction per array and then log transformed (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref>).
