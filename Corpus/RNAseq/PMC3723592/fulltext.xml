The current study was prompted by our identification of MEG-4.1 expression in the gland and the observation of erythrocyte uncoating in the posterior esophagus.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>The salient feature of the posterior esophagus, characterized by confocal and electron microscopy, is the enormous increase in membrane surface area provided by the plate-like extensions and basal invaginations of the lining syncytium, with unique crystalloid vesicles releasing their contents between the plates. The feeding process was shown by video microscopy to be divided into two phases, blood first accumulating in the anterior lumen before passing as a bolus to the posterior. There it streamed around a plug of material revealed by confocal microscopy as tethered leucocytes. These were present in far larger numbers than predicted from the volume of the lumen, and in varying states of damage and destruction. Intact erythrocytes were detected in the anterior esophagus but not observed thereafter, implying that their lysis occurred rapidly as they enter the posterior. Two further genes, MEGs 4.2 and 14, were shown to be expressed exclusively in the esophageal gland. Bioinformatics predicted that MEGs 4.1 and 4.2 possessed a common hydrophobic region with a shared motif, while antibodies to SjMEG-4.1 showed it was bound to leucocytes in the esophageal lumen. It was also predicted that MEGs 4.1 and 14 were heavily O-glycosylated and this was confirmed for the former by 2D-electrophoresis and Western blotting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The esophageal gland and its products play a central role in the processing of ingested blood. The binding of host antibodies in the esophageal lumen shows that some constituents are antibody targets and could provide a new source of vaccine candidates.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Host blood ingested by adult schistosomes resident in the bloodstream, passes down a short esophagus to reach the gut where proteolysis of its constituents occurs. The esophageal gland surrounds the posterior half of the esophagus, which has a membrane surface area enormously expanded into plates that must be crucial for its functioning. The contents of a unique crystalloid vesicle, manufactured in the gland, are released into the lumen and accumulate between the plates. Incoming host leucocytes are tethered in the lumen of the posterior esophagus and damaged or destroyed there. Erythrocytes are also lysed as they enter the posterior esophagus. We have identified two further protein products of the gland, to add to the two we previously described, which may potentially interact with the incoming host cells to determine their fate. Finally, we have shown the antibodies from infected hosts can recognise and bind to the esophageal gland secretions. This raises the possibility that gland constituents may serve as a new source of candidates for both a therapeutic and prophylactic vaccine.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>WdCB and LXN were supported by FAPEMIG and CAPES.

This short tube connecting the oral cavity to the gut was originally shown to be lined by an extension of the syncytial tegument that covers the entire parasite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Morris1">[1]</xref>, its junction with the gut epithelium (gastrodermis) being clearly demarcated by a septate desmosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Morris1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Dike1">[2]</xref>. The mass of cells around the posterior esophagus, collectively referred to as the esophageal gland, was explored by electron microscopy in the 1970s but has been almost completely neglected since then <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Bogitsh1">[3]</xref>. The esophageal lining has a more highly specialised surface architecture than the normal tegument. Its cytoplasm in the anterior half contains characteristic tegumental discoid bodies and multilaminate vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Wilson1">[4]</xref>, the latter replaced by a distinct secretory inclusion in the posterior half. The cell bodies, where the various inclusions originate, are numerous in the anterior esophagus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Dike1">[2]</xref> and even more closely packed in the posterior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Morris1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Shannon1">[5]</xref>. The inclusions in the posterior esophagus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Bogitsh1">[3]</xref> contain a crystalline core arranged in parallel layers and sometimes circular profiles; hereafter we refer to them as &#x02018;crystalloid vesicles&#x02019;. Their role is presently a matter of conjecture.</p><p>The process of blood feeding has received scant attention, only a brief verbal description noting the opening and closing of the oral cavity every 1&#x02013;2 seconds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Bloch1">[6]</xref>. Additionally a single micrograph in a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study of the worm gut revealed the presence of intact erythrocytes and platelets in the lumen of the anterior esophagus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Bruce1">[7]</xref>. The one pertinent quantitative study involved the use of Cr<sup>51</sup>-labelled erythrocytes to compare the kinetics of blood ingestion in vivo, by male and female worms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Lawrence1">[8]</xref>. Lastly, as part of a proteomic analysis of worm vomitus, we observed the uncoating of PKH2-labelled erythrocytes as they passed down the esophagus, with the transfer of the lipophilic dye to the lining; this provides direct evidence for the interaction of gland products with incoming blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Hall1">[9]</xref>. Little is currently known about the molecular products of the gland. The first constituent localised there, by whole mount in situ hybridisation (WISH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Dillon1">[10]</xref>) and immunocytochemistry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-DeMarco1">[11]</xref>, was SmMEG-4.1 (previously known as Ag10.3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Davis1">[12]</xref>) encoded by a microexon gene (MEG). More recently a member of the SmVAL family, SmVAL-7, was exclusively localised to the gland by WISH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Rofatto1">[13]</xref>. Lastly, the reactivity of the gland for labelled peanut agglutinin, which binds to O-glycans, has been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Collins1">[14]</xref>. The above descriptions refer entirely to <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, nothing similar having been reported for <italic>S. japonicum</italic>.</p><p>In this paper we use confocal microscopy to investigate the detailed morphology of the esophagus and the associated cells of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and <italic>S. japonicum</italic>, with additional TEM and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations. We have analyzed the blood feeding process by video microscopy and determined the distinct pathways for processing of blood components. We have identified further specific molecular constituents of the esophageal gland and used bioinformatics to predict their properties. For one of the proteins we have confirmed these predictions by Western blotting. Finally, we demonstrated the antigenicity of the gland secretions, indicating their potential as new vaccine candidates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>York</title><p>Procedures involving animals were carried out in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and authorised on personal and project licences issued by the UK Home Office.

For immunocytochemistry, intact adult worms were fixed and permeabilized using the protocol described by Mair et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Mair1">[16]</xref>. Briefly, they were fixed for four hours in 4% PF and then incubated in permeablising fluid (PBS containing 0.1% Triton x-100, 0.1% BSA and 0.02% sodium azide; antibody diluent solution; AbD) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Subsequent steps were carried out, with shaking, at 4&#x000b0;C in AbD. For visualization of the musculature by staining of f-actin, permeabilised worms were incubated overnight with a 1&#x02236;100 dilution of AF555-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes). For staining of nuclei, permeabilised worms were incubated with 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI;1 &#x000b5;g/ml in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, Dorset, UK) for 30 minutes.

This is achieved when the sucker rim contracts, sweeping blood down into the oral cavity. The blood passes through the open oral sphincter to accumulate in the lumen of the anterior esophagus, which gradually expands to form a bulge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002337-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In the second step, a wave of peristalsis passes down the esophagus driving the bolus to the posterior esophagus in a single smooth movement, as the anterior bulge deflates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002337-g004">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002337.s010">Movie S3</xref>).

The dominant constituents identified by tandem mass spectrometry were all known muscle proteins (data not shown), unsurprising considering that the head preparation contained both sucker and body wall muscles.

Structurally, it is clearly demarcated into anterior and posterior regions, coincident with two distinct phases of blood processing. The network of micron diameter circular and longitudinal muscle fibres embedded in the structure, generate the forward peristalsis to propel blood from the oral cavity to the transverse gut. Their wider spacing, compared those of the close-packed sub-tegumental musculature, is presumably to accommodate the expansions and contractions in peristalsis. Although no sphincter was observed dividing the two regions, incoming blood accumulates in the anterior lumen before passing as a bolus to the posterior, indicating fine neurological control of the musculature. We have been unable to discover who first designated the cell bodies of the posterior esophagus as a gland but those of the anterior, although almost as numerous, have not been singled out in this way. The products of the anterior cell bodies are typical of the surface tegument but why such an intense concentration of cell bodies is required remains unclear. The most obvious function for the longitudinal corrugations of the anterior lining is to increase the interaction-surface area, but they may also orientate the incoming cells for later processing.</p><p>In contrast, the cell bodies of the posterior esophagus manufacture the unique crystalloid vesicles that replace the multilaminate vesicles of the anterior, so no membranocalyx is present. Their finely crystalline structure was first remarked upon by Morris &#x00026; Threadgold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Morris1">[1]</xref> and described in detail by Bogitsh and Carter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Bogitsh1">[3]</xref>, who interpreted the contents as parallel layers of membrane. The vesicles are 0.26&#x000d7;0.21 &#x000b5;m in size (not the 4.0&#x000d7;2.0 &#x000b5;m given by Bogitsh and Carter) and we differ in interpreting the contents as quasi-molecular structures of highly ordered proteins/glycoproteins that have self-assembled after packaging in the Golgi apparatus of the gland cell bodies. The salient feature of the posterior esophageal syncytium is its very large surface area. This is provided by the combination of the thin plate-like extensions of the luminal membrane and the very elongate invaginations of the basal membrane that penetrate almost the whole length of each plate. (The plates are not analogous to the much shorter surface extensions of the gastrodermis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Hall1">[9]</xref>). Ostensibly, this increased surface area would enhance interactions with incoming cells but the spaces between plates are too narrow to admit erythrocytes or leucocytes, and quite possibly platelets, leaving only plasma proteins able to enter. The basal invaginations are typical of epithelial cells such as those of the proximal and distal tubules of the mammalian kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Berridge1">[19]</xref>, where ion transporters are located. The Na-K-Cl cotransporter is one such protein in the basolateral membranes of secretory epithelia in many species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Haas1">[20]</xref>. This raises the possibility that the enormous surface area is an adaptation to generate massive ion fluxes into or out of the posterior esophagus lumen, and this in turn might be linked to erythrocyte lysis.</p><p>The location of crystalloid vesicles in the base of the syncytium and a short distance up the plates indicates that secretion of contents occurs only in this region. The contained parallel array of material is released intact to the lumen, at specific docking sites, by fusion of the vesicle membrane with the surface plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Bogitsh1">[3]</xref>. Thereafter the arrays do not dissipate, as would be expected for normal secretory vesicle contents, but persist intact, as attested in several studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Dike1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Bogitsh1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Shannon1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Spence1">[21]</xref>. Indeed our observations show that they cluster into larger aggregates, thus confirming the self-affinity of their molecular constituents. However, the 40% greater repeating unit in the aggregates, compared to the vesicles, indicates that expansion of the electron lucent layers occurs after release. These observations provide another potential function of the plates, namely to sequester the crystalloid aggregates, allowing them both to interact more efficiently with the incoming blood and to prevent their wash-out (and waste) when the worm vomits. This hypothesis envisages the longitudinal plates of the posterior esophagus serving as a slow release reservoir for gland products that must interact instantaneously when blood is ingested. In the context of wash-out by vomit, we did not observe reverse peristalsis of the musculature. Rather, vomiting was characterised by a thin stream of material up the esophageal lumen, powered by contractions in the gut. Such a configuration of the esophagus would minimize the loss of gland secretions.</p><p>A remarkable feature of the posterior esophagus of both <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and <italic>S. japonicum</italic>, in males and females, is the extended cluster of leucocytes occupying the centre of the lumen. Previously, such cells were only mentioned in passing in two TEM studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Morris1">[1]</xref>, . The stationary position of the cells in consecutive video frames and their battered appearance in TEMs confirms that they are tethered in this location. How this is achieved remains unclear but the inference must be that tethering benefits the worm by minimising leucocyte transit to the gut lumen. This would avoid production of an oxidative burst in the gut in proximity to the reproductive organ with their rapidly dividing cells but conversely would require highly active anti-oxidant systems in a very concentrated region of the esophagus. The tethering is leucocyte-specific as blood can be seen in movies, flowing round the sequestered mass of nucleated cells. That many trapped leucocytes are damaged implies secretion of a &#x02018;toxic agent&#x02019; from the esophageal gland.</p><p>The number of leucocytes in the posterior esophageal lumen of male <italic>S.mansoni</italic> is three times that of females, roughly in proportion to their respective size. The investigation by Lawrence of blood feeding in vivo, estimated that males and females ingested 39,000 and 330,000 erythrocytes per hour, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Lawrence1">[8]</xref>. Although the sole study, its conclusions are reinforced by the disparities in the amounts of haemozoin (the haemoglobin breakdown pigment) in males and females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Oliveira1">[22]</xref>. From blood feeding data we can estimate the number of leucocytes ingested per hour as 54.6 for males and 462 for females. Given the average number of leucocytes observed in a male (28), the &#x02018;duration of stay&#x02019; in the lumen equates to 31 minutes. The battered state of tethered leucocytes, observed by TEM, indicates that they are destroyed in situ. The 31-minute &#x02018;duration of stay&#x02019; is too short for apoptosis, which is measured in hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-BouchierHayes1">[23]</xref> but more consistent with necrosis, induced either directly by parasite-generated toxins or indirectly via the leucocyte's own necrosis pathways, e.g. by activation of RIP-1 (receptor interacting protein) kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Vanlangenakker1">[24]</xref>. If the much greater ingestion of blood by females is analysed in this way, the duration of leucocyte stay (10.4 observed/462 predicted) would be only 1.5 minutes, a 21 fold discrepancy in timing between males and females. It seems unlikely that females could destroy leucocytes so much faster. It is possible that they ingest fewer leucocytes by selectively excluding them due to their smaller mouths or that many pass into the gut lumen. However, leucocytes observed in that location are severely damaged. Conversely, following tethering and damage, leucocytes could be expelled with vomitus since females feed (and vomit) at 8 to 9 times the rate of males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Lawrence1">[8]</xref>.</p><p>We have already shown, in earlier feeding experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Hall1">[9]</xref>, that the lipophilic PKH2 compound transfers from the erythrocyte membrane to the posterior esophageal lining. Furthermore, intact erythrocytes can be visualized in the anterior esophageal compartment by confocal microscopy (this study) and TEM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Bruce1">[7]</xref>, but not in the transverse gut where the haemoglobin is aggregated into micron size blobs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Hall1">[9]</xref>. Indeed, Spence and Silk in their extensive ultrastructural study, recorded that they did not observe intact red blood cells or ghosts in any TEM section <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Spence1">[21]</xref>. We thus infer that haemolysis occurs in the posterior esophagus but the extreme scarcity of erythrocyte ghosts implies that it is a rapid process. From video analysis, we estimated that erythrocytes take only 4 to 5 seconds to pass through the posterior esophagus during which haemoglobin leaks out. Thus the fate of erythrocytes differs markedly from that of leucocytes, not just in the absence of tethering but also in the manner of destruction, potentially due to their greater fragility and susceptibility to osmotic/ionic changes. One outstanding question to be resolved is that if haemoglobin is released into solution in the esophageal lumen, how does it aggregate to form blobs in the gut? Is it purely physical as a result of pH change (pH of the gut is acidic, &#x0223c;4.8, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Oliveira1">[22]</xref>; &#x0003c;6.2 and inferred 4.9, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Hall1">[9]</xref>) or chemical interaction? The potential value to the worm of anchoring blobs of undigested haemoglobin to the gastrodermal lamellae is that they, and the nutrients they represent, will be retained when haemozoin pigment is regurgitated in vomitus.</p><p>SmMEG-4.1 was the first protein to be localized in the esophageal gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Dillon1">[10]</xref>. It was also one of the 20 most highly up-regulated genes in the day 3 schistosomulum, as was VAL-7, recently also localized to the gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Rofatto1">[13]</xref>. We have now demonstrated that two further genes in the top 20 list, SmMEG-14 and SmMEG-4.2, are also expressed in the gland. The additional presence of five putative gastrodermal genes in the top 20 list indicates that this tissue, along with the esophageal gland, is undergoing differentiation ahead of worm arrival in the portal vein and the start of blood feeding. (The expression sites of MEG-8.1, 9, 11 and 12 also highlighted by the array, are currently being investigated.) It is tempting to conclude that the four proteins identified so far are principal constituents of the secretory crystalloid vesicles. The predicted molecular weight of the longest isoform of MEG-4.1, based on amino acid composition, is 27.4 kDa, but the observed molecular weight is between 110 and 120 kDa, due at least in part to the decorating O-glycans. Depending on configuration, its dimensions would range from 9.6 nm (sphere) to 18 nm (rod) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Erickson1">[25]</xref>. Thus the repeating unit of the crystalloid vesicles and inter-plate aggregates could accommodate two such protein molecules lined up in apposition, with their peptide backbones forming the dark line and the decorating glycans filling the space between. Indeed, the 40% greater size of the repeating unit in the inter-plate aggregates, compared to the vesicles, could be due to hydration of the O-glycan chains after secretion.</p><p>Western blotting and lectin staining of protein extracts from worm heads confirmed the bioinformatic prediction that MEG-4.1 was heavily O-glycosylated. It also revealed that at least two isoforms were present, potentially the product of alternative splicing of microexons or differential glycosylation. The strong PNA lectin staining of the esophageal gland, recently reported for <italic>S. mansoni</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Collins1">[14]</xref> was also confirmed here in <italic>S. japonicum</italic>. We suggest the presence of large amounts of O-glycans on the native MEG-4.1 is likely to make it a very sticky macromolecule, prone to adhere to surfaces. This is supported by its immunodetection not just in the lumen of the gland but also up the entire esophagus, way beyond its secretion zone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-DeMarco1">[11]</xref>. MEG-14 is also predicted to be O-glycosylated but the membrane anchor and predicted extent of glycosylation suggest it is mucin-like, potentially providing a surface coat for the entire lumen of the posterior esophagus. This idea is supported by early observation of neutral mucosubstances (revealed by PATCO staining) at the surface of the esophageal lining in a related parasite (<italic>Schistosomatium douthitti</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Shannon1">[5]</xref>). In contrast, MEG-4.2 is predicted to be secreted but not O-glycosylated, so more likely to exert its function in solution. The most important feature common to MEG-4.1 and MEG-4.2 is a motif conserved throughout schistosome evolution. Examination of the consensus sequence using Jpred (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-jpred/">http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-jpred/</ext-link>) predicts an alpha helix configuration. Furthermore, the detection of MEG-4.1 associated with leucocytes in the esophageal lumen, suggests that it targets these cells, e.g. by binding to a pan-leucocyte marker such as CD45. The function of the secreted VAL-7 is more problematic since its Sperm Coating Protein (SCP) domain is widespread in proteins from many organisms, yet no clear molecular function has been defined. There are at least 28 members in the SmVAL superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Chalmers1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Chalmers2">[27]</xref>, but SmVAL-7 appears to be the most distantly related of all the Group 1 (secreted) VALs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Chalmers2">[27]</xref>. Extended similarity group analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Chitale1">[28]</xref> suggests ion channel inhibitor activity as the molecular function for VAL-7, with a probability of 80% for <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and 65% for <italic>S. japonicum</italic>. Such a property could affect the viability of incoming host cells, a hypothesis worth testing.</p><p>Detection of host IgG binding in the esophageal lumen raises the possibility that the esophageal proteins might serve as targets of the host immune response. Clearly, in the permissive hamster and mouse worms we examined, this binding is not detrimental to parasite survival. It would be instructive to repeat these experiments with worms from non-permissive/self-curing hosts, such as the laboratory rat and rhesus macaque <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Cutts1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0002337-Wilson2">[30]</xref>. Another important task is to identify more potential targets secreted by the esophageal gland beyond the four we already know. Potentially, the novel proteins of the esophageal gland make attractive vaccine candidates, not least because they are secreted into a confined space to mediate key aspects of the feeding process. In addition, vaccine-induced antibodies that targeted such proteins would not face the hostile acid proteolytic environment that surrounds targets in the gut lumen or on the gastrodermis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0002337.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Cellular morphology of the esophageal gland cell bodies and granule traffic revealed by TEM.</bold> (A) Esophageal gland of <italic>S.mansoni</italic> showing several cell bodies in section with large amounts of rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) indicating intense protein synthesis for export.
