Here we perform a genome-wide screen for genes that control myofibroblast transformation, and identify the RNA-binding protein muscleblind-like1 (MBNL1). MBNL1 overexpression promotes transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, whereas loss of <italic>Mbnl1</italic> abrogates transformation and impairs the fibrotic phase of wound healing in mouse models of myocardial infarction and dermal injury. Mechanistically, MBNL1 directly binds to and regulates a network of differentiation-specific and cytoskeletal/matrix-assembly transcripts to promote myofibroblast differentiation. One of these transcripts is the nodal transcriptional regulator serum response factor (SRF), whereas another is calcineurin A&#x003b2;. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene-editing of the MBNL1-binding site within the <italic>Srf</italic> 3&#x02032;UTR impairs myofibroblast differentiation, whereas <italic>in vivo</italic> deletion of <italic>Srf</italic> in fibroblasts impairs wound healing and fibrosis.

Although the myofibroblast and fibrosis literature are biased towards canonical TGF&#x003b2; signalling, there is clearly an extensive network of other molecular regulators in play.

Baseline activity was measured in fibroblasts that were transfected with &#x003b1;SMA-luc and an empty plasmid (control), and all values were compared with this basal level of promoter activity. Out of 18,400 cDNAs, less than 1&#x00025; produced &#x003b1;SMA promoter induction greater or equal to TGF&#x003b2; stimulation, with one of the highest scoring candidates encoding the gene product MBNL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Another genetic marker of the myofibroblast is periostin (<italic>Postn</italic> gene), which was also induced at the promoter level by MBNL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). To functionally confirm these results, MBNL1 was overexpressed using a recombinant adenovirus (AdMBNL1) in serum-reduced rat cardiac fibroblasts and SV40 transformed MEFs. MBNL1 overexpression or treatment with TGF&#x003b2; induced 50&#x02013;60&#x00025; of the fibroblasts to develop &#x003b1;SMA-positive stress fibres, a marker for myofibroblast transformation, compared with very low levels of background &#x003b1;SMA-expressing fibroblasts using a control &#x003b2;-galactosidase expressing adenovirus (Ad&#x003b2;gal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). MBNL1-expressing cardiac fibroblasts were also able to contract collagen gel matrices similar to TGF&#x003b2; treatment, demonstrating the acquisition of a contractile myofibroblast phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p><p>To determine if MBNL1 is required for fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation, primary MEFs isolated from <italic>Mbnl1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and wild-type (<italic>Mbnl1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</italic></sup>) mice were treated with TGF&#x003b2; and examined for &#x003b1;SMA stress fibre expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>) and contractile function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g,h</xref>).

MI injury also caused induction of MBNL1 mRNA expression in both isolated cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts from these hearts, relative to sham mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2i</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that MBNL1 is a critical factor underlying the acute wound-healing process, as loss of this gene product renders mice more susceptible to ventricular wall rupture and greater cardiomyopathy in surviving mice, consistent with impaired myofibroblast differentiation.</p><p>We also employed a dermal injury model in the mouse to address whether MBNL1 might underlie a more universal wound-healing response through its ability to regulate myofibroblast differentiation. <italic>Mbnl1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Mbnl1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</italic></sup> mice were given two adjacent 6&#x02009;mm dermal punch biopsies, and wound size was analysed over a period of 6 days.

At the midpoint of the acute wound-healing response, we found that MBNL1 expression was strongly upregulated in the border zone of the injured skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2l</xref>). The border zone was also analysed for the presence of myofibroblasts using immunofluorescent imaging of &#x003b1;SMA (red) and a marker for endothelial cells (green), which showed that <italic>Mbnl1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had negligible numbers of myofibroblasts relative to their wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2m,n</xref>).

To specifically address if MBNL1 underlies a myofibroblast differentiation phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic>, we engineered a conditional transgenic (TG) mouse model in which expression of MBNL1 can be increased by Cre-dependent recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In cultured dermal fibroblasts isolated from conditional MBNL1 TGs, we observed that this LoxP-dependent MBNL1 transgene was effectively induced after adenoviral Cre (AdCre) infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>).

Tamoxifen was given at weaning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and 1-month later cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from MBNL1 TG-<italic>Tcf21</italic><sup><italic>MCM</italic></sup> hearts to determine the level of MBNL1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c,d</xref>). With four additional months of continuous tamoxifen treatment (to prevent a proliferation selection bias), MBNL1 TG-<italic>Tcf21</italic><sup><italic>MCM</italic></sup> mice developed perivascular fibrosis in the heart, as well as interstitial fibrosis in the kidneys and lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>).

In comparison, non-TG <italic>Tcf21</italic><sup><italic>MCM</italic></sup> mice (NTG-<italic>Tcf21</italic><sup><italic>MCM</italic></sup>) had minimal fibrotic staining. These results indicate that induction of MBNL1 expression in quiescent tissue-resident fibroblasts induces a fibrotic response likely by initiating myofibroblast differentiation that mimics the injured state.</p><p>Although fibroblast-specific expression of MBNL1 elicited a fibrotic response in multiple tissues that progressed with age, we hypothesized that this response was likely muted given a lack of cytokine and stress-dependent co-stimuli.

A control cell line that contains an innocuous green fluorescent protein (GFP) cassette with Cas9 was also used for comparison. Of the predicted binding sites, five of them had sequences consistent with those identified as preferred MBNL1 targets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Therefore, we chose to individually mutate each of these sites and found that only one worked exceptional well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>, upper diagram). Remarkably, RIP analysis from the CRISPR mutated fibroblast cell line, transfected with MBNL1, showed a loss in MBNL1 binding to the SRF transcript when the critical 3&#x02032;UTR MBNL-binding site in the <italic>Srf</italic> gene was mutated, compared with a Cas9-GFP control cell line that had a wild-type <italic>Srf</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e&#x02013;g</xref>, bottom panel). As a control, MBNL1 binding to its own mRNA (this is known to occur) was not changed in these same samples.

MBNL1 expression, which is normally low in uninjured tissue and quiescent fibroblasts, becomes induced in fibroblasts in response to signals from the injured environment. With upregulation, MBNL1 then binds thousands of transcripts, most of which are easily parsed into selected signalling pathways that are consistent with myofibroblast differentiation, or differentiation in general. These pathways include canonical TGF&#x003b2; signalling, non-canonical TGF&#x003b2; signalling through p38 MAPK, classical MAPK signalling, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-calcineurin-NFAT signalling, actin cytoskeletal regulation (focused on Rho GTPase-ROCK-SRF) and focal adhesion regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>).

Although not directly tested, one could envision that greater translation of these transcripts would be paramount to scar formation and retaining tissue integrity during wound healing.

Certainly, the data presented here demonstrates that MBNL1's regulation of the transcriptome is an integral mechanism for how a fibroblast responds rapidly to injury by transitioning to the highly differentiated cell type known as the myofibroblast, which has the new features of both a contractile muscle cell and secretory fibroblast. As MBNL1 simultaneously regulates multiple arms of the myofibroblast differentiation signalling network and would be amenable to current RNA-based therapeutic strategies, it represents a novel target for either accelerating the acute wound-healing response and/or limiting the chronic phase that results in fibrosis and scarring during disease.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mouse models, dermal wound healing and MI injury</title><p><italic>Mbnl1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (sv129 congenic strain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) and <italic>Tcf21</italic><sup><italic>MCM</italic></sup> (C57BL/6-sv129) mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> were previously described. <italic>Postn</italic><sup><italic>MCM</italic></sup> (C57BL/6-sv129) mice were generated by inserting the MerCreMer cDNA cassette into the first coding exon of the <italic>Postn</italic> gene by standard homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells, followed by generation of germline-targeted mice. <italic>Srf-LoxP, CD-1 background</italic>-targeted mice were described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.
