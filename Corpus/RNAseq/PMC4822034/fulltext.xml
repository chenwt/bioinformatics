Within pre-mRNA, specific signals, such as the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; splice sites, the branch point sequence and additional less conserved intronic or exonic elements with enhancer or silencer functions (intron splicing enhancer, exon splicing enhancer (ESE), intron splicing silencer (ISS), exon splicing silencer, respectively)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> drive the spliceosome to identify the correct exon&#x02013;intron boundaries. The first step of spliceosome assembly involves the binding of the U1 snRNP to the 5&#x02032; splice sites of an exon through its 9-bp tail<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. U1 snRNA is 165&#x02009;bp long and has a stable and defined secondary structure that interacts with a set of U1-specific proteins, U1-A, U1-70K and U1-C, as well as with the Smith antigen (Sm) proteins, common to all the U-rich snRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The precise contribution of the U1 snRNP-associated proteins to normal splicing is not completely understood, but 70K is considered to have a major role. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the interaction between the RS-domain of 70K and RS-domain-containing splicing factors (SR proteins) bound in the exons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> promotes their selection for inclusion, a process known as exon definition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. U1C, in contrast to original predictions, is not essential for splicing as cells depleted of this factor have a preferential effect only on a narrow group of weakly defined exons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The important U1 snRNA structural element stem loop IV interacts with the U2 snRNP-specific protein SF3A1, which is crucial for splicing as it promotes the alternative mechanism of splicing, namely &#x02018;intron' definition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Apart from an established role in splicing, U1 snRNP has an additional effect on transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> and on polyadenylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Both U1A and 70K are reported to affect polyadenylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>Exon skipping is one of the most frequent disease-causing splicing defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Different types of mutations at the pre-mRNA splice site consensus or in the accessory splicing regulatory elements can induce exon skipping. One of the most studied diseases involving exon skipping is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disease affecting &#x003b1;-motoneurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. SMA is caused by a homozygous loss-of-function of survival motor neuron (<italic>SMN1</italic>) gene, which encodes SMN, a key protein mainly involved in the biogenesis of snRNPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In the paralogous <italic>SMN2</italic> gene, a C&#x0003e;T transition disrupts and transforms an ESE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> into an exon splicing silencer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, inducing skipping of exon 7. As a result, in SMA-affected individuals, the reduced amount of normal transcript produced from <italic>SMN2</italic> only compensates partially for the loss of <italic>SMN1</italic>. An SMA mouse model, which integrates different copies of the human-specific <italic>SMN2</italic> gene, mostly reproduces the disease phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. This is one of the very few available animal models in which the same exon skipping defect is associated with a disease in humans and mice.</p><p>In the past decade, different strategies have been developed to rescue exon skipping defects and for the most part the SMA mouse model has been used. These approaches include antisense oligonucleotides or U7-derivatives<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> that interfere with splicing-regulatory elements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Other approaches include the recruitment of positive splicing factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and the use of chemical compounds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. We developed an approach to correct exon skipping, in different diseases, based on the modification of the core spliceosomal U1 snRNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. The modified small RNAs, named exon-specific U1s (ExSpeU1s), have engineered 5&#x02032;-tails that direct their loading onto intronic regions downstream of 5&#x02032; (donor-) splice sites and rescue exon skipping in coagulation factor IX exon 9, CFTR exon 13, SMN2 exon 7 and SPINK5 exon 7 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). The positive effect on pre-mRNA splicing improves the protein function in patient-derived primary cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, ExSpeU1 expression mediated by AAV delivery efficiently rescues aberrant splicing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Interestingly, a unique ExSpeU1 is active on different types of mutations. Apart from canonical GU and AG dinucleotides at the splice sites, ExSpeU1 correct mutations in the 5&#x02032; splice sites consensus, in exonic regulatory elements or in polypyrimidine tract of the 3&#x02032; splice site, suggesting that some component(s) of the particle is/are involved in the splicing rescue activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.</p><p>Here, we investigate the therapeutic splicing activity and structural requirements of the modified core spliceosomal U1 snRNPs. Germline expression of the active particle does not result in obvious phenotypic abnormalities and crossing of an ExSpeU1 transgenic animal with a severely affected SMA model mouse considerably improves the phenotype and survival. Using ExSpeU1 mutants and silencing experiments in splicing assays on different gene systems, we show that the splicing rescue activity of these U1-like particles is dependent on the U1 snRNP 70K protein and on the loop IV structure of the U1snRNA, but not on the U1A protein. Altogether, the experimental evidence indicates that precise engineering of one of the core components of the spliceosome efficiently corrects defective exons and has a significant therapeutic activity in a splicing-defective mouse model.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>SMN splicing and protein rescue in SM25 transgenic SMA mice</title><p>Binding of ExSpeU1s in intronic sequences downstream of the 5&#x02032; splice sites rescues exon skipping caused by different types of mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. To evaluate their therapeutic potential, we focused on SMA and created a transgenic mouse line with germline-integrated SM25, an ExSpeU1 that efficiently promotes SMN2 exon 7 inclusion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. By northern blot analysis, all the tissues tested expressed SM25, with higher levels detected in the heart and muscle, and lower in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Mapping of the transgene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> identified one integrated copy of ExSpeU1 cassette in chromosome 1. Since the SM25 construct was prepared to specifically improve <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 definition, we crossed the SM25 transgenic line with a severe SMA mouse model, FVB.Cg-Tg(SMN2)89Ahmb <italic>Smn1</italic><sup><italic>tm1Msd</italic></sup>/J that show symptoms and neuropathology similar to SMA type I patients and survive 4&#x02013;6 days. We performed PCR with reverse transcription (RT&#x02013;PCR) on RNA samples from mice at postnatal day 40 (P40) to examine <italic>SMN2</italic> splicing changes in various tissues caused by ExSpeU1 expression. In most of the tissues analysed, <italic>Smn1</italic> heterozygous mice carrying human <italic>SMN2</italic> gene along with the ExSpeU1 transgene (Smn1&#x0002b;/&#x02212;, SMN2&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;,ExSpeU1&#x0002b;/&#x02212;) showed a significant increase in the percentage of <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 inclusion. Consistent with the SM25 expression data, the highest SMN2 exon 7 inclusion levels were observed in the heart and muscle with &#x0223c;70&#x00025; inclusion. The brain, spinal cord and kidney had intermediate levels (&#x0223c;40&#x02013;50&#x00025;), and liver had a small improvement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Moreover, we have tested SMN protein expression from SMA-affected (Smn1&#x02212;/&#x02212;, SMN2&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;), SMA-rescued (Smn1&#x02212;/&#x02212;, SMN2&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;; ExSpeU1&#x0002b;/&#x02212;) and control animals (Smn1&#x0002b;/&#x02212;, SMN2&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;, ExSpeU1&#x0002b;/&#x02212;) by immunoblotting. Since SMA-affected mice without ExSpeU1 survive only up to 6 days, we performed protein analysis at P2&#x02013;3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). In comparison with control animals, the affected SMA mice showed a significant reduction of SMN expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>) One copy of the ExSpeU1 restored SMN protein expression to &#x0223c;30&#x00025; in the brain, spinal cord, skeletal muscle and the heart, and to &#x0223c;10&#x00025; in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). These data indicate that stable integration of one copy of SM25 ExSpeU1 increases SMN2 exon 7 inclusion and SMN expression in most of the tissues analysed.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>SM25 expression prolongs the lifespan of SMA-affected mice</title><p>To evaluate the phenotypic improvement of the increased SMN protein expression, we analysed survival of SMA-affected mice, SMA-rescued animals and their healthy siblings. Strikingly, expression of the SM25 U1-like particle extensively prolongs the survival of SMA mice: whereas the affected animals, representing a very severe form of the disease, survive only 4&#x02013;6 days, &#x0223c;60&#x00025; of rescued mice are alive at P250, the last day of recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Most of the mortality was observed during the first 5 weeks of life and no significant differences were observed between hemizygote and homozygote SM25 transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The increase in survival in the rescued mice was associated with a significant improvement in weight, although the animals gain weight slower than normal mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). At P50, SMA-rescued mice had &#x0223c;70&#x00025; of the heterozygous littermates' weight. Nevertheless, they were able to breed and deliver the litter, although we observed an increased mortality of the pups delivered by the SMA-rescued females, which was probably due to reduced capacity to feed the pups. Since the motor neuron degeneration is the most important hallmark of SMA pathology, we also evaluated the &#x003b1;-motor-neurons count in SMA-affected and control mice. The &#x003b1;-motor-neuron counts in the spinal cords of SMA-rescued mice were comparable to the control heterozygous littermates with no significant difference between these groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In functional analysis, rescued-SMA mice had prematurely reduced ability to perform righting reflex, four-limb hanging test and Rotarod compared with control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d&#x02013;f</xref>). However, consistent with a delayed development of the neuromuscular performance, the rescued mice progressively recover the defects during development and performed the tests equally well as control mice when older. In comparison with hemizygote mice, homozygote SM25 transgenic animals performed slightly better for righting reflex and four-limb hanging test but this difference did not reach the statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). The rescued mice had no obvious phenotypic abnormality at P80, apart from reduced weight.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Selectivity of the splicing changes induced by SM25</title><p>To explore the selectivity of ExSpeU1, we measured global gene expression changes in the spinal cord of wild-type (Smn1&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;, SMN2&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;, ExSpeU1&#x02212;/&#x02212;) and SM25 ExSpeU1 transgenic (Smn1&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;, SMN2&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;, ExSpeU1&#x0002b;/&#x02212;) animals by mRNA-Seq. We only observed altered expression of a small proportion of the 12,414 investigated genes, indicating that SM25 ExSpeU1 does not have a widespread effect on gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). We identified one gene that was downregulated and 11 genes that were upregulated. We validated 6 out of 12 transcript changes using quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>); in all the remaining cases that did not reach the statistical significance, the changes were consistent with the RNA-Seq data. To evaluate the effect on specific pathways, we tested all the differentially expressed genes by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen). Canonical pathway and network analysis showed no significant enrichment (score &#x0003c;4). To assess the possible large-scale effect of SM25 on splicing, we measured the U1/U6 snRNA ratio and analysed selected constitutive and alternative splicing events. SM25 had no effect on the endogenous U1/U6 snRNA ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) indicating that ExSpeU1s do not affect the abundance of core spliceosomal snRNAs. We then evaluated selected alternative splicing events previously reported to change in the spinal cord of SMA mice and potentially related to the disease pathology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Apart from the expected rescue of transgenic human SMN2 exon 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), we observed no changes in nine constitutive and nine alternative splicing events in the spinal cord by RT&#x02013;PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Similarly, the evaluation of RNAseq data for splicing alterations at the exon level, revealed only one candidate event (<italic>Cnbd2</italic>) where splicing differs in the SM25-expressing tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The gene identified in the splicing alterations, <italic>Cnbd2</italic>, is also included in the list of 12 genes whose expression changes. Collectively these results suggest that SM25 ExSpeU1 expression does not induce widespread changes in gene expression or splicing.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>ExSpeU1s are assembled as U1-like particles</title><p>To understand how ExSpeU1 promotes definition of defective exons, we evaluated the structural requirement of SM25 along with CF11 and FIX9, two previously reported ExSpeU1s, which are active on CFTR exon 13 and FIX exon 5, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. We investigated the composition of the resulting particles on these ExSpeU1s, using RNA oligonucleotides that distinguish ExSpeU1s from endogenous U1 snRNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We performed affinity purification, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and EMSA experiments using nuclear extracts obtained from the cells transfected with different ExSpeU1s. In the affinity purification assays, we pulled down ExSpeU1 snRNPs using a biotinylated 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl-RNA oligonucleotide complementary to their 5&#x02032; tail. Associated proteins were identified by western blotting using antibodies against U1A, 70K and U1C. Experiments showed that the ExSpeU1 snRNPs contain the U1-specific proteins U1A, 70K and U1C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). As expected, in untransfected cells, the ExSpeU1-specific oligonucleotides did not precipitate endogenous U1 snRNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, lanes 3, 7 and 11). To further characterize the snRNP composition, we performed an RIP experiment with SM25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). HEK 293 nuclear extracts from the cells transfected with ExSpeU1 SM25 were incubated with agarose beads coated with U1A, 70K and U1C Ab and bound RNA was identified by northern blotting. The membranes were hybridized with oligonucleotides complementary to the 5&#x02032; tail of ExSpeU1 SM25 or with U1 snRNA. As expected, in mock-transfected nuclear extracts, immunoprecipitated RNAs only hybridizes with U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, lanes 2, 7 and 12). In cells transfected with ExSpeU1 SM25 (lanes 1, 6 and 11), U1A, 70K and U1C antibodies immunoprecipitated both ExSpeU1 SM25 and U1 snRNAs indicating that these three proteins are present in the ExSpeU1 particles. Control analysis of associated proteins by western blotting showed the correct presence of the U1 specific proteins in the IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, lower panels). Last, we evaluated the ExSpeU1 snRNP composition in EMSA. In this assay, only the CF11 resulted in the formation of a specific complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). It is possible that the lack of complex formation in the other cases might be due to the sequence composition of the 5&#x02032; tails, which, in the experimental condition of the assay, is not accessible or does not have the optimal hybridization condition for the oligonucleotides. The analysis of CF11 ribonucleoparticles showed that it has the same mobility as the U1 snRNP and is super-shifted by U1A, U1-70K and U1C antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Thus, using three different assays, affinity purification, RIP and EMSA, we demonstrate that ExSpeU1 snRNPs form particles that resemble U1 snRNP and contain the U1-specific proteins U1A, 70K and U1C.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>ExSpeU1s do not require endogenous U1 snRNP</title><p>To understand whether these U1-like particles affect the splicing rescue in a U1 snRNP-dependent manner, we decreased the amount of functional endogenous U1 snRNP. To this aim, we used a U1 decoy (D1) that covers the 5&#x02032; end of normal U1 RNA and blocks its binding to the 5&#x02032; splice sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. In SMN2, using this approach, we showed that ExSpeU1-mediated splicing rescue, in contrast to the antisense masking of the ISS, does not require U1 snRNP, suggesting that these two molecules improve exon definition by different mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. To establish the amount of U1 snRNP sequestered by the decoy in transfection experiments, we performed an RNase H protection assay. Extracts from the cells transfected with a control D3 plasmid or with the decoy D1 plasmid were incubated with RNase H and an antisense DNA oligonucleotide that is complementary to the 5&#x02032; end of U1 snRNA. In this experimental condition, D1 transfection, but not control D3, functionally protected &#x0223c;70&#x00025; of endogenous U1 snRNP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>), which presumably correspond to the sequestered fraction. We co-transfected splicing minigenes along with U1 decoy and ExSpeU1s to evaluate if the ExSpeU1s-mediated splicing rescue requires U1 snRNP. We analysed the effect of the decoy on wild-type and mutated SMN, FIX and CFTR minigenes. In all the cases, the U1 decoy (D1) did not affect the splicing rescue induced by ExSpeU1s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). This demonstrates that ExSpeU1s binding to the intronic sequences downstream of the 5&#x02032; splice sites do not require additional U1 snRNP for splicing enhancement.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>ExSpeU1 mutants with altered binding properties</title><p>To identify the structural component of ExSpeU1 involved in splicing rescue, we evaluated the particles expressed from SM25 RNA mutants.

We also considered a variant in stem loop 4 (SL4m)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), as this structural element has been recently reported to be essential for splicing <italic>in vivo</italic> because of its interaction with the U2 snRNP-specific SF3A1 protein. The cells were transfected with the SM25 ExSpeU1 variants and total and nuclear U1 RNAs analysed by northern blotting. In comparison to the native ExSpeU1, all mutations reduced (to &#x0223c;40&#x02013;50&#x00025;) the amount of total and nuclear RNAs, indicating that <italic>in vivo</italic> they lack some structural components that reduce, but do not completely disrupt the biosynthesis, assembly and nuclear import of the particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). In addition, the SL4 mutant produced a truncated ExSpeU1 RNA that was preferentially located in the nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Consistent with the fact that defective SL4 variants are processed to generate a truncated shorter isoform, as reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, we show by 3&#x02032;-RNA adaptor ligation that in our case the shorter U1 variant is missing the last 22&#x02013;24 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>) and accordingly maintains the consensus Sm binding site. We next evaluated the composition of the ExSpeU1 snRNP by affinity purification. Native and mutant ExSpeU1 snRNPs were affinity purified and protein composition was evaluated by western blotting. In comparison with the corresponding native counterparts, U1Am and the 70Km2 variants specifically lack U1A and 70K binding, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). In contrast, the less-disruptive loop I substitutions in 70Km1, previously used in complementation assays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, did not completely abolish the interaction with 70K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). We confirmed the binding properties of the three mutants on a different ExSpeU1, CF11 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). To further validate these results, we performed RNA-IP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>). In this case, U1A Ab immunoprecipitated all ExSpeU1 RNAs except the U1Am1 mutant; 70K Ab failed to pull down the 70Km2 variant whereas U1C and Y12 immunoprecipitated all ExSpeU1 RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>). RIP efficiency was confirmed by re-probing the membranes for endogenous U1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Thus, <italic>in vivo</italic> the two U1Am and 70Km2 mutants specifically inhibit U1A and 70K binding, respectively. The SL4 mutant showed a slight reduction in the amount of RNA pulled down by the 70K and U1C Ab and no effect on RNA pulled down by Y12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>). This suggests that the SL4 structure might contribute to 70K and U1C binding. Interestingly, U1C is present on all variants suggesting that neither, 70K, U1A nor the stem loop 4, are strictly required for its recruitment on the mature particle. However, consistent with previous studies that indicate an important role for 70K in mediating association of U1C to the particle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, we observed a reduced amount of this protein in the 70Km2 mutant.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Proteins involved in ExSpeU1-mediated splicing rescue</title><p>To understand the contribution of the U1-specific proteins to splicing, we performed a complementation assay using native ExSpeU1 and loop I, II and SL4 variants. We initially considered the effect of ExSpeU1s on mutations that severely affect exon definition. Of the previously reported ExSpeU1 rescued variants, we selected four disease-causing mutations that severely affect exon inclusion: &#x0002b;3G and &#x02212;2G at the 5&#x02032; splice sites consensus in CFTR exon 13 and FIX exon 5, respectively and two exonic deletions in FIX exon 5 (&#x00394;9 and &#x00394;10.1). To ensure comparable expression levels of the different ExSpeU1s in our complementation experiments, we co-transfected an increased amount of the mutants relative to the native ExSpeU1s and equivalent levels of RNAs were verified by northern blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). In all minigenes, U1Am had a rescue activity comparable to corresponding native ExSpeU1s, indicating that the presence of the U1A protein in the particle is dispensable for splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). In contrast, the SL4 mutant did not significantly rescue splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test). Interestingly, the 70Km2 mutant failed to rescue exon skipping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>
<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test), indicating that the 70K protein in the ExSpeU1 particle is crucial for exon definition. To better investigate the role of the U1-specific proteins on the ExSpeU1-mediated splicing rescue, we performed silencing experiments of U1A, 70K and U1C. siRNA treatment resulted in nearly complete depletion of 70K and U1C and &#x0223c;80&#x00025; reduction of U1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). As expected, 70K silencing caused a reduction in U1C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Depletion of U1A and U1C did not significantly affect the ExSpeU1-mediated splicing enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>, lanes 4, 5, 10, 11). In contrast, 70K silencing almost completely abolished the splicing enhancement induced by ExSpeU1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>, lanes 3 and 9). We next evaluated less-disruptive mutations, to better understand the relationship between ExSpeU1 snRNP and exon definition. We considered mutations in exonic elements or in the polypyrimidine tract that maintain low levels of normal splicing (from 10 to 25&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. For the FIX, CFTR and SMN2 minigenes, we evaluated the effect of ExSpeU1 variants along with silencing of the three U1-specific splicing factors. Native ExSpeU1s or U1Am rescued exon skipping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>) with equal efficiency, whereas SL4 did not considerably impact splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>
<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test). SL4 showed only a minor effect on the SMN2 exonic mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref> lane 20), which was the least disruptive among the mutations tested. This small effect could either be due to a residual splicing-rescue activity of the defective particle in this particular context or to a partial antisense interference of the inactive SL4 mutant at the previously described nearby ISS-element<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. The particle lacking 70K showed some reduced activity on partially defective exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). In comparison with the corresponding native ExSpeU1s, 70Km2 had &#x0223c;60&#x00025; less activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test). Similarly, silencing of the U1 specific factors showed that U1A and U1C depletion had no significant effect on the ExSpeU1-mediated splicing enhancement. However 70K silencing reduced the ExSpeU1-mediated rescue to &#x0223c;55&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). Thus, in the case of mutations that cause severe exon skipping, the ExSpeU1 snRNP-associated 70K protein (but not U1A and U1C) is essential for splicing rescue. However, the ExSpeU1 particle, devoid of 70K, retains some activity in those mutations that do not completely disrupt exon definition. Mutations in SL4, previously reported to affect binding of the U2 snRNP-specific SF3A1 protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, produced an inactive ExSpeU1.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Several strategies have been developed to correct inherited splicing defects.

U1 snRNP is a core macromolecular spliceosomal component that is built around an RNA backbone, U1 snRNA. We show here that modifying U1 snRNA to bind specific intronic sequences downstream of the 5&#x02032; splice sites results in the assembly of a target-specific therapeutic U1-like particle (ExSpeU1). This modified U1 snRNP restores spliceosomal activity on several skipped exons, mainly through its associated 70K protein and stem loop IV. This effect does not require endogenous U1 snRNP. Most importantly, the splicing correction results in significant rescue of the phenotype in a very severe SMA mouse model, providing the first proof of principle <italic>in vivo</italic> of safety and efficacy of this novel therapeutic strategy.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first time that a specific modification of a core spliceosomal component has been shown to be safe and active in a mouse model. Our results show that germline expression of the U1-like SM25 particle is highly specific for processing of <italic>SMN2</italic> pre-mRNA and has no apparent side effects. This indicates that the expression of a U1-like particle that contains the SM25 sequence complementary to part of the SMN2 intron is not toxic <italic>in vivo</italic>. Strikingly, ExSpeU1 SM25 expression has a profound effect on the phenotype. Although the severe SMA mice die before P6 and show some embryonic lethality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, &#x0223c;60&#x00025; of transgenic SM25 animals are alive after 250 days of observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The significant rescue of the phenotype, splicing and protein observed with a single integrated copy of ExSpeU1 highlights the potential therapeutic activity of modified U1 snRNAs that bind in introns. The high rescue efficiency we observed, here <italic>in vivo</italic> and previously in cell culture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, can be due to the combined effect on exon and intron definition mediated by the structural 70K and SL4 elements, respectively. Even if the phenotypic improvement is highly evident, the younger rescued mice performed less efficiently in functional tests than normal animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>) which could explain why most of the mortality recorded in the transgenic rescued mice occurred before P40. In fact, female mice tend to concentrate on pups that have the highest chance of survival; therefore, the mortality in the first weeks is probably due to competition, in the same litter, between the normal pups and the rescued less-fit animals.</p><p>We previously showed that ExSpeU1-binding to intronic sequences rescued different types of exon skipping defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Here we established that 70K and stem loop IV represent the key structural determinants involved in the splicing rescue in the modified U1-like particle. Its 5&#x02032; tail, binding downstream of the donor site, assures that two important 70K and SL4 structural elements are loaded on pre mRNA, in non-conserved intronic sequences, only in the proximity of target exons. In contrast to previously reported modified U1-based approaches, aimed at reinforcing the binding of the U1 particle at suboptimal non-conserved 5&#x02032; splice sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>, binding at non-conserved intronic sequences of the particles, reduces potentially deleterious off-target alternative splicing events. Indeed, in the spinal cord, a target tissue for therapy, we found that only 12 genes changed their expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and that, in our experimental conditions, RNA-Seq identified just one alternative splicing off-target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Cyclic nucleotide binding domain containing 2 (Cnbd2) is the only gene that show changes in both expression and splicing and codes for a putative cytoplasmic protein involved in cAMP binding and spermatogenesis. As its function is inferred only from automatic GO electronic annotation, the absence of any experimental and computation evidence do not allow to clarify its potential role in the disease. Furthermore, we did not observe changes in a group of alternative splicing events previously implicated in the SMA pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>The U1 70K protein is indispensable for splicing rescue of severe mutations for which the exon is otherwise virtually absent in the final transcript. In fact, ExSpeU1 loop I mutants that lack the 70K- binding site have no effect on splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>) and silencing of 70K inhibits the splicing rescue mediated by native ExSpeU1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c,d</xref>). The 70K is loaded in the proximity of the 5&#x02032; splice sites and accordingly it can promote a network of interaction on the exon and facilitate its recognition. This role in splicing has been previously described <italic>in vitro</italic> where 70K promotes exon definition through the interaction between its RS domain and SR-splicing factors bound to exonic splicing enhancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. The 70K is not obligatory for less-severe mutations for which additional factor(s) can partially compensate for its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a&#x02013;c</xref>). Interestingly, U1C remains associated with loop II mutant snRNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e,f</xref>) and this factor was previously reported to have a specific effect on weakly defined alternative spliced exons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Thus, in exons with less-severe mutations that maintain a residual level of exon definition, the lack of 70K is probably compensated for, in part, by U1C. ExSpeU1s, besides inducing exon definition, can also promote definition of the intron providing, in the proximity of defective exons, the stem loop IV structure, which has been reported to bind to the U2 snRNP-specific SF3A1 protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Even if the SL4 mutant that we used here, in common with other changes introduced in this structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, is processed in the nucleus to a reduced RNA size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>), the resulting RNA maintains the Sm-binding site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>) and accordingly the snRNP contains the three U1-specific proteins (U1A, 70K and U1C) along with the Y12-reactive Sm protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). These data indicate that the SL4 mutant retains the Sm binding site even if truncated, and the resulting snRNP is correctly assembled and transported to the nucleus. Interestingly, we observed that U1A is largely dispensable for all types of splicing mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figs 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">7</xref>). These results are in agreement with earliest <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing data using complementary U1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>) but pose a question regarding the role of this protein in pre mRNA processing. Indeed, U1A-associated snRNPs may have additional non splicing-related functions. For example, when U1 snRNP binds in the intron, U1A could be specifically involved in preventing the use of cryptic polyadenylation sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>.</p><p>Remarkably, the ExSpeU1-mediated splicing improvement does not require endogenous U1 snRNP, as assessed by U1 decoy experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>) indicating that the U1-like particles do not act by facilitating recruitment of the endogenous U1 on the upstream 5&#x02032; splice sites. The most plausible explanation is that all the different types of mutations affecting the polypyrimidine tract, exonic regulatory elements or the 5&#x02032; splice sites reduce U1 snRNP recruitment at the donor site. ExSpeU1s targeted to downstream intronic sequences compensate the mutations in the proximity of the defective exons. This provides a functional U1-like particle that promotes exon and intron definition, mainly through 70K and stem-loop IV, respectively. In addition, functional inhibition experiments with U1 decoy suggest that the exact positioning of a U1 particle with respect to the 5&#x02032; splice sites is less restricted than previously thought. In particular contexts, it is possible that binding of normal U1 snRNP to cryptic or consensus 5&#x02032; splice sites in the intronic sequences downstream of the natural 5&#x02032; splice sites might contribute to exon definition. Bifunctional U7 constructs that carry antisense and ESE sequences were previously shown to correct SMA when introduced by germline transgenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. However, to our knowledge, the resulting U7 artificial snRNPs have not been evaluated for other gene systems or for diverse types of exon skipping defects. Indeed, U7 has been extensively used as antisense molecule to induce therapeutic exon skipping <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. The ExSpeU1 strategy of loading a U1-like particle in the proximity of the 5&#x02032; splice sites, represents a more general approach for recovering exon definition. In line with this, we identified ExSpeU1s that are active on additional defective exons associated with cystic fibrosis, familial dysautonomia and epidermolysis bullosa (data not shown). In addition, the significant improvement of the SMA phenotype with a single SM25 copy suggests, as we have previously reported in cellular models, that ExSpeU1 has an efficient splicing rescue activity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In conclusion our results provide for the first time the evidence that precise engineering of the U1 core spliceosomal RNA particle to make it bind to intronic sequences downstream of the donor site results in molecules that have a therapeutic potential in pathologies caused by exon-skipping mutations. Exon skipping is the most frequent type of defect caused by splicing mutations and it is the leading disease-causing defect in SMA or familial dysautonomia. Furthermore in other diseases a significant number of patients show this type of aberrant splicing. For therapeutic intervention, the U1-like particles need to be delivered to the target tissues. We have previously shown that AAV-mediated administration of ExSpeU1 in SMN2 transgenic mice recovers exon 7 inclusion in several target tissues including the brain, heart and skeletal muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Additional approaches include delivery with lentiviral vectors for a cell-based therapy <italic>ex vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, or synthetic modified U1 snRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>.
