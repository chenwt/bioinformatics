However, an equivalent map for the human proteome with direct measurements of proteins and peptides does not exist yet. Here, we present a draft map of the human proteome using high resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry. In-depth proteomic profiling of 30 histologically normal human samples including 17 adult tissues, 7 fetal tissues and 6 purified primary hematopoietic cells resulted in identification of proteins encoded by 17,294 genes accounting for ~84% of the total annotated protein-coding genes in humans. A unique and comprehensive strategy for proteogenomic analysis enabled us to discover a number of novel protein-coding regions, which includes translated pseudogenes, non-coding RNAs and upstream ORFs. This large human proteome catalog (available as an interactive web-based resource at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.humanproteomemap.org">http://www.humanproteomemap.org</ext-link>) will complement available human genome and transcriptome data to accelerate biomedical research in health and disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Analysis of the complete human genome sequence has thus far led to the identification of ~20,687 protein-coding genes<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> although the annotation still continues to be refined. Mass spectrometry has revolutionized proteomics studies in a manner analogous to the impact of next generation sequencing on genomics and transcriptomics<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Several groups, including ours, have employed mass spectrometry to catalog complete proteomes of unicellular organisms<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and to explore proteomes of higher organisms including mouse<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> or human<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. To develop a draft map of the human proteome by systematically identifying and annotating protein-coding genes in the human genome, we carried out proteomic profiling of 30 histologically normal human tissues and primary cells using high resolution mass spectrometry. We generated tandem mass spectra corresponding to proteins encoded by 17,294 genes, accounting for ~84% of the annotated protein-coding genes in the human genome &#x02013; the largest coverage of the human proteome reported thus far. This includes mass spectrometric evidence for proteins encoded by 2,535 genes that have not been previously observed as evidenced by their absence in large community-based proteomic datasets - PeptideAtlas<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, GPMDB<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and neXtProt<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (which includes annotations from Human Protein Atlas<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P4">A general limitation of current proteomics methods is their dependence on predefined protein sequence databases for identifying proteins. To overcome this, we also employed a comprehensive proteogenomic analysis strategy to identify novel peptides/proteins that are currently not part of annotated protein databases. This approach revealed novel protein-coding genes in the human genome that are missing from current genome annotations in addition to evidence of translation of several annotated pseudogenes as well as non-coding RNAs. As discussed below, we provide evidence for revising hundreds of entries in protein databases based on our data. This includes novel translation start sites, gene/exon extensions and novel coding exons for annotated genes in the human genome.</p><sec id="S1"><title>A high quality mass spectrometry dataset to define the normal human proteome</title><p id="P5">To generate a baseline proteomic profile in humans, we studied 30 histologically normal human cell and tissue types, including 17 adult tissues, 7 fetal tissues, and 6 hematopoietic cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Pooled samples from three individuals per tissue type were processed and fractionated at the protein level by SDS-PAGE and at the peptide level by basic RPLC and analyzed on high resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometers (LTQ-Orbitrap Elite and LTQ-Orbitrap Velos ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). To generate a high quality dataset, both precursor ions and HCD-derived fragment ions were measured using the high resolution and high accuracy Orbitrap mass analyzer. Approximately 25 million high resolution tandem mass spectra, acquired from &#x0003e;2,000 LC-MS/MS runs, were searched against NCBI&#x02019;s RefSeq<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> human protein sequence database using MASCOT<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and SEQUEST<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> search engines. The search results were rescored using the Percolator<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> algorithm and a total of ~293,000 non-redundant peptides were identified at a <italic>q</italic> value &#x0003c;0.01 with a median mass measurement error of ~260 parts per billion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). The median number of peptides and corresponding tandem mass spectra identified per gene are 10 and 37, respectively, while the median protein sequence coverage was ~28% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1 b, c</xref>). It should be noted, however, that false positive rates for subgroups of peptide-spectrum matches can vary upon nature of peptides such as size, charge state of precursor peptide ions or missed enzymatic cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1d&#x02013;f</xref> and Supplementary Information).</p><p id="P6">We compared our dataset with two of the largest human peptide-based resources &#x02013; PeptideAtlas and GPMDB. These two databases contain curated peptide information that has been collected from the entire proteomics community over the last decade. Strikingly, almost half of the peptides we identified were not deposited in either one of these resources. Also, the novel peptides in our dataset constitute 37% of the peptides in PeptideAtlas and 54% of peptides in the case of GPMDB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1g, h</xref>). This dramatic increase in the coverage of human proteomic data was made possible by the breadth and depth of our analysis as most of the cells and tissues that we have analyzed have not previously been studied using similar methods. The depth of our analysis enabled us to identify protein products derived from two-thirds (2,535 out of 3,844) of proteins designated as &#x02018;missing proteins&#x02019;<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> for lack of protein-based evidence. Several hypothetical proteins that we identified have a broad tissue distribution indicating the inadequate sampling of the human proteome thus far (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Landscape of protein expression pattern across cells and tissues</title><p id="P7">Based on gene expression studies, it is clear that there are several genes that are involved in basic cellular functions that are constitutively expressed in almost all the cells/tissues. Although the concept of &#x02018;housekeeping genes&#x02019; as genes that are expressed in all tissues and cell types is widespread among biologists, there is no readily available catalog of such genes. However, the extent to which these transcripts are translated into proteins remains unknown. We detected proteins encoded by 2,350 genes across all human cells/tissues with these highly abundant &#x02018;housekeeping proteins&#x02019; constituting ~75% of total protein mass based on spectral counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). Large majority of these highly expressed housekeeping proteins include histones, ribosomal proteins, metabolic enzymes and cytoskeletal proteins. One of the caveats of tissue proteomics is the contribution of vasculature, blood and hematopoietic cells. Thus, proteins designated as housekeeping proteins based on analysis of tissue proteomes could be broadly grouped into two categories - those that are truly expressed in every single cell type and those that are found in every tissue (<italic>e.g</italic>. endothelial cells). Another caveat to be noted here is that some proteins that are indeed expressed in all tissues might not be detected in some of the tissues because of inadequate sampling by mass spectrometry. Thus, this list of housekeeping proteins will continue to be refined as additional in-depth analyses are carried out.</p><p id="P8">We used a label-free method based on spectral counting to quantitate protein expression across cells/tissues.

Supervised hierarchical clustering showed proteins encoded by some genes to be expressed in only a few cells/tissues, while others were more broadly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Some proteins detected in only one sample were encoded by well-known genes like <italic>CD19</italic> in B cells, <italic>SCN1A</italic> in frontal cortex and <italic>GNAT1</italic> in the retina, while others were encoded by ill-characterized genes. For example, <italic>C8orf46</italic> was expressed in adult frontal cortex while <italic>C9orf9</italic> was expressed in adult ovary and testis. Overall, we detected proteins encoded by 1,537 genes only in one of 30 human samples examined in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). These may or may not be tissue-specific genes because of the limit of detection of mass spectrometry and because this analysis did not sample every human cell or tissue type. Because methods based on antibody-based detection can be more sensitive, we performed Western blotting experiments to confirm the tissue-restricted nature of expression of some proteins against which appropriate antibodies were available. Of 32 proteins tested, eight proteins exhibited a tissue-specific expression in agreement with mass spectrometry-derived data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). Four proteins exhibited a more widespread expression although in each of these cases extra bands were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>).

High levels of AFP in serum and cerebrospinal fluid are clinically used as biomarkers for neural tube defects, teratoma and yolk sac tumors. Some of the proteins expressed during development in ovary and testis can serve as potential biological markers for identifying cancers of different lineages in the future.</p><p id="P10">In the past, gene expression profiles across various experimental conditions or tissues have been utilized to investigate the likelihood of co-expressed genes to physically interact at the protein level<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that protein expression patterns should be a better predictor of protein-protein interactions than gene expression measured at the mRNA level. We correlated the expression level for each available protein pair across all 30 cells/tissues in our data using Pearson correlation and compared this to known protein-protein interactions. We then repeated this analysis using correlations obtained from 111 published gene expression data sets. ROC curve analysis clearly shows that data from the human proteome map outperforms that from gene expression profiles for predicting protein-protein interactions, even if all the gene expression datasets are combined and used as a single predictor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). It should be pointed out, however, that although the use of protein expression data is useful for predicting protein-protein interactions, it is unlikely by itself to be sufficient for such predictions.</p><p id="P11">Many proteins interact with different partners in different tissues or at different stages of development although they are not traditionally studied in this fashion. To investigate tissue-restricted expression of protein complex subunits, we evaluated 938 complexes with three or more subunits from the CORUM database<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and found 679 protein complex subunits showing differential expression in at least one of the 30 tissues. In contrast, there were 34 complexes where all the subunits were expressed concurrently in all tissues. Interestingly, there were 201 instances where differential expression of subunits of complexes was observed across the adult and fetal tissues suggesting that these complexes are dynamic and likely have distinct composition during ontogeny. This dynamic composition is probably related to developmental stage-specific processes in which these complexes are involved. For example, MCM complex components are highly expressed in fetal liver in contrast to FARP2-NRP1-PlexinA1 complex members, which are highly expressed in the adult liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Detecting protein isoforms</title><p id="P12">Alternative splicing gives rise to a large number of splice variants at the RNA level, some of which can encode distinct protein isoforms.

Following protein database search of our large-scale proteome analysis, we extracted ~16 million MS/MS spectra that did not match currently annotated proteins. These unmatched spectra were searched using a unique proteogenomic analysis strategy developed by our group against conceptually translated human reference genome, RefSeq transcript sequences, non-coding RNAs and pseudogenes. In addition, the data were searched against theoretical protein N-termini and predicted signal sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>).

This uORF encodes a 103 amino acid protein that contains a transmembrane region within a putative BNIP3 domain (BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3) that is required for mitochondrial localization, suggesting that this protein may play a role in mitochondrial function.</p><p id="P16">We identified eight cases where we observed peptides that mapped to an ORF located in an alternate reading frame within coding regions of annotated genes.

The following parameters were common to all searches - 1) Precursor mass error set at 10 ppm, 2) Fragment mass error set at 0.05 Da, 3) Carbamidomethylation of Cysteine defined as fixed modification, 4) Oxidation of methionine defined as variable modification. 5) Only tryptic peptides with up to 2 missed cleavages were considered. Unmatched MS/MS spectra generated from the protein database search were then searched against these database using X!Tandem search engine installed locally. Specific details about generation of each database, search parameters and post-processing of the search outcome are provided below.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Customization of sequence databases</title><p id="P31">The human reference genome assembly hg19 was downloaded from NCBI and translated in six reading frames using in-house python scripts. The six frame translation included stop codon to stop codon translation of the template sequence. Translated peptide sequences smaller than 7 amino acids were not included in the database. Three frame translated mRNA sequence database was created from mRNA sequences downloaded from NCBI RefSeq (RefSeq version 56 containing 33,580 sequences) and translated in three reading frames. Pseudogene sequences downloaded from NCBI (11,160 sequences from NCBI) and Gerstein&#x02019;s pseudogene database (16,881 sequences from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pseudogene.org/">http://pseudogene.org/</ext-link>, version 68) were translated into three frames. Similarly, non-coding RNA sequences from NONCODE (91,687 sequences from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.noncode.org/NONCODERv3/">http://www.noncode.org/NONCODERv3/</ext-link>, version 3) and mRNA sequences from RefSeq version 56 (33,580 sequences) were translated in three reading frames. A custom N-terminal tryptic peptides database was created by fetching all the peptide sequences which begin with methionine and end with K/R from RefSeq mRNA sequences (RefSeq 56). 5&#x02019;-UTRs of known mRNAs were translated in three reading frames and all possible peptides starting with a methionine until the next tryptic cleavage site were generated. Peptides starting with a methionine until the next tryptic cleavage site from translated protein were also included in the database. Only peptide sequences with up to one missed cleavage and 6&#x02013;25 amino acids in length were considered. &#x02018;Quick acetyl&#x02019; search option was defined in X!Tandem searches as it allows up to 2 N-terminal amino acids clipping. Signal peptide database was created by using signal peptide annotations for 15,257 proteins from HPRD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hprd.org">www.hprd.org</ext-link>) and SignalP version 4.0 to fetch sequences from starting amino acid of protein extended to the next tryptic cleavage site.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Manual validation of GSSPs</title><p id="P32">Peptide sequences identified from each of the alternate database searches were filtered and only peptides passing 1% FDR score threshold were considered. Spectra that matched to multiple sequences with equal score were not considered for further analysis. Unique list of genome search specific peptides (GSSPs), pseudogene specific peptides and transcriptome search specific peptides were generated by comparing the unique peptide data with the protein database. The genomic regions to which these peptides mapped were further analyzed to identify novel protein coding regions or corrections/alterations to existing annotations. The peptides identified were categorized either as 1) mapping intergenic regions 2) overlapping annotated genes 3) mapping to the intronic regions of existing gene models 4) overlapping annotated genes but translated in alternate reading frame. In case of peptides identified uniquely from pseudogene database search, the amino acid change compared to parent sequence was checked against dbSNP to rule out SNP cases. Peptides identified with at least one mismatch and filtered after comparison with dbSNP were considered for further analysis. The filtered novel peptides were further manually verified to check the confidence of spectral assignment by the search engines. A list of novel peptides identified from this study is available (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P33">UCSC genome browser<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?command=start">http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?command=start</ext-link>) was used as visualization tool for manual genome annotation using these novel peptides. Novel peptides, ESTs, ncRNA transcripts, Ensembl RNASeq models and gene prediction models from GENSCAN tracks were enabled on the genome browser. For manual genome annotation, genomic regions where novel peptides mapped were examined and novel genes or changes in gene structures were determined.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Validation of novel findings using synthetic peptides</title><p id="P34">Peptide sequences were randomly chosen from several categories of proteogenomic analysis and synthesized (JPT Peptide Technologies, Berlin, Germany). Dried peptides were diluted using 0.1% formic acid and ~1 pmol of each peptide was separately subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis on the LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometers. Fragmentation patterns of 98 peptides were validated manually by comparing them with that identified from proteogenomic analysis (Supporting Information).</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Development of web-based portal</title><p id="P35">The Human Proteome Map (HPM) portal was developed using the 3-tier web architecture with presentation, application and persistence layers. A MySQL database was used as a persistence layer. PHP and HTML were used for the application and presentation layers, respectively, and AJAX was used for dynamic functionality. Protein and peptide identifications obtained from SEQUEST and MASCOT search engines were converted into MySQL tables. NCBI RefSeq56 annotations were used as standard reference for fetching additional information about the genes from various public resources. Normalized spectral counts were used to represent expression of proteins and peptides. For each peptide, a high resolution MS/MS spectrum from the best scoring identification is shown on the spectrum viewer page using the Lorikeet JQuery plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://code.google.com/p/lorikeet/">https://code.google.com/p/lorikeet/</ext-link>).

If two proteins physically interact and both have spectral count data in a tissue, then the protein interaction is included in the corresponding tissue specific network. First, proteins identified were mapped to UniProt protein accessions using data from the UniProt, HGNC, and GeneCards databases. 87,027 pairwise and experimental PPIs with confidence score &#x0003e; 0 (iRefWeb MINT-like score) were downloaded from iRefWeb. These interactions were used to generate 30 tissue specific PPI networks. We compared our tissue specific interaction networks to the CORUM database.
