However, how <italic>p21</italic> is suppressed in ESCs has been unclear. We found that p53 binds to the <italic>p21</italic> promoter in human ESCs (hESCs) as efficiently as in differentiated human mesenchymal stem cells, however it does not promote <italic>p21</italic> transcription in hESCs. We observed an enrichment for both the repressive histone H3K27me3 and activating histone H3K4me3 chromatin marks at the <italic>p21</italic> locus in hESCs, suggesting it is a suppressed, bivalent domain which overrides activation by p53. Reducing H3K27me3 methylation in hESCs rescued <italic>p21</italic> expression, and ectopic expression of p21 in hESCs triggered their differentiation. Further, we uncovered a subset of bivalent promoters bound by p53 in hESCs that are similarly induced upon differentiation in a p53-dependent manner, whereas p53 promotes the transcription of other target genes which do not show an enrichment of H3K27me3 in ESCs. Our studies reveal a unique epigenetic strategy used by ESCs to poise undesired p53 target genes, thus balancing the maintenance of pluripotency in the undifferentiated state with a robust response to differentiation signals, while utilizing p53 activity to maintain genomic stability and homeostasis in ESCs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from the inner cell mass of blastocysts and can serve as progenitors for all adult tissues. In culture, they retain latent differentiation abilities while remaining undifferentiated, proliferative and genetically pristine. Therefore, ESCs must have extensive mechanisms for maintaining these properties. Such mechanisms could involve the tumor suppressor p53, which is expressed in ESCs. Lack of p53 has been shown to cause aneuploidy and genetic instability in ESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. In addition, p53 appears to either promote<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> or inhibit differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> depending on the context. p53 also serves as a barrier to the induced reprogramming of somatic cells, suggesting the pro-differentiation role of p53<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. It remains unclear how p53 executes these two opposite functions and manages to maintain genomic stability of ESCs.</p><p>In somatic cells, p53 induces expression of <italic>p21</italic>, which in turn triggers cell cycle arrest in response to genotoxic stress. However, the levels of p21 in ESCs are extremely low despite the presence of p53<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, and ESCs do not demonstrate p21-dependent or any other type of G1/S cell cycle checkpoint arrest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. These findings suggest that some p53 target genes are specifically repressed in ESCs.</p><p>ESCs exhibit a very high activity of cyclin dependent kinase2 (CDK2) throughout the cell cycle, and this activity is the main driving force behind the rapid proliferation of ESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. ESCs have a very short G1 phase, and lengthening the G1 phase of human ESCs leads to differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Therefore, suppression of p21, an inhibitor of CDK2, could allow ESCs to rapidly proliferate. In addition, since p21 has been known to inhibit apoptosis by inducing cell cycle arrest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, repressing p21 expression would facilitate apoptosis in ESCs suffering DNA damage, thereby preserving the genomic integrity of the cell population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. However, how p21 expression is controlled in ESCs is currently unclear.</p><p>p53 is a cellular stress sensor that triggers cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence dependent on cellular context. Recent evidence highlights the tumor suppressive roles of p53 in modulating diverse downstream pathways, such as cellular metabolism, antioxidant and autophagy in unstressed cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. However, little is known about the role of these diverse p53 functions in maintaining the quality of ESCs.</p><p>Here, we have identified a mechanism that suppresses p21 in hESCs. Although p53 localizes to the nucleus and binds to the <italic>p21</italic> promoter in hESCs as efficiently as in differentiated mesenchymal stem cells, <italic>p21</italic> transcription is suppressed by histone H3K27 trimethylation specifically in hESCs. Depletion of this modification in hESCs by the pharmacological inhibitor DZNep induces p21 expression, and ectopic expression of p21 induces differentiation of hESCs. Interestingly, p53 promotes the transcription of a diverse subset of target genes which do not show an enrichment of H3K27me3 in hESCs, whereas another subset, including <italic>p21</italic>, is enriched for bivalent chromatin marks and poised for p53-dependent activation upon differentiation. Our study reveals a unique epigenetic strategy in ESCs to selectively regulate different p53 target genes and prepare for robust differentiation signals.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>p21 regulation by p53 is attenuated in hESCs and hiPSCs</title><p>Since p53 is a well-established regulator of p21 expression, we compared the expression of p53 and p21 in human ESCs (hESCs), induced pluripotent cells (hiPSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). N1-hiPSCs were generated from normal adult fibroblasts by reprogramming using the four Yamanaka factors, whereas hMSCs were generated by differentiating H9 hESCs or N1-hiPSCs respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. H9 hESCs and H9 hMSCs were validated by using several pluripotent and differentiation markers respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1A,B</xref>). The validation of N1-hiPSCs and N1-hiPS MSCs were previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Although p53 protein levels were similar between hESCs and hMSCs, p21 levels were barely detectable in hESCs and high in hMSCs, consistent with earlier reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). p21 levels increased even further in later passages of hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>, lane 2 and lane 3). Similar results were obtained with hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). By comparing signals from serially diluted protein lysates, we estimated that hMSCs express up to 50 times more p21 than H9 hESCs depending on the passage numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). <italic>p21</italic> mRNA levels were also substantially higher in hMSCs relative to hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>), consistent with the difference in p21 protein expression between these cells. To determine if p21 expression in hMSCs requires p53, we used RNAi to repress p53. Knockdown of p53 in hMSCs drastically reduced p21 protein and mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D,E</xref>). These results suggest that p53 significantly contributes to the expression of p21 in hMSCs, but the similar levels of p53 protein expression are not sufficient to induce the same level of p21 expression in hESCs.</p><p>We next asked if p21 expression would reach the levels observed in hMSCs upon activation of p53 in hESCs. To activate p53, we induced DNA damage by treating cells with increasing concentrations of etoposide, a topoisomerase inhibitor. Etoposide triggered Ser15 phosphorylation of p53 in both H9 hESCs and H9 hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1F</xref>), indicating that the stress response pathway upstream of p53 is intact in both cells. ESCs are highly sensitive to DNA damage and undergo apoptosis. In fact, increasing concentrations of etoposide induced PARP cleavage and caspase-3 cleavage in H9 hESCs (0.16&#x02009;&#x003bc;M to 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;M, lane 3 to 6), but not in H9 hMSCs (lane 9 to 12). To compare p21 expression in hESCs and hMSCs without apoptosis, we examined H9 hESCs with the lowest dose of etoposide (0.03&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1F</xref>, lane 2). p53 Ser15 phosphorylation levels were comparable between H9 hESCs treated with 0.03&#x02009;&#x003bc;M etoposide (lane 2) and H9 hMSCs with 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;M etoposide (lane 12). Importantly, when we compared these two conditions (lanes 2 and 12), p21 was markedly induced only in H9 hMSCs (lane 12), and the expression of p21 in H9 hESCs remained very low with 0.03&#x02009;&#x003bc;M etoposide (lane 2). Interestingly, MDM2, another well-known p53 target gene product, expressed similarly in H9 hESCs and hMSCs, and increasing concentrations of etoposide induced MDM2 comparably in H9 hESCs and H9 hMSCs, suggesting that the expression of p21, but not MDM2, is selectively suppressed in H9 hESCs, even if p53 is activated.</p><p>We next used hydroxyurea as an alternative DNA damage reagent to activate p53 and confirmed our findings with etoposide. Hydroxyurea depletes dNTPs from cells, resulting in stalled replication forks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> which eventually collapse and generate DNA double strand breaks after prolonged treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Hydroxyurea (HU) is known to activate p53 and induce p53 target genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Similar to etoposide treatment, HU induced p21 expression in hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1G</xref>, lane 12), whereas the expression of p21 was still very low in H9 hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1G</xref>, lane 1&#x02013;6) even if Ser15 phosphorylation was efficiently induced (lane 4&#x02013;6). On the other hand, MDM2 was induced by HU similarly in H9 hESCs and hMSCs. Similar results were obtained using N1-hiPSCs and N1-hiPS MSCs after treatment with etoposide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2A</xref>) or HU (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2B</xref>). Other post-translational modifications of p53, such as methylation at K372 and acetylation at K120 and K382, were also comparable between H9 hESCs and hMSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>). These data suggest that, although the pathway activating p53 is intact, the expression of p21 is selectively suppressed in hESCs and hiPSCs compared to hMSCs, regardless of the presence or absence of stress.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Protein stability and translational efficiency do not contribute substantially to the low expression of p21 in hESCs</title><p>To investigate additional mechanisms that may underlie the relatively low p21 levels in hESCs, we assessed protein stability and translational efficiency. We treated cells with cyclohexamide to inhibit protein synthesis and found that the half-life of the p21 protein was similar in hESCs and hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We also treated both hESCs and hMSCs with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, and monitored the levels of p21. Although p21 protein levels increased slightly upon treating H9 hESCs with MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>, lane 1 and 4), they were still much lower than in H9 hMSCs, with or without MG132 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>, lane 4, 5, 7, and 8). These results suggest that enhanced proteasomal degradation does not account for the low levels of p21 in hESCs. Further, we used polysome profile analysis to assess the translational efficiency of <italic>p21</italic>. <italic>p21</italic> mRNA was enriched in the polysome fractions, suggesting that it is being actively translated in hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>, right panel). <italic>p21</italic> mRNA was similarly enriched on the polysomes in WI-38 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4A</xref>), a normal human fibroblast cell line which has similar p21 mRNA and protein levels as H9 hMSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4B</xref>). <italic>TBP</italic>, a house keeping gene, was enriched in the polysomes to a similar extent as <italic>p21</italic> in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S4A</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that post-translational and translational mechanisms do not contribute substantially to the low expression of p21 in hESCs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>p21</italic> is transcriptionally silent but poised for p53-dependent activation in hESCs</title><p>Given that <italic>p21</italic> mRNA levels are lower in hESCs than in hMSCs, we hypothesized that <italic>p21</italic> transcription is repressed in hESCs. To determine if the <italic>p21</italic> promoter is silenced by DNA methylation in hESCs, we performed bisulfite sequencing. Bisulfite treatment of both hESCs and hMSCs converted most of the cytosines to uracil in the <italic>p21</italic> promoter region between &#x02212;131 and +370 bp in relation to the transcriptional start site, indicating a lack of cytosine methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Thus, <italic>p21</italic> is not suppressed by DNA methylation in hESCs.</p><p>Recent genome-wide chromatin studies have revealed that a subset of genes in hESCs have &#x0201c;bivalent promoters&#x0201d;, which are modified by both the activating histone H3K4 trimethyl (H3K4me3) and the repressive histone H3K27 trimethyl (H3K27me3) marks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Most bivalent genes are required for development, and are poised for future expression depending on different developmental signals. To determine if histone modifications might regulate <italic>p21</italic> expression, we performed ChIP to evaluate H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 at the <italic>p21</italic> locus in hESCs and hMSCs. H3K27me3 was enriched around the transcriptional start site (TSS) in hESCs but not hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>), whereas H3K4me3 was evident in both hESCs and hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Since trimethylation of H3K27 has been shown to be mediated by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), we performed ChIP for the PRC2 component SUZ12. We observed SUZ12 enrichment at the +182 and +507 bp regions of <italic>p21</italic> in hESCs but not hMSCs, which overlap with the regions of H3K27me3 enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>). To further evaluate the transcriptional activity at the <italic>p21</italic> locus, we performed ChIP for RNA polymerase II (Pol II). We found that Pol II was depleted around TSS in hESCs compared to hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Together, these data suggest that <italic>p21</italic> has a transcriptionally silent and bivalent promoter in hESCs that is poised for activation.</p><p>To determine if p53 associates with the <italic>p21</italic> promoter in hESCs, we examined its subcellular and genomic localization. Some previous reports have claimed that p53 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm in mouse ESCs and suggested that this impedes its role as a transcription factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. However, other recent reports using human and mouse ESCs showed that p53 is mainly nuclear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. We evaluated the subcellular distribution of endogenous p53 in the human ESC lines H9 and HES3 and mouse ESC line E14, and found nuclear localization in both human ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3F</xref>) and mouse ESCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5A</xref>). In addition, exogenous p53, introduced by lentivirus infection into H9 hESCs, was also detected in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5B</xref>). Next, we examined the occupancy of p53 at the <italic>p21</italic> promoter in hESCs and hMSCs. The <italic>p21</italic> promoter possesses two p53 binding sites, around &#x02212;2283 bp (high affinity binding site) and &#x02212;1391 bp (low affinity binding site)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Unexpectedly, p53 bound equally well to the <italic>p21</italic> promoter in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3G</xref>), indicating that p53 associates with the <italic>p21</italic> promoter in hESCs but cannot activate transcription efficiently. Thus, although the <italic>p21</italic> promoter is epigenetically silenced in hESCs, both the bivalent chromatin state and binding of p53 poise it for activation upon differentiation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reducing H3K27me3 levels restores p21 expression in hESCs</title><p>To determine if H3K27me3 is required to repress the <italic>p21</italic> promoter in hESCs, we treated cells with 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), which was previously shown to reduce the levels of PRC2 components, such as EZH2 and SUZ12, and to selectively block H3K27 methylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. As expected, DZNep treatment reduced the levels of EZH2 and SUZ12 in both hESCs and hMSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6</xref>). DZNep did not affect the binding of p53 to the <italic>p21</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>), however it reduced H3K27me3 enrichment at the <italic>p21</italic> gene at +507 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>) and it induced p21 expression in hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). In contrast, although DZNep treatment similarly decreased total levels of H3K27me3 in hESCs and hMSCs, it had no effect on p21 expression in hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>), consistent with the lack of H3K27me3 at the <italic>p21</italic> gene in hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). p21 inhibits CDK2 and CDK4/6, which phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (RB) for S-phase entry. Interestingly, DZNep treatment decreased the levels of phosphorylated RB in hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>), consistent with the increased expression of p21. Thus, reducing H3K27 trimethylation by DZNep activates p21 expression in hESCs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>p21 induces differentiation of hESCs</title><p>Our results reveal that <italic>p21</italic> expression is suppressed by epigenetic silencing in hESCs. To determine how ectopic p21 expression would affect hESCs, we introduced exogenous p21 by retroviral infection of H9 hESCs. p21 expression was verified by immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D,E</xref>). We achieved moderate ectopic <italic>p21</italic> expression levels that were about 4 times higher than endogenous levels but less than that seen in hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 1C and 4E</xref>). Ectopic expression of p21 significantly reduced the levels of pluripotency markers (<italic>NANOG, OCT4, LIN28</italic> and <italic>GDF3</italic>) and increased the levels of differentiation markers (<italic>GATA4, GATA6</italic> and <italic>CDX2</italic>) in H9 hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Another differentiation marker, Lamin A/C (LMNA), also increased the expression by p21 introduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>). In addition, H9 hESCs expressing ectopic p21 displayed a more differentiated cell morphology compared to the control cells, consistent with the reduced alkaline phosphatase staining of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that p21 suppression in hESCs is required to maintain their undifferentiated state.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>A subset of p53 target genes undergo epigenetic silencing in hESCs</title><p>We next examined if there are other p53 target genes that may be similar to <italic>p21</italic> and are epigenetically silenced in hESCs.

However, the mechanism of p21 repression has been unclear. We found that <italic>p21</italic> is epigenetically silenced through H3K27me3 in hESCs. DZNep, a pharmacological inhibitor of PRC2, reduced H3K27me3 levels and induced p21 expression in hESCs. p21 expression in DZNep-treated, undifferentiated hESCs was still lower than in differentiated hMSCs, perhaps due to incomplete removal of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>) or to the presence of other factors that contribute to <italic>p21</italic> repression, such as miR-302<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. In addition, other histone modifications, such as acetylation, may also regulate <italic>p21</italic> expression. Nevertheless, our data suggest that <italic>p21</italic> belongs to a small subset of target genes bound by p53 that are epigenetically silenced by histone modifications in hESCs to support rapid proliferation, maintain genomic integrity and prevent inappropriate differentiation.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that a subset of p53 target gene candidates, including <italic>p21</italic>, contain the bivalent chromatin modifications H3K4me3 (activating) and H3K27me3 (repressive) in hESCs. It has been shown that there are many of these bivalent promoters in ESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The bivalent mark is thought to confer timely activation in response to differentiation signals, suggesting that a subset of p53 target gene candidates, including <italic>p21</italic>, may require prompt activation upon differentiation. In fact, our results showed that the expression levels of these genes were increased in a p53-dependent manner after differentiation from hESCs to hMSCs. Further, p53 binds to the <italic>p21</italic> promoter equally well in hESCs and hMSCs, suggesting that p53 is equally functional as a transcription factor in these cells and that the <italic>p21</italic> promoter is poised for p53-dependent activation upon differentiation of hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Besides <italic>p21</italic>, there are also other p53 target gene candidates which are poised in hESCs and upregulated upon the differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). For example, <italic>PHLDA3</italic>, Pleckstrin Homology-Like Domain, Family A, Member 3, is a well-known p53 target gene that suppresses AKT signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. AKT signaling is known to contribute to pluripotency of ESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, suggesting that <italic>PHLDA3</italic> may be suppressed in order to activate AKT signaling for keeping pluripotency in ESCs. SGMS2, Sphingomyelin Synthase 2, is a bidirectional sphingomyelin synthase involved in ceramide metabolism. Since ceramide is widely-used to differentiate ESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, SGMS2 may need to be suppressed to prevent unwanted differentiation in ESCs. GAS6, Growth Arrest-Specific 6, is a biological ligand of AXL receptor tyrosine kinase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> that is involved in the differentiation of several tissues. It has been recently showed that inhibition of AXL contributes to the maintenance of pluripotency of hESC and to the improvement of hiPSCs generation from fibroblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Therefore, repression of GAS6 may be important for hESCs to keep their undifferentiated state.</p><p>We showed that ectopic p21 expression induces differentiation of hESCs and reduces the expression of pluripotency markers. These data are consistent with the finding that depletion of p21 enhances iPSC generation from somatic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and suggest that p21 is an inhibitor of the pluripotent state. Consistent with our data, several reports suggested the importance of having low levels of p21 or having high activity of CDK2 in human ESCs to keep pluripotency and self-renewal. For example, ectopic expression of p21 induces hESCs differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. CDK2 inhibition by drugs or RNA interference induce differentiation in hESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. CDK2 inhibition by p27 induces hESCs differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In contrast to human ESCs, the effects of p21 expression and CDK2 inhibition on mouse ESCs (mESCs) were still controversial. p21 does not induce differentiation in mESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Consistent with this, CDK2 inhibitors do not have effect on differentiation in mESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and knockout mice of <italic>Cdk2</italic> were viable although <italic>Cdk2</italic> is required for germ cell development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. On the other hand, other report showed that CDK2 inhibitor induces differentiation in mESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Recent reports showed that p21 can facilitate the expression of differentiation marker at low serum condition in mESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, suggesting that p21 is able to tip the balance toward pro-differentiation state depends on the culture condition even in mESCs. These differences in sensitivity to CDK2 inhibition between human and mouse ESCs may come from the difference in cell cycle regulation. In fact, unlike mESCs, most of the cell cycle regulators including cyclin D3, E and A in hESCs show cell cycle phase-specific expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Nevertheless, all these reports showed that p21 expression or CDK2 inhibition in both hESCs and mESCs prolongs G1 phase and reduces rapid proliferation rate. Therefore, it is well established that the low levels of p21 is critical for short G1 and rapid proliferation that is an important characteristic of ESCs, which emphasizes the importance of having the mechanism to suppress p21 expression in ESCs.</p><p>Our results and several recent reports suggest that p53 is functional in ESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. For examples, similarly to p53-null somatic cells, chromosomal aneuploidy was observed in p53-null hESCs, suggesting that p53 plays an important role in preventing genomic instability in ESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The canonical functions of p53 in somatic cells are the induction of cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis upon cellular stress. Recent evidences challenge this long held view of p53-mediated tumor suppression and highlight the importance of non-canonical diverse functions of p53 in the absence of cellular stresses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. In fact, our results showed that p53 target genes involved in the regulation of proliferation, metabolism and DNA repair, are actively transcribed in a p53-dependent manner in ESCs without stress. It is highly possible that these diverse functions of p53 are also involved in the maintenance of the genomic stability and homeostasis of ESCs, which remains to be explored.</p><p>The role of p53 in differentiation and development is still unclear. Even though the majority of <italic>p53</italic>-null mice can be born without any noticeable developmental defects, the frequency of developmental abnormalities in <italic>p53</italic>-null mice is higher than wild-type mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Several reports have revealed that p53 can either suppress or promote the differentiation of ESCs, depending on the context. p53 activates Wnt signaling, which maintains ESCs in an undifferentiated state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. On the other hand, p53 induces differentiation by suppressing Nanog<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, and hyperactivation of p53 by Nutlin, an inhibitor of p53-MDM2 binding, also induces differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. It has been unclear how p53 can differentially exert both anti- and pro-differentiation functions. However, at least our data indicated that the upregulation of p21 by p53 is undesired for ESCs to maintain undifferentiated state, suggesting the existence of another layer of mechanisms to suppress the unwanted p21 expression in ESCs. Based on our data, we propose a model in which, while p53 actively induces genes involved in the maintenance of genomic stability and homeostasis of ESCs, a subset of p53 target genes, like <italic>p21</italic>, are bound by p53 but regulated by epigenetic marks that prevent p53-mediated activation in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5E</xref>). These genes may otherwise induce undesired changes in ESCs, such as differentiation, preventing apoptosis downstream of DNA damage, decreasing proliferation rate and changing cell cycle profiles. In response to proper signal of differentiation, H3K27me3 marks are removed and p53 rapidly induces these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Elucidating how these genes are targeted for specific histone modifications and the consequences of removing their epigenetic marks will further our understanding of pluripotency, metabolism and genomic integrity in ESCs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell Lines and Cell Culture</title><p>Human ESCs, H9 and HES3 were purchased from WiCell.

Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) was used to generate cDNA from equal volumes of RNA from each fraction according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction. Two bacterial spike-in poly-A RNAs were added before RNA purification to equal volumes of fraction. These were used as normalization controls for qRT-PCR. For qRT-PCR, SYBR Green was used with gene specific primers (listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary material and methods</xref>) on an ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection Systems.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data analysis of histone modification and p53 ChIP and RNAseq from public data set</title><p>The data of H3K27me3 ChIP-seq, H3K4me3 ChIP-seq, and RNAseq in H1 hESCs and H1 hMSCs were obtained from the European Nucleotide Archive (accession number: SRP000941): <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/SRP000941">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/SRP000941</ext-link><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.

The same set of genes were also plotted for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 levels in H1-derived hMSCs (right). The <italic>p21</italic> gene is marked in black open circle and shows high levels of H3K27me3 in hESCs, indicating that it is epigenetically repressed. The color corresponds to the mRNA expression level (FPKM) for each gene in the respective cell type. (<bold>B</bold>) Heatmap showing relative mRNA expression of p53 target gene candidates in H1 hESCs and hMSCs. Genes were sorted by the ratio of H3K27me3 levels in hESCs:hMSCs. FPKM values were normalized per gene to obtain relative expression values. The <italic>p21</italic> gene and the genes selected for further analysis in Fig. 5C are indicated in red. (<bold>C</bold>) A subset of p53 target gene candidates is suppressed in H9 hESCs and requires p53 for expression in hMSCs. RNA was extracted from H9 hESCs and hMSCs and the indicated genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3, means&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD) (left plot). The mean value of mRNA expression in H9 hESCs is set at 1, and relative expression is shown in the left plot. H9 hMSCs were transfected with control and p53 siRNAs, and mRNA levels of each gene were analyzed similarly (right plot). The mean value of mRNA expression in control siRNA transfected H9 MSCs is set at 1, and relative expression is shown in the right plot. The passage number of H9 hMSCs is P8.
