The swarm-forming invasive millipede, <italic>Chamberlinius hualienensis</italic>, which is not classified as eusocial animal, exudes irritant chemicals such as benzoyl cyanide as a defensive secretion. Although it has been thought that this defensive chemical was converted from mandelonitrile, identification of the biocatalyst has remained unidentified for 40 years. Here, we identify the novel blood enzyme, mandelonitrile oxidase (ChuaMOX), which stoichiometrically catalyzes oxygen consumption and synthesis of benzoyl cyanide and hydrogen peroxide from mandelonitrile. Interestingly the enzymatic activity is suppressed at a blood pH of 7, and the enzyme is segregated by membranes of defensive sacs from mandelonitrile which has a pH of 4.6, the optimum pH for ChuaMOX activity. In addition, strong body muscle contractions are necessary for <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of benzoyl cyanide. We propose that, to protect its swarm, the sacrificial millipede also applies a self-destructive defense strategy&#x02014;the endogenous rupturing of the defensive sacs to mix ChuaMOX and mandelonitrile at an optimum pH. Further study of defensive systems in primitive arthropods will pave the way to elucidate the evolution of altruistic defenses in the animal kingdom.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Swarm-forming animals have unique defense systems for protection.

Mandelonitrile is a defensive chemical that is conserved among cyanogenic millipedes and is also used as a starting material to produce benzaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and benzoyl cyanide as defensive secretions. The aldoxime-nitrile pathway in the synthesis of mandelonitrile through phenylacetaldoxime and phenylacetonitrile is widely observed in bacteria, cyanogenic plants, and millipedes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p><p>The invasive polydesmid millipede, <italic>Chamberlinius hualienensis</italic> Wang, derives from Taiwan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The animal usually forms a large swarm in cedar forests (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) and has been expanding its range throughout southern Japan. When a cyanogenic millipede is attacked by a predator, it achieves a high blood pressure by forming a tight defensive spiral and can then expel benzoyl cyanide as a defensive chemical<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.

In addition, the reactive chemical causes irritation of the nose, eyes, and mouth of vertebrates such as birds, lizards, and humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. It has been proposed that benzoyl cyanide is converted from mandelonitrile by dehydrogenation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. However, identification of mandelonitrile dehydrogenase has remained unidentified for 40 years.</p><p>Here, we identify the novel enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of benzoyl cyanide from mandelonitrile. The enzyme is actually classified as an oxidase. We characterize its enzymatic activity, physico-chemical properties, and localization. Surprisingly, the substrate and the enzyme are not colocalized; they separately accumulate in defensive sacs and in blood respectively. Synthesis of benzoyl cyanide likely occurs by, endogenously rupturing the membranes of the defensive sacs using strong body muscle contractions during defensive behavior. We discuss this self-destructive defense of the millipede for protection of its swarm by synthesizing benzoyl cyanide from mandelonitrile through mandelonitrile oxidase.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification, purification, and characterization of mandelonitrile oxidase from the invasive millipede</title><p>On the basis of a preliminary experiment using millipede homogenate as an enzyme source, we detected the production not only of benzoyl cyanide but also of hydrogen peroxide from mandelonitrile.

Placing 0.1 U and 0.01 U of the purified enzyme in 1&#x02009;ml of 100&#x02009;mM citrate buffer with pH 5 containing 500&#x02009;nmol of (<italic>R</italic>)-mandelonitrile at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 1&#x02009;min consumed 95.6&#x02009;nmol and 7.30&#x02009;nmol of oxygen and produced 106&#x02009;nmol and 10.2&#x02009;nmol of benzoyl cyanide and 100&#x02009;nmol and 10&#x02009;nmol of hydrogen peroxide, respectively. These results indicate that the enzyme stoichiometrically consumes oxygen and converts (<italic>R</italic>)-mandelonitrile into benzoyl cyanide and hydrogen peroxide, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The results suggest that the enzyme should be newly classified as mandelonitrile:oxygen oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.3.-). Thus, we named this enzyme mandelonitrile oxidase (ChuaMOX).</p><p>The molecular mass of ChuaMOX was estimated to be 67,000 Da by SDS-PAGE analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3a</xref>) and 65,000 Da by gel-filtration. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining determined that this enzyme was glycosylated (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3b</xref>). UV-visible scanning detected three absorption maxima at 278&#x02009;nm, 404&#x02009;nm, and 469&#x02009;nm (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). Thin layer chromatography (TLC) identified the prosthetic group as flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p><p>The values of <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of ChuaMOX for racemic mandelonitrile were calculated as 2.1&#x02009;mM and 151.5&#x02009;U/mg, respectively. The optimum pH toward mandelonitrile lay within a range of pH 4 and pH 4.5, and the enzyme also showed 80% activity at pH 3.5 and pH 5. Enzymatic activity decreased in conditions approaching neutral pH, and it was lowest at a pH of 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). After one hour of incubation at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 80% of the ChuaMOX activity remained over a range of pH values between 3 and 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). The optimum temperature was 35&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and 90% of the enzymatic activity was observed at 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 40&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). After one hour of incubation at pH 8, 80% of the activity remained between 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 50&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and all activity was lost at 70&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). These results suggest that ChuaMOX is a stable enzyme similar to hydroxynitrile lyase, which was previously isolated from <italic>C. hualienensis</italic> (ChuaHNL) and considered as a potential industrial biocatalyst for the synthesis of cyanohydrins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The formation of hydrogen peroxide constituted 100%, 29%, and 22% of the ChuaMOX activity toward mandelonitrile, (<italic>E</italic>)-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbut-3-enenitrile, and 2-(3-bromophenyl)-2-hydroxyacetonitrile, respectively, indicating that this enzyme specifically reacts with mandelonitrile (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The enzyme required (<italic>R</italic>)-mandelonitrile as a substrate rather than (<italic>S</italic>)-mandelonitrile (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Adding 1&#x02009;mM potassium cyanide, sodium azide, and 8-hydroxyquinoline resulted in 12.7%, 28.6%, and 56% relative activities of ChuaMOX, respectively, but adding 1&#x02009;mM ferric chloride enhanced the activity to 124.6% (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cloning of cDNA of ChuaMOX, prediction of its properties, and the enzyme and substrate localization</title><p>To further characterize ChuaMOX, we cloned its cDNA.

The ORF consisted of 1,782&#x02009;bp encoding 593 amino acid residues including a 17 amino acid-long signal peptide, and the deduced amino acid sequence also included 8 amino acid sequences determined by protein sequencing (accession number, LC036560; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). The predicted mature protein had a molecular mass of 62,818 Da and an isoelectric point of 6.26. It also contained 6 predicted <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites (N57, N79, N94, N149, N406, and N491), and a FAD binding motif (VXGXGXXGXXXA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> in the T22-S62 region (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>), which agree with the results of PAS staining, the UV-visible scanning, and the TLC analyses (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S3b and S4, and Table S2</xref>).

However, phylogenetic analysis indicated that ChuaMOX did not belong to the cluster of glucose dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The enzymatic activity not to react toward D-glucose (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>) and the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) suggest that ChuaMOX is a distinctive enzyme stoichiometrically catalyzing oxygen consumption and the conversion of mandelonitrile into benzoyl cyanide and hydrogen peroxide and that it differs from glucose dehydrogenases and alcohol dehydrogenases.</p><p><italic>ChuaMOX</italic> was expressed in the paraterga of the millipede (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), which houses the storage and reaction chambers related to the production of defensive secretions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Because the storage and reaction chambers were fragile in various preparations of tissue sections, we could not detect cytological expression of ChuaMOX. Thus, we applied zymography to detect the enzyme activity of ChuaMOX from each experimental tissue. Intriguingly, most of the enzyme was detected in the blood (0.1 animal equivalent) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), even though its pH of 7 is inappropriate for the expression of the enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). A scanty amount of the enzymatic activity was detected in the paraterga (1 animal equivalent), which may be derived from residual blood in the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b)</xref>. (<italic>R</italic>)-Mandelonitrile, a substrate of ChuaMOX, was detected from the paraterga by HPLC analysis but benzoyl cyanide was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). In addition, although defensive secretions such as benzaldehyde, benzoyl cyanide, and benzoic acid were observed in the whole-body extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), no candidate cyanohydrins for ChuaMOX were detected from the blood by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). These results indicate that ChuaMOX is not only suppressed by the neutral pH of the blood, but it is also segregated from its substrate, (<italic>R</italic>)-mandelonitrile, by tissue membranes of the storage and reaction chambers. Furthermore, benzoyl cyanide is not stored in the defensive sacs but is newly synthesized during defensive behavior. In other words, the expression of benzoyl cyanide synthesis by the defense system is unusual in terms of the millipede&#x02019;s physiology.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Body muscle contractions are essential for mixing ChuaMOX and (<italic>R</italic>)-mandelonitrile, causing the production of benzoyl cyanide</title><p>To understand this enigma, we reexamined the synthesis of benzoyl cyanide in the millipede. The animal discharges defensive secretions, the major components of which are mandelonitrile, benzaldehyde, and benzoyl cyanide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In the Japanese cedar forest, the animal is possibly attacked by large predators such as wild birds (jungle crow, <italic>Corvus macrorhynchos</italic>; Eurasian jay, <italic>Garrulus glandarius</italic>; dusky thrush, <italic>Turdus eunomus</italic>; and pale thrush, <italic>Turdus pallidus</italic>). These birds usually show behaviors of 1) swallowing in one gulp or 2) eating after teasing with a beak. Thus, we mimicked such attacks for 1) as a non-treated animal and 2) as a shaken animal, extracted the defensive secretion from each animal with an organic solvent (<italic>n</italic>-hexane:2-propanol with a volume ratio of 85:15). We then analyzed the extract using an HPLC equipped with a chiral column. The non-treated animal secreted benzaldehyde and benzoyl cyanide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), while the shaken animal secreted benzaldehyde, benzoyl cyanide, and mandelonitrile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). These results indicate that an active millipede is able to produce benzoyl cyanide in both conditions 1) and 2).</p><p>In the <italic>n</italic>-hexane/2-propanol extraction, we reproducibly observed that both experimental animals writhed in agony and exhibited strong body muscle contractions until death. It has been reported that a predator, the larva of the phengodid beetle, <italic>Phengodes laticollis</italic>, presumably injects a muscle relaxant into its millipede prey, <italic>Floridobolus penneri</italic>, before feeding to avoid the formation of a tight defensive spiral and the discharge of defensive secretions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Thus, we hypothesized that inhibition of the body muscle contractions presumably prevents the production of benzoyl cyanide from the (<italic>R</italic>)-mandelonitrile. After anesthetizing using diethyl ether, the relaxed millipede did not display its defensive form or muscle contractions. HPLC analysis failed to detect not only benzaldehyde and mandelonitrile but also detected no benzoyl cyanide from the anesthetized animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we sought to synthesize benzoyl cyanide by roughly snatching the paraterga from the weakly anesthetized animals, which is expected to rupture defensive sac and mix residual blood containing ChuaMOX and mandelonitrile. HPLC analysis detected benzaldehyde, mandelonitrile, and benzoyl cyanide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that synthesis of benzoyl cyanide requires strong body muscle contractions in the tight defensive spiral position, presumably rupturing the defensive sacs and thus mixing ChuaMOX and mandelonitrile.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we isolate and localize ChuaMOX, which has remained unidentified for 40 years. It is stable in a wide range of pH and temperature conditions and is a monomeric glycosylated oxidase containing FAD as a prosthetic group. Furthermore, it stoichiometrically catalyzes the oxygen consumption and the synthesis of benzoyl cyanide and hydrogen peroxide from (<italic>R</italic>)-mandelonitrile and is different from glucose dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase. Thus, this enzyme is classified as mandelonitrile:oxygen oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.3.-). The enzymatic activity is expressed in a range of pH 3.5 to pH 5, whereas it is lowest at a blood pH of 7. The blood enzyme is segregated by membranes of the storage and reaction chambers from the substrate, (<italic>R</italic>)-mandelonitrile, in a condition of pH 4.6 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments indicate that muscle contractions in the animal are essential for synthesis of benzoyl cyanide.</p><p>We propose the following molecular defense system for this invasive animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>): when caught by a large predator, the millipede severely contracts its body muscle, which results in extremely high blood pressure. After endogenously rupturing the membranes of the storage and reaction chambers, the ChuaMOX in the blood immediately flows into these chambers due to the high blood pressure. The suppressed enzyme is activated by the shift of pH from 7 to 4.6 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>), which starts the synthesis of benzoyl cyanide from (<italic>R</italic>)-mandelonitrile. Finally, the benzoyl cyanide is released from the sacrificed body, acting as a toxic exudate.</p><p>These defensive chemicals provide protection to both the animal under attack and its swarm. In some cases, the continuous release of the defensive chemicals from the prey contributes to the protection of its undamaged swarm from the large predator. Among eusocial insects, the carpenter ant, <italic>Camponotus cylindricus</italic> complex, also shows, endogenously rupturing its mandibular glands by body muscle contraction to exude defensive secretions of polyacetate-derived aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and alcohols from the mandibular gland<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Soldiers of the termite, <italic>Globitermes sulphureus</italic>, contract their body muscle, rupture the frontal gland membrane, and exude the defensive secretions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The invasive millipede, <italic>C. hualienensis</italic>, is a larger arthropod than ants and termites. Its size (3.5&#x02009;cm) makes it an appropriate pray for wild birds. Although it is not a eusocial animal with sophisticated castes, it also shows rupturing the defensive sacs, which consequently plays a role in protecting its swarm. In the field observation during millipede collection in 2013&#x02013;2015, dusky thrushes approached the gutter filled with the millipedes. However, the wild birds showed just hopping several times toward the gutter, never attacked the swarm, and flew away all the time. Presumably they already learned that the millipedes were not eatable because of its defense system. Thus, the habitat of this millipede may be expanding in Japan yearly.</p><p>Insects and millipedes diverged into Chelicerata and Myriapoda 666 million years ago<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The basal lineages of ants and termites diverged approximately 105&#x02013;110 million years ago and 130 million years ago, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, and each developed eusocial forms. Self-destructive altruistic defenses have evolved independently in each eusocial form in response to various enemies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Although this defensive strategy has been considered as a system unique to social animal, the invasive primitive millipede, which has not evolved eusociality, is also equipped with, rupturing the defensive sacs to protect its swarm. Further study on the defense systems in primitive arthropods will pave the way to delineate the establishment of altruistic defenses in the animal kingdom.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Millipede</title><p>Invasive millipedes of <italic>C. hualienensis</italic> [Polydesmida: Paradoxomatidae] were collected in Japanese cedar forests in southern Japan in 2013&#x02013;2015 and shipped to our lab.
