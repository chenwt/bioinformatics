We aim to explore the potential negatively regulated miRNA-mRNA pairs and investigate their regulatory roles so as to elaborate the potential roles of the critical proteins in the signaling pathways enriched by the differential target genes of negatively regulated miRNA in CRC. Firstly, the differential miRNA-mRNA pairs were selected, followed by pairs of miRNA and their target genes. The obtained relationships were subjected to do functional enrichment analysis and those enriched in CRC pathways were chose to further construct a protein interaction network. Finally, we analyzed the regulatory roles of these relationships and constructed a regulatory network of negatively regulated miRNA and mRNA relationships. A total of 372 pairs of miRNA-mRNA were found and 108 target genes of miRNA were obtained. Three miRNAs including hsa-mir-23b, hsa-mir-365-1 and hsa-mir-365-2 showed significant influence on prognosis of CRC patients. To conclude, the miRNA/mRNA deregulations pairs identified in this study have high potentials to be further applied in diagnosis and treatment of CRC.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> and recently accumulated evidence indicates that CRC is a genetically heterogeneous and complicated disease caused by abnormalities in gene structure and/or expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. It is now generally accepted that CRC mainly develops through two different genetic pathways, of which one is the chromosomal instability pathway characterized by the involvement of APC, p53, and k-ras genes, by 18q allelic loss, and by aneuploidy DNA content, while the other is a pathway involving microsatellite instability (MSI)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Although considerable progress has been made in molecular biology, novel approaches are still required to uncover the detailed molecular mechanism of CRC.</p><p>Recently, microarray tools have been enriched by the development of platforms for the analysis of miRNA expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. miRNAs consists of an abundant class of endogenous, small non-coding RNAs at a length of 18&#x02013;25 nucleotides, which can repress protein translation by binding to the target mRNAs. It is reported there are over 700 miRNA sequences in the human genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> by the latest version of miRBase (release 13.0, March 2009). In addition, miRNAs have been mainly studied in the field of oncological research, and more and more evidence shows that altered miRNA regulation may involve in the pathogenesis of cancers through regulating the translation of tumor suppressors and oncogenes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In addition, miRNAs can target up to several hundred mRNAs, which makes them very powerful regulators and an aberrant miRNA expression can disturb a multitude of cell signaling pathways and profoundly influence cancer onset and progression. Changes in the expression of miRNAs have been observed in a variety of human tumors. Although the expression differences can not represent causal events of carcinogenesis necessarily, yet these changes may regulate some genes that are very important during the process of tumor pathogenesis and may contribute to the classification and prognosis of tumors. These alterations of miRNA expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> have now been detected in various solid tumors and hematological malignancies, such as CRC. As is known, the main function of mammalian miRNAs is post-transcriptionally regulating their target mRNAs, indicating the combination of mRNAs expression and miRNAs may represent the transcriptional program which describes the normal and tumor tissue characteristics more accurately. At present, there are two approaches applied to study the connection between miRNAs and CRC, including functional and profiling studies. Anyhow, it is showed that the expression profiles of miRNAs have the same potentiality to identify the biomarkers as profiling of their mRNA or protein counterparts. This enables prognosis prediction, therapy response and distinguishing some kinds of disease like CRC.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed the expression data of miRNAs and mRNAs of CRC in (The Cancer Genome Atlas) TCGA database so as to excavate the potential deregulated miRNA/mRNA and expound the possible roles of the critic proteins in the signaling pathways enriched by the differential target genes of the deregulated miRNA, hoping to better understand the pathogenesis and make contributes to the diagnosis or therapy of CRC.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Differential genes and miRNA</title><p>The information of expression value of 20531 genes and 680 miRNAs in a total of 253 samples was obtained after pre-processing the TCGA expression data with the detailed flowcharts shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>. Then the differential genes and miRNAs were screened by SAM and limma algorithms was/were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>. A total of 4937 differentially expressed genes were selected by both the algorithms, among which 2974 of genes were up-regulated while 1963 of genes were down-regulated in cancer samples, accounting for 60.23% and 39.77% of the total differential genes respectively. There were 118 differentially expressed miRNAs, among which 57 were up-regulated while 61down-regulated in cancer samples, accounting for 48.31% and 51.69% of the total differential miRNAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). In order to better characterize the differential miRNAs to distinguish between cancer and normal samples, the differential miRNAs were further used to do clustering analysis. The differential miRNAs could distinguish the normal and cancer samples effectively, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Functional enrichment analysis of the differential targeted genes</title><p>108 target genes of miRNA were obtained, and there were a total of 2093 validated target genes through searching all the differential miRNA in miRWalk2.0 database. Pearson correlation tests of the 108 miRNA and their 2093 target genes were calculated respectively, and the pairs of miRNA- target genes with negative correlation value p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 were screened. There were 377 pairs which contained 202 genes and 76 miRNA. In order to study the regulation effects of the significant negative relationships, 202 genes were selected to map into the DAVID database and subjected to functional enrichment analysis. After GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis for the genes, we found the biological processes involved mainly included the positive regulation of the main macromolecule metabolic process, positive regulation of biosynthetic process, positive regulation of macromolecule biosynthetic process, positive regulation of gene expression and so on, among which 52 genes were enriched in 20 KEGG related pathway, and 36 genes were enriched in 13 tumor-associated pathways, including pathways in cancer, prostate cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia and CRC. In addition, 30 genes were enriched in 5 signaling pathways, including MAPK signaling pathway, ErbB signaling pathway and the like; wherein the expression of critical protein ErbB1 in ErbB signaling pathway was significantly down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), while 23 genes were enriched in focal adhesion and cell cycle pathway and the expression of key protein CDK2 in cell cycle pathway was up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Screening of disease related miRNAs</title><p>With the aim of further elucidating the roles of miRNA-mRNA relationships, the miRNA-mRNA pairs where all the genes enriched in colorectal pathway were selected; then a total of 30 corresponding miRNAs were screened, finally 137 genes associated with these miRNAs were selected, which constituted 231 pairs of miRNA-mRNA with miRNA. The selected 30 miRNAs were all subjected to do survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier method, among which hsa-mir-23b, hsa-mir-365-1 and hsa-mir-365-2 showed significant influence on prognosis, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>. All these 3 miRNAs were downregulated in cancer samples, while the one with relatively high expression in the downregulated samples would have a bad prognosis. Then 13 genes in the CRC-related miRNA-mRNA pairs were subjected to do enrichment analysis, and the results showed that the main biological processes involved in included promoting the regulation of metabolic processes of large molecules, promoting the regulation of cell bio-synthesis, promoting the regulation of bio-synthesis, promoting the regulation of gene expression and so on. 42 genes were included in the KEGG pathway, among which 32 genes participated in cancer pathways, while 26 genes were associated with 5 signaling pathway and 21 genes were involved in focal adhesion, cell cycle, adhesive connection, which contained all the pathways that the original 202 genes were enriched in, indicating the selected 137 genes could represent the 202 genes with regulation procures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>. Then the 137 genes were mapped to the String database and used to construct a PPI interaction network by STRING. A total of 387 pairs of protein interactions with reliability scores greater than 0.4 were selected, among which 96 nodes, accounting for 70.1% of all disease-related genes. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>, the protein interaction network of these genes presented a highly aggregated state. High aggregation is an essential characteristic of biological networks. As could be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>, the majority of genes in a strong interaction with each other were significantly down-regulated. And they formed two clusters, one was associated with cancer, the majority of them were down-regulated; while the other was associated with cell cycle, and most of them were up-regulated. Furthermore we calculated the topology parameters of the network, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8A&#x02013;E</xref>. From A we could see the distribution of network node degrees followed a pattern of power law network; from the shortest path in B, the average aggregation coefficient in C and proximity to the center in D, we could also see that they meet the characteristics of small-world networks.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Construction of regulation networks of miRNA-mRNA</title><p>Eight disease and also eight normal samples were randomly selected to do principal component analysis in miRNA and genes of disease-related miRNA-mRNA so as to distinguish between normal and disease samples with results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>. In order to further investigate the role of miRNA in miRNA-mRNA pairs, we chose 30 miRNAs to calculate their changes in all disease samples, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10A</xref>. The majority changes of miRNAs were less than 0.25, the miRNA hsa-mir-149 with change exceeding 0.25 was selected to execute survival analysis, and observe the effect of its expression in different samples on the prognosis. The survival and treatment information of the corresponding samples in TCGA were downloaded respectively, and they were divided into two groups based on expression level of hsa-mir-149, one with high expression within the group, while the other with low expression with the final survival curve demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10B</xref>. From which we could see the survival rates of the samples with high expression within the group were higher than that of the ones with low expression at 500&#x02013;800 days; however, at 800&#x02013;2500 days the survival rates were lower than that of the ones with low expression within the group, and the survival rates were higher than that of the ones with low expression within the group again after 2800 days. Ultimately a miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was successfully constructed by the regulation interaction of miRNA-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f11">Fig. 11</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the study, a total of 372 pairs of important miRNA/mRNA were found, and the potential functional relations of which were suitable for verification by an experiment. A number of such miRNA/mRNA showed they may play critical roles during the regulation of some genes, especially those expressed in cancer. For example, miR-125b inhibits the formation of tumor vessels by suppressing the expression of VE-cadherin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>; the miRNAmiR-34 family members are important activity mediators for the p53 gene, which plays a key role in oncogenesis. Ectopic expression of miR-34 in breast cancer cells results in decreased proliferation, invasion, and induces apoptosis. Decreased expression of miR-34 was observed in breast tumors and non-small cell lung cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In addition, the expression level of miR-221 that correlates with the expression of p53 can be regarded as a prognostic marker; miR-141 is a new biomarker that can be used for diagnostics of CRC with distant metastasis along with the tumor specific antigen CEA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>In order to study the roles of the miRNA-mRNA pairs in cancer, we selected 137 genes and found that they participated in a series of biological processes and signaling pathways including MAPK signaling pathway, ErbB signaling pathway, Cell cycle and so on. The expressions of certain proteins in the MAPK signaling pathway such as MAP2K4, MAPK1, MAP3K2 and so on were all abnormal. As we known, the MAPK signaling pathway is a highly conserved intercellular signaling system present in multicellular organisms and plays an essential role in cancer progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. And a number of miRNAs have been reported to be associated with the MAPK/ERK pathway in different experimental systems and tumors, some of which have been reported to directly target components of MAPK signaling, but most appear to target the downstream players of MAPK signaling, such as proteins regulating the cell cycle and migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Furthermore, the critical protein ErbB1 in ErbB signaling pathway was down-regulated.</p><p>To further study the function of the 30 miRNAs, they were all subjected to do survival analysis and we found hsa-mir-23b, hsa-mir-365-1 and hsa-mir-365-2 showed significant influence on prognosis. miR-365 has been reported to be involved in the carcinogenesis of CRC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, and hsa-mir-365-2 was reported to act as one of negative regulators of BCL2 through direct binding to their respective binding sites in the 3&#x02032;-UTR of the human BCL2 gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. While BCL2 was identified as an oncogene that does not promote cell proliferation but the evasion of cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. And previous study had proved that overexpression of hsa-mir-365-2 not only caused an increase in apoptosis but also augmented the apoptotic effect of etoposide in breast cancer MCF7 cells, indicating that hsa-mir-365-2 had therapeutic potential.</p><p>Moreover, from the expression changes of these miRNAs among various cancer samples, we found that there was little expression change in most of the miRNAs while miRNA hsa-mir-149 changed a lot. Several lines of evidence have suggested that miR149 plays multiple roles in the cell proliferation, as well as pathogenesis of the progression of various types of malignant tumors, and infectious diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. However, the results were still in dispute<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The expression of MiR-149 was down-regulated in several tumors, such as NSCLC, and it acted as a tumor suppressor to inhibit the oncogenes expression. For example, the expression of miR-149 was down-regulated in glioblastoma and it could restrain the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells through hindering AKT1 signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Moreover, loss of miR-149 resulted in oncogenes expression increase and was related with tumor stage in astrocytomas and renal cell carcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Elevated miR-149 also played an important role in the progress of nasopharyngeal carcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Nevertheless, little was known about the role of miR-149 in CRC. Our study demonstrated the influence of miR-149 on CRC, we divided miR-149 into two groups based on its expression level to observe the effect on the prognosis of CRC. The results indicated that the miR-149 at different level had certain influence on the survival rates of patients with CRC.</p><p>As nearly half of the mRNAs codes protein are subjected to the miRNA-mediated regulation, the role of miRNAs as important regulators of significant genes for cancer has been confirmed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Therefore, it is of importance to understand the functions of miRNA and their regulatory networks, which may provide new insights into cancer development and find new potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. To conclude, this study may provide useful information for understanding the miRNA changes in CRC.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data</title><p>The colorectal adenocarcinoma miRNASeq and level3 RNAseq data were downloaded from TCGA database.

Through identification of the principal components by PCA, one direction can be found, and the value of the data distributed along this direction were the maximum, which reduced the data dimension. Furthermore, just a number of variables rather than thousands of variables can be enough to classify the samples by principal component analysis.
