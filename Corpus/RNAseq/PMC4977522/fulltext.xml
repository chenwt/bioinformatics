The physiopathology of these diseases has multifactorial aetiology in which environmental factors, particularly pollution could play a crucial role. Among the different pollutants listed, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are subject to increased monitoring due to their wide distribution and high toxicity on Humans. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate the impact of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP, most toxic PAH) oral exposure on the faecal and intestinal mucosa-associated bacteria in C57BL/6 mice. Intestinal inflammation was also evaluated by histological observations. BaP oral exposure significantly altered the composition and the abundance of the gut microbiota and led to moderate inflammation in ileal and colonic mucosa. More severe lesions were observed in ileal segment. Shifts in gut microbiota associated with moderate inflammatory signs in intestinal mucosa would suggest the establishment of a pro-inflammatory intestinal environment following BaP oral exposure. Therefore, under conditions of genetic susceptibility and in association with other environmental factors, exposure to this pollutant could trigger and/or accelerate the development of inflammatory pathologies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The gut microbiota is referred as all the diverse microbial populations that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract. Composed of more than 10<sup>14</sup> bacterial cells displayed over 1,000 species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, the intestinal microbial community is considered as a near organ that has coevolved with the human host to perform symbiotic relationship leading to gut homeostasis. Notably, the gut microbiota plays crucial roles in not only energetic balance regulation, drug and xenobiotic metabolism and nutrition but also maturation and modulation of the immune system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Furthermore, the gut microbiota maintains a close relationship with the intestinal mucosa and participates to the regulation of the intestinal barrier effect in a protector and structural role<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Although the gut microbiota appears to be largely beneficial to the human host organism, modifications of the bacterial community composition (BCC), or dysbiosis, are associated with digestive system dysfunction that leads to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and other non-digestive chronic disorders, including allergies, arthritic diseases, obesity, metabolic syndromes or autoimmune disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>Perturbations of the gut microbiota can be caused by several external factors such as the quality of the environment. The impact of toxic environmental chemical compounds such as cadmium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> has been reported in <italic>in vivo</italic> models. Epidemiologic studies have also revealed a relationship between air pollution and human diseases, such as an increased incidence and hospitalization for IBD in industrialized countries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, suggesting a multifactorial origin for these pathologies. In association (or not) with physiological, genetic, immunological and other environmental factors (e.g., stress, diet and antibiotic treatment), the quality of the environment could play a key role in the initiation, development or clinical expression of diseases <italic>via</italic> alterations of the gut microbiota.</p><p>Among the different pollutants listed, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are one of the most monitored because most of them have harmful effects in humans. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is the most characterized and toxic member of this pollutant family. Indeed, several mutagenic, carcinogenic and pro-inflammatory effects have been demonstrated in various animal models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Tumour induction in several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, led also the BaP to be classified as a group 1 carcinogen in humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Human contamination to BaP is unavoidable and occurs through polluted water, soil exposure, as well as through consumption of food, primarily charcoal-broiled, grilled and smoked meats and fishes or poorly cleaned vegetables<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The inhalation of polluted air<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> or tobacco smoke<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> is another source of BaP exposure. The gastrointestinal tract is consequently the human system with the highest exposure, owing to oral uptakes as well as inhaled BaP, which is transported from the lungs to the digestive system by the mucociliary clearance mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>As it was previously underlined, modifications in gut microbiota have been linked to human diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, and the toxic effects of BaP have been extensively characterized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. However, the impact of BaP on the intestinal BCC is still unknown. Based on its pro-inflammatory and mutagenic proprieties, we hypothesized that oral exposure to BaP may disrupt the intestinal microbiota, leading to the induction of an abnormal inflammatory response and an alteration of gut functions. Therefore, in the present work, we performed a subchronic oral exposure to BaP in a murine model. 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing analysis of faecal and mucosa-associated microbiota was carried out to investigate bacterial structure shifts (richness, diversity and composition) following BaP oral administration. Furthermore, intestinal inflammation was evaluated via histological observations performed on the intestinal mucosa of both ileum and colon.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Development of moderate intestinal inflammation during BaP treatment</title><p>The development of intestinal inflammation in mice was determined by histological examination.

Infiltration of the epithelium by polynuclear cells was significantly increased in these two intestinal mucosa tissues from mice exposed to orally administered BaP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1c,d</xref>). Crypt damage and proliferation of inflammatory cells were observed in both ileal and colonic mucosa; in the most severe case, a multifocal erosion of the epithelial surface was also detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>BaP oral exposure did not alter alpha-diversity indices</title><p>We investigated the effects of BaP oral exposure on bacterial richness (qualitative measures [number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Chao1]) and diversity (quantitative species-based measures (Shannon) and divergence-based measures (PD))<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> for different groups of mice.

Emerging evidence has suggested that environmental factors, especially pollution, may be associated with several pathologies. Because links between gut microbiota and diseases and between pollution and pathologies have been previously documented, we investigated the potential effects of BaP subchronic oral exposure both on the intestinal epithelium of different parts of the gastrointestinal tract and on the gut bacterial structure in C57BL/6 mice.</p><p>As showed in previous analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, a lower richness and diversity have been observed for the mucosa-associated microbiota compare to the faecal samples. However, these differences can be explained in part by the great disparity in the sequencing depth between these two types of microbiota samples. Despite that BaP is a molecule characterized by toxic properties and for which modifications of bacterial communities from different environments were observed (e.g., Sawluski <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), no significant impact of BaP was found on the bacterial richness or diversity of either stools or intestinal mucosa tissues in mice, as it was also observed for other environmental pollutants such as PCB or heavy metals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p><p>If no effect was shown on alpha-diversity, the data underlined that BaP oral exposure induced significant shifts in the composition and relative abundance of stool and mucosa-associated bacterial communities in mice (Mann-Whitney test <italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Although the physiological and anatomical structures of humans and mice are quite similar, and most of the mechanisms of microbiota-host interactions are shared between these species, some key differences exist between murine models and humans. For instance, although 85% of the bacterial species found in mice are not present in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, similar trends have been observed in the gut microbiota composition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Thus, in our work, the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla predominated the faecal and mucosa-associated BCC, which was consistent with the results of other studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Moreover, although bacterial populations displayed a broad diversity and taxonomic composition that could varied during the kinetics of each experimental mouse group and between treatments, the general structure of the bacterial assembly remained the same. Indeed, both the faecal and mucosa-associated BCC were dominated by a small number of taxa.</p><p>Oral exposure to BaP appeared to elicit environmental stress mainly on the bacterial family and genus levels. For example, no decrease in Firmicutes was detected following BaP oral exposure, whereas <italic>Lactobacillaceae,</italic> and more particularly <italic>Lactobacillus,</italic> decreased at the end of the experimental period for faecal BCC (T27). <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> are reduced in ulcerative colitis patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and also in mice that have been exposed to heavy metals such as cadmium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Other bacterial taxa that are also recognized as beneficial and that decrease in abundance in inflammatory diseases, such as <italic>Mucispirillum</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic>, were selectively affected during the course of BaP administration and at the end of the experimental period for faecal analyses. <italic>Mucispirillum,</italic> which is a mucolytic genus, plays an important role in regulating host gene expression and cellular functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic>, which produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (acetate) that promote intestinal and systemic health, are depleted in Crohn&#x02019;s disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Following the first BaP oral administration (T1), an increase in abundance of beneficial bacterium <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> was observed. The abilities of this bacterium to degrade mucus and to produce propionate which notably stimulates the immune system and the intestinal barrier functions, have been demonstrated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The bloom of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> one day after the first administration of BaP may suggest a protective effect on the intestinal epithelium. However, this protective effect appeared to be temporary, because a global decrease in the relative abundance of this bacterium was observed during exposure to BaP. These depletions of different beneficial bacterial taxa seem to occur with the onset of a pro-inflammatory intestinal environment, in which members of the <italic>Porphyromonadaceae</italic>, <italic>Paraprevotellaceae</italic>, and <italic>Alcaligenaceae</italic> families, which are known to be associated with inflammatory states, increase in abundance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. <italic>Allobaculum,</italic> which belongs to the <italic>Erysipelotrichaceae</italic> family, was also increased. However, the role of this bacterial genus remains still unclear: Everard <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> have identified <italic>Allobaculum</italic> as being potentially beneficial for host physiology, whereas Wei <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> have found that this genus is increased in the faeces of rats developing precancerous mucosal lesions.</p><p>The rare members of the faecal bacterial communities also underwent temporal changes, like the dominant members. Moreover they can play an important role in the physiology and homeostasis of the gastrointestinal tract. Indeed if they are low contributors to the total community abundance, these members can represent substantial contributors to the functioning of the ecosystem<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In fact, rare members can rapidly increase their presence in response to environmental changes by acting as an active microbial seed bank with a pool of ecological potential. The increase of some rare bacterial taxa that are considered to be harmful to the gut would not be surprising. Thus, BaP oral exposure could lead to the development of a favourable environment for populations that are non-beneficial to the host. These populations include <italic>Desulfovibrionaceae</italic> members, whose increase has previously been related to the occurrence of host inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> and colitis in a murine model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. It has also been suggested that <italic>Desulfovibrionaceae</italic> members could produce endotoxins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> and toxic sulfur<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, which has the capacity to induce inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. To validate these hypotheses, endotoxins and LPS productions should be monitored in future studies. We also observed an increase in rare taxa that are considered to be beneficial for the functioning of the intestinal tract, such as <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> at the end of BaP oral exposure. This lactic bacterial genus has been particularly associated with IBD remission<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In context of the bacterial community functioning in ecosystems, integrating especially the concepts of stability and resistance, the <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> bloom could underline the important role of rare taxa in intestinal homeostasis. Indeed the recruitment of beneficial bacteria can counteract the negative effects of BaP and the higher abundance of pro-inflammatory populations. Their increase could therefore contribute to maintain the gut ecosystem stability <italic>via</italic> resistance phenomenon. Nevertheless, this remains hypothetical and needs to be confirmed in subsequent studies. The capacity of a community to accommodate to environmental changes can be realized by adjusting the overall performance of the present taxa. In the gut, metabolic plasticity or functional redundancy may also be present at the community level, indicating that a similar functional role can be performed by several taxa in the community.</p><p>Several differences have been highlighted between the BCC from stools and the intestinal mucosa. The intestinal epithelium plays an important role as barrier that prevents the entry of bacteria and the passage of microbial components that could drive inflammation. Thus, the mucus layer, which is secreted by the intestinal epithelium, acts as the first physical line of defence and with mucosa-associated bacteria, forms a specific environment in the gut. The alteration of any of these two parameters may play a crucial role in the development of inflammation, and consequently, in the development of intestinal pathologies. Spatial variations were observed in mucosal BCC at family and genus level at the end of the BaP treatment. For all gut segments studied, a decrease of beneficial bacteria was consistent with an increase of pro-inflammatory taxa and a moderate grade of inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. Thus, the depletion of <italic>Coprococcus</italic> (<italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> family), a butyrate-producer, in the ileum of BaP-treated mice has also been shown in IBD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. As <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic>, <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> participate in the carbohydrate fermentation of SCFAs in the human intestine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. A decrease in SCFA production linked to a reduction of these bacterial populations may damage the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium and increased susceptibility to inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. The decrease of <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> in the distal colon in BaP-treated mice suggests a negative impact of the pollutant. Indeed, the immunomodulatory functions of <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> have been highlighted in the colon, revealing their potential as probiotics for treating inflammation in IBD and colitis in a murine model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. In the ileum, the reduction of these different dominant bacterial taxa with anti-inflammatory effects in the BaP treatment group coincided with an increase of dominant and rare bacterial taxa that may be pro-inflammatory, such as <italic>Paraprevotellaceae</italic> (dominant) and <italic>Turicibacter</italic> (rare). For instance, <italic>Turicibacter</italic> has been found at high levels in the ileal pouch of an ulcerative colitis patient<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Following BaP oral exposure, the bloom of the <italic>Clostridium</italic> genus among the rare taxa was observed within the 3 intestinal segments. The role of <italic>Clostridium</italic> could not be defined in our study even though they may take advantage of the alteration of the intestinal epithelium to synthesize potentially toxic metabolic products (e.g., phenols and p-cresols)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Moreover, <italic>Clostridium</italic> have been shown to increase in abundance in patients with ulcerative colitis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. However, we should also note that some <italic>Clostridium</italic> species produce butyrate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. An increase in <italic>Clostridium</italic> species may contribute to the resistance to the pro-inflammatory environment resulting from oral exposure to BaP.</p><p>Chronic oral exposure to BaP caused more pronounced inflammation in the ileal segment than in the colon. This result was concordant with the results of Allais <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, who emphasized that unlike the ileum, the distal colon does not express inflammatory factors in mice subjected to chronic smoke exposure. Similarly, the colon appeared to respond differently than the small intestine to particulate matter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Mucus layer thickness and bacterial density, which are higher in the colon than in the ileum, could contribute to the reduced effect of BaP on the colonic segment. Besides, the small intestine is a known target organ for BaP toxicity, and DNA adduct formation has been demonstrated in the small intestine of mice that were orally exposed to BaP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. The small intestine has been previously shown to be the first segment of the gut to engage in the P450 enzyme-mediated metabolism of absorbed xenobiotics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. The high activity of P450 enzymes in this gut segment could therefore protect the colon against oral exposure to BaP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Moreover, during the investigation of both faecal and mucosa-associated BCC, some bacterial taxa may be identified as actors of xenobiotic degradation. Thus, for <italic>Coriobacteriaceae</italic> members, that increased at the end of the oral exposure to BaP, a strong correlation was found between them and the activity of Cyp3a11, one of the most active cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Therefore, some members of this family may intervene in the degradation of BaP. An increase of <italic>Alcaligenaceae</italic> was also observed in the faecal samples. <italic>Alcaligenaceae</italic> belongs to the <italic>Burkholderiales</italic> order, for which numerous members have been identified as PAH degraders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. In the same way, the bacterial genera specifically detected in the BaP group, such as <italic>Bacillus</italic> in the ileum and <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> in the proximal colon, include species that have been identified as producers of biosurfactants and degraders of PAHs, including BaP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Additionally, it was also suggested that gut microbiota is able to metabolize PAHs into estrogenic metabolites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. These results support the potential role of gut microbiota in BaP degradation.</p><p>To conclude, subchronic oral exposure to BaP induced moderate inflammation primarily in the ileal mucosa and altered the relative abundance of both faecal and mucosa-associated microbiota. At the beginning of the experiment, the gut microbiota may have had a transient protecting effect against the pro-inflammatory proprieties of BaP, especially through the increase of mucolytic taxa. However, after 28 days of oral exposure, BaP led to a pro-inflammatory intestinal environment, with an increase in the pro-inflammatory bacterial taxa and a decrease in the anti-inflammatory bacterial taxa. Even if this study remains descriptive, it is the first work to assess the potential effects of BaP on gut microbiota, especially to analyse both faecal microbiota at different time points and mucosa-associated bacteria at different localisations of the gut. This work establishes a basis for more complex and functional studies. Indeed, to confirm the relationship between gut microbiota shifted by BaP oral exposure and the intestinal functions, gene expression modulation from host and microbial communities, using RNAseq approaches, should be monitored. Such studies will also aim to confirm or refute that under the conditions of genetic susceptibility and in association with other environmental factors, oral exposure to BaP could trigger and/or accelerate the development of inflammatory pathologies such as IBD, autoimmune disorders and colorectal cancers.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animals</title><p>Animal protocols were approved by the Committee for Research and Ethical Issues of the CEMEAA (Comit&#x000e9; d&#x02019;Ethique en Mati&#x000e8;re d&#x02019;Exp&#x000e9;rimentation Animale Auvergne, France) (CE73-12) and were carried out in accordance with the international directive 86/609/CEE.
