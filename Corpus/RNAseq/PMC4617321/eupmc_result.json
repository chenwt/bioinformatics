    "Automated Genomics Analysis (AGA) is an interactive program to analyze high-throughput genomic data sets on a variety of platforms. An easy to use, point and click, guided pipeline is implemented to combine, define, and compare datasets, and customize their outputs. In contrast to other automated programs, AGA enables flexible selection of sample groups for comparison from complex sample annotations. Batch correction techniques are also included to further enable the combination of datasets from diverse studies in this comparison. AGA also allows users to save plots, tables and data, and log files containing key portions of the R script run for reproducible analyses. The link between the interface and R supports collaborative research, enabling advanced R users to extend preliminary analyses generated from bioinformatics novices."
