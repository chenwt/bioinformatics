We hypothesized that microsatellite variation could expand the understanding of glioma etiology. Furthermore, germline markers for gliomas are typically undetectable; therefore we also hypothesize that the predictability of cancer-associated microsatellite loci in germline DNA may support the current hypothesis of a glioma cell of origin.</p><p>In this study, &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; germline exome sequenced DNA from the 1000 Genomes Project (n=390) were compared with exome sequences from germlines of subjects with WHO grade II and III lower-grade glioma (LGG, n=136) and WHO grade IV glioblastoma (GBM, n=252) from The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify microsatellite loci non-randomly associated with glioma. From germline data, we identified 48 GBM-specific loci, 42 Lower-grade glioma specific loci and 29 loci that distinguish GBM from LGG (p&#x02264; 0.01). We then attempted to distinguish WHO grade II glioma (n=67) from GBM resulting in 8 informative loci. Significantly, in all glioma grades, comparisons between tumor and matched germline sequences demonstrated no significant differences in these variants (p&#x02265; 0.01). Therefore, these microsatellite loci are considered to be components of grade-specific signatures for glioma which distinguish germline sequences of individuals with cancer from those of individuals that are &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d;. In order to better understand the significance of these loci, we identified biological processes enriched in genes with these variants. Most strikingly, six helicase genes were enriched in the GBM cohort (p&#x02264; 1.0 &#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>). The preservation of these glioma-specific loci could therefore serve as valuable diagnostic and therapeutic markers; especially since the heterogeneity of tumor cell populations can obscure the identification of mutations preceding a metastatic phenotype.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>GBM</kwd><kwd>microsatellite</kwd><kwd>glioma</kwd><kwd>oligodendroglioma</kwd><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin proteasome system</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Every year in the U.S. approximately 10,000 new adult malignant brain tumors are diagnosed[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] with the most common being glioblastoma (GBM; WHO grade IV astrocytoma)[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Treatment with radiation and chemotherapy yields a median survival of only 11-14 months; therefore, GBM is considered a terminal diagnosis [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There are three main histological groups of adult gliomas: astrocytoma (A); oligodendroglioma (OD) which are slower-growing but rarely progress to GBM; and mixed glioma such as oligoastrocytomas (OA), a mix of A and OD[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Astrocytoma is graded from I to IV according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) classification criteria while OD and OA are primarily in grades II and III. Lower grade adult astrocytomas can progress to higher grade tumors. Recurrence after therapy is common with A, OA, and most OD and is generally associated with more aggressive and infiltrative tumors [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>High-throughput sequencing studies of tumor genomes have produced new molecular markers that have enhanced classification of GBM and highlighted molecular pathways that propagate pathogenesis and progression [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this study, we have chosen to identify and characterize a specific component of glioma genomics- DNA microsatellite variants &#x02013; a feature that is understudied relative to SNPs or epigenetic markers. Microsatellites (MST) are short tandem repeated sequences with variable lengths, making them excellent markers of disease[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Repetitive nucleotide sequences account for 55% of the intergenic region of the genome with 3% of these considered microsatellite repeats[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Microsatellites can be found in both coding and non-coding regions, are generally 10-15 nucleotides in length and are found as monomers, di-, tri-, penta-, or hexamers[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Expansion of tri-nucleotide repeat sequences are notably contributive to over 40 different neurological disorders including Fragile X, Huntington's and Parkinson's Disease[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These alterations are hypothesized to lead to changes in gene regulation through modified binding sites for transcription factors, splicing machinery, or microRNAs [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, changes to microsatellite sequences elicit phenotypes and contribute to diseases, including cancer.</p><p>Therefore, we hypothesize that gliomagenesis is correlated with microsatellite variability at specific loci in germline DNA. Additionally, we demonstrate that germline (non-tumor) DNA is representative of the tumor and these glioma-specific microsatellite loci discriminate glioma grades (specifically II versus IV). With validation, such markers could be developed to aid clinical predictions. We further hypothesize that these loci could influence tumor biology, including a potential contribution to early glioma tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>The two populations studied are GBM and lower-grade gliomas (LGG)</title><p>Classifications were provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and we have chosen to discuss our results using the same assemblage for scientific comparisons (as such, lower-grade gliomas are a mix of glioma types that are non-GBM samples).

Our data show that GBM samples contain 80% of the GBM CAML genotypes regardless of the number of driver mutations found within those samples and that the majority of LGG samples contain 60% of LGG CAML genotypes. However, an increase in CAMLs was identified in most samples with an average of 5 driver mutations, in both GBM and LGG. Interestingly, LGG samples with only 1 driver gene mutation (frequently, IDH-1) were the most likely population to demonstrate CAMLs, and on average 81% of these LGG samples had 43% of the LGG CAMLs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).

As evidenced through our data, several helicases and E3 ubiquitin ligases that are transcriptionally up-regulated by interferon signaling harbor CAMLs, suggesting that a mosaic of genes with functions ascribed to known glioma-specific biology, may work differently in glioma cells with specific and variant microsatellite genotypes. These subtle yet compounding variants may produce gene-products which further intensify genomic instability causing greater genomic alterations (gene mutations, hypermethylation, chromosome loss/breakage, etc.) favoring cancer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-05-6003-g004"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>These data show microsatellite genotypes can differentiate cancer from non-cancer populations and also lower grade from GBM. Since these variant loci are identifiable in somatic DNA and are conserved in tumors lends support to the hypothesis that glioma initiating cell populations exist and are inherent to the individual and their disease.</p><p>Interestingly, we observe that a small number &#x02264;3% of normal subjects have 100% of the GBM, CAML genotypes. This may be due to sample population age biases such that some individuals are as yet undiagnosed, or that our measure over-predicts given that the rate of gliomas in the general population is less than 3%. Therefore risk screening may be valuable only in a subset of the population presenting with an abnormal MRI. Additionally, when we inspected samples with driver mutations, observed in gliomas, the relative percentage of CAMLs is similar in individuals with 1-4 mutations. However, for individuals with 5 mutations there appears to be an increase in identifiable CAMLs which may correspond to overall instability in the genome's of these individuals. The mix of glioma types in the LGG cohort may lend to smaller populations of LGG DNA sequences with identifiable CAMLs compared with GBM (as observed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">FigS3</xref>) which suggests that distinguishable and conserved MST loci may further differentiate glioma phenotypes and may be tumor specific markers. Circulating disease markers for tissue-specific cancers are progressively becoming more detectible; however diagnosing primary brain cancer markers outside of brain tissue remains poor[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, testing for these CAMLs from blood samples could provide a potential supplemental diagnostic resource to identify the most common and dangerous adult brain-specific cancers.</p><p>Since some microsatellites are associated with DNA &#x02018;fragile sites&#x02019;, locations within chromatin susceptible to constrictions or break-points that are linked to cancers and neuro-developmental disorders, we analyzed our MST loci to determine which are located in these regions, as a possible mechanism for tumor potentiation [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. <italic>BRWD2</italic>, found in our GBM signature, is located at a break-point on chromosome 10 and allelic deletions within 10p, 10q 25-26, and 19q 13.3-13.4 are the most common alterations in glial tumors[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Given the location of the breaks, <italic>BRWD2</italic> is considered a candidate tumor suppressor; through our analysis we identified 80% of GBM patients versus 50% of &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; individuals have a CAML genotype at <italic>BRWD2</italic>. Interestingly, <italic>FGFR2</italic> and <italic>BRWD2</italic>, both genes included in the GBM signature, are an oncogene and tumor suppressor pair located at a recombination locus in which deletion of exon 21 of <italic>FGFR2</italic> results in the exclusion of <italic>BRWD2</italic> (the tumor suppressor) and amplification of <italic>FGFR2</italic>; thus intronic CAMLs harbored by these genes could be biological indicators for tumorigenic activity. Additionally, loss of 10p is found in 47% of GBMs while 10q loss is found in 70% of primary and 63% of secondary GBMs[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In our GBM signature, we identified 4 loci in Ch10 at <italic>FGFR2, BRWD2</italic> (<italic>WDR11</italic>), <italic>GLUD1</italic>, and <italic>NRP1;</italic> none were identified in the LGG signature.</p><p>In the original account of &#x02018;the two-hit hypotheses&#x02019; for somatic retinoblastoma, the first hit was an inherited mutation in <italic>Rb</italic>, rendering individuals more susceptible to the disease later in life. Our data suggests the &#x02018;first hit&#x02019; may also be somatic microsatellite instability which then increases the sensitivity to, and probability of, greater genomic aberrance <italic>theoretically</italic> by stress factors such as environment, inflammation or age leading to the &#x02018;second hit&#x02019;[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These tentatively &#x02018;predisposed&#x02019; variants may highlight a connection between cancer-associated microsatellites and developmental and cell cycle genes notably mutated in cancer (such as those identified in our study: <italic>SRC, NPAT</italic> and <italic>CBL</italic>); thus, these MST variants may be additive to gene mutations (including, SNPs) that contribute to cancer.</p><p>More recently, mutable genes commonly identified in GBM patients post chemotherapy and radiation treatment were discovered, and included <italic>RYR1</italic> [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. <italic>RYR1</italic> expression is notably down-regulated in GBM; our GBM data demonstrates CAML genotypes unique to <italic>RYR1</italic> with transcripts and isoforms also unique to GBM. Thus, CAML loci at genes such as <italic>RYR1</italic> may render them to be more susceptible to mutation (for example from stresses associated with treatment) and may be valuable indicators for potential treatment outcomes. Additionally, this further supports the possibility of tumor initiating cells with irregular genetic variations that generate disease relative to an underlying combination and abundance of affected microsatellite loci.</p><p>The aberrant alteration of six helicase genes in GBM suggests that genes important to microsatellite identification and correction, along with transcription and RNA synthesis are themselves modified with MST variants. Previous studies have demonstrated that in addition to mis-match repair genes, helicases (notably RecQ family DNA helicases [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]) are important in DNA damage repair and DNA/RNA metabolism[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In our data we observed minimal MMR gene coding SNP mutations in both GBM and LGG tumors (see, Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) but found CAMLs significantly associated with helicases, suggesting modifications to these genes may also be important to genomic instability in glioma or that there may be more MMR genes that remain to be discovered. As such, one mechanism may be that GBM tumors produce atypical RNA. This idea is further supported by the enrichment of MST variant loci in helicase genes activated through interferon; interferon can initiate helicases and ubiquitin ligases to degrade viral RNAs and other dsRNAs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>), a process which could be interrupted if these helicases are affected by MST. As described in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, we identified multiple genes in which a novel RNA isoform was the abundant transcript for several GBM genes with CAMLs, including <italic>DICER1</italic> and <italic>POLQ</italic>, both genes associated with RNA and DNA modification and metabolism.</p><p>With the abundance of helicase and UPS associated genes in our glioma signatures, another cancer promoting scenario may be introduced through changes to gene-products that compose spliceosome complexes (snRNA, snRNP, or snoRNP); through these genetic modifications, alternatively spliced RNAs may support spliceosome-associated proteins differently, which may further modify mature RNAs. A third mechanism may be modifications to ubiquitin proteasome system proteins (ligases and ubiquitin complex proteins) which could alter protein degradation or signal transduction. Supporting these two hypotheses we identified functionally associated genes with CAMLS, including: <italic>DDX60</italic> and <italic>TRIM25</italic>; <italic>SPOPL</italic> and <italic>BRMS1L</italic>; <italic>FGFR2, BRWD2</italic> and <italic>CBL</italic>; <italic>SEMA3E</italic> and <italic>NRP1</italic>. Other functional associations important to changes in RNA transcription included, <italic>SLC44A4</italic> transcript isoforms uniquely identified in GBM (and with expression significantly greater than normal tissue). Similar results were observed for <italic>LNX2</italic> in LGG supporting our hypothesis that CAMLs may modify RNA transcription and expression.</p><p>Additional important biological changes observed and linked to CAMLs included significantly decreased expression of <italic>SEMA3E</italic> (a GBM signature locus) compared with normal samples; as previously noted <italic>SEMA3</italic> competes with <italic>VEGF</italic>-165 for <italic>NRP1</italic> (a GBM signature locus) and suppresses angiogenesis [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, decreased expression of SEMAs in GBM suggests that these microsatellite variants could contribute to glioma angiogenesis. Several genes, including the <italic>EVC</italic> transcript were identified in GBM and LGG but not in normal brain tissue, and in GBM the novel isoform was the common transcript; expression data suggests that <italic>EVC</italic> is expressed more in GBM and LGG tumors when compared with normal germline expression, although these data did not pass our stringent 2-fold difference in expression (GBM = 1.68; LGG = 1.97).</p><p>Since these loci can be identified from germline (non-tumor) DNA, it further suggests that there is a tumor initiating cell population in which developmental cell signaling and patterning pathways may result in aberrant differentiation and proliferation due to an underlying transcriptional landscape determined by cancer-associated MST variants. Therefore, we further hypothesize that DNA microsatellite variability underlies an adaptability that is conserved in all cancers and can be investigated by determining the frequency of microsatellite variability in those genes (1) that are <italic>essential</italic> for cancer cell survival (and conserved across a cancer type) (2) contribute <italic>intermittently</italic> &#x02013; to cancer cell phenotypes like metastasis, heterogeneity, or aggressiveness, and (3) are <italic>tissue-specific</italic>, associated with only one type of tumor or tissue origin. If so, we can predict that specific microsatellite instability contributes to cancer-specific genomics and may occur during embryogenesis, which has also been predicted in other MST associated diseases, including Huntington's disease and Fragile X syndrome[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, these markers may be valuable to screen risk of occurrence or for treatment decisions in newly diagnosed cancer patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS &#x00026; METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Microsatellite genotyping</title><p>Exome sequencing data, from Illumina HiSeq sequencing machines were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the 1000 Genomes Project (1kGP). These sequences were aligned to the human reference genome using BWA, by their respective projects, and re-alignment followed with microsatellite loci and variant identification by methods and software established in our laboratory [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Only loci with sequencing reads with 15x or greater depth of coverage were used to identify possible informative loci. A distribution of alleles for the affected (TCGA) and unaffected (1kGP) cohorts was then generated for each locus. An allele is defined by a genomic locus with a specific microsatellite repeat and nucleotide sequence length, in each sample a pair of alleles was identified and each allelic pair was then defined as a genotype. The genotype most prevalent from a distribution of genotypes was identified in 1kGP samples; this genotype was defined as the consensus sequence or predominant genotype (if more than a pair of alleles was identified for a locus that locus in the particular sample was not used). Similar to the 1kGP samples, LGG and GBM samples were analyzed for genotypes from the same genomic loci, loci significantly different from the consensus (predominant genotype) in one population compared with the second population were identified. The statistically significant genotypes were determined from data adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR), using a two-sided Fisher's p- test and Benjamini-Hochberg correction; relative risk (RR) was calculated for each locus and loci with a P&#x02264; 0.01 were considered significant. More specifically, an R script computed the p-value for each locus using the two sided fisher-test function. The Benjamini-Hochberg cut-off was selected as approximately 0.01% (computed as the FDR &#x0003c; 1/X (where x is the total number of loci with p-value &#x0003c; 1 for the signature)) to make it unlikely that any locus is a false positive from our data set. Those genotypes, although individually significant and informative, were also assembled into a &#x02018;signature&#x02019; or &#x02018;cancer-associated&#x02019; informative loci set which together increase the statistical significance across all samples. Sequences included 390 (n=249 female; n=141 male) normal/healthy samples from the 1kGP, GBM germline (n=252), GBM tumor (n=139), LGG germline (n=136), and LGG tumor (n=158) sequencing samples (dbGAP Study Accession: phs000178.v8.p7) [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] through the Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub). Microsatellite genotypes were identified through a software system developed in our laboratory [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These samples, like all others, were processed to remove any reads that did not meet the QC thresholds required in the 1kGP [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="s4_2"><title>Creation of microsatellite target set</title><p>We produced a set of over 850,000 microsatellite loci which have flanking sequences unique in the human genome. Initially a set of over a million microsatellites was found in the human genome (NCBI36/hg18) using Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF) [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], with previously established parameters. A series of filters are in place to remove tandem repeat sequences previously identified through RepeatMasker in the flanking sequences of our loci, microsatellites shorter than 12 nucleotides in regions other than exons for which we allowed a minimum length of 10 nucleotides, those containing SNPs, indels, or SNP variations that account for variability greater than 10% of the locus lengths (Repeat Masker Ref. Smit AFA; HR Green). A custom Perl script was written to filter repeat sequences lacking unique flanking regions (10 base flanking sequences were chosen because Illumina reads are 100 bases in length, respectively); filtered sequences were screened based on corresponding flanking sequences to the reference genome (microsatellites with flanking sequences within 200 bases of each other and 5 bases of the repeat in between were also excluded). Vetted microsatellite loci are described with genomic location and gene associations using RefSeq data obtained through the UCSC Genome Table Browser [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4_3"><title>Identifying repeat lengths using microsatellite-based genotyping</title><p>Reads are mapped to the reference genome using BWA or BWA-sw (for long reads; LS454) [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A custom Perl script with SAMTOOLS [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] filters for reads with MST loci, to assure the span of the MST sequence is captured, a 5 base flanking sequence on either side of the read are tested, this process is to validate BWA aligned sequences. Reads with identical repeat sequences are binned; separating reads with different SNPs. SNPs contained in microsatellites were ignored for this study.</p><p>Accuracy estimations of our microsatellite-based genotyping method: Using Sanger sequencing and data from HapMap, we were able to validate 96.5% of a subset of 85 non-synonymous variations composed of repeat length variations and SNPs contained in microsatellites. The novel variants we validated using Sanger sequencing were submitted under the lab handle SGARNER and are available on-line in the latest release of dbSNP. All microsatellite-based genotyping calls from these studies were made publically available at MicrosatDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://discovery.vbi.vt.edu/MicrosatDB/">http://discovery.vbi.vt.edu/MicrosatDB/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4_4"><title>Microsatellite identification restrictions for population-based statistics</title><p>To increase uniformity of coverage and genotyping rates across samples sequenced at different times with different methods by different studies, we required at least 15,000 microsatellite loci to be called per sample for inclusion in this study. This filtered out one 1kGP-F sample and 235 1kGP-M samples. From the TCGA samples, this filtered out 23 LGG germline samples, 57 LGG tumor samples, 238 GBM germline samples, and 254 GBM tumor samples. The large number of GBM samples filtered is expected as these samples were sequenced much earlier by TCGA than the LGG samples. So we would expect lower coverage and shorter reads. Only those loci with at least 15x coverage are considered &#x0201c;callable&#x0201d; in a given sample (healthy or cancer genomes). A locus had to be called in a minimum of 10 exomes to be included in the genotype distribution comparison analysis and to remove loci which may be called at insufficient frequency in one of the two data sets.</p></sec><sec id="s4_5"><title>Alternative splicing</title><p>We processed 339 GBM tumors, 268 LGG tumors, and 57 LGG germline RNAseq Illumina data sets with Cufflinks [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] by using the CuffCompare function to identify possibly alternatively spliced transcripts. These samples had been aligned by TCGA to the reference using TopHat[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

These RNAseq SOLiD fastq read files where reformatted into standard color-space paired files and then run through TopHat using the default parameters, except for indicating the color-space type, as was done by the TCGA to align the GBM/LGG samples.
