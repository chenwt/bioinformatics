Recently, an adherent cell line (BCIRL-TcA-CLG1 or TcA) was developed from late pupae of the red flour beetle. Next generation transcriptome sequencing of TcA cells demonstrated expression of a wide variety of genes associated with specialized functions in chitin metabolism, immune responses and cellular and systemic RNAi pathways. Accordingly, we evaluated the sensitivity of TcA cells to dsRNA to initiate an RNAi response. TcA cells were highly sensitive to minute amounts of dsRNA, with a minimum effective dose of 100&#x02005;pg/mL resulting in significant suppression of gene expression. We have also developed a plasmid containing two TcA-specific promoters, the promoter from the 40S ribosomal protein subunit (TC006550) and a bi-directional heat shock promoter (TcHS70) from the intergenic space between heat shock proteins 68a and b. These promoters have been employed to provide high levels of either constitutive (TC006550) or inducible (TcHS70) gene expression of the reporter proteins. Our results show that the TcA cell line, with its sensitivity to RNAi and functional TcA-specific promoters, is an invaluable resource for studying basic molecular and physiological questions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The red flour beetle, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, is an economically important insect pest that has been widely used as a model organism in laboratory settings. The sequence of the entire genome of <italic>T. castaneum</italic> has been publicly available since 2008<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, and transposable element-mediated transgenesis of this insect has been successful<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Most importantly, this beetle is highly susceptible to systemic RNA interference (RNAi). Injection of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) into the body cavity at any intended stage successfully suppresses the expression of the target gene in the entire body<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In addition, parental RNAi, which can silence gene expression in developing embryos, has also been a useful tool for studying embryonic development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>Two cell lines for <italic>T. castaneum</italic> have recently been independently developed. One is an adherent cell line that was derived from the late pupal stage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and named BCIRL-TcA-CLG1 (TcA). Another embryonic cell line that forms vesicles in suspended culture, named Tc81, was subsequently developed specifically to study juvenile hormone responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. These are the first immortalized cell lines derived from <italic>T. castaneum</italic> and represent major additions to the <italic>Tribolium</italic> tool kit.</p><p>Here, we have enhanced the utility of the TcA cell line by characterizing its patterns of gene expression using next-generation sequencing techniques. Further, we have also demonstrated the extreme sensitivity of TcA gene expression to dsRNA silencing and identified and validated two TcA-specific promoters, one constitutive and one inducible, that produce significant levels of transgene expression. In combination with the genomic tools available for <italic>Tribolium</italic>, these enhancements make the TcA cell line an invaluable tool for exploring basic molecular and cellular physiology of the red flour beetle.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Transcriptome</title><p>Illumina sequencing generated 144 million raw single reads (50&#x02005;bp each). About 105 million reads were mapped to the Tcas 3.0 genome sequence covering 12,265 genes (74%) of the 16,550 in the <italic>T. castaneum</italic> official gene set. We performed gene ontology-term (GO-term) enrichment analysis for the 5,000 most highly expressed genes (Up5k) and the 4,285 undetected genes (Down0), as ranked by RPKM &#x02013; reads per kilobase in a million reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>Enriched GO-terms from the TcA Up5K and Down0 groups were compared with those from abdominal carcass, elytra, and whole pupae transcriptome sequencing projects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). A total of 591 GO-terms were found to be significantly enriched in the TcA Up5k (RPKM&#x0003e;0.4686) group; 124 of which were found in the Up5k group of all four RNAseq databases (O in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The enriched GO-terms for both the Up5k and Down0 had the highest similarity to that of the elytra RNAseq data, with the abdominal carcass and whole pupae comprising the second and third similar collection of enriched GO-terms. The similarity of the TcA enriched GO-terms with those of the elytra suggest that the TcA cell line may be of an epidermal origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a, b, c</xref>).</p><p>The enriched GO-terms commonly found in all four RNAseq for the Up5k (O in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) generally included housekeeping genes, including those for ribosomal proteins (GO:0005840) and subunits (GO:0015934 and 0015935), as well as mitochondrial respiratory components (GO:0005739, 0005740, 0005743, 0005746, 0005747, 0005753, and 0005759). The commonly enriched GO-terms in Down0 groups of all four RNAseq datasets included genes involved in sensory neural function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, GO:0007600, 000718, 0007606, 0038023, 0004930, 0004888). Large numbers of enriched GO-terms for Up5k were shared between TcA, abdominal carcass, and elytra (N in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) or between TcA and elytra (G), while the similarity was relatively low between TcA and whole pupae (F). Among the GO-terms in the category N (common to TcA, abdominal carcass, and elytra in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), it is noteworthy to mention that many of the GO-terms are related to intracellular vesicle formation and activity (GO:0006897, 0006909, 0006911, and 0016192), as it was also the case with category G (common in TcA and elytra; GO:0030133, 0006888, and 0048193). In category A (uniquely enriched only in TcA), it is interesting to note that GO-terms related to negative regulators of cell death (GO:0043066 and 0043069) are among those in the Up5K group and may be partly responsible for the establishment of the immortalized, stable cell line.</p><p>We used immunohistochemistry to confirm the presence of proteins from genes that were highly expressed in the tanscriptome. An antibody specific for a signaling peptide, calcitonin-like diuretic hormone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, showed small cytoplasmic vesicles in every cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig 3a</xref>), indicating a uniformity of expression among the TcA cells. However, an antibody specific for chitin deacetylase stained vesicles in only a subpopulation of TcA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), suggesting some variability in gene expression between cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Expression of the genes involved in cuticle and chitin metabolism</title><p>Our transcriptome data showed that the TcA cell line highly expresses a set of genes associated with chitin metabolism and or cuticle structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S2</xref>). We also found a subset of cuticle proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S1</xref>), including CP6 (TC013135, RPKM 41.58) and ld-cp1v1 (TC000442, 7.537), that are highly expressed. In addition, chitinase 20, 21, and 11N were expressed at moderate levels. Other genes that are known to have critical functions in proper cuticle formation that were included in the Up5k group of TcA were Rtv (TC007364, RPKM 38.16), Obstructor A1 (TC011140, 10.91), tyrosine hydroxylase (TC002496, 6.665), laccase 1 (TC000821, 6.103), chitin deacetylase 1 (TC14100, 2.589), and KNK1 (TC010653, 2.219). Most notable is low, but significant levels of expressions of both chitin synthase 1 (42 reads, RPKM 0.06) and 2 (67 reads, 0.11) genes.</p><p>Although a number of genes involved in cuticle metabolism were found to be highly expressed, supporting the idea of TcA as an epidermal cell type, there were a large number of chitin metabolic genes that were captured in Down0. Indeed, category A, enriched only in TcA with no detectable expression (Down0. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), included many GO-terms for chitin catabolism and chitinase activities. Therefore, it seems TcA expresses a specific subset of cuticle proteins and chitinases at significant levels while it lacks expression of many other genes involved in cuticle metabolism, perhaps because the TcA cell line is a clonal descendent from a specific subtype of epidermal cells. It would be of interest in the future to determine if the TcA line can be used as a model as an insect epidermal cell type with the activity for chitin synthesis.</p><p>In addition to the genes involved in chitin metabolism discussed above, we also found that numerous genes putatively involved in insect immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> are expressed in the TcA cell line. These are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S3</xref> and entire expression data is in data set 1.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Expression of genes encoding candidate RNAi machinery</title><p>RNAi is very effective in <italic>T. castaneum</italic> during all life stages, and has been widely used to study candidate gene function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Previous studies have established the basic components of the RNAi pathway that are found in the <italic>T. castaneum</italic> genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Based on the information from these studies, we examined the expression of genes encoding core RNAi machinery (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) and genes implicated in systemic RNAi (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>) in the TcA cell line. All genes encoding components of the cellular RNAi machinery were expressed in the TcA cell line (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) including the three dicer family genes (dicer 1, dicer 2, and drosha), the genes for their associated dsRNA binding proteins (loquacious, R2D2 and C3PO, and pasha), all 5 argonaute genes (Ago 1, 2A, 2B, 3, and piwi), and the exonuclease, snipper. In addition, many of the candidate genes thought to be associated with the systemic RNAi response are expressed in the TcA cell line (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). The apparent intact nature of the RNAi response system in the TcA cell line vastly increases the potential for this cell line to be used in highly informative investigations of cellular and molecular physiology.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>TcA-specific promoters for reporter gene expressions</title><p>Heterologous expression of a native, chimeric, or fluorescently-tagged protein in a cell line is a commonly used and extraordinarily useful tool. Use of the TcA for expression of target proteins depends on efficient promoters that constitutively or conditionally promote the expression of the exogenous gene. Our initial trials with promoters that are commonly used in insect cell lines were not successful at expressing either the fluorescent reporter protein, Tomato, or enhanced green fluorescent protein, EGFP. In a test of the common promoters frequently used in insect cell systems, the Actin 5 promoter of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, the CMV promoter in the pcDNA3.1+ plasmid, the OpIE1 and OpIE2 promoters in the pIZT vector (Invitrogen), and the alpha tubulin promoter of <italic>T. castaneum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> were all ineffective at producing detectable levels of Tomato up to 3 days after transfection of the plasmid into TcA cells.</p><p>Therefore, we expanded our efforts to test endogenous <italic>Tribolium</italic> promoters. We chose candidate promoters based on the expression levels of genes in the TcA (~&#x0003e;5 in the RPKM), defined small sizes of intergenic regions at the 5&#x02032; end of the genes, and a lack of large introns. The putative promoters for three genes encoding ribosomal protein subunits, TC014362, TC000476, and TC006550, and one heat shock protein 68 (hereafter named as TcHS70 by <italic>Drosophila</italic> homology) were identified and selected for testing. Two promoters, TC006550 encoding a 40S ribosomal protein subunit and TcHS70, were found to be active for production of the reporter protein.</p><p>The TcHS70 contained multiple putative heat shock sequence elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a and b</xref>). Initially, we tested the TcHS70 activity after a heat shock in the endogenous cell. Immediately after a heat shock of TcA cells at 40&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02005;min, total RNA was extracted to investigate the transcriptional responses of the hsp genes. We found ~300 to 500-fold increases in mRNA levels for each hsp68a, hsp68b, and another highly similar hsp TC010172 after normalization to rps3 transcript levels and comparison to the no heat shock control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). We subsequently used the 1910bp intergenic region between the coding genes for hsp68a and hsp68b as the TcHS70 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5a</xref>). This sequence included the putative TATA boxes, transcription start sites located in each end, and numerous heat shock sequence elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p>We constructed a plasmid using the pUC18 vector as a backbone, containing reporter and antibiotic proteins: the TC006550 promoter driving expression of an EGFP-Zeocin resistance fusion protein and the bidirectional TcHS70 promoter driving expression of secretory nanoluciferase (Promega) and photo switchable Orange<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Transient transfection of this construct was followed by heat shocks at 38&#x000b0;C for 10, 20, and 40&#x02005;min. and at 40&#x000b0;C for 10 or 20&#x02005;min. The naouluciferase activity in the cell culture media was significantly increased 5&#x02005;hr after heat shock except in the case of 38&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02005;min. Application of a second heat shock further increased naoluciferase activity compared to the first heatshock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The changes in nanoluciferase activity over time indicated that the minimum expression and maturation time for nanoluciferase activity is ~3&#x02005;hr after heatshock, and it reaches a plateau at ~8&#x02005;hr following heat shock at 38&#x000b0;C for 40&#x02005;min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b and c</xref>). The cells with constitutive expression of EGFP were also found to have inducible expression of psOrange following heat shock, although induction of visible levels of psOrange appears to require a longer time for maturation than that of nanoluciferase. Occasionally, we found autofluorescence in the TcA that is similar to the EGFP wavelength. This autofluorescence was limited to large vacuolar structures appearing only in a small subpopulation of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, based on expression of the reporter proteins, the TcHS70 is a highly inducible bidirectional promoter. Further, the TC006550 promoter also provides a moderate level of constitutive reporter expression. The plasmid containing those promoters will be a valuable tool for expression of heterologous genes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>RNAi in the TcA cell line</title><p>Expression of many of the components of the RNAi machinery led us to investigate the sensitivity of this cell line to RNAi. Accordingly, we selected a relatively highly expressed chitin protein, CP6, as our target for silencing, and used the common control target, vermilion, as a negative control. dsRNA was synthesized (231&#x02005;bp for CP6, 400&#x02005;bp for vermilion) and mixed directly with culture media at various concentrations (1&#x02005;fg/mL to 1&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/mL, vermilion was mixed at 100&#x02005;ng/mL) prior to applying to the TcA cells. qPCR quantification showed that the TcA cell line is highly sensitive to RNAi of CP6. Treatment with as little as 1&#x02005;ng/mL resulted in &#x0003e;99% suppression of CP6 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Suppression of CP6 mRNA decreased in a dose-dependent manner as dsRNA concentration decreased below 1&#x02005;ng/mL, with no significant reduction in CP6 expression occurring with 1&#x02005;pg/mL dsRNA. The sensitivity to dsRNA of TcA cells is similar to that of the Tc81 cell line as measured with dsRNA targeting the <italic>met</italic> gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, and more than 10,000 times greater than that for the S2 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell line<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>We also tested our CP6 dsRNA <italic>in vivo</italic> by injecting dsRNA (2 or 200 ng/beetle) into <italic>T. castaneum</italic> early instar larvae to ascertain the effects of CP6 RNAi <italic>in vivo</italic>. No obvious phenotype was associated with silencing of CP6 in any developmental stage (late instar larvae, pupae, or adult), although the beetles injected with vermilion dsRNA showed the characteristic white eyes associated with this treatment. Analysis of CP6 mRNA showed that both 2 and 200&#x02005;ng treatments per individual resulted in &#x0003e;99% suppression of expression at the organismal levels without noticeable phenotype in the observation until the early adult stage.</p><p>We also subsequently tested the efficiency of RNAi to silence the expression of heterologously expressed proteins, transiently transfected for heat shock inducible nanoluciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Silencing of nanoluciferase activity induced by heat shock was measured following treatment with dsNluc. Interestingly, significant suppression of nanoluciferase activity required a minimum of 1&#x02005;ng/mL (~50% suppression, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>), which is more than 10-fold greater than that required for suppression of CP6 expression. We suspect that this difference is likely caused by the rapid induction of extremely high levels of expression of the nanoluciferae following heat shock treatment.</p><p>High sensitivity of the TcA cells to dsRNA in the media requires efficient mechanisms for cellular uptake of primary dsRNA followed by dsRNA processing into small interference RNA (siRNA) which forms complexes with the target messenger RNA. Our results show that TcA expresses a large number of candidate molecular components of the RNAi pathway (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) and shows high sensitivity to dsRNA, provideing an excellent opportunity to explore novel, highly efficient RNAi mechanisms in the TcA cell.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>TcA, an adherent cell line, was derived from BCIRL-TcA-CLG1 that was originally established from the late pupal <italic>T. castaneum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.

Direct comparisons of RNAseq data for expression levels of each gene by RPKM in different sets of data were not possible because of varying sample preparation procedures and sequencing approaches in each RNA library. For example, normalization of our sequence data to another library introduced largely skewed raw RPKM values, and was thus not appropriate to use in conventional methods for comparing expression levels. As an alternative approach, the lists of genes for the Up5k and Down0 were used for a GO-term enrichment test against the official gene set (Tcas 3.0 OGS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,) in Blast2GO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> at the False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).

The promoters tested were: the CMV promoter from the pcDNA3.1+ plasmid (Invitrogen), the OpIE1 and OpIE2 promoters from the pIZT vector, the <italic>Tribolium</italic> alpha tubulin promoter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, and the <italic>Tribolium</italic> heat shock promoter (TcHS70, in this study). The dTomato was amplified using the primers dTomatoF and dTomatoR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S1</xref>) and cloned into a pGEMT easy vector. Then, dTomato was introduced into the pIZTV5-His vector by using a NotI restriction site (pIZT-dTomato). Subsequently, the promoters were cloned into the pGEMT easy vector and then inserted into pIZT-dTomato replacing the OpIE2 promoter by digestion with the corresponding restriction enzymes and ligation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure S1</xref>). Among these constructs, the plasmid containing the <italic>Tribolium</italic> heat shock promoter was further modified to add an ampicillin selection marker driven by a <italic>bla</italic> promoter. The OpIE1 promoter upstream of the GFP-Zeocin chimeric gene in pIZTV5-His was replaced by the putative promoters for three genes encoding ribosomal protein subunits, TC014362, TC000476, or TC006550. Subsequently, the constitutively active promoter TC006550 (upstream ~1.2&#x02005;kb) was used for the expression of GFP-Zeocin.</p><p>After we tested promoter efficiencies by using the plasmids described above, we constructed the plasmid that contains several reporter genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref>, and S1.

The dsRNA was purified using a commercial kit (MEGAClear, Life Technologies) and run on a 2% agarose gel to confirm the band size. dsRNA was quantified using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE) and diluted to the desired concentration with nuclease-free water.</p><p>For <italic>CP6</italic> RNAi experiments in cell culture, TcA cells were seeded onto 24-well plates (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL) and left to grow for at least 24&#x02005;h.

Two weeks post-injection, adults were visually examined for any defects in development. Four individuals from each treatment group were pooled for total RNA isolation. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (1&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/rxn) using the ImProm-II&#x02122; Reverse Transcription System (Promega).

The TcA cells were transfected with the expression plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), using FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega). Subsequently, various concentrations of dsRNA for nanoluciferase were directly added to the culture media for final dsRNA concentrations ranging from 100&#x02005;fg/mL to 100&#x02005;ng/mL. About 48&#x02005;h after the transfection, the cells were subject to heat shock (HS) at 38&#x000b0;C for 40&#x02005;min. Approximately 18&#x02005;h after the initial HS, the media was changed to new media and one more HS was made at 38&#x000b0;C for 40&#x02005;min. Six hours after the HS, secretory nanoluciferase activity in the cell culture media was measured using the Nano-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega). dsVermilion (100&#x02005;ng/mL) was used as a negative control.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>K.S., H.J., J.F., Y.P. performed the experiments.
