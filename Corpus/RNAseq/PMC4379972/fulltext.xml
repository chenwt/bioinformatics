To overcome this constraint, several plant species from regions having a cool season have evolved an adaptive response, called cold acclimation. We have studied this response in olive tree (<italic>Olea europaea</italic> L.) cv. Picual. Biochemical stress markers and cold-stress symptoms were detected after the first 24 h as sagging leaves. After 5 days, the plants were found to have completely recovered. Control and cold-stressed plants were sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 1000 paired-end technique. We also assembled a new olive transcriptome comprising 157,799 unigenes and found 6,309 unigenes differentially expressed in response to cold. Three types of response that led to cold acclimation were found: short-term transient response, early long-term response, and late long-term response. These subsets of unigenes were related to different biological processes. Early responses involved many cold-stress-responsive genes coding for, among many other things, C-repeat binding factor transcription factors, fatty acid desaturases, wax synthesis, and oligosaccharide metabolism. After long-term exposure to cold, a large proportion of gene down-regulation was found, including photosynthesis and plant growth genes. Up-regulated genes after long-term cold exposure were related to organelle fusion, nucleus organization, and DNA integration, including retrotransposons.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Olea europaea</italic></kwd><kwd>olive</kwd><kwd>cold-stress</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Olive (<italic>Olea europaea</italic> L.) is an evergreen species that is sensitive to winter chilling temperatures with severe leaf damage at &#x02212;7&#x000b0;C.<sup><xref rid="DSU033C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Olive oil is the major product extracted from olive fruit, and its consumption is steadily growing worldwide. The process of cold acclimation is very complex and involves diverse physiological, metabolic, and developmental changes that are under strict genetic control.<sup><xref rid="DSU033C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The identity of the cold-stress sensor in plants is yet unknown.<sup><xref rid="DSU033C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Nevertheless, early changes in membrane rigidification leading to certain cytoskeletal rearrangement has been proposed to be a cellular sensor for cold stress,<sup><xref rid="DSU033C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="DSU033C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> in addition to metabolic or redox status alterations. Changes in membrane fluidity lead to a transient induction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and a raised cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, which acts as a second messenger in the early sensing of low temperatures.<sup><xref rid="DSU033C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Cold acclimation is the result of several processes, such as the synthesis of cryoprotectant molecules and membrane phospholipids, protein stabilization, maintenance of ion homeostasis, and a stress response mainly mediated by the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS).<sup><xref rid="DSU033C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="DSU033C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Cold response involves around 1,000 genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, as previously shown by whole transcriptome analyses.<sup><xref rid="DSU033C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="DSU033C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> A relevant number of cold-regulated genes encode transcription factors or proteins involved in transcription.<sup><xref rid="DSU033C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Among these, C-repeat binding factor (CBF)/dehydration responsive element binding consists of transcriptional activators that provide one of the most important pathways for cold response.<sup><xref rid="DSU033C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="DSU033C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The expression of the <italic>CBF</italic> genes is induced after an increase of the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level and is responsible for controlling the expression of a large number of cold-response (COR) proteins.<sup><xref rid="DSU033C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The CBFs bind to the low-temperature-responsive DNA-regulatory element termed C-repeat/dehydration-response element<sup><xref rid="DSU033C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="DSU033C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> present in the promoters of many COR genes. Nevertheless, the analysis of cold acclimation in the olive drupe and seed has shown an important role of &#x02018;fatty-acid desaturase (FAD)&#x02019; genes in cold tolerance and oil quality.<sup><xref rid="DSU033C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="DSU033C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> These <italic>FAD</italic> genes contribute to cold acclimation by increasing the presence of unsaturated fatty acids which produce cell-membrane fluidification and F-actin stabilization.<sup><xref rid="DSU033C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="DSU033C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> However, little is known about the gene-expression changes occurring during cold acclimation in this important crop, and no transcriptomic analysis has been conducted to determine the genetic changes induced by cold stress.

Picual. These plants were obtained from a commercial nursery located in C&#x000f3;rdoba province, southern Spain. Before being subjected to the low-temperature treatment, they were acclimated at 24&#x000b0;C day light for 3 weeks within the same controlled growth chamber where the cold-stress assay was conducted. Afterwards, we incubated a group of 35 plants under the following environmental conditions: 14-h photoperiod of fluorescent light at 65 &#x000b5;mol m<sup>2</sup> s (10&#x000b0;C day/4&#x000b0;C night) for 10 days and constant 76&#x02013;78% relative humidity. An additional group of 15 plants remained as a control treatment. Time of cold exposure was considered from the moment at which the growth chamber reached the working temperature for the first time in daylight (i.e. 10&#x000b0;C). Aerial tissues were then harvested at 0 h, 24 h, and 10 days (three plants/time point) after the start of the experiment. Tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until the extraction of total RNA. In order to build an olive transcriptome of diverse biotic and abiotic stresses, mechanical wounding and infection with the soil-borne fungus <italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic> were also considered. This pathogen is the causal agent of Verticillium wilt of olive, one of the most serious diseases affecting olive cultivation in many areas.<sup><xref rid="DSU033C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Therefore, an additional set of nursery-produced &#x02018;Picual&#x02019; plants (40) were submitted to root-dip inoculation in a conidia suspension of a <italic>V. dahliae</italic> isolate representative of the so-called defoliating pathotype, following the procedure detailed in Mercado-Blanco <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="DSU033C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> with the modification that inoculation time was only 30 min. Non-inoculated plants (40), but manipulated in the same way (control treatment), were used to obtain tissue samples of wounded plants in the absence of the pathogen.

On average, the N50 length, average length, and maximal length for the 8,090,448 scaffolds obtained were 661, 312, and 8,791 bases, respectively. The mapping analysis with bowtie2<sup><xref rid="DSU033C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> showed that 87.4% of reads on average aligned end to end on those scaffolds (bowtie2 parameters: -D 15 -R 2 -N 0 -L 22 -i S,1,1.15) and 93.2% aligned locally (-D 15 -R 2 -N 0 -L 20 -i S,1,0.75). Secondly, to collapse all related sequences that could not have done so during the first assembly step, the scaffolds of all libraries were assembled using ABySS single-end (<italic>k</italic>-mer = 63).

Mapping analysis with bowtie2 in the same way as above showed that 65% of reads on average aligned end to end on the final unigenes while 83.5% aligned locally.

The vast majority of plants had flaccid leaves, resembling wilting symptoms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSU033F1">1</xref>C and D). However, 4&#x02013;5 days after the start of the experiment, plants progressively recovered from these symptoms, and nearly no trace of flaccid or wilted leaves remained at the end of the experiment (10 days of exposure to low temperature) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSU033F1">1</xref>E and F). This result shows that a sudden fall in temperature, even if this is above 0&#x000b0;C, can trigger clear morphological changes and stress symptoms in olive plants. However, in just a few days most plants were fully recovered and were not distinguishable from the unstressed ones. Low-temperature treatment caused an overproduction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accompanied by a down-regulation of SOD isoenzymes, a key enzyme of the ascorbate&#x02013;glutathione cycle (APX) and an antioxidant NADP-dehydrogenase (NADP-ICDH). During long-term cold acclimation at 10 days, a slight recovery of Mn-SOD and NADP-ICDH was detected, indicating that a mechanism of cold acclimation takes place (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/dnares/dsu033/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>).

We found 6,309 unigenes differentially expressed in response to cold, which were included in three types of responses leading to cold acclimation: a short-term transient response including 890 over-expressed and only 6 repressed unigenes, an early long-term response that consisted in 204 over-expressed and 594 repressed unigenes, and a late long-term response with 4,551 unigenes down-regulated between days 1 and 10 of low temperature exposure, and just 64 unigenes were over-expressed.</p><p>The results presented here suggest a complex acclimation response to cold in olive leaves with early transient or long-term and late transcriptional responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/dnares/dsu033/-/DC1">Supplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by grant <award-id id="cn1" rid="cs1">AGR-5948</award-id> from <funding-source id="cs1" rid="cn1">Junta de Andaluc&#x000ed;a (Consejer&#x000ed;a de Econom&#x000ed;a, Innovaci&#x000f3;n y Ciencia) and Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci&#x000f3;n</funding-source>.
