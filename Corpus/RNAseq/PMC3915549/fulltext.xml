Affected embryos may fail to implant although many first breach the endometrial epithelium and embed in the decidualizing stroma before being rejected via mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here we show that developmentally impaired human embryos elicit an endoplasmic stress response in human decidual cells. A stress response was also evident upon <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure of mouse uteri to culture medium conditioned by low-quality human embryos. By contrast, signals emanating from developmentally competent embryos activated a focused gene network enriched in metabolic enzymes and implantation factors. We further show that trypsin, a serine protease released by pre-implantation embryos, elicits Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in endometrial epithelial cells. Competent human embryos triggered short-lived oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes whereas low-quality embryos caused a heightened and prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. Thus, distinct positive and negative mechanisms contribute to active selection of human embryos at implantation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Reproduction in humans is marred by early pregnancy failure. Approximately 15% of clinically recognized pregnancies miscarry. When combined with pre-clinical losses, the true incidence is closer to 50%, rendering miscarriage by far the most common complication of pregnancy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. This exceptional attrition rate is attributed to the intrinsic invasiveness of human embryos and the high prevalence of chromosomal errors. Based on genome-wide screening of individual blastomeres, in excess of 70% of high-quality cleavage-stage IVF embryos reportedly harbor cells with complex large-scale structural chromosomal imbalances, some caused by meiotic aneuploidies but most by mitotic non-disjunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The incidence of aneuploidy in human embryos is estimated to be an order of magnitude higher than in other mammalian species. Further, a vast array of chromosomal errors has been detected in human embryos throughout all stages of pre-implantation development. Many of the chromosomal abnormalities observed in blastocysts have never been recorded in clinical miscarriage samples<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, suggesting that these embryos either fail to implant or are rejected soon after breaching the endometrial luminal epithelium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>Evidence from several mammalian species indicates that the endometrium is intrinsically capable of mounting an implantation response that is tailored to individual embryos. For example, microarray analysis of bovine endometrium has identified gene signatures that are dependent on the origins (e.g. somatic cell nuclear transfer, IVF, or artificial insemination) and developmental potential of the attaching embryo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Using a co-culture system, we reported previously that human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) become sensitive to embryonic signals upon differentiation into decidual cells and respond selectively to low-quality human embryos by inhibiting the secretion of key implantation factors, including interleukin-1 beta, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, and leukemia inhibitory factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Furthermore, aberrant decidualization of HESCs and lack of embryo sensoring are strongly associated with recurrent pregnancy loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. These observations led to the hypothesis that active embryo selection at implantation is essential for reproductive success<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, although the underlying mechanisms remain as yet poorly characterized.</p><p>A major obstacle is that human implantation events cannot be studied directly. In culture, the developmental potential of human embryos can only be assessed indirectly, foremost on morphological criteria, and over a legally restricted period. To overcome these hurdles, we prospectively collected conditioned medium of individually cultured human pre-implantation embryos and then characterized the maternal response, <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as in a heterologous <italic>in vivo</italic> model, to soluble factors produced by low-quality human embryos and embryos of proven developmental competence. We report that human embryos presage their developmental competence even prior to implantation. The spectrum of endometrial responses to cues from different embryos ranges widely, from enhanced expression of key implantation factors to overt endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We also provide evidence that embryo-derived serine proteases are involved in eliciting a maternal response tailored to the developmental potential of the conceptus.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Developmentally impaired human embryos induce ER stress response in decidualizing HESCs</title><p>We systematically collected the conditioned medium of day 4 human IVF embryos, which had been cultured individually for 72&#x02005;h in microdroplets overlaid with mineral oil. Next, we incubated primary decidualizing HESCs with pooled culture supernatants from developmentally impaired embryos (DIEs), which were deemed unsuitable for transfer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, and from embryos that resulted in ongoing pregnancies after single embryo transfer (developmentally competent embryos, DCEs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S1</xref>). Control cultures consisted of decidualizing HESCs incubated with unconditioned embryo culture medium (ECM). Incubation of primary cultures was repeated three times with separate pools of conditioned media from DCEs and DIEs. RNA was isolated from decidualizing HESCs after 12&#x02005;h of incubation and analyzed by genome-wide expression profiling using DNA microarrays. Surprisingly, only 15 decidual genes were found to respond significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) to signals emanating from DCEs. In contrast, 449 maternal genes were perturbed in response to medium conditioned by DIEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S1</xref>). Gene ontology annotation categorized half of these maternal genes into three broad biological processes: transport (20%), translation (17%), and cell cycle (13%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p>To investigate further the response of decidual cells to compromised embryos, we focused on <italic>HSPA8</italic>, the most downregulated gene in the array analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S2</xref>). This gene encodes HSC70, a ubiquitously and constitutively expressed member of the heat shock protein 70 family of molecular chaperones involved in the assembly of multiprotein complexes, transport of nascent polypeptides and regulation of protein folding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. HSC70 levels increased in primary HESCs decidualized for 4 or more days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Small interfering (si)RNA-mediated knockdown of this molecular chaperone reduced the secretion of prolactin (PRL) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D and E</xref>), two highly sensitive differentiation markers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Cell viability was not affected significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p><p>Because of its role in protein homeostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, we postulated that loss of HSC70 causes ER stress in decidual cells. In fact, decidualizing HESCs mount a physiological unfolded protein response (UPR) associated with ER expansion and acquisition of a secretory phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. This UPR was characterized by synchronous induction of various chaperones, including protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), BIP (GRP78), endoplasmic oxidoreductin-1&#x003b1; (ERO1&#x003b1;), and calnexin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In addition, differentiating HESCs upregulate the expression of the three key ER signaling proteins, the serine/threonine kinase inositol-requiring enzyme 1&#x003b1; (IRE1&#x003b1;), PKR-like ER-localized eIF2&#x003b1; kinase (PERK), and the protease-activated transcription factor ATF6, which collectively determine the cellular response to ER stress signals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Interestingly, HSC70 knockdown had little or no effect on the expression of other ER chaperones or ATF6 but further enhanced the induction of IRE1&#x003b1; and PERK. In addition, silencing of this molecular chaperone protein in decidualizing cells markedly upregulated the levels of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), downstream transcription factors that couple ER stress to translational inhibition, induction of ER chaperones, cell cycle arrest and death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. We speculated that lack of overt cell death upon HSC70 knockdown could be accounted for by augmented autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In keeping with this notion, the abundance of the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B (LC3B), a marker of autophagic activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, increased markedly upon HSC70 knockdown in decidualizing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Confocal microscopy showed that the pattern of LC3B staining changed from being punctate and finely granular in undifferentiated and decidualizing cells to immunoreactive aggregates upon HSC70 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p>To test further the assertion that decidualizing HESCs mount an ER stress response upon HSC70 knockdown, we transfected primary cultures with pcDNA3/XBP1-luc, a plasmid in which human XBP1 cDNA is fused upstream of luciferase cDNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Under non-ER stress conditions, the presence of an in-frame stop codon prevents the expression of the downstream luciferase gene. Under ER stress conditions, however, activated IRE1&#x003b1; splices the XBP1-luc transcript, allowing translation of the luciferase cDNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>, decidualization of HESCs transfected with pcDNA3/XBP1-luc only marginally enhanced luciferase levels whereas simultaneous HSC70 knockdown elicited a 5-fold induction. We then reasoned that decidualizing HESCs transfected with pcDNA3/XBP1-luc could serve as a bioassay to monitor ER stress responses induced by limited amounts of ECM. Primary cells seeded in 96-well plates were first transfected with the reporter construct, decidualized for 5&#x02005;d, and then exposed for 12&#x02005;h to either unconditioned ECM or pooled spent medium from DCEs or DIEs. In keeping with the array findings, soluble factors derived from DIEs strongly induced luciferase expression whereas this response was entirely absent upon incubation with unconditioned ECM or medium conditioned by DCEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Developmentally competent human embryos signal to promote implantation</title><p>We next explored if the developmental potential of human embryos impacts on the expression of uterine implantation genes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Female C57BL/6 mice were hormonally stimulated to induce uterine receptivity and the lumen flushed with 50&#x02005;&#x003bc;l of unconditioned ECM or pooled conditioned culture medium from human DCEs or DIEs. The animals were sacrificed 24&#x02005;h later and the uterine transcriptome sequenced. As in the experiments with primary HESCs, many more genes (~6&#x000d7;) were altered in response to exposure of the uterine lumen to DIE versus DCE conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). However, the extent and amplitude of the transcriptional response to DCE was much more pronounced <italic>in vivo</italic> when compared to decidualizing primary HESC cultures. Strikingly, 27 of 90 (30%) uterine genes solely responsive to DCE signals code factors that have already been implicated in the implantation process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S3</xref>), including COX-2 (<italic>Ptgs2</italic>), Cytochrome P450 26a1 (<italic>Cyp26a1</italic>), and osteopontin (<italic>Spp1</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. In addition, exposure to DCE signals strongly upregulated a group of metabolic genes, which included <italic>Fabp4</italic>, <italic>Plin1</italic>, <italic>Cidec</italic>, <italic>Adipoq</italic>, <italic>Retn</italic>, and <italic>Car3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Fig. S1</xref>). Fatty acid binding protein 4 (<italic>Fabp4</italic>) is a widely used marker of differentiating adipocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector c (<italic>Cidec</italic>) promotes lipid droplet expansion whereas perilipin 1 (<italic>Plin1</italic>) prevents lipase-dependent breakdown of lipid droplets under basal conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Further, adiponectin (<italic>Adipoq</italic>) and resistin (<italic>Retn</italic>) are key adipokines involved in regulating energy intake and expenditure as well as insulin sensitivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Taken together, the data point towards the existence of an evolutionarily conserved network of maternal genes that is responsive to embryonic signals and contributes to post-implantation development. By contrast, the response to DIE signals had the hallmarks of a stress response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Fig. S2</xref>). This was confirmed by Western blot analysis demonstrating strong uterine expression of Xbp1, Chop and Lc3b in response to DIE signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Fig. S3</xref>). Notably, a modest stress-like response was also apparent upon flushing of the uterine lumen with medium conditioned by DCEs, which may point towards the induction of a decidual response and associated UPR.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The role of embryo-derived trypsin in maternal embryo recognition</title><p>A surprising observation was the induction of <italic>Prss28</italic> (68-fold) and <italic>Prss29</italic> (6-fold) mRNAs in the mouse uterus in response to DCE signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S3</xref>). Prss28 and Prss29 are implantation-specific serine proteases that exhibit trypsin-like substrate specificity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Embryonic tryptases activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and upregulate COX-2 levels in murine endometrial epithelial cells (EECs), leading to prostaglandin production required for implantation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. <italic>Prss28</italic> and <italic>Prss29</italic> have no functional homologs in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, suggesting a compensatory role for other serine proteases or, perhaps, that tryptic activity is no longer involved in embryo-EEC signaling<italic>.</italic> Comparative analysis of gene expression data showed that (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Fig. S4 &#x00026; S5</xref>), unlike their murine counterparts, developing human embryos up- and down-regulate the expression of <italic>TMPRSS15</italic> and <italic>AMBP</italic> coding for the trypsinogen activator (enterokinase) and trypsin inhibitor (trypstatin/bikunin precursor), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Fig. S5</xref>). Trypsin activity was detectable in culture medium conditioned by human embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Furthermore, exposure of Ishikawa cells (a cell line model for human EECs) to spent embryo medium induced oscillatory increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>). Interestingly, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations were discrete, lasting approximately 5&#x02005;min, in response to DCE medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>, upper panel). This contrasted to more pronounced and much longer oscillations when cells were exposed to DIE signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>, lower panel). The [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> fluxes induced by embryonic cues bore a striking similarity to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations induced upon application of trypsin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Fig. S6A and D</xref>). Soybean trypsin inhibitor dramatically decreased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signals induced by spent embryo medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Fig. S6B and D</xref>). Conversely, embryo-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations greatly attenuated the subsequent [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses to trypsin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Fig. S6C and D</xref>). Finally, short exposure to trypsin (5&#x02005;min) was sufficient to upregulate COX-2 expression in Ishikawa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>). These data indicate that EECs serve to amplify discrete embryonic protease signals that induce a supportive maternal environment.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Conflict between parent and offspring is thought to drive reproductive evolution and innovation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. This hypothesis predicts that the embryonic genome evolves to extract as much as possible from the mother to ensure its propagation whereas maternal genes will adapt to safeguard the success of current as well as future offspring. Thus, reproductive success in different species depends on balancing evolving embryonic and maternal traits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. A singular feature of the reproductive cycle in humans, shared with very few other mammalian species, is menstruation, a process triggered by &#x02018;spontaneous&#x02019; decidualization of the endometrium in an embryo-independent manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. When placed in the context of fetal-maternal conflict<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, our findings indicate that cyclic decidualization coupled to menstruation emerged as a strategy for early detection and active rejection of developmentally abnormal embryos that have breached the luminal epithelium. We show that decidual cells mount an extraordinarily polarized transcriptional response to embryonic signals, ranging from being exceptionally discrete in case of a competent embryo to extensive and complex in the presence of a low-quality embryo. We further demonstrate that <italic>HSPA8</italic> is particularly sensitive to signals from DIEs. Down-regulation of this molecular chaperone in decidual cells converts the differentiation-associated UPR into an overt ER stress response, which in turn compromises secretion of decidual factors, including PRL and IGFBP1, essential for placental formation and fetal development.</p><p>Conversely, this study shows that competent pre-implantation human embryos have retained the ability to actively enhance the uterine environment for implantation. This response to DCE signals is characterized by the induction of 29 known implantation factors, including COX-2, as well as various metabolic enzymes involved in lipid accumulation, glucose uptake, and energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S3</xref>). Interestingly, several of these metabolic genes (e.g. <italic>Cidec</italic>, <italic>Plin1</italic>, <italic>Adipoq</italic>, <italic>Retn</italic> and <italic>Fabp4</italic>) are transcriptionally regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#x003b3;) in adipocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, suggesting that embryonic signals activate this nuclear receptor in the endometrium, perhaps indirectly via induction of COX-2-dependent prostaglandin production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. In mice, initiation of implantation requires release of embryonic serine proteases, which in turn activate epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel (ENaC) in EECs, triggering Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and induction of COX-2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Several lines of evidence indicate that this implantation pathway is not only conserved in humans but also important for embryo sensoring. We found that tryptic activity is detectable in medium conditioned by human embryos even before hatching. Incubation of EECs with ECM elicited [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations, a response markedly blunted by soybean trypsin inhibitor and recapitulated upon treatment of cells with low concentrations of trypsin. Further, brief exposure of EECs to trypsin was sufficient to induce COX-2 expression. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis showed that progression to the blastocyst stage is associated with gene changes predictive of increased expression and activation of various proteases implicated in ENaC activation, although the pattern of expression of individual genes during pre-implantation development frequently differs between mouse and human embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Fig. S4 &#x00026; S5</xref> and data not shown). Remarkably, cues from competent human embryos strongly induced two non-conserved implantation-specific serine proteinases, Prss28 (also known as implantation serine protease 1 or ISP1) and Prss29 (ISP2), in the mouse uterus. These proteases are also co-expressed in pre-implantation murine embryos<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. ISP1 and 2 heterodimerize and form an enzymatic complex essential for blastocyst hatching, outgrowth and implantation in mice. Taken together, these observations suggest that endometrial protease production accelerates as the embryo approaches the surface epithelium, perhaps aligning hatching of the blastocyst with implantation. By contrast, low-quality human embryos triggered prolonged and disorganized [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations in EECs and an uterine stress response <italic>in vivo</italic>. The mechanism that couples these events warrants further investigations, although it is likely to involve illicit, excessive or unopposed activation of embryonic proteases, leading to proteotoxic stress in both the conceptus and surrounding maternal cells. This conjecture is supported by the observation that DCE but not DIE signals strongly enhance uterine expression of <italic>Spink3</italic>, which codes for the secreted serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 3 (SPINK3). The human homolog SPINK1 critically protects the pancreas from auto-digestion by preventing premature protease activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>.</p><p>In summary, reproductive success in humans depends on sustained maternal investment in one - occasionally two - implanting embryos. Genomic instability, giving rise to a vast array of chromosomal errors of variable complexity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, is prevalent in human embryos throughout all stages of pre-implantation development. This engrained diversity in embryo quality poses an obvious maternal challenge. Our observations show that both positive and negative selection mechanisms govern implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), rendering this process intrinsically dynamic and adaptable to individual embryos.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Experimental ethics policy</title><p>This study was approved by the Medical Review Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Central Committee for Research on Human Subjects in The Netherlands (NL 12481.000.06), and the Hammersmith and Queen Charlotte's &#x00026; Chelsea Research Ethics Committee (1997/5065).

In concert, the decidualizing endometrium secretes serine protease inhibitors, such as murine SPINK3 and the human homolog SPINK1, to limit embryo-derived proteolytic activity. Note that acquisition of a secretory phenotype upon decidualization depends on massive expansion of the ER in HESCs. (B) By contrast, excessive protease activity emanating from developmentally compromised embryos that have breached the luminal epithelium down-regulates the expression of molecular chaperones in surrounding decidual cells, leading to accumulation of misfolded proteins and ER stress. This in turn compromises decidual cell functions and triggers tissue breakdown and early maternal rejection.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep03894-f4"/></fig></floats-group></article>
