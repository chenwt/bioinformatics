However, the current reference genome contains &#x0223c;1000 blocks of unknown sequence (&#x02018;N-islands&#x02019;), which are frequently placed in introns of annotated gene models. We developed a strategy to search for previously unknown exons hidden within such blocks, and determine the sequence, and exon/intron boundaries, of such exons. These methods are based on assembly and alignment of short cDNA and genomic DNA reads, completely independent of prior reference assembly or annotation. Our evidence indicates that a substantial proportion of the annotated intronic N-islands contain hidden exons. For most of these, our algorithm recovers full exonic sequence with associated splice junctions and exon-adjacent intronic sequence. These new exons represent <italic>de novo</italic> sequence generally present nowhere in the assembled genome, and the added sequence improves evolutionary conservation of the predicted encoded peptides.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>transcriptome assembly</kwd><kwd>trinity</kwd><kwd><italic>Chlamydomonas</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="17"/><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>The assembled <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> reference genome is 120 Mb long, 65% GC, and repeat-rich.

Since we were primarily interested in evaluating N-islands within gene models, we restricted the RNAseq data input to &#x0223c;57 million 50-bp single-end reads that either (1) aligned to a transcript models that contain at least one N-island, or (2) did not align to any transcript model.</p><p>To focus on sequences that are likely to contain useful biological information, we filtered the initial 10,134-sequence Trinity output (median sequence length = 315 bp) to retain only sequences that had an e-value (BLASTX) to <italic>Volvox</italic> or <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (TAIR10) peptides of 0.001 or lower. <italic>Volvox</italic> is a recently diverged multicellular relative of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, with approximately 50% neutral sequence divergence but high conservation of many predicted encoded proteins (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Prochnik <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).

Since we wanted to resolve intronic N-islands, we used only Phytozome transcripts predicted to splice out N-islands in the search. There are 821 such transcripts; we analyzed 647 of them, for which we found aligned Trinity objects. These 647 transcripts contain 9720 splice junctions, of which 789 are annotated as splicing out N-islands.</p><p>From this set, of 8931 junctions not associated with N-islands, 7141 (80%) were &#x02018;covered&#x02019;: a Trinity object aligns with continuous coverage across the junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top). This result supports the <italic>in vivo</italic> splicing event proposed for these junctions. For 20%, we did not recover Trinity sequences aligned to either side of the splice junction (&#x02018;no information&#x02019;). The &#x02018;no information&#x02019; category could reflect many causes, including low mRNA abundance, Trinity alignment difficulties due to repetitive sequence, or incorrect gene models, such as intronic or intergenic sequence predicted to encode a splice junction.</p><p>In contrast, of 789 junctions predicted to splice out N-islands, only 272 (34%) were covered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.116.029207/-/DC1/TableS1.xlsx">Table S1</ext-link>). There was no information for 396 (50%). For 15%, we found evidence that the N-island-associated junction was associated with hidden exons within the N-island (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.116.029207/-/DC1/TableS2.xlsx">Table S2</ext-link>).</p><p>The striking enrichment of the &#x02018;no information&#x02019; category for splice junctions splicing out N-islands suggests that presence of N-islands may correlate with (or cause) difficulties in construction of accurate gene models; this possibility is hard to evaluate directly. We focus below on validating the finding of hidden exons within intronic N-islands. The overall frequency with which intronic N-islands actually contain hidden exons is hard to estimate with confidence due to the large &#x02018;no information&#x02019; category; the simplest estimate is 26% (104 with hidden exons out of 393 for which we have Trinity information).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Hidden exons</title><p>If an intronic N-island harbors hidden exonic sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom), we may find a Trinity object that &#x02019;bridges&#x02019; the splice junction using two high-scoring pairs (HSPs) flanking the junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Blastn alignments were done with the &#x02019;ungapped&#x02019; option to force generation of distinct HSPs, rather than introducing gaps in a single HSP. This option was particularly important for discovering very short hidden exons. We also required extra sequence from the Trinity object between the HSPs, to spurious detection of BLAST results with two HSPs that overlap due to direct repeat sequences at the HSP termini. A &#x02019;half-bridge&#x02019; can result if the Trinity object is too short relative to the amount of missing sequence to make a full bridge (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.116.029207/-/DC1/TableS4.xlsx">Table S4</ext-link>). To score as a half-bridge, we required that an HSP align within 50 bp of the N island, with a long (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;60% of the Trinity sequence) unaligned tail extending in the direction of the N island. We also required evolutionary support by Blastx alignment of the Trinity sequence to <italic>Volvox</italic> peptides (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>BLAST analysis against Volvox to determine evolutionary conservation of bridging sequences</title><p>Trinity sequences bridging an N-island-containing splice junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) suggest identification of missing exons; however, they could result from artifacts of <italic>in silico</italic> assembly. A Trinity object bridging an N-island should frequently improve BLAST alignments to the proteome of <italic>Volvox</italic>, a close relative of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, if the bridge contains genuine translated exons. Such improvement should be highly unlikely if the bridge structure is the result of a Trinity assembly artifact. A similar analysis was useful in evaluating biological significance of annotated 5&#x02032;-untranslated open reading frames (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cross 2015</xref>). Therefore, we carried out BLASTX with nucleotide sequences corresponding to the aligned HSPs plus the intervening sequence provided by Trinity (&#x02019;extended&#x02019;) as query, and the <italic>Volvox</italic> proteome as source of subjects. As a control, the intervening sequence was scrambled. We required that queries with and without the intervening sequence both hit the same <italic>Volvox</italic> peptide. To determine how much score increase we should consider significant, we supposed that if the intervening sequence was not translated <italic>in vivo</italic>, then small random score changes should be similar with scrambled controls as with the intact sequence. We found that the scrambled control never showed a score increase &#x0003e; 10, while such increases happened very frequently with the intact sequence. While a BLAST score of 11 is trivially attained in a search of a query against an entire proteome; the reason such a small score is significant in the present case is that the subject for the query is a single <italic>Volvox</italic> peptide preselected on the basis of alignment to the flanking regions common to the reference transcript and the Trinity object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Increases of this magnitude were biologically significant in evaluating upstream open reading frames (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cross 2015</xref>). Note that, since the assay is for improvement of BLAST score, the result is specific to the novel segment in question&#x02014;it is independent of the quality of alignment elsewhere in the sequence. In general, the newly aligned sequence aligns across its length, and lacks stop codons or other indicators of internal errors, though we have not evaluated this comprehensively.</p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Authentic missing exons can encode evolutionarily conserved sequence: the <italic>Volvox</italic> BLASTX test.

A Trinity object could be: (1) assembled from RNA sequence transcribed from a single contiguous stretch of genomic DNA; (2) assembled from RNA transcribed from discontiguous stretches that are spliced <italic>in vivo</italic> into a single RNA; (3) assembled from RNA transcribed from discontiguous stretches that are combined by Trinity into a single object by misassembly <italic>in silico</italic> (most likely by &#x02018;track-crossing&#x02019; at repeat sequences).</p><p>If a segment of a Trinity object was transcribed from a contiguous stretch of genomic DNA, then genomic reads aligned to the segment should tile over a single continuous matching sequence. In contrast, if the segment was transcribed from discontiguous segments, alignment of genomic reads should break into multiple discrete islands. We aligned 100 bp genomic DNA reads to the collection of Trinity objects with Bowtie2 using &#x02018;local&#x02019; alignment (which allows alignment even if only a portion of the read aligns to the template). This leads to a highly specific signature of an alignment discontinuity: an &#x0223c;100-fold excess assignment of &#x02018;starts&#x02019; and finishes&#x02019; of alignment to nucleotide positions exactly at the point where two discontiguous sequences are joined in the template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3, A and B</xref>). These positions were used as seeds to grow a contiguous genomic region out of all reads initially aligned to the Trinity object, by iteratively constructing a majority consensus, discarding reads that fit poorly, and recruiting new reads that aligned well and expanded the consensus. The process terminates when no unrecruited reads both align to the Trinity object and also agree with the growing consensus. The latter criterion is highly effective in discarding reads that align solely by an internal repeat. The result for each discontiguous segment of genomic DNA aligning to part of a Trinity object is an island of sequence supported by a tiled series of reads, with sequence not alignable to Trinity extending from either end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The extensions are typically of length &#x0223c;80 nt, equal to the read length 100, minus the minimum 20 required for Bowtie2 to call a local alignment. Ideally, one such island is found for each discontiguous sequence making up the Trinity object.</p><fig id="fig3" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Local alignment of genomic reads to transcripts gives a signature for junctions of discontiguous genomic encoding segments.

Splice sites from the annotated Phytozome reference genome were collected and analyzed using the Weblogo algorithm (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Crooks <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://weblogo.berkeley.edu">http://weblogo.berkeley.edu</ext-link>). The human consensus is shown for comparison. (C) The splicing test. Consensus islands assembled as in (B) can be assembled into mRNA only by a join at a highly restricted location [in the absence of any terminal direct repeats, a single nucleotide at the terminus (start or finish) of each island]. This provides a highly constrained condition for searching for splice site homology (donor and acceptor positions; the most likely start and finish positions are indicated by green or red arrows). A series of consensus islands connected by high-confidence splices on the same strand forms a &#x02018;connected island&#x02019;; a candidate hidden exon should be contained within such a connected island to pass the splicing test.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1899f4-1"/><graphic xlink:href="1899f4-2"/></fig><p>Sequential islands of this kind have no aligned sequence at all comparing them to each other, although each has a central segment aligned to sequential segments of the Trinity object. Alignment discontinuities between these islands (the blue-yellow and orange-purple junctions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) mark an obligatory and exact position where the genomic segments must be joined in order to reconstitute the Trinity object. This restricts positions of potential RNA splicing to one nucleotide. (This is expanded to a few nucleotides in the case of direct repeats at the termini of the Trinity-homologous segments). Internal repeats will typically not yield a neighboring start&#x02013;finish pair in close enough proximity to explain the join by splicing.</p><p>Because the position of the join is highly constrained, we reasoned that if the segments were joined by RNA splicing, then we should be able to detect sequence signatures permissive for splicing specifically at these junctions. We examined genomic splice site sequences in the reference assembly/annotation to determine a splicing consensus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4, B and C</xref>). Consistent with previous work in many eukaryotic organisms, the strongest determinant was the /GT&#x02026;AG/ dinucleotide pair at intron termini; other flanking sequences also contributed significantly to the consensus, equivalent to almost eight nucleotides of specified sequence. We found that a match score of 11 bits (obtained by summing information content for observed nucleotide at each position) was attained by &#x0223c;99% of Phytozome annotated splice junctions, and by only &#x0223c;1% of randomly selected genomic sequences, and we chose this value as a cutoff for splice junction detection. Because of the near-absolute requirement for the /GT&#x02026;(intron)&#x02026;AG/ dinucleotides for splicing, we imposed a two-step test: presence of the dinucleotides, and a score of at least 11 (the dinucleotides alone give a score of 8). We applied this test to the discontinuities in alignment of genomic sequences to Trinity objects, as detailed above.</p><p>The results of this procedure for four typical cases with a &#x02018;bridged&#x02019; N-island (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. The successive red bars at top represent islands aligned to Trinity; the black lines at left and right of these islands represent non-Trinity-homologous sequence. The blue arrows are high-confidence splice junctions according to the test described above. In the four typical cases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, the algorithm has assembled multiple candidate exons. In all cases. these exons could be joined by high-confidence splices; thus, these sets of sequences form &#x02018;connected islands&#x02019; that could be assembled into a single mature transcript by splicing.

The blue joining arrows indicate high-scoring splice junctions (if detected, junctions on the opposite strand are in yellow). Below is a quantitative trace of splice junction locations and scores (standardized to the maximum possible score of &#x0223c;15; the cutoff value for acceptance of 11 is illustrated by the red line). The blue lines are splices in our model; green lines below are splices from the reference transcript model aligned to the Trinity object. Red lines indicate splice junctions on the opposite strand in the Trinity sequence. The green bars indicate regions of alignment (HSPs) to the specified Phytozome reference transcript.

Importantly, almost all of the nucleotides contributing to the splice site consensus are intronic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and thus not present in the Trinity-assembled sequence.

The Cre17.g740510 gene model has two intronic N-islands, between exons 11 and 12 (246 N) and between exons 12 and 13 (100 N). We identified a Trinity object that covered exons 9&#x02013;17 of the <italic>CDC27</italic> transcript model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Two separated HSPs surround the first N-island, with extra sequence between the HSPs in the Trinity object [the signature for possible hidden exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>)]. The first HSP aligns to reference exons 9&#x02013;11, and the second HSP covers reference exons 12&#x02013;17, including the 3&#x02032;UTR. The intervening &#x0201c;missing sequence&#x0201d; between exons 11 and 12 is accounted for by splicing in two new exons &#x02018;X&#x02019; and &#x02018;Y&#x02019; from a previously unknown genomic segment; the extra peptide sequence thereby added to CDC27 is supported by <italic>Volvox</italic> homology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

We defined a flanking N-island as an N-island starting within 100 bp of the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; borders of a gene model. If the authentic gene extends into the N-island, then there could be a &#x02018;half-bridging&#x02019; Trinity object aligning at one end to the reference gene model, with the other end &#x02018;hanging&#x02019; in the N-island.

Two examples are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Because the Trinity objects are short, it is unlikely that these extensions complete the transcript model, and the lack of a full bridge intrinsically makes these hits less reliable, but it is clear that extension of these methods could significantly extend or even complete gene models by foraging into the adjacent N-islands. We suspect that the low yield of these structures is related to the sequencing difficulties (simple sequence, repeat regions, and inverted repeats) that led to them being called as N-islands in the original annotation.</p><fig id="fig7" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Flanking N islands can truncate a gene model.

Many N-islands are assigned in the reference to intergenic or intronic regions, and such assignments are problematic (since, for example, intronic N-islands could, in principle, contain any number of unknown exons, or even complete unknown genes). Our results suggest additional internal coding exons, or N- or C-terminal extension of coding sequence, to replace the putatively noncoding N-islands, in a significant minority of N-islands.</p><p>We did not attempt to validate the new exons by additional direct experimentation; possibilities would include longer RNAseq reads, paired-end, or strand-specific RNAseq, and different sequencing technologies allowing much longer genomic DNA reads. However, the BLASTX improvement assay, and the finding that high-confidence splice junctions could be formed at almost all the relevant junctions, constitute two entirely independent ways to validate the results, since neither of these results is predicted if the new candidate exons are not spliced and translated as predicted.</p><p>The methods used here are useful for &#x02018;proofreading&#x02019; a reference assembly/annotations, but the methods do not require a prior reference. In principle, these methods could validate RNAseq-based transcriptome assemblies, including providing genomic splice sites and flanking intronic sequences, even for organisms without any assembled genome or annotation.</p><p>While our computations <italic>per se</italic> did not use the assembled genome or reference annotation, the results could be evaluated with much higher confidence when looking for a revision of the current assembly, rather than entirely <italic>de novo</italic> sequence. Thus, we have more confidence in the bridged than the half-bridged cases (such as with the flanking N-islands), and we did not so far attempt to evaluate Trinity objects that were completely unalignable to any reference transcript. One limitation to our approach, as noted above, was the use of single-end, nonstrand-specific 50-nt RNAseq reads. More informative libraries might improve resolution and reduce track-crossing sufficiently that a reliable full transcriptome, along with junctional sequences at promoter, termination and splice sites, might be recovered <italic>de novo</italic>. The <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> genome is a favorable case in that it is 1.2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>8</sup> bp, of which around one-third is exonic. It is unfavorable in having a very high density of repeats and low-complexity sequence (likely the source of most alignment difficulties including N-islands, and certainly the source of most difficulties we encountered with our approach).</p><p>In principle, the genomic islands recovered to account for Trinity objects could be used iteratively to align genomic reads, ultimately finding the next exon and providing sequence of the entire intron. We have not attempted this because of the clear danger of track-crossing in repeat sequences, which are especially enriched in intronic sequence, but it is likely possible in at least some cases.</p><p>The test for splice sites at the borders of the Trinity-nucleated genomic islands also tests the validity of the Trinity object, since it is a sensitive indicator of track-crossing leading to fusion transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This could be a useful proofreading step when Trinity-generated transcriptomes are used in the absence of a reference genome sequence, since it requires only a single library of genomic reads aligned to the Trinity objects, and requires no prior assembly of a reference genome.</p><p>The combination of <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly followed by alignment of short genomic reads onto the assembled transcriptome objects in principle represents a massively parallel approach to validating a genome assembly/annotation, equivalent in some ways to checking a near-complete collection of ESTs against the annotation in a single experiment. Our implementation was not quite up to this challenge, because the assembly was only &#x0223c;70% complete, and a significant minority of the assembled objects had track-crossing and other issues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, these seem likely to be solvable issues, through the use of better RNAseq libraries, and through making use of paired-end information for both RNAseq and DNA libraries.</p><p>While our approach did uncover some novel exons missed in the prior assembly/annotation, overall our results document the very high quality of the annotation. A majority of N-islands annotated as intronic most likely are purely intronic, and a large majority of annotated splice junctions lacking N-islands are confirmed: they are covered by continuous Trinity object sequence, and put together from discontiguous genomic segments with high-confidence splices.</p><p>The current assembly/annotation reports &#x0223c;4 Mb of Ns (3.4% of the genome), distributed in 1489 islands of highly variable size; 64% of these islands are located in introns, and these are primarily the N-islands addressed by the current study. However, these intronic N-islands are short (only 15% &#x0003e; 1 kb, 2% &#x0003e;&#x000a0;10 kb), and account for only 22% of the total Ns; most Ns are found in large islands (45% &#x0003e; 1 kb, 25% &#x0003e;&#x000a0;10 kb) annotated as intergenic. It is likely that at least some of these large regions contain unknown transcripts, which should be represented in our study by Trinity objects that did not align to any current Phytozome transcript model. We have not examined this question in detail, but it is clear that few such objects exist in our dataset, and could account for no more than a very small proportion of the 3.1 Mb of Ns in intergenic islands. Therefore, while we cannot make a strong conclusion on this point, it seems at least plausible that most of the large intergenic N-islands are composed of noncoding sequence; perhaps sequence characteristics leading experimentally to N-island status are relatively rare in sequences transcribed into mRNA. Until the sequences are identified, this remains a speculation.</p></sec>
