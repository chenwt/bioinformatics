In this study, the mitochondrial proteome in the cardiac tissue of ICM patients was analysed by quantitative differential electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry (MS) for the first time to provide new insights into cardiac dysfunction in this cardiomyopathy. We isolated mitochondria from LV samples of explanted hearts of ICM patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8) and control donors (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8) and used a proteomic approach to investigate the variations in mitochondrial protein expression. We found that most of the altered proteins were involved in cardiac energy metabolism (82%). We focused on ATPA, which is involved in energy production, and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, implicated in substrate utilization, and observed that these molecules were overexpressed and that the changes detected in the processes mediated by these proteins were closely related. Notably, we found that ATPA overexpression was associated with reduction in LV mass (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02212;0.74, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01). We also found a substantial increase in the expression of elongation factor Tu, a molecule implicated in protein synthesis, and PRDX3, involved in the stress response. All of these changes were validated using classical techniques and by using novel and precise selected reaction monitoring analysis and an RNA sequencing approach, with the total heart samples being increased to 24. This study provides key insights that enhance our understanding of the cellular mechanisms related to the pathophysiology of ICM and could lead to the development of aetiology-specific heart failure therapies. ATPA could serve as a molecular target suitable for new therapeutic interventions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>heart failure</kwd><kwd>ischaemic cardiomyopathy</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>tissue</kwd><kwd>transplantation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries, and ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) is one of the main causes of this syndrome <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Advances in the understanding of the molecular basis of myocardial ischaemia have yielded deep insights into the complex sequence of events occurring in ICM, regardless of its manifestations. This enhanced understanding has highlighted the critical role played by cardiac mitochondria in this cardiomyopathy <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p><p>Several key studies have focused on how mitochondria contribute to the development and progression of HF, because mitochondria play a central role in energy production, metabolism, calcium homoeostasis and oxidative stress <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Alterations in mitochondrial bioenergetics appear to be critically involved in ICM. The failing heart exhibits marked mitochondrial abnormalities that impair the ability of the cardiac tissue to synthesize ATP. Thus, impaired oxidative phosphorylation can reduce cardiac function by providing an insufficient supply of ATP to cardiac myocytes <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Although promising mitochondrion-targeted drugs have emerged, successful clinical trials have been completed for only very few of these drugs. Therefore, the mitochondrion remains a potential untapped target for use in new ICM therapies. Mitochondria have been studied extensively using experimental models and conventional biochemical methods <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. These studies have typically focused on only one particular protein rather than on the entire cardiac mitochondrial proteome. Furthermore, the mitochondrial proteome has not been analysed in pathological human hearts by 2D-DIGE and MS/MS. Thus, characterizing the mitochondrial proteome could provide new insights into cardiac dysfunction and suggest new molecular targets for use in therapeutic interventions designed for ICM.</p><p>In this study, we isolated mitochondria from LV samples of explanted human hearts of patients with ICM and used a proteomic approach to investigate the variations in mitochondrial protein expression. Our results reveal that, in ischaemic human hearts, proteins involved mainly in energy metabolism and also those involved in protein synthesis and stress response increased. We focused on four representative mitochondrial proteins that were altered in these processes, which were validated using distinct classical techniques as well as novel and precise selected reaction monitoring (SRM) analysis and an RNA sequencing (RNAseq) approach. We found that these proteins could play a key role in ICM. Specifically, our results indicate a direct relationship between the overexpression of ATP synthase subunit alpha (ATPA) and a reduction in LV mass (LVM).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Tissue sources</title><p>Experiments were performed with LV samples obtained from the explanted hearts of Caucasian patients who had ICM and had undergone cardiac transplantation (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;16).

Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the development of this cardiomyopathy <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. However, the mechanisms responsible for mitochondrial alterations in human hearts are poorly understood, and the animal models used to elucidate these mechanisms may not reflect the true pathophysiology of ICM. To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse the mitochondrial proteome in pathological human hearts. Focusing research efforts on targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in the failing heart is crucial for restoring the myocardium and its contractile function. Thus, analysing the mitochondrial proteome could provide new insights into cardiac dysfunction in ICM patients. Here, we identified 12 protein spots corresponding to 11 mitochondrial proteins that were altered in failing hearts; nine proteins were increased, two were decreased. These changes comprise numerous aspects of mitochondrial function, but most of the altered proteins (9 of the 11 differentially regulated proteins, 82%) are involved in energy metabolism, which suggests that these are the proteins that are most sensitive to myocardial ischaemic injury.</p><p>Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation forms the basis of ATP production <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Cardiac work is supported by a high rate of ATP hydrolysis, which is matched by ATP production through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. During HF development, both energy demands and metabolism change cause a drastic reduction in oxidative phosphorylation and a shift towards glucose over fatty-acid utilization <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Moreover, high rates of myocardial energy production are required to maintain the constant ATP demand of the working heart, and alterations in oxidative phosphorylation reduce cardiac function by providing an insufficient supply of ATP to cardiomyocytes <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Our data show specific alterations in the ATP synthase system in ICM patients, we observed a substantial overexpression of ATPA. An interesting functional analysis in rats published by Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. showed that inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthase abolished the intermittent improvements induced by hypobaric hypoxia, specifically reducing post-ischaemic recovery of LV function, mitochondrial membrane potential and respiratory control ratios <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. A critical finding of our study was the close relationship between ATPA protein level and LV mass, which indicates that an increase in the protein level is associated with a reduction in LV mass. Thus, our results have once again demonstrated that ATP synthase activity is a key player in cardioprotection and have revealed for first time a direct relationship between the level of ATPA and the degree of hypertrophy in human ischaemic cardiac tissue. Taken together, these results imply that the mitochondrial ATP synthase could potentially be targeted in therapies to protect the heart against ischaemic injury and remodelling. To verify the causality of this highly significant relationship, additional studies are required.</p><p>We also found a strong positive correlation between the protein levels of ATPA and DLDH, a protein that is involved in substrate utilization. This correlation highlights the relationship between the two principal components of the cardiac energy metabolism system, energy production and substrate utilization. We found overexpression of DLDH, a stable homodimer that is an essential component of the pyruvate-dehydrogenase and glycine-cleavage systems, as well as of the &#x003b1;-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. This result agrees with those published by our group and also by Li <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. in previous studies conducted using total homogenates of LV tissue of ICM patients, which revealed increased expression of DLDH <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>.</p><p>Oxidative stress has been widely reported to be a crucial feature in the pathophysiology and development of HF occurring through free-radical production <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. Reactive oxygen species play a key role in the onset and progression of coronary heart disease, tissue necrosis, and contractile dysfunction <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. PRDX3 is a mitochondrial antioxidant protein that protects radical-sensitive enzymes against oxidative damage by means of a radical-generating system. PRDX3 overexpression has been reported to protect the heart against post-myocardial infarct remodelling and failure in mice by reducing LV cavity dilation, dysfunction, fibrosis and apoptosis <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. These results are consistent with our findings, because we found that PRDX3 levels were increased substantially in the cardiac tissue of ICM patients. Furthermore, we found that PRDX3 levels were strongly correlated with those of other altered proteins that are implicated in protein synthesis, specifically EFTU, a result that interconnects the changes occurring in distinct processes. Thus, oxidative damage is linked to increased activation of protein biosynthesis in failing hearts, because EFTU promotes the GTP-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site of ribosomes, and the down-regulation of EFTU increases reactive oxygen species <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>.</p><p>A common limitation of studies in which the cardiac tissues used are obtained from end-stage failing human hearts is that disease aetiology and treatments vary considerably. However, we ensured that our study population was aetiologically homogeneous. Moreover, our tissue samples were obtained from the transmural LV apex, and thus our findings cannot be generalized to all layers and regions of the LV. However, a crucial factor of our study was that it was conducted using a large number of samples collected from explanted hearts of patients who had undergone cardiac transplantation, which makes our results applicable to the ICM population.</p><p>In summary, this study is the first to analyse the mitochondrial proteome in the cardiac tissue of ICM patients. We found significant and reproducible alterations in cardiac energy metabolism, especially in molecules involved in substrate utilization and energy production, which revealed a close relationship between the changes detected in these two processes. Importantly, we observed that ATPA overexpression was strongly correlated with a reduction in LV mass. This work provides new insights into the cellular mechanisms associated with the pathophysiology of ICM and could serve as a pivotal study in the development of aetiology-specific HF therapies. Our data identify ATPA as a molecule that could be targeted in new therapeutic interventions developed for ICM patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the Transplant Coordination Unit (Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain) for their help in obtaining the samples.
