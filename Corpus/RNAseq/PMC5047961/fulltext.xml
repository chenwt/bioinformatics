Among the different epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated transcriptional factors, ZEB1 has a key role in inducing the mesenchymal phenotypes and stem cell-like properties of different breast cancer cells. ARF6 and its effector AMAP1 are frequently overexpressed in breast cancer cells, and promote invasion, metastasis and drug resistance. EPB41L5 is induced during EMT, and mediates the disruption of E-cadherin-based cell&#x02013;cell adhesion and the promotion of focal adhesion dynamics. Here we show that EPB41L5 is an integral component of the ARF6-based pathway, which is induced by ZEB1. We found that EPB41L5 is expressed at high levels in malignant breast cancer cells and binds to AMAP1. ZEB1 induced <italic>EPB41L5</italic> both in cancer cells and normal cells. This relationship was recaptured with The Cancer Genome Atlas RNASeq data set, and correlated with the poor outcome of the patients. In contrast, diversified events, such as tumor growth factor &#x003b2;1 stimulation, expression of SNAI1 and <italic>TP53</italic> mutation, can each cause the induction of <italic>ZEB1</italic> and EPB41L5, depending on the cellular context. Our results demonstrated that the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis is at the core of the cancer mesenchymal program that drives ARF6-based invasion, metastasis and drug resistance of significant populations of primary breast cancers, and is tightly correlated with the poor outcomes of patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The acquisition of malignant phenotypes by breast cancer cells often involves their transition into mesenchymal-type cells, through processes resembling epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition (EMT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Such mesenchymal-type malignancy involves resistance against anoikis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> which might help to maintain cell viability in the absence of cell adhesion during the distant metastasis of cancer cells, whereas mesenchymal malignancy on its own also includes highly invasive and metastatic potentials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Recent studies have moreover suggested that the acquisition of mesenchymal properties of cancer cells is closely related to drug resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup></p><p>Research on breast cancer has played leading roles towards understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in cancerous EMT.

The NMuMG cell line is derived from mouse normal mammary epithelial cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> in which TGF&#x003b2;1 induces EPB41L5 at the mRNA and protein levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> We found that TGF&#x003b2;1 induces ZEB1 expression in these cells, whereas silencing of <italic>ZEB1</italic> almost completely abolishes TGF&#x003b2;1-induced EPB41L5 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). HMLE cells are immortalized human mammary epithelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> HMLE cells expressed only marginal levels of EPB41L5 and ZEB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). TGF&#x003b2;1 did not notably enhance the expression of ZEB1 and EPB41L5 in HMLE cells, whereas this stimulation promoted the expression of fibronectin, which is indicative of progression of some EMT process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2c</xref>). On the other hand, the transcriptional factor SNAI1 was reported to induce ZEB1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>.

<italic>ZEB1</italic> and <italic>EPB41L5</italic> were not expressed in HMLER cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). Therefore, these results support a notion that the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis exists also in non-transformed cells. Our results also indicated that TGF&#x003b2;1 might not be a general inducer of the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis, and oncogenic RAS may also not be a common inducer of this axis.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>TP53</italic> mutation induces <italic>ZEB1</italic> and <italic>EPB41L5</italic></title><p>Normal-p53 has a potential to suppress the mesenchymal program of breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Mutations in the <italic>TP53</italic> gene are frequent in breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> We next investigated the possible involvement of <italic>TP53</italic> mutations in induction of the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis.

Shp53 cells expressing the rescue construct (shp53/R280K cells), or expressing the other p53-mutants, R175H, R249S and R273H, which were all thought to be oncogenic, were also generated. Expression of ZEB1 and EPB41L5, at the mRNA and protein levels, was found to be repressed in shp53/wt cells, whereas they were expressed in shp53 cells and also in all of these cells expressing p53-mutants, at levels similar to the parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a&#x02013;c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3b</xref>). On the other hand, TGF&#x003b2;1 did not affect the expression of ZEB1 and EPB41L5 in any of these cells, whereas TGF&#x003b2;1 induced SNAI1 and SNAI2 in these cells, irrespective of the <italic>TP53</italic> status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a and b</xref>). Expression of <italic>TWIST1/2</italic> mRNA was almost undetectable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3c</xref>). Therefore, loss of normal-p53 function appeared to be an event that induces the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis in MDA-MB-231 cells.

Using The Cancer Genome Atlas RNASeq data set, we then sought to assess the extent to which <italic>TP53</italic> mutations are associated with induction of the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis in primary breast tumors. We classified the top 33&#x00025; of primary breast tumors regarding their high expression of both <italic>ZEB1</italic> mRNA and <italic>EPB41L5</italic> mRNA as the high-expression group, and found that ~15&#x00025; of tumors of the high-expression group bear <italic>TP53</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Therefore, although the high expression of <italic>ZEB1</italic> and <italic>EPB41L5</italic> appears to occur among certain populations of primary breast tumors bearing <italic>TP53</italic> mutations, these results suggested that the loss of normal-p53 might not be a major cause inducing the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis and that induction of this axis may frequently occur even in the presence of normal-p53.</p></sec><sec><title>The ARF6-AMAP1-EPB41L5 pathway promotes drug resistance</title><p>We have already shown that EPB41L5 promotes the drug resistance of breast cancer cells, such as MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435s, both of which express every component of the ARF6-based pathway at high levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> Involvement of ZEB1 in drug resistance has also been documented in pancreatic cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> We then sought to understand whether other components of the ARF6-based mesenchymal pathway are also involved in promoting the drug resistance.

On the other hand, silencing of ARF6 for more than 2 days affected the growth of these cells, and thus we were unable to precisely assess the effects of ARF6 silencing on drug resistance. Collectively, it is conceivable that rather than the solitary expression of ZEB1 or EPB41L5 at high levels, high expression of the intact ARF6-based mesenchymal pathway is necessary to render the drug resistance.

The high expression of any of these mRNAs, by their own or even in the presence of missense <italic>TP53</italic> mutations, also did not statistically correlate with the poor survival of patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5a</xref>). These results suggested that a high expression of <italic>EPB41L5</italic> play a central role in the poor outcome of breast cancer patients, rather than high expression of the other EMT-related genes, including <italic>ZEB1</italic>. In this regard, it should be noted that the <italic>EPB41L5</italic> gene is not the sole target of ZEB1. Our analysis moreover suggested that high levels of <italic>EPB41L5</italic> expression may become more closely associated with the poor overall survival of patients, if cells possess oncogenic mutations of <italic>TP53</italic> (see later).</p></sec><sec><title>High expression of <italic>EPB41L5</italic> is not specifically associated with basal-like or HER2-enriched genotypes</title><p>Primary breast cancers can be categorized into four main molecular classes regarding their gene expression profiles: basal-like, HER2-enriched, luminal A and luminal B.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup>
<italic>TP53</italic> mutations are very frequent in the basal-like (80&#x00025;) and HER2-enriched (72&#x00025;) genotypes, which exhibit very aggressive phenotypes compared with the luminal A/B types. We found that high expression of <italic>EPB41L5</italic> is not specifically related to the basal-like or HER2-enriched genotypes, but appears to be rather related to the luminal A/B genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5b</xref>). High expression of <italic>EPB41L5</italic> in the presence of <italic>TP53</italic> missense mutations was not specifically related to any of the four genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5b</xref>). High mRNA expression of all components of the ARF6-based pathway, as well as their co-incidence with <italic>TP53</italic> missense mutations, also appeared to occur almost randomly among these four molecular classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5b</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that EBP41L5-mediated mesenchymal phenotypes may arise mostly independent of the basal-like and HER2-enriched genotypes. This notion is consistent with the above results that <italic>TP53</italic> mutations might not be the major cause inducing <italic>EBP41L5</italic> among different breast cancers.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we show that the ARF6-based pathway includes a mesenchymal-specific protein, EPB41L5, as its integral component. Therefore, this pathway appears to be a mesenchymal-specific pathway, not expressed in cancer cells unless they undergo EMT. We have moreover demonstrated that this pathway contributes to the drug resistance, rather than merely promoting invasion and metastasis. There is an argument regarding whether EMT-like changes of cancer cells actually contribute to their invasion and metastasis, whereas such changes might contribute to the drug resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> Our results, however, clearly demonstrated that the ARF6-AMAP1-EPB41L5 mesenchymal pathway is critical to both the invasion/metastasis and the drug resistance. We are studying precise molecular mechanisms as to how this pathway contributes to the drug resistance.</p><p>ZEB1 was identified to be primarily responsible to induce <italic>EPB41L5</italic> in both non-transformed and transformed mammary epithelial cells, whereas several different events, such as TGF&#x003b2;1, SNAI1 and <italic>TP53</italic> mutation, induced the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis. TGF&#x003b2;1 has been well documented to be associated with mesenchymal properties by breast cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> However, it is rare that this cytokine alone is sufficient to induce EMT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> Our results indicated that the induction of the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis by TGF&#x003b2;1 does not always occur among different mammary epithelial cells. Likewise, although the expression of SNAI1 has been shown to induce <italic>ZEB1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> and to be critical to the malignancy of certain populations of primary breast cancers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> SNAI1 did not necessarily induce <italic>ZEB1</italic>. Furthermore, although we observed that loss of normal-p53 induces the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis in MDA-MB-231 cells, loss of normal-p53 does not always induce the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis among different preparations of HMLE cells. Clinical data set analysis indicated that <italic>TP53</italic> mutation might not be the major cause that induces high expression of <italic>ZEB1</italic> and <italic>EPB41L5</italic> among different primary breast tumors. Therefore, whereas the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis appears to be central to promote mesenchymal malignancies of significant populations of primary breast cancers, different events may initially trigger induction of this axis perhaps dependent on cell contexts. It is well documented that epigenomic chromatin modifications are critical in determining the <italic>ZEB1</italic> transcription,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> and that miRNAs are involved in regulating the <italic>ZEB1</italic> transcripts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> We have yet to understand what types of genome/epigenome statuses of cancer cells, as well as the microenvironments, are involved in the apparently non-linear processes inducing the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis. Furthermore, although ZEB1 can be critical in the cell plasticity generating cancer stem cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> we have yet to study the relationship between EPB41L5 expression and the generation of cancer stem-like cells.</p><p>The high expression of <italic>EPB41L5</italic> in the presence of <italic>TP53</italic> missense mutations was more tightly correlated with the poor overall survival of patients than the high expression of <italic>EPB41L5</italic> alone. We have shown that upregulation of the mevalonate pathway by oncogenic mutant-p53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> is critical to facilitate ARF6 activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> On the other hand, <italic>TP53</italic> mutations are not the major event inducing the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis. Therefore, these two events, induction of the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis and <italic>TP53</italic> mutations, can be complementary to each other in generating and activating the ARF6-based mesenchymal pathway, and may hence cooperatively promotes the mesenchymal malignancy of breast cancer cells.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis is at the core of the mesenchymal program of breast cancer, which carries out ARF6-mediated invasion, metastasis and drug resistance. Our analyses also demonstrated that a high expression level of <italic>EPB41L5</italic> is a key factor in the poor overall survival of patients, rather than the high expression level of other representative genes associated with EMT. Collectively, the ARF6-based pathway driven by the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis appears to account for almost half the population of breast cancer patients that survive for less than several years after diagnosis under current therapeutics.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cells</title><p>MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435s, Hs578T, NMuMG and human mammary epithelial cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA).
