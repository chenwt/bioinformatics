Expression is expected to evolve adaptively in all populations but only those populations experiencing environmental heterogeneity are expected to show adaptive evolution of plasticity. We measured the transcriptome in a cadmium-enriched diet and a salt-enriched diet for experimental populations of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> that evolved for ~130 generations in one of four selective regimes: two constant regimes maintained in either cadmium or salt diets and two heterogeneous regimes that varied either temporally or spatially between the two diets. For populations evolving in constant regimes, we find a strong signature of counter-gradient evolution; the evolved expression differences between populations adapted to alternative diets is opposite to the plastic response of the ancestral population that is na&#x000ef;ve to both diets. Based on expression patterns in the ancestral populations, we identify a set of genes for which we predict selection in heterogeneous regimes to result in increases in plasticity and we find the expected pattern. In contrast, a set of genes where we predicted reduced plasticity did not follow expectation. Nonetheless, both gene sets showed a pattern consistent with adaptive expression evolution in heterogeneous regimes, highlighting the difference between observing &#x0201c;optimal&#x0201d; plasticity and improvements in environment-specific expression. Looking across all genes, there is evidence in all regimes of differences in biased allele expression across environments (&#x0201c;allelic plasticity&#x0201d;) and this is more common among genes with plasticity in total expression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Different developmental environments change how genes are expressed and what phenotypes are produced.

To produce different phenotypes from a single genotype, one of the essential intermediate steps is the induction of gene expression changes by the environment [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Studying expression plasticity can provide insights on how different phenotypes are generated by the interactions between genotype and the environment [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, transcriptomics allow us to examine plastic responses for a large set of traits (expression levels of many genes) that are relatively unbiased compared to traditional phenotypic traits with respect to preconceived notions of their importance or ease of measurement, though the link between expression traits and ecological importance is typically more tenuous than for traditional phenotypes.</p><p>Plasticity may be beneficial, allowing organisms developing in different environments to produce phenotypes better suited to those environments. On the other hand, a plastic response can be deleterious if it shifts the phenotype away from the optimum for the organism, perhaps reflecting the inability of the organism to buffer against the imposed environmental perturbation [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Finally, a plastic phenotypic change can be neutral (or nearly so), e.g., a by-product of physiological response to the environment that has little effect on fitness [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A variety of transcriptional changes may occur as a result of exposure to a novel environment. Multigenerational selection in the new environment may engender genetic responses that reinforce initially beneficial plastic changes (e.g., genetic assimilation [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). Alternatively, long-term selection may result in genetic responses that oppose deleterious plastic responses that were deleterious, resulting in a pattern of &#x0201c;counter-gradient&#x0201d; variation [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Plasticity can only be shaped adaptively in populations that evolve in a variable environment. A na&#x000ef;ve population first exposed to a variable environment may initially exhibit beneficial plasticity with respect to some expression traits but deleterious plasticity for others. Subsequent evolution in a variable environment is expected to reshape plastic responses. For most traits, including expression traits, selection does not act directly on plasticity itself but rather plasticity evolves as a by-product of adaptation of trait means to each encountered environment [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. How plasticity evolves depends on how the phenotypes initially produced in a novel environment differ from the optimal phenotype in each environment. Both decreases and increases in phenotypic plasticity could contribute to adaptation to variable environments [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Further, alternative forms of heterogeneity (e.g., temporal vs. spatial) may select on plasticity differently [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Although expression plasticity could be beneficial [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or deleterious [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and genetic variation for plasticity has been found in different organisms [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we still have little understanding of how expression plasticity evolves, in terms of the rate and the directions. Can plasticity evolve adaptively on short time scales? Yampolsky et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] used microarrays to survey the transcriptome of <italic>Drosophila</italic> populations maintained in homogeneous environments (regular or ethanol medium) or spatially heterogeneous environments (mixed of two types of mediums) for more than 300 generations but found that the selective regime had limited effect on expression plasticity for the two mediums. They suggested that evolution of expression plasticity might require a longer timescale.</p><p>Here we examine expression plasticity in experimental <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> populations that have evolved under constant conditions or with either spatial or temporal heterogeneity in larval diets. We have previously used these populations to examine how environmental heterogeneity affects inbreeding depression [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], genome-wide molecular diversity [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], quantitative genetic variation [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and adaptive potential [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Here we use these populations, after ~130 generations of evolution, to study expression plasticity in larvae. We address three types of questions:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>For populations adapted to different (but non-varying) environments, are expression differences related to allele frequency differences?

Briefly, the original field-collected population was maintained in a large lab population on standard cornmeal food (<italic>Grand Ancestor</italic>). From that population, two other large populations were established, one maintained on a salt-enriched diet (<italic>Ancestral Salt</italic> [<italic>AS</italic>]) and one on a cadmium-enriched (<italic>Ancestral Cadmium</italic> [<italic>AC</italic>]), and each of these adapted to its respective diet. A cross was made between <italic>AS</italic> and <italic>AC</italic> to create 20 smaller populations; these were divided among four selective regimes: <italic>Cad</italic>, <italic>Salt</italic>, <italic>Temp</italic>, and <italic>Spatial</italic> (five replicate populations per regime). In the two homogeneous selection regimes (<italic>Cad</italic> and <italic>Salt</italic>), larvae were reared on the appropriate regime-specific diet every generation. In the <italic>Temp</italic> treatment, populations were reared in alternating generations on salt- or cadmium-enriched medium. In the <italic>Spatial</italic> treatment, each generation half of the population was reared in one medium and half in the other, and the parents were mixed. Approximately 130 generations after the creation of these selective regimes, RNAseq data was obtained from each population, including the three ancestral populations. For each population, two RNAseq samples were obtained from very young larvae that had been exposed for 12 hours to either the cadmium- or salt-enriched diet (one sample of each).</p><fig id="pgen.1006336.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1006336.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Selection history of the experimental populations.</title><p>The <italic>Grand Ancestor</italic> population (<italic>GA</italic>) was established from wild collected flies and maintained in benign laboratory conditions (cornmeal diet).

A significant &#x0201c;selective history&#x0201d; effect can be loosely interpreted as an evolved difference in the level of expression averaged across diets. Previously, we examined allele frequency divergence between the <italic>Cad</italic> and <italic>Salt</italic> populations [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Combining those results with expression divergence, we tested whether the set of genes with significantly divergent SNP frequencies between the cadmium-selected and the salt-selected populations are enriched for genes showing divergent expression between <italic>Cad</italic> and <italic>Salt</italic>. We separated the genes based on whether the SNPs are located in exon, intron or intergenic regions. There is significant enrichment for differential expression for genes with differentiated SNPs located within 1kb outside the genic regions (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> = 8.0, df = 1, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0047 for genes with SNPs 1kb around the gene), but not for genes with SNPs located in exons (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> = 2.3, df = 1, <italic>p</italic> = 0.12) or introns (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> = 1.7, df = 1, <italic>p</italic> = 0.19). These results suggest that cis-acting factors contribute to the evolved divergence in expression (but these results do not exclude an important role for trans-acting factors as well). This is consistent with previous studies showing cis-regulatory variants are important for expression divergence between populations or species in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Next, we examine whether the direction of expression changes in the ancestral population when exposed to cadmium- versus salt-enriched food match evolved expression differences between cadmium- and salt-selected populations (i.e., do genes that are up-regulated by cadmium exposure relative to salt exposure in the ancestor evolve higher or lower expression in cadmium-selected populations than salt-selected populations?). Using the <italic>Grand Ancestor</italic> (<italic>GA</italic>) population, which is na&#x000ef;ve to both diets, we identify 905 genes that have log<sub>2</sub> fold change (log<sub>2</sub>FC) in expression between cadmium and salt diets greater than 0.4. (This plasticity reflects a change in expression then the ancestor is reared on cadmium versus salt; it is not a contrast with expression on benign cornmeal.) Using samples from the five <italic>Cad</italic> and the five <italic>Salt</italic> populations, there are 546 genes showing a &#x0201c;selection history&#x0201d; effect with <italic>q</italic> &#x0003c; 0.1. (The &#x0201c;selection history&#x0201d; history reflects differentiation between <italic>Cad</italic> and <italic>Salt</italic> regimes from one another, not necessarily differentiation from the <italic>Grand Ancestor</italic>.) A hundred and eight genes overlap between the two sets of genes (gene names are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006336.s012">S7 Table</xref>). The functional categories &#x0201c;Membrane&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Transmembrane&#x0201d; are significantly enriched among these 108 genes (~40 of the 108 genes are related to membranes).</p><p>For 91% of these genes, the evolved divergence is in the opposite direction to the na&#x000ef;ve plastic response (98/108; significantly different than 50%: <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> = 71.7, df = 1, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 2.2e-16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006336.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), meaning, for example, that a gene which is up-regulated when the ancestor is reared in cadmium (relative to salt) has evolved lower average expression in the <italic>Cad</italic> than in the <italic>Salt</italic> populations. Using <italic>Cad/Salt</italic> population pairs (rather than genes) as the unit of replication confirms this result where evolved responses oppose rather than reinforce plastic ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006336.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This type of &#x0201c;counter-gradient&#x0201d; response [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] is emerging as a major theme in evolutionary expression studies [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><fig id="pgen.1006336.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1006336.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Plastic changes in the na&#x000ef;ve ancestor (<italic>GA</italic>) compared to evolved differences in adapted populations.</title><p>(A) The log2 fold change (log<sub>2</sub>FC) between diets in <italic>GA</italic> vs. the log<sub>2</sub>FC between regimes <italic>Cad</italic> and <italic>Salt</italic> from a statistical model using both diets.

The expression difference is negative for all five pairs and the average across them is significantly below zero (<italic>t</italic> = -16.5, <italic>p</italic> = 8.0e-05) indicating that evolved differences between <italic>Cad</italic> and <italic>Salt</italic> is in the opposite direction to plasticity in the ancestor.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1006336.g002"/></fig><p>There are at least two reasons that a countergradient pattern could occur. If selection favours the same expression level (or phenotype) across environments but one environment induces a change in the phenotype, then opposing genetic changes are expected to evolve. Heuristically, genetic and environmental effects of opposite sign combine additively to yield little net change in phenotype/expression when genotypes are assayed in their adaptive environment. This type of explanation has been used for the countergradient pattern observed for the rate of tadpole development along an altitudinal gradient [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A different reason for the appearance of a countergradient pattern is related to the stress experienced by a population exposed to a novel environment. Abnormal expression responses occur because of the direct perturbation by the novel environment or reflect the stress response (or its cascading effects) employed to cope with environmental perturbation. Adaptation may render the environment benign (for example, via the evolution of efficient cadmium detoxifaction) such that there is no longer a direct perturbation or a stress response. In this case, genetic and environmental effects are not additive as each population is affected differently by the environment.</p><p>A closer inspection of our data indicates that the observed counter-gradient response does not appear to involve a genetic effect acting in opposition to but additively with the diet effect; rather <italic>Salt</italic> and <italic>Cad</italic> regimes are affected differently by diet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006336.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). In this gene set, a large proportion of genes is up-regulated in the na&#x000ef;ve ancestor (<italic>GA</italic>) when it is reared in cadmium compared to when it is reared in salt; a similar pattern of plasticity is observed in <italic>Salt</italic> populations. In contrast, this plasticity has largely been evolutionarily lost in <italic>Cad</italic> populations such that there is little up-regulation of these genes in cadmium. A likely scenario is that, after <italic>Cad</italic> populations adapt reasonably well to cadmium, they no longer show the perturbed response of a population na&#x000ef;ve to cadmium.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Differential gene expression among experimental regimes</title><p>In addition to the two homogeneous selective regimes (<italic>Cad</italic> and <italic>Salt</italic>), this experiment involved two regimes with heterogeneous selection (<italic>Temp</italic> and <italic>Spatial</italic>). To visualize the expression divergence among experimental samples from all regimes, we plot the first five principle components of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006336.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The most striking pattern occurs with respect to PC2. <italic>Salt</italic> populations reared in cadmium have a very different value for PC2 than all other treatment/diet combinations, reinforcing the idea that cadmium perturbs the expression profile of populations without an evolutionary history of cadmium exposure.

Though plasticity is expected to be more adaptive in the heterogeneous regimes than homogeneous regimes, we cannot test this prediction by looking at the transcriptome as a single unit. Rather, we need to first identify genes on which we expect selection to result in (i) increased or (ii) decreased plasticity. To do so, we leverage the history of our experimental treatments. The focal populations in all four selective regimes were originally created by crossing two diet-adapted populations, <italic>Ancestral Cadmium</italic> (<italic>AC</italic>) and <italic>Ancestral Salt</italic> (<italic>AS</italic>), followed by ~130 generations of selection within each of the four treatments.

Though we cannot know the &#x0201c;optimal&#x0201d; expression level, we can use expression of each diet-adapted ancestor assayed in its respective diet as a first approximation of the optimum. To identify potential targets for the evolution of increased plasticity in heterogeneous regimes, we used the data from the two diet-adapted ancestors (<italic>AC</italic> and <italic>AS</italic>). We screened for genes that met the two criteria (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref> for further details).

We now consider their plasticity in the four experimental treatments derived from these ancestors. For each gene in each population, we calculated the log<sub>2</sub>FC change across diets such that positive values indicate plasticity in the adaptive direction. For each population we averaged across the 109 genes to obtain a single measure of adaptive plasticity per population (i.e., &#x0201c;population&#x0201d;, not &#x0201c;gene&#x0201d;, is used as the unit of replication).

RNAseq provides us an opportunity to study another type of plasticity, &#x0201c;allelic plasticity&#x0201d;, which is the relative expression difference of two alleles for a polymorphic gene between diets (i.e., plasticity in allelic expression bias). This type of plasticity reflects variation in cis-regulatory elements whose effects are environmentally-dependent. Because each population is assayed in both environments, significant differences in SNP frequencies between environments in the RNAseq data reflects plasticity in allelic expression bias. In the context of pooled-seq data, allelic plasticity can be due to between-diet differences in expression between alternative homozygotes or because of between-diet differences in allele expression within heterozygotes. Alternatively, apparent allelic plasticity could be due to selection but there is little opportunity for this (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>). For each regime, we screened for polymorphic sites and then selected the most informative site within each gene. We detect evidence of allelic plasticity at numerous genes (~7% of genes tested); the average number of genes across the four regimes with significant (at <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) allelic plasticity is 516 whereas the average number of genes expected by chance based on a permutation analysis is 49. Moreover, allelic plasticity is approximately twice as common among those genes with significant abundance plasticity than those without (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006336.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This pattern of enrichment would not be expected if a strong from of compensatory expression in which increased expression of one allele is balanced by reduced expression of the alternative allele in order to keep total expression reasonably constant. Rather, this enrichment likely exists because expression of one allele is substantially more sensitive to the environment but than the other, resulting in plasticity in total expression (abundance plasticity) as well as plasticity in the relative expression of the two alleles (allelic plasticity). These patterns are likely driven by variation in cis-regulatory elements. There is no indication that this enrichment varies among treatments.</p><fig id="pgen.1006336.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1006336.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Enrichment of allelic plasticity among genes with abundance plasticity.</title><p>For each regime, the fraction of genes with significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) allelic plasticity among genes without (blue) or with (orange) significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) abundance plasticity.

We observe a striking pattern of countergradient variation with respect to expression divergence in a manner suggesting genetic responses evolve to restore an optimum perturbed by environmental effects. Though &#x0201c;countergradient&#x0201d; responses have been reported in several recent expression studies [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], not all studies use the term in exactly the same manner. Classic usage of the term implicitly assumes plasticity is constant (at least in sign) across populations [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] but in a recent study [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and in our own, patterns of plasticity differ among populations. As suggested above, adaptation may often involve physiologically &#x0201c;managing&#x0201d; an environmental stimulus (e.g., cadmium detoxification) so that it no longer creates a cascade of expression perturbations. If so, we would not expect that the genes showing countergradient responses to be the direct targets of adaptive evolution. Ghalambor et al. [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] argued that genes that have their expression maladaptively perturbed by a novel environment would be under strong selection to evolve genetic changes in expression. From this perspective, one might expect many of the genes with countergradient responses to be the direct targets of adaptive evolution. Future studies attempting to resolve these issues should strive to understand mechanistically (i) why plasticity occurs, (ii) what genetic changes underlie adaptation, and (iii) how these are responsible for changes in transcription.</p><p>The expression perturbations experienced by a na&#x000ef;ve population relative to an adapted one are not necessarily bad, and some may be beneficial in the short-term. Na&#x000ef;ve populations may respond to novel environmental stimuli by altering gene expression in helpful but non-ideal ways that mitigate harmful environmental effects, e.g., beneficial stress responses that are no longer needed (and possibly harmful) after better mechanisms of coping with the environment have evolved. Such genes could contribute to the gene set used in our countergradient analysis as well as the gene set predicted to evolve reduced plasticity, though there is no obvious indication of this from GO analysis. Regardless, these expression changes reflect the lack of a good solution to the environment even if some expression changes are beneficial initially. Thus, inclusion of such genes does not interfere with the objective of either analysis, though this possibility should be considered in interpreting the results. Specifically, we cannot assume that plastic responses that occur a na&#x000ef;ve population but not in an adapted one are all necessarily deleterious in the na&#x000ef;ve population. Expression studies like our own cannot identify which specific plastic changes are beneficial or deleterious in populations with different genetic backgrounds. In principle, selection on gene expression within a population could be studied using the same framework used to study selection on traditional phenotypes [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] though in practice this would be very difficult given the high dimensionality.</p><p>Changes in transcriptome-wide expression plasticity can be difficult to interpret because selection that results in adaptive reaction norms will not occur in populations living in homogeneous environments. For populations experiencing heterogeneity, selection within each environment may ultimately result in increases or decreases in plasticity for different genes. Our approach has been to use the diet-adapted ancestors as a guide to optimal expression within each environment. Using this approach, we inferred the ideal level of plasticity in the absence of constraints and identified gene sets that we expected to evolve increased or reduced levels of plasticity. Focusing on these gene sets, we found that expression in heterogeneous regimes was more adaptive in each environment than that of the non-adapted homogeneous regime. For genes predicted to increase plasticity, we found, as expected, higher levels of adaptive plasticity in heterogeneous regimes than homogeneous regimes. However, we did not find a reduction in plasticity in heterogeneous regimes for genes predicted to reduce plasticity despite the evidence of adaptive levels of expression.</p><p>Two reasons may contribute to the seeming discrepancy with respect to this latter gene set for which we see evidence of adaptive expression yet not the expected reduction in plasticity in heterogeneous regimes. First, any measurement error in expression (in addition to true plasticity) will contribute to our estimates of |log<sub>2</sub>FC| because we are using the absolute value of the difference in observed expression values between diets. Though such error should not artificially create differences in |log<sub>2</sub>FC| among regimes, it may reduce our power to detect true variation among regimes. Second, the observed results could arise simply by evolution toward optimal expression proceeding faster in one environment than the other within heterogeneous regimes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006336.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). Consider a case where expression in both environments is initially higher than the optimum, which is the same in both environments. If expression levels evolve down toward the optimum in both environments but adaptation proceeds faster in one environment than the other, then this would result in increased plasticity in expression across environments despite improvement in both. The observation of adaptive expression without the expected reduction in plasticity serves as a reminder that selection does not truly act directly on plasticity for most types of traits [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. If improvement is possible in only one environment, then this may result in increased plasticity (at least transiently) even if optimal expression is the same in both environments.</p><p>Because the averaging across environments works differently with temporal and spatial heterogeneity [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], plasticity may evolve differently with these alternatives forms of heterogeneity, though existing models make different predictions about the nature of this difference [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. With respect to expression in the gene sets predicted to evolve increased and decreased plasticity, we see some hints of differentiation between the <italic>Spatial</italic> and <italic>Temp</italic> treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006336.g004">Fig 4</xref>) but these are not statistically significant. Given that there are SNP frequency differences between the <italic>Spatial</italic> and <italic>Temp</italic> treatments [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a remaining challenge is to understand mechanistically how and evolutionarily why adaptation occurs differently with alternative forms of heterogeneity. When other studies investigate differences in plasticity in populations with spatial versus temporal heterogeneity, it will be possible to ask if there are general patterns in how plasticity evolves with these two common forms of heterogeneity.</p><p>A fundamental question of expression evolution is the relative importance of cis and trans effects. Previous work has established several lines of evidence that cis effects are of considerable importance [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Two of our results add to this. First, we observed that genes differentially expressed between <italic>Cad</italic> and <italic>Salt</italic> regimes where enriched having significantly differentiated SNP frequencies located in nearby intergenic regions. Second, we found evidence of extensive diet-dependent differences in allelic bias and that this allelic plasticity is associated with abundance plasticity. The simplest explanation for these observations is environmentally-sensitive cis-acting factors. This observation, along with other recent studies [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], raises the possibility that a substantial fraction of the genetic variation for expression may be manifest under particular environments (i.e., a large G&#x000d7;E component).</p><p>Our view of expression plasticity in this study is limited in several respects. We have measured expression at only a single developmental stage (very young larvae) and patterns may differ at other stages. For example, we see evidence that expression of <italic>Salt</italic> larvae is strongly perturbed in cadmium but comparatively little expression perturbation of <italic>Cad</italic> larvae in salt. Because we know that egg to adult survivorship is low for both situations [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], more severe expression perturbations are expected for <italic>Cad</italic> larvae in salt but these may not become apparent until later in development. Second, our analysis, like most expression studies, is biased towards detecting expression differences for genes that are reasonably highly expressed. Third, the pattern of plasticity evolves over time and may not yet have reached its equilibrium so measuring plasticity at multiple time points for evolving populations would be informative; this study represents only a single snapshot of expression evolution. Despite these limitations, various patterns are apparent and we have no <italic>a priori</italic> reason to believe these are misrepresentative, though other patterns might emerge with other types of expression data.</p><p>While we have studied expression and its plasticity in well-controlled experimental populations, comparing expression plasticity for populations living in different natural habitats should generate insights into how plasticity facilitates adaptation on long timescales [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. What aspects of the regulatory networks mediating plasticity evolve differently in short versus long evolutionary timescales? Combining different approaches from laboratory experiments to field studies should yield a more comprehensive understanding of the selective forces and constraints on the evolution of plasticity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>History of selection populations</title><p>A full description of the selective history of these populations can be found in Huang et al. 2014 [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Briefly a population collected from the wild was maintained in standard benign conditions (approximately 2000&#x02013;4000 adults), referred to here as the &#x0201c;<italic>Grand Ancestor</italic>&#x0201d; (<italic>GA</italic>). Two subsets of flies from the <italic>GA</italic> population were used to initiate a population maintained in a cadmium-enriched medium and a population maintained in a salt-enriched medium, each with population size ~1000, referred to as the &#x0201c;<italic>Ancestral Cadmium</italic>&#x0201d; (<italic>AC</italic>) population and the &#x0201c;<italic>Ancestral Salt</italic>&#x0201d; (<italic>AS</italic>) population, respectively. 448 males and 448 virgin females were collected from each the <italic>AC</italic> and <italic>AS</italic> populations and crossed with flies from the other population. The offspring from the next generation were used to found 20 populations (each with 448 adults) that were distributed evenly among four regimes: (i) constant cadmium-enriched (CdCl<sub>2</sub>) medium (&#x0201c;<italic>Cad&#x0201d;</italic>), (ii) constant salt-enriched (NaCl) medium (&#x0201c;<italic>Salt&#x0201d;</italic>), (iii) alternating each generation between salt- and cadmium-enriched media (&#x0201c;<italic>Temp&#x0201d;</italic>), and (iv) half the rearing vials containing cadmium-enriched medium and the other half containing salt-enriched medium (&#x0201c;<italic>Spatial&#x0201d;</italic>). For the <italic>Spatial</italic> regime, an equal number of adult flies produced from each type of medium were mixed to produce offspring for the next generation (i.e., a &#x0201c;soft&#x0201d; selection regime <italic>sensu</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]). The <italic>Cad</italic> and <italic>Salt</italic> regimes show the expected patterns of local adaptation based on the different fitness assays measured at ~50 and ~130 generations, i.e., populations from each regime perform better in their own diet than in the alternative [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The <italic>Temp</italic> and <italic>Spatial</italic> regimes have intermediate fitness between the two constant regimes in both diets.

Each block used one replicate population from each of the four regimes and assayed in both diets, resulting in eight samples (perfectly balanced) per block. Block 1 was performed at generation 127; Blocks 2 and 3 were performed at generation 128; Blocks 4 and 5 were performed at generation 129. Samples from all three ancestral populations were prepared at generation 129, regarded as Block 6. One generation before the collection, each replicate experimental population was reared in regular cornmeal diet to control for the maternal environment. In next generation, the emerged adult flies (Day 12) of each population mated for 1.5 days and then laid eggs on either salt or cadmium treatment diet. Before the actual egg-laying, pre-lay plates were supplied for two hours to provide ample opportunity for females to dump any stored eggs and ensure synchronization of the developmental stage of subsequently laid eggs. Laying plates were then supplied for two hours before the adults were removed. After ~ 20 hours (at 25&#x000b0;C), any hatched larvae were removed and discarded. Newly hatched larvae were transferred to the same selective diet within a one-hour window. After 12 hours, 80 larvae were collected per sample in 1.5 ml tubes with PBS solution (i.e., all larvae were 12&#x02013;13 hours old). The PBS solution was removed after centrifuging at 9500 rmp for 1 min. The samples were immediately frozen in dry ice and store in -80&#x000b0;C prior to RNA extraction.

Different sets of genes were tested for functional enrichment: genes for principle component analysis, genes for differential expression analysis between diets/regimes. Selection of overrepresented GO terms among all the tested GO (only considering the terms that do not associate with the child terms) was based on FDR(<italic>q</italic>) &#x0003c; 0.05 and were reported on different directions separately (i.e., positive or negative loading values on each PC axis; up-regulated in one or the other diet/regime). For the genes involved in comparing initial plasticity in the <italic>GA</italic> and evolved divergence, we obtained the functionality information and tested for overrepresented GO terms using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We performed the same GO analysis for the gene sets predicted to evolve increased or decreased plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Allelic bias expression analysis</title><p>To identify genes with different levels of allele expression bias in different diets (&#x0201c;allelic plasticity&#x0201d;) for each regime, we assumed the allele frequencies are the same for the two samples in different diets from a replicate population. Therefore, the difference in the ratio of mRNA levels of two alleles between diets is due to expression changes but not DNA. There will be some difference due to sampling of larvae (&#x0201c;genetic drift&#x0201d;) but this should be minimal because 80 larvae where taken for each sample. More importantly, the direction of drift should not be the same across replicates (reducing the statistical power to detect allelic plasticity rather than creating false positives). It is possible that during the 12 hours of diet feeding, selection changed the allele frequency. However, the opportunity for selection seems very small as dead larvae were rarely observed and almost all the larvae on the medium were collected for RNA extraction. However, if different genotypes grow at different rates at different diets, the changes in the allelic expression ratio will be due to the changes of relative contribution of mRNA from different genotypes. Bearing this caveat in mind, we examined between-diet differences in allelic expression within each regime. (An additional analysis described below found no evidence of &#x0201c;allelic plasticity&#x0201d; being in the direction of the allele favoured in a given diet, providing further evidence that selection is not responsible for observed instances of allelic plasticity.) To test for allelic plasticity, we first used Popoolation2 [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] to obtain the counts for different nucleotides in each position of the genes. To control the statistical power of identifying allelic expression among diets, we down-sampled the nucleotide counts for each site to the minimum coverage of the sites in each block (eight samples). For all the samples from regime <italic>i</italic> in both diets, we screened for sites that (i) have average diversity 2<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub><italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> &#x0003e; 20% (where <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the average mRNA nucleotide count frequency across the 10 samples for regime <italic>i</italic>, <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = 1 &#x02013;<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>), (ii) the total count for the site passes <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> &#x0003e; 100 (where <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the total count for that site among the 10 samples for regime <italic>i</italic>), and (iii) <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is at least half of the total read count for that gene. We chose the most informative site within each gene for each regime (highest <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub><italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub><italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>), to calculate its allelic expression. Significant allelic plasticity was identified by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test in R (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Two samples in different diets from the same replicate population were paired in the CMH test.</p><p>To test whether allelic plasticity is overrepresented among genes showing abundance plasticity, we only considered genes that are included in both the allelic plasticity analysis and the abundance plasticity analysis. Significant abundance plasticity (i.e., differential expression between diets) was identified by <italic>DESeq2</italic> (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 for &#x0201c;diet&#x0201d; effect on expression). We calculated the fraction of genes showing allelic plasticity amongst genes with significant abundance plasticity (<italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub>) and the fraction of genes showing allelic plasticity amongst genes without significant abundance plasticity (<italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>). The difference between the two fractions is <italic>diff_f</italic> = <italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub> &#x02013;<italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub>.</p><p>To evaluate whether the observed <italic>diff_f</italic> is significantly different than expected by chance, we used permutations to produce an empirical null distribution of <italic>diff_f</italic> for each regime. For each site within each population, we permutated the two alleles across diets, keeping total read count within each diet unchanged. Each permuted site was tested by CMH test for allelic bias expression. &#x0201c;Significant&#x0201d; genes in this permutation test result from chance associations (i.e., classic false positives) but may be more likely to occur for some genes than others (i.e., genes with low coverage in one or both diets). The number of pseudo-significant genes was much lower than the observed number of sites with significant allelic plasticity. To complete the enrichment test, we designated &#x0201c;significant allelic bias&#x0201d; to randomly chosen sites until the total number of genes with &#x0201c;significant allelic bias&#x0201d; was the same as the actual number. The genes with significant abundance expression plasticity were based on the actual data (i.e., this feature of the data was not permuted). For each permuted data set, we calculate the difference in fraction of allelic expression bias genes between genes with or without significant abundance expression plasticity (<italic>diff_f_permuted</italic>). We performed 5000 permutations to generate the distribution of <italic>diff_f_permuted</italic> for each regime. The <italic>p</italic>-value was computed as the twice of the proportion of the permuted statistics that were equal or more extreme than the actual <italic>diff_f</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Examining gene expression divergence and plasticity with respect to SNP differentiation</title><p>We obtained sites that are significantly differentiated with respect to genotypic SNP frequencies between cadmium- and salt-selected populations from previously reported genotypic sequencing data at generation 42 [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To determine whether the genes with ecologically differentiated SNPs are enriched for genes showing differential expression across regimes or diets, we only analyzed genes that not only have polymorphic SNPs for the allele frequency differentiation test [<xref rid="pgen.1006336.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] but are also involved in differential expression analysis. Further, we divided the genes into different categories based on whether the polymorphic SNPs are located in exons, introns and 1kb upstream and downstream of the genic region for enrichment test; genes with multiple SNP-types (e.g., SNPs in both exons and introns) are used in each relevant test. <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> tests were used to test for significant enrichment.</p><p>In addition, we searched for evidence for adaptive differential expression of alternative alleles between diets. To obtain high statistical power, we identified SNPs that show significant genomic allele frequency differentiation between the six cadmium- and six salt-selected populations (by including <italic>AC</italic> and <italic>AS</italic>), only using the sites identified as having alternative alleles that are differentially expressed between diets, i.e., allelic plasticity (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). For the set of genes that show both allelic plasticity and significant genomic allele frequency differentiation, we examined whether the direction of allelic plasticity between cadmium and salt diets is aligned with the direction of allele frequency change between cadmium- and salt-selected populations. For each of these genes, the allelic bias expression was assigned as positive if the direction of change between environments is the same, otherwise it was negative. The average allelic bias expression in the direction of allele frequency change was tested based on whether the bootstrapped distribution overlaps with 0.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1006336.s001"><label>S1 Information</label><caption><title>Gene-level pairwise comparisons among all four selective treatments.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1006336.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1006336.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>The log2 fold change (log</bold><sub><bold>2</bold></sub><bold>FC) between diets in <italic>GA</italic> vs. the log</bold><sub><bold>2</bold></sub><bold>FC between regimes <italic>Cad</italic> and <italic>Salt</italic> considering only the cadmium diet assay (A) and only the salt diet assay (B).</bold> The log<sub>2</sub>FC between diets in <italic>GA</italic> vs. log<sub>2</sub>FC between diets considering only the <italic>Cad</italic> populations (C) and considering only the <italic>Salt</italic> populations (D).</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1006336.s002.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1006336.s003"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Cartoon example showing the potential inconsistency between adaptedness and plasticity for genes expected to evolve decreased plasticity.</title><p>The optimal expressions (open symbols, <italic>A</italic>) are similar in two diets (<italic>C</italic> and <italic>S</italic>).
