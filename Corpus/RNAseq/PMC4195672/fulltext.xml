Short neuropeptide F (sNPF) signaling regulates several physiological processes in insects such as feeding, locomotion, circadian rhythm and reproduction, among others. Previously, the red imported fire ant (<italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic>) sNPF receptor (<italic>S. invicta</italic> sNPFR), a G protein-coupled receptor, was immunolocalized in queen and worker brain and queen ovaries. Differential distribution patterns of <italic>S. invicta</italic> sNPFR protein in fire ant worker brain were associated both with worker subcastes and with presence or absence of brood in the colony. However, the cognate ligand for this sNPFR has not been characterized and attempts to deorphanize the receptor with sNPF peptides from other insect species which ended in the canonical sequence LRLRFamide, failed. Receptor deorphanization is an important step to understand the neuropeptide receptor downstream signaling cascade. We cloned the full length cDNA of the putative <italic>S. invicta</italic> sNPF prepropeptide and identified the putative &#x0201c;sNPF&#x0201d; ligand within its sequence. The peptide ends with an amidated Tyr residue whereas in other insect species sNPFs have an amidated Phe or Trp residue at the C-terminus. We stably expressed the HA-tagged <italic>S. invicta</italic> sNPFR in CHO-K1 cells. Two <italic>S. invicta</italic> sNPFs differing at their N-terminus were synthesized that equally activated the sNPFR, SLRSALAAGHLRYa (EC<sub>50</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.2 nM) and SALAAGHLRYa (EC<sub>50</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8.6 nM). Both peptides decreased the intracellular cAMP concentration, indicating signaling through the G<sub>&#x003b1;i</sub>-subunit. The receptor was not activated by sNPF peptides from other insect species, honey bee long NPF (NPY) or mammalian PYY. Further, a synthesized peptide otherwise identical to the fire ant sequence but in which the C-terminal amidated amino acid residue &#x02018;Y&#x02019; was switched to &#x02018;F&#x02019;, failed to activate the sNPFR. This discovery will now allow us to investigate the function of sNPY and its cognate receptor in fire ant biology.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation NSF-IOS 1257837 and the Texas invasive ant research and management seed grant program from Texas AgriLife Research to P.V.P.

Therefore, they are of great interest to researchers in insect neurobiology and physiology and also to those interested in target validation for pesticide discovery and pest management. The red imported fire ant (<italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic> Buren) is a eusocial insect species native to South America. Because of its extraordinary capacity to adapt to different environmental conditions and its aggressiveness, the species is invasive and successfully establishes affecting the habitat of native animals; this has occurred in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, mainland China and Taiwan <xref rid="pone.0109590-Ascunce1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109590-Wilder1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. <italic>S. invicta</italic> colonies can recover even after destruction of 90% of their workers <xref rid="pone.0109590-VanderMeer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> making their management very difficult. In addition to their high reproductive output and aggressiveness, fire ants are an interesting model for the study of social organization and behavior because colonies are present in monogyne (single queen) and polygyne (multiple queens) forms <xref rid="pone.0109590-Chirino1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109590-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>We are systematically studying fire ant receptors involved in critical physiological functions, especially signaling receptors, to gain knowledge of physiological mechanisms in fire ants that perhaps collectively contribute to their success, life history, high reproductive output and colony growth. The neuropeptide Y (NPY) signaling system is recognized as evolutionarily conserved in animals and regulates several physiological processes such as feeding behavior, obesity, stress, blood pressure, anxiety, memory and circadian rhythms <xref rid="pone.0109590-Beck1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109590-Zimanyi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

In insects, the neuropeptide F (NPF) peptide family is represented by two forms, the long NPF (NPF) and short NPF (sNPF) <xref rid="pone.0109590-DeLoof1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. NPFs are commonly 28&#x02013;45 amino acids long with C-terminal conserved sequences being RxRFamide or GRxRYamide, while sNPFs are the short peptide sequences of 6&#x02013;19 amino acid residues ending in RFamide or RWamide <xref rid="pone.0109590-Nssel1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>sNPF has been identified exclusively in arthropods <xref rid="pone.0109590-Nssel1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. sNPF peptides have been isolated from several insect species including the Colorado potato beetle <xref rid="pone.0109590-Spittaels1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, the American cockroach <xref rid="pone.0109590-Veenstra1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, the desert locust <xref rid="pone.0109590-Clynen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and the fruit fly <xref rid="pone.0109590-Garczynski1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The peptide predicted sequence has also been identified by genomic and EST analyses in fruit fly and mosquito <xref rid="pone.0109590-Garczynski1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109590-Riehle1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

In <italic>Drosophila</italic> sNPF is also involved in the regulation of sleep homeostasis through the modulation of the cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling pathway <xref rid="pone.0109590-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109590-Shang1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. sNPF seems to have a species specific effect in feeding behavior and several studies indicate the positive relationship of activation of the sNPF signaling system (increased expression) and food searching and feeding behavior. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the over expression of sNPF increases adult body size and the number of feeding flies <xref rid="pone.0109590-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109590-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Further, in adult flies, expression of sNPF in olfactory receptor neurons mediates the enhancement of starvation-dependent food-searching behavior <xref rid="pone.0109590-Root1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Starvation increases expression of sNPF in cockroach <xref rid="pone.0109590-Mikani1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and sNPF receptor (sNPFR) in honey bee <xref rid="pone.0109590-Ament1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Transcript levels of the sNPF and cognate receptor in the honey bee, are interpreted as associated with worker division of labor and nutritional status, because increases in both transcripts were observed in foragers from nutritionally poor colonies <xref rid="pone.0109590-Ament1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Peptidomics of the honey bee (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) brain identified the sNPF abundance changed in association with nectar and pollen foraging <xref rid="pone.0109590-Brockmann1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In other insect species such as the lepidopteran silkworm, <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, and the red imported fire ant queens, sNPF and sNPFR transcript levels, respectively, decrease with food-deprivation, pointing to a negative correlation of sNPF activation and fed status. Similarly, an inverse relation of sNPF signaling and feeding behavior was also observed in the desert locust. Injection of sNPF peptides decreases food uptake while knock down of sNPF prepropeptide and sNPFR genes stimulates it <xref rid="pone.0109590-Dillen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109590-Dillen2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Some of these generalizations, however, are made on the basis of transcript levels alone, and not peptide and/or receptor protein, so caution is needed when interpreting them.</p><p>In fire ant, the full length cDNA of the sNPFR was originally cloned from queen ovaries <xref rid="pone.0109590-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Detection of the sNPFR proteins both in brain and in oocytes of fire ant queens <xref rid="pone.0109590-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> strongly suggests a link between feeding and reproductive functions of sNPF in fire ants. A reduction of sNPFR transcript expression was observed in starved mated queen brain, implying a negative relationship between sNPFR transcript expression and fed status <xref rid="pone.0109590-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. It must be noted that these queens were only given water and they had been isolated from the colony. In workers of the fire ant, sNPFR immunoreactive cells in the brain were higher in number in the minor subcaste (workers that were involved in queen and brood care), followed by medium and major worker subcastes. In addition, the number of sNPFR expressing neurons changed in the worker brain, decreasing in all worker subcastes when brood was absent. It was speculated that higher number of sNPFR immunoreactive neurons in the presence of brood may reflect the detection of protein, or the need for protein when larvae of the 4<sup>th</sup> instar, which digest protein actively for the rest of the colony, are present <xref rid="pone.0109590-Castillo1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p><p>sNPFRs have been functionally characterized only in solitary insects, flies (mosquitoes and fruit fly) and locust <xref rid="pone.0109590-Garczynski1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109590-Dillen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109590-Mertens1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. For this study our attempts to deorphanize the sNPF receptor using the orthologous peptide from the honey bee and those from <italic>Drosophila</italic> failed: none of these activated the receptor. We thus cloned the full length cDNA of the elusive sNPF ligand. Unexpectedly, the fire ant sNPF peptide ends with &#x02018;Y&#x02019; (tyrosine), differing from other known insect sNPF sequences ending in F (phenylalanine) or W (tryptophan). Two predicted peptides, when C-terminally amidated, activated the <italic>S. invicta</italic> recombinant sNPFR, which behaves as a Gi-coupled receptor in CHO-K1 cells, decreasing intracellular cAMP. Ligand identification will allow testing new hypothesis on the role of sNPY in social organization and overall fire ant biology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Fire ant collection and tissue isolation</title><p>Newly mated, dealate, fire ant queens were collected after mating flights in the campus area of Texas A&#x00026;M University, College Station, Texas.

In fire ant colonies, fourth instar larvae have a critical role in dietary protein digestion, and peptides so processed are shared by the colony members, mainly given to other larvae and queen, through trophalaxis. These larvae perform extraoral digestion in addition to digestion that occurs in their gut. Therefore, is very likely that these abundant proteases may have digested the propeptide and the active ligand during their homogenization, because we did not add protease inhibitors to the homogenate. This explains the detection of only a partial sNPF sequence. A search of the fire ant genome for other potential proteins exhibiting the detected sequence ALAAGH did not yield any protein with that motif, although proteins with the motifs LAAGH or ALAA were found, further supporting the detected fragment corresponds to the sNPF peptide and that the fire ants translate the sNPF cDNA.

We thus speculated that if the honey bee has one sNPF receptor but two related peptides (sNPF and NPY), perhaps the fire ant sNPF receptor could be a &#x0201c;permissive receptor&#x0201d; being activated by other NPY-like ligands. However, neither the honey bee NPY (long NPF; 39 amino acid residues) nor vertebrate PYY (34 amino acid residues) activated the fire ant receptor despite the similarity of these ligands to <italic>S. invicta</italic> sNPF in having an amidated tyrosine at the C-terminus and other sequence similarities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0109590-t001">Table 1</xref>, underlined residues). Based on these findings it appears that social insects have significant differences with respect to solitary insects in neuropeptide networks controlling the propensity to food searching and acquisition <xref rid="pone.0109590-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref> and of sensing their nutritional status <xref rid="pone.0109590-Castillo1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. In summary, the <italic>S. invicta</italic> sNPFR has been deorphanized by identifying a non-canonical sNPF peptide sequence ending at amidated &#x02018;Y&#x02019; from <italic>S. invicta</italic>, and this residue is critical for receptor activation and decrease in intracellular cAMP production. These conclusions are supported by genomic, RNAseq and cloning data as well as detection of a signature peptide fragment by MALDI-TOF MS and by functional cAMP assays. The receptor exhibits high selectivity for <italic>S. invicta</italic> sNPF1 and sNPF2 which have equal potency, in the nanomolar range.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0109590.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Corrected open reading frame sequence of <italic>S. invicta</italic> sNPF receptor.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0109590.s001.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0109590.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Alignment of sNPF pre-propeptide sequences from the seven ant species for which genome sequences are available.
