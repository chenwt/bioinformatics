EWS/FLI dysregulates gene expression during tumorigenesis by abnormally activating or repressing genes. The expression levels of thousands of genes are affected in Ewing sarcoma, however, it is unknown which of these genes contribute to the transformed phenotype. Here we characterize BCL11B as an up-regulated EWS/FLI target that is necessary for the maintenance of transformation in patient derived Ewing sarcoma cells lines. BCL11B, a zinc finger transcription factor, acts as a transcriptional repressor in Ewing&#x02019;s sarcoma and contributes to the EWS/FLI repressed gene signature. BCL11B repressive activity is mediated by the NuRD co-repressor complex. We further demonstrate that re-expression of SPRY1, a repressed target of BCL11B, limits the transformation capacity of Ewing sarcoma cells. These data define a new pathway downstream of EWS/FLI required for oncogenic maintenance in Ewing sarcoma.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>ETW is a Sydney&#x02019;s Incredible Defeat of Ewing&#x02019;s Sarcoma (SIDES) Scholar.

This tumor is characterized by a chromosomal translocation that fuses the 5&#x02032; portion of the <italic>EWSR1</italic> gene (encoding the EWS protein) on chromosome 22, in frame, to the 3&#x02032; portion of the <italic>FLI1</italic> gene (encoding the FLI protein) on chromosome 11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059369-Delattre1">[2]</xref>. The resulting fusion protein, EWS/FLI, retains the ETS-type DNA binding domain from FLI as well as the transcriptional activating and repressing domains from EWS, and thus acts as an aberrant transcription factor. EWS/FLI is present in &#x0223c;85% of Ewing sarcoma cases while the remaining 15% express a fusion between EWS and another member of the ETS family (ERG, ETV1, ETV4, or FEV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059369-TurcCarel1">[3]</xref>. While the cell of origin is unknown, this fusion is thought to occur in a primitive cell type where it prevents terminal differentiation. Initial mutational studies suggest that Ewing sarcoma has a relatively low frequency of alterations in known tumor suppressors or oncogenes, supporting the concept that EWS/FLI, and the genes that it regulates, are largely responsible for oncogenesis and tumor maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059369-Shukla1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059369-Huang1">[5]</xref>.

These findings, which characterize BCL11B&#x02019;s tumor inhibitory function, present a conundrum: why does EWS/FLI induce the expression of a postulated tumor suppressor? We therefore sought to define the role of BCL11B in Ewing sarcoma.

In addition to its nucleosome remodeling activity, the NuRD complex also contains class I histone deacetylases (HDACs). To test the necessity of HDACs in this repression, A673 cells were treated with the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat. After 48 hours of treatment, all four of the BCL11B target genes we identified were derepressed in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059369-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

However, BCL11B regulates a unique set of genes in the A673 cellular background in comparison to other cell types in which it has been studied. For example, BCL11B has been implicated in cell cycle progression by directly repressing the cell cycle inhibitors p21WAF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059369-Cherrier1">[43]</xref> and p57KIP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059369-ToparkNgarm1">[41]</xref> in microglial cells and SK-N-MC (which were originally characterized as a neuroblastoma cell line, but are in fact a Ewing cell line) cells, respectively. We were able to confirm downregulation of p57KIP2 transcript levels by BCL11B in SK-N-MC cells by qRT-PCR; however this was not observed in A673 or TC71 cells (ETW unpublished observation). At this time, we do not understand the differences among these cellular contexts that account for this discrepancy. Nonetheless, this discrepancy across Ewing sarcoma cell lines suggests that inhibition of p57KIP2 is not a central feature of BCL11B function in this tumor type. In developing T-cells BCL11B represses genes that allow for a more primitive state thus contributing to the differentiation process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059369-Li1">[23]</xref>. These classes of genes were not observed in our genome wide analysis of BCL11B regulated genes in A673 cells. Our data suggests that BCL11B contributes to the overall EWS/FLI repressed gene signature in Ewing sarcoma, and that the repression of a subset of these genes may be necessary for the transformed phenotype. EWS/FLI directly represses approximately 5% of the total EWS/FLI repressed genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059369-Sankar1">[31]</xref>.

BCL11B likely utilizes these interactions to mediate repression in both a cell-type specific and a promoter-specific fashion. We have shown that the chromatin remodeling activity of the NuRD co-repressor complex participates in the repression of the four BCL11B repressed genes investigated in this study. Our data further suggest that vorinostat-repressible HDAC activity is involved in this repression. These data are consistent with vorinostat inhibition of NuRD-associated HDACs, but inhibition of non-NuRD associated HDACs may also play a role. We have also demonstrated that the LSD1 inhibitor, HCI-2509, increases the expression of these genes. The mechanism for HCI-2509 is unclear due to the fact that BCL11B levels are also somewhat reduced. This small molecule has recently been shown to de-repress some EWS/FLI directly repressed target genes and show specific toxicity for Ewing sarcoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059369-Sankar1">[31]</xref>.
