The MFD-1 cell line was isolated from a 55-year-old male with OAC without recombinant-DNA transformation. Somatic genetic variations from MFD-1, tumour, normal oesophagus, and leucocytes were analysed with SNP6. WGS was performed in tumour and leucocytes. RNAseq was performed in MFD-1, and two classic OAC cell lines FLO1 and OE33. Transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) was performed in MFD-1, OE33, and non-neoplastic HET1A cells. Functional studies were performed. MFD-1 had a high SNP genotype concordance with matched germline/tumour. Parental tumour and MFD-1 carried four somatically acquired mutations in three recurrent mutated genes in OAC: <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>ABCB1</italic> and <italic>SEMA5A</italic>, not present in FLO-1 or OE33. MFD-1 displayed high expression of epithelial and glandular markers and a unique fingerprint of open chromatin. MFD-1 was tumorigenic in SCID mouse and proliferative and invasive in 3D cultures. The clinical utility of whole genome sequencing projects will be delivered using accurate model systems to develop molecular-phenotype therapeutics. We have described the first such system to arise from the oesophageal International Cancer Genome Consortium project.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Oesophageal cancer is hard to treat. Patients typically present with late-stage disease and respond poorly to conventional anti-cancer therapies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. In the case of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) rates of diagnosis and death run roughly parallel and there have been few improvements in outcomes in the last 30 years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>Recent efforts have been directed towards understanding the genetic landscape of OAC with a view to the identification of potentially targetable driver mutations. These studies have revealed the complexity of the genomic aberrations in OAC. The progression from Barrett&#x02019;s Oesophagus (BE), the only known precursor lesion from OAC, to invasive cancer is characterised by early chromosomal instability, probably due to p53 loss, often including genome doubling and a high frequency of chromothripsis events resulting in considerable genetic diversity followed by a later acquisition of driver mutations at sub-clonal frequencies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. By tracking the genomic evolution of OAC through neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) treatment and surgical resection, Murugaesu <italic>et al.</italic> have further revealed an association between high intratumour heterogeneity and poor response to NAC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.

BE is confined to humans and some primates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> but the logistics of performing research in large mammals and the anatomical interspecies differences in the oesophago-gastric junction between humans and rodents has limited representative animal modelling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Research on OAC is therefore dependant on a very small set of established cell lines, with little known about the genomic landscape of the tumour of origin or how representative the cell lines are of the genetic aberrations within the primary cancer. In a world-wide effort to validate the authenticity of 13 of the 14 OAC cell lines available in 2010, Boonstra <italic>et al.</italic> found that 3 frequently used lines originated from other tissues (lung cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Over 100 publications, three National Institute of Health grants and 11 US patents have been founded on these cell lines. These concerns are not confined to oesophageal cancer research. When the National Cancer Institute&#x02019;s Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) panel of 60 cancer cell lines derived from nine different tumour types was assessed for relevance in the study of clinical multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms it was found that the cell lines bore more resemblance to each other, regardless of the tissue of origin, than to the clinical samples they were supposed to model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.

Furthermore these genes are in regions with major structural abnormalities revealed by the CNV annotation. For example, the ABCB1 gene is in a region with a copy number state of four, whilst DOCK2, SEMA5A and TP53 loci are in regions subjected to loss of heterozygosity in a copy neutral state which translates to a duplication of the mutant allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genotyping of acquired mutations in MFD-1</title><p>To confirm the retention of these potentially important mutations in MFD-1 genomic DNA from the MFD-1 cell line and three derived clones obtained by single cell dilution ring cloning method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> was genotyped by Sanger sequencing at the 5 acquired mutations identified by WGS in the tumour.

For instance, verification of the OANC1 cell line was performed using immunohistochemistry for columnar (CK18), glandular (CK7) and intestinal (CDX2, SOX9, villin) markers in xenografts. In keeping with the genome wide approach used to document somatic mutations in the MFD-1 parent tumour, we performed RNA-seq of MFD-1, OE33 and FLO1 in culture to compare global gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>) (the authenticity of OE33 and FLO1 was first confirmed by short tandem repeat analysis; data not shown). MFD-1 was confirmed to express CK18 (KRT18), CK7 (KRT7), SOX9 and Villin in high abundance. CDX2 was also expressed but at lower levels when compared to OE33 and FLO1. FLO1 appeared to have relatively little expression of mRNA coding for cytokeratins, except CK18 (KRT18) compared to OE33 and MFD-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). This relative lack of expression was confirmed at the protein level using a pan-CK antibody in Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>).

This technique reports on the accessible regions of the genome, which are thought to represent areas of &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; chromatin. MFD-1 was compared directly with OE33 and not FLO1, as FLO1 had been shown to express few oesophageal related epithelial markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). First we identified all of the genes that were expressed to significantly higher levels in MFD-1 compared to OE33 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, top). Next we performed ATAC-seq on MFD-1 and OE33 cells and extracted the chromatin accessibility data (transposase cut counts) around the transcription start sites (TSS) of the genes showing elevated mRNA expression in MFD-1 compared to OE33 cells. The distribution of cut count densities showed that the chromatin accessibility around these genes was significantly higher in MFD1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, bottom), in keeping with the notion that ATAC-seq reports on &#x0201c;active chromatin&#x0201d;. Next, we investigated which regions are more open in cancer cells and whether these differed between MFD1 and OE33 OAC cell lines. We compared the ATAC-seq signals in MFD-1 and OE33 OAC cells to HET1A cells, which were derived from non-cancerous oesophageal tissue. We identified two classes of regions, which showed &#x0003e;3 fold changes in chromatin accessibility which were either higher (open in MFD-1) or lower (open in HET1A) in MFD-1 compared to HET1A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). While MFD1 cells showed clear differences to the HET1A cells, OE33 cells showed an intermediate pattern, demonstrating the heterogeneity between these OAC-derived cell types. For example, the <italic>KAT6A</italic> promoter is more open specifically in MFD-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, top) although at other loci, exemplified by the <italic>KRT8</italic> gene, the chromatin associated with the TSS is more open in both MFD-1 and OE33 cancer cell lines compared to HET1A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, bottom). These results are in keeping with the different gene expression profiles exhibited by these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). To gain potential insights into the regulatory processes that are altered in MFD-1 cells, we searched for over-represented transcription factor binding motifs within the regions of chromatin exhibiting differential accessibility. In regions of chromatin activated in MFD1 cells, motifs recognised by CTCF, NFY, Meis3 and Nrf2 were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>, top). In contrast, in chromatin regions showing reduced accessibility in MFD-1 cells and hence potentially lower activity, a different set of motifs were identified with AP-1 figuring most prominently among these (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>, bottom). Thus regulatory events controlled by different transcription factors are likely important determinants of the gene expression programmes in MFD-1 and HET1A cells. Interestingly, Gene Ontology analysis of the genes associated with the regulatory regions exhibiting differential accessibility (either increased or decreased) in MFD-1 cells showed enrichments for a large number of terms associated with cancer, including several epithelial cancers and GI tract neoplasms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of MFD-1 as a model OAC system</title><p>To enable the rational design and testing of new therapeutic options for OAC new model systems such as MFD-1 need not only to represent the parent tumour at a genetic level, but furthermore recapitulate tumour growth <italic>in vivo</italic> and respond to microenvironmental signals that are increasingly recognised as determinants of cancer outcome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.

Here, we have described the first fully-characterised system (MFD-1) to arise from the oesophageal International Cancer Genome Consortium project and confirmed that it represents an invasive tumour model containing somatic mutations in genes known to be important in OAC biology that correspond to mutations in the parent tumour. We also offer further characterisation of two commonly used historical lines, OE33 and FLO1.</p><p>The majority of cell lines currently used in OAC research are decades old and were not subjected to the kind of detailed genetic authentication that current technologies make possible. For example OE33 was derived from a stage IIa Barrett&#x02019;s cancer in 1996 and was subjected to karyotyping and cell surface antigen phenotyping, but no analysis of the primary tumour was presented, so the research community cannot know if the mutational burden of OE33 is representative of the tumour of origin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Subsequent short tandem repeat (STR) comparison of OE33 with the tumour of origin taken from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue has confirmed the authenticity of current OE33 cell stocks, but no genome wide analysis of mutational status has been performed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Similar problems exist for all historic OAC cell lines. More recently Clemons and colleagues developed the OANC1 cell line<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Authenticity was confirmed by STR comparing the cell line and tumour of origin at 16 loci and targeted deep sequencing of 48 cancer related genes was performed, but only in the cell line. OANC1 is a valuable new addition for OAC researchers, however it may represent a &#x0201c;non-classical&#x0201d; OAC as it was derived from a 44-year-old patient and more information about the tumour of origin is required.</p><p>By contrast, the strength of the current work is that we have used multiple genome-wide platforms (WGS, SNP arrays, ATAC-seq and RNA-seq) in the primary tumour and the MFD-1 cell line to confirm the tissue of origin and to accurately document somatic mutations that can be further tested as potential tractable targets. Our initial analysis has concentrated on a panel of genes commonly mutated in OAC constructed by synthesizing data from the WGS studies described by Dulak<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and Weaver<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, but this does not preclude future interrogation of the data as new targets are discovered.</p><p>We describe 5 mutations in 4 genes (<italic>ABCB1, DOCK2, SEMA5A</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic>) with relevance to OAC found in the parent tumour by WGS. Interestingly, the mutation observed in the lowest number of reads from the WGS data (<italic>DOCK2</italic>, mutant allele 10%) is homozygous wild-type in MFD-1, suggesting that the cell line is likely derived from the dominant clone in the tumour. The finding of a mutation in <italic>TP53</italic> that has been extensively documented in OAC suggests that MFD-1 is representative of primary OAC tumours. The mutations in <italic>ABCB1</italic> and <italic>SEMA5A</italic> described here have not been previously reported in oesophageal cancer. Importantly, the products of these genes are expressed in MFD-1 making the cell line a useful model to study the biological effects of these mutations. <italic>ABCB1</italic> encodes one of a family of ATP-binding cassette membrane transporters that efflux many chemically diverse compounds across the plasma membrane. These transporters are implicated in the development of multidrug resistance in cancer cells treated with chemotherapy (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). <italic>SEMA5A</italic> is a Semaphorin important in neuronal development that has recently been implicated in cancer development by influencing angiogenesis, tumour growth and metastasis (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). The coexistence of mutations in <italic>SEMA5A</italic> and <italic>ABCB1</italic> and the expression of both genes together in MFD-1 is of particular relevance because mutations in <italic>SEMA5A</italic> and <italic>ABCB1</italic> were the only mutations found to co-occur more often than would be expected by chance in a cohort of 112 cases (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0021) of OAC by Weaver et.al, but the reasons for this association remain unclear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In addition, the <italic>ABCB1</italic> mutations may indicate a potential mechanism for chemotherapy resistance that was observed in the primary tumour. None of these mutations were found in OE33 or FLO1 and neither of these lines express ABCB1 and SEMA5A together. MFD-1 was generated from a tumour in a patient who had been treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This leads to the potential that some of the mutations in MFD-1 may be chemotherapy induced, however the frequency of mutations observed in <italic>SEMA5A</italic> and <italic>ABCB1</italic> in previous studies of chemotherapy na&#x000ef;ve OAC point to these mutations being tumour specific.</p><p>MFD-1 is tumourigenic in SCID mice. This adds substantially to the utility of MFD-1 as a pre-clinical model of OAC and enables complex experiments that may include other constituents of the tumour microenvironment and/or manipulation of the host organism to mimic human treatments, such as novel CAF targeted agents or combination therapies. Similarly to the results reported by Clemons <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> we found that FLO1 and OE33 are poorly tumourigenic in SCID mice, this is somewhat surprising given that OE33 is one of the most commonly used OAC cell lines in xenograft experiments, however these findings reinforce the tumourigenic nature of MFD-1.</p><p>MFD-1 is derived from a single clone from the parent tumour and has to date appeared stable <italic>in vitro</italic>. This is advantageous as a molecular tool for genetic manipulation of candidate genes, but has the disadvantage of not offering insight into the heterogeneity of OAC. More complex models that recapitulate the complexity of OAC <italic>in vivo</italic>, such as primary xenografts or spheroids, will be required to address this issue. In addition, MFD-1 was derived from a particularly aggressive tumour and is the only cell line to be developed in our laboratory from several attempts (&#x0003e;10). This highlights the difficulty in performing research in OAC with the currently available pre-clinical models that may not be representative of tumours seen in the clinic. However, MFD-1 does contain mutations that have been observed in commonly mutated genes in OAC from large, contemporary cohorts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and this is reassuring that MFD-1 has relevance for future research.</p><p>In summary, we describe a pre-clinical model system developed from the oesophageal ICGC project. The availability of genome and transcriptome wide data from the parent tumour and cell line makes MFD-1 perhaps the best-catalogued OAC cell line in existence. Future OAC researchers will have confidence in the integrity of work performed with this cell line and will be able to easily confirm the significance of genetic changes in MFD-1 by reference to the parent tumour by examination of the WGS data. Research in OAC is held back due to a lack of hi-fidelity pre-clinical models and further efforts should be directed to bridge this technology gap.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Garcia, E. <italic>et al.</italic> Authentication and characterisation of a new oesophageal adenocarcinoma cell line: MFD-1. <italic>Sci.

CNV comparison between germ-line, tumour and cell line DNA confirms derivation of MFD-1 from the parent tumour. For example, the CNV plot of MFD-1 shows a loss of the Y chromosome and a duplication of the X chromosome that was also revealed by WGS in tumour DNA. The MFD-1 cell line retains CNV from germline DNA and tumour DNA. CNVs found in the normal genome, such as the gain with a scale of 4 on chromosome 2 at 95&#x02009;cM is readily observed in all of the genomes under analysis, acting as a fingerprint of identity. A homozygous deletion is observed in genome isolated from PMBC on chromosome 8 at 45&#x02009;cM, this mark is preserved across the genomes under analysis. On chromosome 16 at 20&#x02009;cM there is a gain CNV in the tumour tissue that is not found in the normal genome (PMBC or adjacent normal tissue DNA) but is readily observed in the MFD-1 cell line.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep32417-f1"/></fig><fig id="f2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Somatic acquired mutations in tumour and copy number in MFD-1</title><p>.

The ABCB1 has a copy number state of 4 compatible with amplification whilst the TP53, SEMA5A and DOCK2 shows loss of heterozygosity with a minor allele frequency of zero and duplication of a mutant allele which translate as a copy number of 2.
