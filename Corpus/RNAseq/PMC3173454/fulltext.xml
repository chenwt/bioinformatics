World cocoa production was estimated to be 3 million tons in 2010 and had an annual estimated average growth rate of 2.2% from 1998 to 2010 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldcocoafoundation.org/learn-about-cocoa/cocoa-facts-and-figures.html">http://www.worldcocoafoundation.org/learn-about-cocoa/cocoa-facts-and-figures.html</ext-link>). Cacao bean production is currently under threat from several sources including a rise in the incidence of fungal diseases including black pod, frosty pod, and witches' broom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In order to address these issues, multiple genetic and genomic efforts have been initiated in the last decade to identify genetic markers and genes that could be utilized to accelerate the release of robust <italic>T. cacao </italic>cultivars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These efforts have recently culminated in whole-genome shotgun assemblies of the genomes of two <italic>T. cacao </italic>cultivars: Criollo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and Matina 1-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These genome sequences will greatly assist <italic>T. cacao </italic>breeding efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] as well as contribute to our basic knowledge of tree and dicot biology through comparisons with a growing collection of genome sequences from trees and dicotyledonous plants.</p><p>There are primarily two approaches to sequence a genome: the BAC-by-BAC approach where libraries of clones with large inserts (e.g. BACs) are randomly sequenced and ordered relative to a minimum tile path (MTP) such as has been used to sequence the genomes of rice and maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], or the whole- genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing of genomic DNA, carried out without cloning, from genomic libraries with multiple insert sizes as implemented for Western poplar, grapevine, and sorghum genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the BAC-by-BAC approach, the MTP is obtained through the construction of a physical map via DNA fingerprinting: each BAC clone is digested with restriction enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and contigs are generated based upon shared DNA signatures. DNA signatures, comprised of a BAC's repertoire of fragment sizes, are determined by algorithms incorporated into software such as Fingerprinted Contigs (FPC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. FPC-based physical maps can be validated and improved by incorporating information obtained by hybridizing BAC clones with specific probes which can include probes that have been genetically mapped; the ordering of contigs on physical maps can thus be facilitated by using genetically derived mapping information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, BAC ends can be sequenced and serve as well-spaced markers for determining the accuracy of shotgun read assemblies. Using a strategy that integrates physical mapping and genetic mapping reduces the number of chimeric contigs and increases overall confidence in the final assembly (whether BAC-by-BAC or WGS). In any strategy, it is important to have a high quality reference assembly available for annotation and re-sequencing endeavours.</p><p>In this study, we describe the construction of a BAC-based integrated genetic-physical map of the genome of <italic>T. cacao </italic>cv. Matina 1-6 (estimated genome size = 374 Mbp). We also demonstrate the utility of the map by comparing it with other plant genomes. This map serves as an important reference for <italic>T. cacao </italic>genomes being sequenced; it can be used to establish the accuracy of those genome sequences prior to their use for applications such as SNP discovery, RNAseq, ChiPseq, and other techniques.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Physical map construction</title><p><italic>T. cacao </italic>genomic DNA was first cleaved into large fragments for cloning into vectors that could accommodate large inserts.

This base assembly resulted in 445 contigs harbouring 86,590 clones and 8,806 singletons. The DQer function of FPC was run to identify and break up contigs comprised of greater than 10% questionable clones (a sign of potential false joins).

It is important to note here that even though 96 COSII sequences were used as anchor points, only 59 of them were considered a homologous match in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>; the unmatched COSII sequences likely were flanked by non-homologous BES that did not meet the criteria set to be considered a syntenic region.

These results suggest that a BAC-based physical map with relatively evenly spaced BAC-end sequence anchor points can have immediate utility, depending on the amount of collinearity that exists between it and other genomes of interest, for interrogating agriculturally important genes and gene families and elucidating evolutionary origins prior to the availability of a high quality reference genome.</p></sec><sec><title>Alignment of the <italic>T. cacao </italic>cv.

Segments of Criollo chromosome 1 are duplicated on Matina 1-6 chromosomes 4, 8, and 9, for example. There are also segments of Criollo chromosome 4 and chromosome 5 that are duplicated on Matina 1-6 chromosome 10 and chromosomes 2 and 10, respectively. There are segments on Criollo chromosome 7 that are duplicated on Matina 1-6 chromosome 2. There is a segment of Criollo chromosome 8 that is duplicated on Matina 1-6 chromosome 1 and 2. An example of an inverted genomic segment resides near the telomere on Criollo chromosome 1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) and another on chromosome 5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Two potential sequence translocations are located on Criollo chromosomes 1, 5, and 7, reside on chromosomes 4, and 2 in Matina 1-6, respectively, but further support is necessary to confirm these due to low resolution in these areas. As an example of using a comparative approach to elucidate the structure of the Matina 1-6 genome, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> illustrates duplicated sequences from Matina 1-6 linkage group 10 that match sequences on Criollo chromosomes 4, 5, 8, and 10. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> shows a 2D comparison of Matina 1-6 chromosome 10 and Criollo chromosome 10.

Matina 1-6 (publicly available via <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cacaogenomedb.org">http://www.cacaogenomedb.org</ext-link>). This map is genetically anchored and enables cacao cultivar improvement through efforts such as positional cloning and region-specific analysis through sub-genome sequencing (companion paper). The map also aids in assembly of reference genomes, gap-filling, and independent assessment of assembly accuracy. And, in addition to protein-coding regions, BACs harbor genomic segments such as untranslated regions (UTR), promotor/regulatory elements, and introns that are important in functional genomics studies. A BAC-based physical map is thus not just an interim solution or a step in the process of sequencing a genome but a viable resource for utilizing a complete genome sequence once ascertained. Physical maps have been reported recently for <italic>Gossypium raimondii </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], <italic>Aquilegia formosa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], wheat chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], <italic>Brachypodium distachyon </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], <italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], <italic>Prunus persica </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and <italic>Glycine max </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Our <italic>T. cacao </italic>physical map assembly is highly ordered and tightly anchored to a moderately dense genetic recombination map, resides in 49 anchored contigs, and represents 82% of the <italic>T. cacao </italic>genome as computed by assuming a total genome size of 440 Mbp. However, estimated genome sizes for <italic>T. cacao </italic>range from 326 Mbp to 440 Mbp as determined using reassociation kinetics, flow cytometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], or genome assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Once the true size of the genome of <italic>T. cacao </italic>cv. Matina 1-6 is known, our physical map statistics may require adjustment. Availability of a high-density genetic recombination map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] was critical to our success in ordering and orienting BAC contigs and subsequently assigning contigs to chromosomes. We hybridized 230 genetically mapped SSR markers to the BAC contigs. Only 10 of these mapped markers hybridized to more than one contig signifying low copy-number, accuracy of the genetic map through additional evidence in the independent physical map build, and accuracy of the BAC assembly. Several of these markers flank QTL loci and therefore provide immediate templates for sequencing pools of high priority BACs to identify candidate genes for further investigation (companion paper). These mapped marker sequences also serve as sequence anchor points for use in comparative genome studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Using other genomes to assess and improve the <italic>T. cacao </italic>physical map and discover biological insights</title><p>Each newly available genome assembly, especially those from species distantly related to model organisms, improves the resolution of genome biology and evolution. Exploration of evolving genome architecture through synteny analysis upon the release of a new genome has become a standard experiment in which a new window into a clade is opened. New genome assemblies are, however, incomplete. Gaps, chimeric joins, and unresolvable repeat-induced compressions are unavoidable. One way to identify these errors and improve an assembly is to use related genomes as a guide.</p><p>Comparative genomics has evolved rapidly over the last decade. More genomes acting as reference sequences and the advancement of computational algorithms and visualization software has facilitated a turnkey approach. At the same time, aligning physical maps to sequenced genomes has become increasingly useful. For example, Fang et al. constructed a physical map for <italic>Aquilegia formosa</italic>, a species in a unique clade of basal eudicots that is being utilized as a new model system for studying floral variation, adaptive radiation, and evolution, and used a comparative approach to gain insight into the evolutionary lineages between <italic>A. formosa </italic>and <italic>V. vinifera </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Gu et al. created a physical map of <italic>Brachypodium distachyon </italic>and compared it to rice and wheat; they observed whole-genome duplication events in relation to rice that were caused by paleotetraploidy and a broad spectrum of other evolutionary events between the wheat and <italic>B. distachyon </italic>genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In short, a physical map serves as a distinct line of non-sequence-based evidence as well as an adjunct to a draft genome sequence during the biological discovery process.</p><p>In our comparative genome analysis, we used the SyMAP software to align the <italic>T. cacao </italic>cv. Matina 1-6 physical map to <italic>A. thaliana, V. vinifera</italic>, and <italic>P. trichocarpa </italic>genome sequences to gain insight into the structure and evolutionary history of <italic>T. cacao </italic>as well as to improve the physical map assembly. Not surprisingly, we found more syntenic blocks between the ten chromosomes of <italic>T. cacao </italic>and the 19 chromosomes of <italic>P. trichocarpa </italic>than between the ten chromosomes of <italic>T. cacao </italic>and the 19 chromosomes of grape. The main difference was in the length of the syntenic blocks; 100 syntenic blocks between <italic>T. cacao </italic>and <italic>P. trichocarpa </italic>were greater than 1 Mbp in length, whereas there were only 74 syntenic blocks longer than 1 Mbp between <italic>T. cacao </italic>and <italic>V. vinifera</italic>. The number of short (&#x0003c; 1 Mbp) collinear regions differed between these comparisons as well (27 in the <italic>V. vinifera </italic>comparison and 87 in the comparison with <italic>P. trichocarpa</italic>). Alignment to the <italic>A. thaliana </italic>genome produced the fewest syntenic blocks as expected since <italic>A. thaliana </italic>is the most evolutionarily distant species of the three used for our comparisons.</p><p>Structural and evolutionary implications can also be derived from comparisons between physical maps and available genome sequences. Collinear genomic segments and duplications can be quickly identified and provide insight into selective pressures and identify regions of the genome for targeted detailed analysis, all without a reference genome. As a result of our use of this approach, we concur that the chromosome fusion events recently reported by Argout et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] occurred in the ancient genome structure that led to the ten-chromosome structure we see today. Additionally, this comparative approach is sufficient to identify and confirm ancestral triplicated chromosomal groups recently reported for <italic>V. vinifera </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The utility of the cacao physical map with regard to cacao genome sequences</title><p>Even as more and more genomes are sequenced <italic>de novo </italic>and sequencing strategies evolve, <italic>i.e</italic>. there is less reliance on Sanger-based sequencing and second-generation sequencing platforms shift in chemistry and read-lengths, there are still inherent problems with assembly and resolution of distal regions of complex eukaryotic genomes. Mate-pair sequencing libraries with long insert sizes such as BACs and fosmids provide the necessary linking information and long-range contiguity for resolving repetitive DNA and scaffolding draft contigs. As noted previously, a physical map is an important adjunct to <italic>de novo </italic>genome sequencing projects and serves as an independent genome assembly that is composed of a very different data type. BAC fingerprints assembled (at a conservative cutoff) with an integrated dense array of paired-end sequences and genetic markers can be used to check for errors and to corroborate the accuracy of a draft genome assembled using a whole-genome sequencing (WGS) strategy. The physical map can also serve as a template for gap-filling and targeted sub-genome re-sequencing of BAC pools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>The physical map we present here can be of great utility in advancing draft genome sequences of <italic>Theobroma cacao </italic>into high quality reference genomes. For example, comparison of the cv. Matina 1-6 physical map assemblies to the cv. Criollo pseudomolecules revealed a high degree of collinear genomic segments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). However, there are still many regions of structural difference between these two draft sequences such as sequence inversions and translocations. There are also regions of discontiguous alignments between the physical map and draft sequence. We speculate that these differences may be the result of underlying biological differences between cultivars, misassemblies in either the Matina 1-6 physical map or the Criollo whole-genome draft assembly, gaps resulting from unresolved repetitive DNA, or a lack of dense BES in particular contigs in the physical map. For any of these possibilities, the Matina 1-6 physical map can serve as a template for confirming/resolving assembly differences and provide resolution in regions of low quality or underrepresentation in the draft genome assemblies through targeted PCR or sub-genome sequencing through BAC pools.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The three BAC libraries, BAC-end sequences, and the genetically integrated physical map for <italic>T. cacao </italic>cv.

The results obtained from the comparative analyses with <italic>A. thaliana, V. vinifera</italic>, and <italic>P. trichocarpa </italic>suggest that genome assemblies from distantly related species can be used to gain insights into genome structure and evolutionary history as well as conserved functional genomic sites and to improve a physical map assembly. These resources will also serve as the templates for refinement of <italic>T. cacao </italic>genome sequences through gap-filling, targeted re-sequencing, and resolution of repetitive DNA arrays through long-range contiguity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>BAC library construction</title><p>The Matina 1-6 tree clones used for DNA isolation were kept at greenhouse conditions and dark-treated for 12 hours prior to leaf harvesting. Approximately 100 g of young, F2 stage expanding leaf tissue with the mid-vein removed were harvested, washed two times with autoclaved ddH<sub>2</sub>0 and ground in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle to a coarse powder. Nuclei were prepared following previously published methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] with the following modifications: addition of 1% (w/v) soluble PVP-40 (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1% (w/v) L-ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.13% (w/v) sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.4% beta-mercaptoethanol to nuclei isolation buffer (NIB) right before use. Purified nuclei were concentrated and embedded in agarose plugs. Protein digestion and plug washing was carried out exactly as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To prepare high molecular weight genomic DNA fragments, plugs were macerated with a single-edge razor blade and then partially digested (separately) with, <italic>Hin</italic>dIII, <italic>Eco</italic>RI, or <italic>Mbo</italic>I using standard procedures. DNA size selection, electro-elution, and ligation were carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The BAC libraries were assigned a unique CUGI identifier according the enzyme used for partial digestion: TCC_Ba was made using <italic>Hin</italic>dIII, TCC_Bb with <italic>Mbo</italic>I, and TCC_Bc with <italic>Eco</italic>RI. Each BAC library was characterized for insert distribution by randomly selecting 384 clones and subjecting them to miniprep, digestion with Not-I (New England Biolabs), and resolution by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>HICF BAC fingerprinting</title><p>384-well plates containing BACs were decondensed to 96-well format robotically with the Q-bot (Genetix, United Kingdom). Two pins were removed from the sub-plate inoculators to allow for manual insertion of control clones in the E07 and H12 positions; controls were used to assess data uniformity. DNA was isolated from a total of 108,288 clones from TCC_Ba, TCC_Bb, and TCC_Bc, the three BAC libraries, by following standard alkaline lysis miniprep methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], and then used as substrates for HICF carried out following previously published methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] with the following modifications. Approximately 0.5 ug of BAC DNA was digested with 2.0 units of <italic>Hin</italic>dIII, <italic>Bam</italic>HI, <italic>Xba</italic>I, <italic>Xho</italic>I, and <italic>Hae</italic>III at 37C for 2 hours. The DNA was treated with 0.25 U of label from the SNaP-shot kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) at 65 C for 1 hour and then precipitated with ethanol. The labelled DNA was reconstituted in 9 ul of Hi-Di formamide (Applied Biosystems) and 0.05 ul of LIZ600 (Applied Biosystems). BAC fingerprints were sized on an ABI3730 (Applied Biosystems) using a 36 cm array and POP7 (Applied Biosystems). The fingerprint profiles were processed using GeneMapper 3.7 (Applied Biosystems) for sizing quality and FPMiner (Bioinforsoft, Oregon) for digitized fingerprint assignment. For improved data quality, vector bands, clones without inserts, and restriction profiles with less than 20 or more than 200 bands were removed and the remaining profiles were uploaded to FPC v8.5.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] for fingerprint contig assembly.</p></sec><sec><title>Physical map assembly</title><p>The initial build was done at a Sulston score cut-off of 1 e<sup>-80 </sup>and a tolerance of 3. To reduce false joins, the DQer function of FPC was used to break down all contigs comprised of more than 10% questionable (Q) clones. Further physical map refinement was performed using the Ends-to-Ends and Singles-to-Ends functions of FPC with stepwise reductions of the Sulston score cutoff values to a final score of 1 e<sup>-50</sup>. Additional fingerprint contig merges were made with lower Ends-to-Ends overlap when there was additional agreement with the anchored genetic map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Contigs merged in this fashion used Sulston score cutoffs as low as 1 e<sup>-25</sup>. High quality marker sequence was processed through a CUGI pipeline consisting of Repeat Masker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] with the RepBase database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], cross_match [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], and Tandem Repeat Finder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The remaining sequence was used for overgo design using the overgomaker (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.wustl.edu/software/overgo_maker">http://genome.wustl.edu/software/overgo_maker</ext-link>) software. Once a version of the whole-genome draft sequence of Matina 1-6 became available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], potentially repetitive overgo sequences were aligned using BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] with cutoff of at least 85% percent identity. Any overgo sequence with more than 8 hits to the putative assembly was removed from the experiment, the repetitive sequence was masked, and a new overgo was selected from the original sequence. Manual filter hit-calling and deconvolution of the multi-dimensional pool hybridization data was accomplished using HybDecon, open source software available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.clemson.edu/software/hybdecon">http://www.genome.clemson.edu/software/hybdecon</ext-link>. The filter hit-calling functionality is an improved version of Hybsweeper, a web-based Java tool first reported by Lazo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In addition, a Perl-based deconvolution script, written entirely at CUGI, accompanies the tool and is launched from within the graphical interface once manual calling of positive hits is complete. The source code, a test dataset, and installation manual are all available online. A user's manual is readily available with the click of the Help button from within the software. Additionally an online experimental design tool is available (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.clemson.edu/software/hybdecon/exp_setup">http://www.genome.clemson.edu/software/hybdecon/exp_setup</ext-link>) to assist with setup for multi-dimensional pooling hybridization.</p></sec><sec><title>Dense MTP selection and BAC-end sequencing</title><p>We selected a set of BACs from the physical map to provide sequenced BAC-ends at least every 8 kb along the genomic sequence. However, because the unit of measure in an FPC physical map is a Consensus Band (CB) unit, or restriction fragment unit, which does not correlate with distance in base pairs, we estimated the number of CB units that would approximate a distance of 20 kb using the following formula:</p><p><disp-formula><mml:math id="M1" name="1471-2164-12-413-i1" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo class="MathClass-rel">=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.3em" class="thinspace"/><mml:mfenced open="/"><mml:mrow/></mml:mfenced><mml:mspace width="0.3em" class="thinspace"/><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where m is median number of CB units per BAC in the physical map, i is the average BAC insert size, k is the desired size in base pairs, and n is the number of CB units that estimates a distance of 20 kb. An in-house Perl script was created to iterate through the contigs of the physical map and select BACs which were closest to being 7 CB units apart. A list of BAC-ends that existed prior to this analysis was provided as input to the script and these BACs were used to avoid selection of a new BAC in regions where BAC-ends already existed. BACs were selected first by the CB location of their left-ends, but new BACs were not selected in regions where right-ends from a previous selection existed.</p></sec><sec><title>Pseudomolecule construction and genome size estimation</title><p>Physical map coordinates for markers (CB position, contig ID) were obtained directly from FPC by right-clicking 'file' and selecting 'save ordered marker list'. Contig lengths and BAC positions were manually parsed from FPC using the following procedure: A) 'cat &#x0003c; fpc_filename &#x0003e; | grep 'Map' | sed s/Map//| sed s/Ends//| sed s/ctg//| cut -d "O" -f1 | cut -d "." -f1 &#x0003e; BacsInContigs.txt'; B) BacsInContigs.txt was dropped into Excel and split at space delimiters and parsed; C) BAC start and stop positions in a contig and total BAC counts per contig was determined using a 'find duplicates' query in Access 2010 (Microsoft). Contigs that contained a genetic marker were considered anchored and assigned to a linkage group based upon that marker. Marker order within a contig was determined based upon physical position and not genetic position. Ordered and anchored contigs were then assigned physical map positions. Anchored contigs were sorted according to genetic position and pseudomolecules were constructed by adding an arbitrary gap of 0.25 Mbp between anchored contigs. Finally, a CMAP file was constructed for 10 anchored linkage group maps (Pseudo1-Pseudo10) with the following four feature types: contig, gap, marker, and STS. Genome size was estimated as the sum of anchored contigs (+ gaps) and unanchored contigs.</p></sec><sec><title>Synteny mapping and comparative genomics</title><p>Synteny mapping was carried out using the Symap software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].
