The identification of molecular markers linked to traits of interest is a way to expedite the breeding process. In the present study, we aimed to identify genes whose steady-state transcript abundance was associated with inheritance of specific traits segregating in an apple (<italic>Malus</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>domestica</italic>) rootstock F<sub>1</sub> breeding population, including resistance to powdery mildew (<italic>Podosphaera leucotricha</italic>) disease and woolly apple aphid (<italic>Eriosoma lanigerum</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Transcription profiling was performed for 48 individual F<sub>1</sub> apple trees from a cross of two highly heterozygous parents, using RNA isolated from healthy, actively-growing shoot tips and a custom apple DNA oligonucleotide microarray representing 26,000 unique transcripts. Genome-wide expression profiles were not clear indicators of powdery mildew or woolly apple aphid resistance phenotype. However, standard differential gene expression analysis between phenotypic groups of trees revealed relatively small sets of genes with trait-associated expression levels. For example, thirty genes were identified that were differentially expressed between trees resistant and susceptible to powdery mildew. Interestingly, the genes encoding twenty-four of these transcripts were physically clustered on chromosome 12. Similarly, seven genes were identified that were differentially expressed between trees resistant and susceptible to woolly apple aphid, and the genes encoding five of these transcripts were also clustered, this time on chromosome 17. In each case, the gene clusters were in the vicinity of previously identified major quantitative trait loci for the corresponding trait. Similar results were obtained for a series of molecular traits. Several of the differentially expressed genes were used to develop DNA polymorphism markers linked to powdery mildew disease and woolly apple aphid resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Gene expression profiling and trait-associated transcript analysis using an apple F<sub>1</sub> population readily identified genes physically linked to powdery mildew disease resistance and woolly apple aphid resistance loci. This result was especially useful in apple, where extreme levels of heterozygosity make the development of reliable DNA markers quite difficult. The results suggest that this approach could prove effective in crops with complicated genetics, or for which few genomic information resources are available.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Powdery mildew disease</kwd><kwd>Woolly apple aphid</kwd><kwd>Gene expression marker</kwd><kwd>DNA microarray</kwd><kwd>Genetic marker development</kwd><kwd>Quantitative PCR</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The advent of large-scale transcription profiling technologies, such as DNA microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and RNAseq technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], has allowed the analysis of gene expression patterns at the genome level. DNA microarrays have been used for genetic mapping studies based on polymorphisms between parental genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. When used to analyze genetically segregating populations, DNA microarrays have facilitated the discovery of gene expression markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Gene expression markers can be defined as transcripts encoded by genes whose relative messenger RNA expression level is inherited and segregates as a phenotypic trait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Apple tree breeding is a slow and difficult process for reasons that include long juvenility periods, large size of mature plants, inbreeding depression, reproductive self-incompatibility, and complex phenotypes related to grafted trees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The use of molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding and selection has the potential to expedite this process by increasing the percentage of desired genotypes and associated phenotypes early on in the breeding pipeline and assisting breeders in combining desirable traits from different parents into breeding progenies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the present study, our objective was to identify genes whose steady-state expression level in healthy, uninfected apple shoot tips correlated with the inheritance of agriculturally important traits in an apple rootstock breeding population. These transcripts would have the potential to be used as molecular markers by themselves, or could be used to develop DNA polymorphism markers for marker-assisted selection and gene mapping in the population.</p><p>Genetics in apple is typically done in the F<sub>1</sub> generation due to the self-incompatibility of apple [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The apple rootstock population used for this study was an F<sub>1</sub> population from a cross of two highly heterozygous rootstock parents, &#x02018;Ottawa 3&#x02019; (O3) and &#x02018;Robusta 5&#x02019; (R5). This is a phenotypically diverse and well-characterized population that is segregating for numerous traits of interest to apple growers. The segregating traits include resistance to biotic stresses such as fire blight (<italic>Erwinia amylovora</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]) and powdery mildew (PM, <italic>Podosphaera leucotricha</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]) diseases and resistance to the woolly apple aphid (WAA; <italic>Eriosoma lanigerum</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]) pest.</p><p>We applied DNA microarray transcription profiling to 48 individual F<sub>1</sub> trees from the O3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;R5 cross and identified transcripts with expression levels associated with PM disease and WAA pest resistance phenotypes. When the genes encoding these transcripts were mapped to the apple genome, they were found to be physically clustered. This is similar to the phenomenon described for single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene expression markers in <italic>Brassica napus</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The utility of using physically clustered, differentially expressed genes for DNA marker development will be discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Microarrays</title><p>RNA was isolated from healthy, uninfected, uninfested shoot tips collected from 48 individual F<sub>1</sub> trees from the O3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;R5 cross population growing in a rootstock production stool bed in Geneva, NY.

In contrast, the differential gene expression analysis based on phenotypic groups of F<sub>1</sub> individuals yielded relatively small numbers of genes that were differentially expressed between the phenotypic groups, and these differentially expressed genes displayed a remarkable degree of physical clustering on the apple genome. The clustered genes were typically in the physical vicinity of the major locus controlling the trait, in the case of PM and WAA resistance, or in the vicinity of the gene expression marker used as the molecular trait. Clusters at locations unlinked to their corresponding trait of interest (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>f; and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1) might represent the locations of other QTLs related to the phenotype. All of the phenotypes examined in this study were controlled by single, major, dominant QTL, which allowed detection of linkage using only 48&#x000a0;F<sub>1</sub> individuals. Analysis of larger numbers of individuals would certainly be required in order to analyze multi-locus traits effectively.</p><p>The clustered differentially expressed genes are not necessarily involved in controlling their associated phenotype. For example, the differentially expressed genes associated with PM resistance did not show any obvious functional patterns or similarities (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). It is also important to note here that differentially expressed genes we examined here were not selected based on their induced expression during pathogen or insect interaction. Rather, the differentially expressed genes represented transcripts whose steady-state expression levels in healthy tissue were associated with PM or WAA resistance phenotype status. It is possible that examining differential gene expression using infected or infested samples might mask the clustering due to the large numbers of genes being up- and down-regulated in response to the stress.</p><p>The clustering pattern of differentially expressed genes is consistent with the relative expression levels of these genes being inherited from a parent. This is different from genome neighborhood effects, where groups of linked genes are typically up- or down-regulated together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Just as DNA polymorphism markers can be linked to a trait locus, expression patterns of some of the nearby genes are also linked. By grouping trees according to an inherited trait of interest, one might expect that the differentially expressed genes would be identified simply due to their decreased expression variation within a particular pool compared to non-correlating genes at loci unlinked to the trait of interest. However, it is remarkable that the differential expression patterns between the phenotypic groups included so few genes, and that so many of these were physically clustered. This suggests that heritable differences in gene relative expression were predominantly detected by the analysis, rather than genes whose expression levels might contribute to or be necessary for the development of the phenotype. Such genes would be expected to be scattered randomly across the genome. Our results are similar to those seen in <italic>Brassica napus</italic> using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and gene expression markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, the present study used a segregating apple tree F<sub>1</sub> population, while the other study used a collection of accessions.</p><p>Validation of the expression patterns using qPCR indicated that most of the genes indeed had patterns of expression consistent with the array data. The congruence of DNA microarray and qPCR data for selected differentially expressed genes and gene expression markers provided strong validation for the DNA microarray data. qPCR validation was successful using a different set of individuals from the same cross in a different environment and year from those used for the microarray, indicating that the differentially expressed genes had relative expression levels consistent across different growing conditions and years and between different groups of individuals from the O3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;R5 F<sub>1</sub> population. The development of PCR based molecular markers associated with several of the differentially expressed sequences was in many cases successful because sequence mutations such as large INDELs and microsatellite variation was discovered within or nearby the target genes. While several methods are available to detect polymorphisms in marker assisted breeding, markers based on the polymerase chain reaction are still the most accessible and least expensive for small scale breeding programs. The combination of expression analysis for target identification and sequence based marker development proved a good strategy as the PCR markers developed in this study have been routinely proven useful in apple rootstock breeding program in Geneva, NY. As RNAseq methods become more refined, it may be possible to find differentially expressed genes associated with traits of interest and at the same time leverage polymorphisms contained in the expressed sequences for haplotype specific breeding marker development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown in a segregating population from the cross of a highly heterozygous plant that gene expression analysis can result in identification of differentially expressed genes that are physically linked to one another. Gene expression heritability as a method to detect genes physically linked to trait loci of interest could be useful in crops for which few genetic and genomic information resources are available. Even in the absence of a genetic map, molecular markers linked to traits of interest could be developed using transcriptome profiles of segregating populations, since a substantial proportion of the differentially expressed genes would be expected to cluster in the vicinity of the trait of interest. While there may be no causal link between the differentially expressed genes and their associated traits, they do provide an excellent starting point for development of DNA markers linked to segregating traits of interest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials</title><p>The trees used for the DNA microarray analysis were from a segregating F<sub>1</sub> population from an O3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;R5 cross and were grown in an orchard in Geneva, NY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

The samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C for later RNA isolation.</p><p>For the qPCR analyses, shoot tip samples were collected in late spring of 2013 from a separate group of 46 individuals belonging to the same O3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;R5 population from clonally propagated material in a replicate orchard in Geneva, NY. Shoot tips from the population parents (O3 and R5) were collected from trees at the apple collection of the USDA ARS Plant Genetic Resources Unit in Geneva, NY.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA isolation and microarray analysis</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from whole apple shoot tips as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The microarray data used in the present study were generated during a previously-reported study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and subjected to a new analysis. The contig sequences used for array probe development are accessible at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The array used was a second-generation array in a 12-plex array format containing 135,000 probes per plex, representing 26,017 transcripts, enabling us to query a relatively large number of samples. Each transcript was queried by 4&#x02013;5 probes of 60&#x02013;70 bases in length. The array included the best-performing probes from the first-generation array and was enriched for differentially-expressed genes based on analyses of the first-generation array [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The genes predicted to encode the 26,017 transcripts probed by the array represented were evenly and randomly physically distributed across the apple tree genome. The expression levels for each individual F<sub>1</sub> tree were analyzed using a single array only; however, analyses were conducted using pooled data from trees with similar phenotypes, which represented pseudo-replicates in this context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>While the parents of the breeding population were different from the varieties used to design the DNA microarray, this did not interfere with probe performance or account for patterns. Any nucleotide polymorphisms between the probes and the samples, when present, did not affect hybridization, as the other probes for the same transcripts, which had no polymorphisms, gave similar intensity values (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S4). In addition, mismatches between probes and samples did not correlate with variation in between probe signals (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S4). For example, the probes for APPLE0FR00039157 had 1 or 5 mismatches to their target per probe, yet they produced data with similar signal intensity and standard deviations to the APPLE0FR00031686 probe set, which had no mismatches to their target (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S4).</p></sec><sec><title>Differential gene expression analysis</title><p>The gene expression data from the DNA microarray hybridization experiments were previously normalized using R software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To identify differentially expressed genes based on PM resistance phenotype, for example, the trees were divided into two groups, one group containing the PM-resistant trees, and the other group containing the PM-susceptible trees. The mean of the log<sub>2</sub> (expression) value for each transcript was then calculated separately in each phenotypic group, and then the M-value (log<sub>2</sub> fold difference in expression) for each transcript was computed as the difference in the mean log<sub>2</sub> (expression) value for each transcript between the two groups of trees. Empirical Bayes ANOVA analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] was performed using the LIMMA (Linear Models for Microarray Data) package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] as part of the R Bioconductor suite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. P-values (false positive rate) from this analysis were then converted to q-values (false discovery rate) using the methodology of Storey and Tibshirani [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] as implemented in the Bioconductor q-value routine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Differentially expressed transcripts were identified as transcripts with statistically different levels of expression between the phenotypic groups (q-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), regardless of the magnitude of the difference (M-value). Differentially expressed genes for WAA and the several GEM traits were identified using the same approach, using phenotypic groups defined by each trait.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of gene expression markers</title><p>The first step was to calculate the mean of the log<sub>2</sub> (expression) value for each transcript in the entire F<sub>1</sub> population. Next, the divergence in expression for each individual tree compared to the average was determined for each transcript. GEMs were identified as transcripts that could divide the trees into groups of roughly equal size based on having at least a 1.5-fold difference in expression levels between the groups (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S1).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression pattern validation by qPCR</title><p>Shoot tip samples were processed fresh, immediately after collection, using the ZR Plant RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine CA, USA) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, with the addition of DNAse I (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) to the RNA wash buffer in the kit as recommended in the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. cDNA synthesis was performed using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. PCR primers for selected differentially expressed genes and gene expression markers were optimized using parental genomic DNA with Annealing Temperature Gradient PCR (ATG-PCR; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S5). qPCR was performed in 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l reactions using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master reaction mix (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and a LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche) A Basic Relative Quantification workflow was used that included fluorescence measurement at each PCR extension step and a final melting step measuring fluorescence from 95-55&#x000b0;C for Melt Curve Genotyping. An actin gene (Genbank accession number EB 136338, primers: 5&#x02032;-GGCTGGATTTGCTGGTGATG-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-TGCTCACTATGCCGTGCTCA-3&#x02032;) was used as the reference for Relative Quantification Analysis (RQA). The Crossing Point (Cp) values and ratios between target and references were calculated using the LC480 software and algorithms (Roche). Melt curves were analyzed for non-specific amplification peaks (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S2). Amplicons were resolved on 1.5% ethidium bromide (EtBr) stained agarose gels and visualized with an AlphaImager HP gel documentation system (ProteinSimple, Santa Clara, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA marker development</title><p>The sequence of gene APPLE0FR00068101, whose expression was associated with WAA resistance, was compared to the &#x02018;Golden Delicious&#x02019; apple genome hosted by the Genome Database for Rosaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)&#x02019;s BLASTN program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] to identify four contigs (MDC015568.236, MDC013761.427, MDC015568.269, MDC000748.724) containing similar sequences (e-values between 1E-97 to 2E-89). All four contigs were located on apple chromosome 17 within a 74&#x000a0;kb interval (genome base pair positions 1,405,743-1,479,871; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S5). Genomic sequences for parents O3 and R5 had been obtained by Next-Gen Illumina Hi-Seq paired end sequencing. Geneious bioinformatic software (Biomatters, San Francisco, CA, USA) was used to construct a local alignment of next-gen sequences to the <italic>Malus</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>domestica</italic> contig containing the complete predicted target gene sequence (MDP). Contig MDC015568.236 contained sequences most similar to the R5 next-gen sequences, and was therefore chosen for further analysis. Unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and haplotypes were identified for the R5 (WAA-resistant) parent. Several 18&#x02013;21&#x000a0;bp PCR primers were designed to match unique SNP haplotypes at the 3&#x02032; end, and primer pairs were tested with parental DNAs using annealing temperature gradient PCR (45&#x000b0;C to 65&#x000b0;C) to verify genotype specificity, stability and reproducibility of amplicons. Amplicons were resolved on 2% EtBr-stained agarose gels and visualized with an AlphaImager HP gel documentation system (ProteinSimple). In addition, some primers were designed flanking microsatellite SSRs. Genotype-specific amplicons were then tested on segregating individuals in the O3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;R5 population and a diversity panel of apple rootstocks to verify genetic inheritance, linkage to other markers, and haplotype uniqueness.</p></sec><sec><title>Availability of supporting data</title><p>Microarray data are available through the GEO website using accession number GSE43268.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANOVA: Analysis of variance; ATG-PCR: Annealing temperature gradient PCR; BLAST: Basic local alignment search tool; bp: Base pairs of DNA; cDNA: Complementary DNA; DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid; EtBr: Ethidium bromide; kb: Kilobase pairs; O3: &#x02018;Ottawa 3&#x02019;; PCR: Polymerase chain reaction; PM: Powdery mildew; qPCR: Quantitative PCR; QTL: Quantitative trait locus; R5: &#x02018;Robusta 5&#x02019;; RNA: Ribonucleic acid; RNAseq: RNA sequencing; SNP: Single nucleotide polymorphism; SSR: Simple sequence repeats; USDA: United States Department of Agriculture; WAA: Woolly apple aphid.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>PJJ performed the microarray experiments and analyzed the results; GF performed phenotypic characterizations of apple trees and performed the qPCR validation of selected transcripts and developed the DNA markers based on the differentially expressed genes; NA provided statistical advice and assisted with data analysis; CP performed microarray hybridizations and provided advice for experiment design and data interpretation; TWM initiated, developed, and supervised the project; all authors contributed to the writing of the manuscript and have approved the manuscript.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title>Additional file 1: Table S1</title><p>Transcripts identified as having expression patterns associated with powdery mildew resistance, woolly apple aphid resistance, and the gene expression marker traits analyzed in a segregating F<sub>1</sub> population from an &#x02018;Ottawa3&#x02019; &#x000d7; &#x02018;Robusta 5&#x02019; cross. <bold>Table S2.</bold> Correlation between Microarray Gene Expression Values for WAA resistance differentially expressed genes APPLE0FR00068101, and associated features APPLE00R00024612, APPLE0F000011491, APPLE0F000050102. <bold>Table S3.</bold> Correlation between Relative Gene Expression values (Target Gene/Actin Reference Gene) in qPCR Basic Relative Quantification outputs for the following targets: APPLE24612, APPLE50102, APPLE11491 and WAA resistance differentially expressed gene APPLE68101. <bold>Table S4.</bold> Individual probe data and SNP counts for transcripts in the region 29.0 to 30.2&#x000a0;Mb on Chromosome 12. <bold>Table S5.</bold> qPCR conditions and primers for gene expression validation.</p></caption><media xlink:href="1471-2164-15-261-S1.XLSX"><caption><p>Click here for file</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S2"><caption><title>Additional file 2: Figure S1</title><p>Example gene expression marker (GEM) trait. <bold>Figure S2.</bold>&#x02009;Relative quantification results for qPCR of differentially expressed gene APPLE0FR00048809 (associated with PM resistance) relative to actin. <bold>Figure S3.</bold>&#x02009;Visualization of qPCR amplicons of gene APPLE0F000001977, showing clear segregation (presence/absence) of amplified target cDNA in selected progeny. <bold>Figure S4.</bold>&#x02009;Annealing temperature gradient amplification (65&#x000b0;C - 45&#x000b0;C) of differentially expressed gene APPLE0FR00068101 derived markers on parental DNAs. <bold>Figure S5.</bold>&#x02009;Alignment of microarray feature APPLE0FR00068101 to Chromosome 17 of the apple genome.</p></caption><media xlink:href="1471-2164-15-261-S2.PDF"><caption><p>Click here for file</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This work was supported by National Science Foundation Plant Genome Research Program Grant DBI-0420394 to T.W.M., Robert M.
