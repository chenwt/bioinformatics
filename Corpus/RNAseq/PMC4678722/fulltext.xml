We evaluated GGS in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HGSC data across 144 combinations of DM size, redundancy (1&#x02013;3), and |r<sub>P</sub>| (0.60, 0.65, 0.70). Across the parameter sweep, GGS allows on average 9 times more gene expression information to be captured compared to the DM set alone. GGS successfully augments prognostic HGSC gene sets; the addition of 20 GGS selected genes more than doubles the number of genes whose expression is predictable. Moreover, the expression prediction is highly accurate. After training regression models for the predictable gene set using 2/3 of the TCGA data, the average accuracy (ranked correlation of true and predicted values) in the 1/3 testing partition and four independent populations is above 0.65 and approaches 0.8 for conservative parameter sets. We observe similar accuracies in the TCGA HGSC RNA-sequencing data. Specifically, the prediction accuracy increases with increasing redundancy and increasing |r<sub>P</sub>|.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>GGS-selected genes, which maximize expression information about unmeasured genes, can be combined with candidate gene sets as a cost effective way to increase the amount of gene expression information obtained in large studies.

The large numbers of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues which are routinely collected for clinical and diagnostic purposes represent an important resource for genomic studies. While it is possible to perform whole genome expression assays and sequencing in FFPE samples, it is currently cost-prohibitive to do so in the very large collections of FFPE samples that are available. Most FFPE-based research to date has focused on assaying a subset of genes selected based on a current hypothesis of interest (e.g., genes associated with prognosis) or a reduced gene set classifier of molecular subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The number of genes included is determined both by scientific rationale and cost, and by definition, represent only a subset of gene expression information. We sought to develop a method to maximize the amount of gene expression information obtained from assayed samples by inferring the expression levels of unmeasured genes.</p><p>Conceptually, this problem is similar to genotype imputation. Loci physically located near each other on a chromosome tend to be inherited together, and sets of highly associated loci can be identified using linkage disequilibrium (LD) which is a measure of co-occurrence of alleles. Representative or &#x02018;tag&#x02019; single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from these sets can be selected to be assayed and the remaining values inferred based on LD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In an analogous manner, we propose to use the organism-, disease-, and tissue-specific gene expression correlation structure to identify genes which indirectly provide information about the expression of other genes in that tissue. The correlation of gene expression values is well studied and has been used to help inform molecular pathway definitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], disease subtype discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and clinical prognosis and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Just as it is important to select tag SNPs based on allele correlations in a population similar to the population studied, it is also important to use gene expression patterns from the specific tissue of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The robustness of the co-expression relationships directly affects the inference of expression of unmeasured genes; for this reason, our method is valid for stable systems of co-expression, e.g., for design of large-scale targeted assays following initial genome-wide measurements, not dynamic systems such as differentiation where the co-expression relationships are expected to change. We focus on high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) for the development and evaluation of our algorithm, but also apply our method to a breast cancer dataset. The wealth of publicly available expression data allows our method to be used for studies of a wide variety of different organisms, tissues, model systems, and disease types. While our intention is to identify genes that broadly capture gene expression information for many genes, recent work suggests that these genes may also be enriched for disease drivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Herein, we present our method of gene selection that can be combined with candidate gene sets as a cost-effective way to increase the amount of gene expression information obtained in large studies where using a genome-wide measurement platform is not feasible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our greedy geneset selection (GGS) algorithm uses pairwise gene expression correlation (Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient: r<sub>P</sub>) to identify sets of correlated genes, and within those sets selects genes to directly measure and genes to attempt to infer using the directly measured genes. We applied this algorithm to the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HGSC data (Affymetrix HGU133a; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), and compared the ability of GGS to maximize the number of inferred genes given a user defined size of directly measured (DM) genes to that of a ranked-degree gene selection method. We tested the ability to infer unmeasured expression by constructing regression models for unmeasured genes and evaluating the accuracy of these predictions in independent studies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Gene selection <bold>a</bold> and expression prediction <bold>b</bold> workflows. A.1) The workflow starts with the TCGA HGSC Affymetrix gene expression data which is filtered to remove no/low expressed genes. A.2) A symmetrical gene-by-gene correlation matrix is created by calculating pairwise Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients (r<sub>P</sub>). A.3) A user-determined threshold is applied to the absolute value of the Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients (|r<sub>P</sub>|) in order to generate a binary adjacency matrix. Here, black indicates no correlation beyond the threshold between two genes, and white indicates the existence of such a correlation. A.4) A greedy geneset selection algorithm iteratively builds a set of genes to directly measure (DM set; red) and a set of genes that are predictable using the DM set (predictable set; blue). The predictable set is defined as those eligible but unmeasured genes that are strongly correlated to at least <italic>n</italic> DM genes where <italic>n</italic> is the redundancy chosen. B.1) The expression prediction workflow starts with splitting the TCGA HGSC data into training and testing partitions. The training partition is used to build a regression model for each gene in the predictable set. Only the genes in the DM set that are correlated to the specific predictable gene above the |r<sub>P</sub>| threshold are used as predictors. If there are multiple predictors, a forest of regression is trained. Otherwise, a polynomial regression of degree 2 is trained. B.2) The regression models are then used in the testing partition of the TCGA HGSC data to predict expression. The true and predicted values are compared using the Spearman rank correlation (r<sub>S</sub>). B.3) The accuracy of the regression models are assessed across populations and platforms using four independent HGSC datasets. In each dataset, the regression models are used to predict expression and r<sub>S</sub> is calculated</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2015_2250_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterization of eligible genes</title><p>We removed genes that did not appear to be expressed (90th quantile thresholds below 5), leaving 8,265 genes for analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). We calculated pairwise correlations between these genes to identify those for which an expression level could be predicted. The minimum number of genes to which an eligible gene must be correlated in order for it to be eligible was set at 1, 2, or 3, for three different correlation thresholds (|r<sub>P</sub>|; absolute value of the Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient) of 0.60, 0.65, or 0.70. GGS selects the directly measured genes and the theoretically predictable genes from these eligible genes. The number of genes eligible to be directly measured or predicted varies as a function of the correlation threshold and the minimum number of genes to which an eligible gene must be correlated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). More stringent correlation thresholds reduce the number of genes correlated to at least one other gene at or above that threshold. When the minimum number of correlated genes is 1 and |r<sub>P</sub>| is 0.60, 0.65, and 0.70, there are 3,695, 2,463, and 1,577 eligible genes (i.e., genes that can be used to predict or genes whose value can be predicted) respectively. To determine the extent to which the eligible genes represent a wide variety of biological processes, we performed enrichment analysis on the Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) GO-slim biological process terms (223 terms) using the 3,695 eligible genes identified using the 0.60 threshold with background frequencies determined by the 8,265 truly expressed genes.

This suggests that the distribution of the eligible genes may be generally representative of the distribution of all expressed genes across most of these high-level biological processes.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Definition of eligible genes. <bold>a</bold> Distribution of the 90th quantile of expression values for all genes in the TCGA data.

The ranked-degree method builds a set of <italic>n</italic> genes to directly measure by selecting the top <italic>n</italic> genes correlated with the largest number of genes. In contrast, as GGS constructs the DM and predictable sets, the edges are removed; i.e., correlations associated with those genes are ignored for the remainder of the set construction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Both approaches require: 1. a binary matrix indicating whether pairs of genes are correlated beyond a specified threshold (|r<sub>P</sub>|); 2. a minimum number of directly measured genes which must be correlated with an unmeasured gene in order to consider that unmeasured gene predictable (redundancy); and 3. the targeted size of the DM set. We used the TCGA HGSC gene by gene correlation matrix and three |r<sub>P</sub>| values (0.60, 0.65, 0.70) to create binary matrices, then applied both the ranked-degree and GGS approaches specifying redundancy as 1, 2, or 3 and a targeted DM set size of 400, and calculated the size of the resulting predictable sets (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). GGS consistently returned at least approximately three times the number of predictable genes across this range of redundancy values and |r<sub>P</sub>| thresholds. Under the most conservative parameters, with redundancy of 3 and |r<sub>P</sub>|&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.70, the GGS predictable set was approximately 11-fold larger than that of the ranked-degree approach. Therefore, the edge removal portion of the algorithm likely improves GGS performance by preventing over-representation of correlated genes in the DM set.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Example run of greedy geneset selection (GGS).

For each of the DM sets, the size of the corresponding predictable set was calculated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">d</xref>, the total number of eligible genes for given parameter values is known, and we subtracted the number of genes in the DM and predictable sets from the number of eligible genes to quantify the eligible genes missed (dotted lines in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). A consistent pattern was observed; the size of the predictable set increased with increasing DM set size and decreasing |r<sub>P</sub>| and redundancy. Redundancy strongly influences the number of predictable genes. For example, for |r<sub>P</sub>| of 0.60 and a DM set size of 250, the number of predictable genes is 2.6-fold higher when redundancy is 1 (1,954 genes) compared to redundancy of 3 (752 genes). The correlation threshold (|r<sub>P</sub>|) also has a strong effect; when redundancy is 1 and the DM set size is 250, the number of predictable genes is 2.3-fold higher for |r<sub>P</sub>| of 0.60 (1,954 genes) compared to |r<sub>P</sub>| of 0.70 (868 genes). The increase in number of predictable genes as the number of directly measured genes increases is expected. However, a plateau is reached as the size of the DM set increases. This plateau is caused by GGS exhausting the larger sets of correlated genes, and subsequently adding genes to the DM set with a smaller return in increased predictable set size. A network representation of the eligible genes when |r<sub>P</sub>| is 0.70 and redundancy is 1 is presented in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figures S2 and S3. The average number of neighbors was approximately 9. The GGS-identified DM set genes are red (20 genes Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1; 400 genes Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2), the predictable genes are blue (430 genes Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1; 1018 genes Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2), and the remaining eligible genes are grey. GGS selects from the dense neighborhoods first but with 400 genes in the DM set the algorithm has started to select from the small 2 node connected components which means only 1 predictable gene is gained for every DM gene added. This explains the diminishing returns in number of predicted genes observed in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> which occurs when selecting from the small connected components.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Predictable gene set size across GGS parameters.

We observed results similar to the HGSC datasets, with increasing predictable set size as a function of increasing DM size, decreasing redundancy, and decreasing correlation threshold. Predictable set sizes were consistently larger than those found in HGSC. For example, with a set of 400 DM genes and a correlation threshold and redundancy of 0.70 and 3 respectively, 1,566 predictable genes were identified in the breast cancer data, versus 337 predictable genes observed in the HGSC data. These results are provided in our source code repository [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>We developed GGS to augment hypothesis-driven candidate gene sets with small numbers of additionally measured genes that allow inference of many unmeasured genes. In this scenario, GGS automatically adds all of the candidate genes to the DM set and selects additional DM set genes using the specified binary adjacency matrix. To characterize the performance of GGS with candidate gene sets, we performed the parameter sweep using either the Yoshihara et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] or TCGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] prognostic gene sets for HGSC which contain 121 and 183 genes respectively. Starting with a DM set that includes the candidate gene set, the number of predictable genes was quantified across the remaining parameter sweep categories (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figures S4). The Yoshihara and TCGA candidate gene sets predicted 572 and 224 genes respectively when |r<sub>P</sub>| was 0.60 and redundancy was 1. These candidate gene sets were created to capture specific biological signals and are not optimized to predict unmeasured gene expression (in comparison, a GGS-generated DM set of 100 genes returned by GGS predicted 1447 genes). Once GGS augmented the Yoshihara et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and TCGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] candidate gene sets with 20 additional DM genes, they predicted 968 and 935 genes respectively.

To evaluate the performance of the regression models, we predicted expression of specific genes using the regression models in the TCGA testing partition (other 1/3 of data), and then correlated the true and predicted values using the Spearman rank correlation (r<sub>S</sub>). Expression prediction was carried out for all parameter sets defined by the parameter sweep (144 GGS runs) and for the parameter sweep results with the two candidate gene sets.</p><p>We also assessed the performance of these regression models in four independent HGSC expression datasets (Tothill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], Mayo, Yoshihara [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and Bonome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). We summarized the accuracy (r<sub>S</sub>) of the regression models in the TCGA testing partition and the four independent datasets (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), and repeated analyses including the two candidate gene sets (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S4 and S5). We observe similar average r<sub>S</sub> across most datasets for a given set of parameters. As expected, the average accuracy of our prediction increases as redundancy and |r<sub>P</sub>| increase. In most of the data sets (TCGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], Tothill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and Bonome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]), accuracy generally increases with increasing DM set size. However, in the Yoshihara and Mayo data, the maximum r<sub>S</sub> is achieved when the DM set size is very small (10&#x02013;20 genes); as more genes are predicted the average r<sub>S</sub> slightly decreases and levels out (e.g., 3-fold redundancy with |r<sub>P</sub>|&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.70 in the Yoshihara and Mayo datasets). A similar pattern is observed when using GGS augmented candidate gene sets across all datasets (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S4 and S5). The highest r<sub>S</sub> is achieved using the candidate genes alone to predict a relatively small number of genes. However, as the DM set size increases and there is a concomitant increase in the number of predicted genes, the r<sub>S</sub> decreases and levels out. Importantly, when redundancy is 3-fold the average r<sub>S</sub> (i.e., imputation accuracy) consistently exceeds the |r<sub>P</sub>|used to identify the genes in the DM and predictable sets (in all data except for Bonome et al.; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

Using the known expression correlation structure within HGSC, we demonstrate that our GGS approach can efficiently identify reduced sets of directly measured genes which accurately predict a maximized number of unmeasured genes in independent data sets, with the ranked correlation between true and predicted expression of 0.60 or greater in all testing scenarios, and nearing 0.80 for conservative parameters. This testing accuracy was observed across Affymetrix and Agilent mRNA expression array platforms and was also demonstrated in RNA-seq expression data. While we emphasize the utility of GGS for the selection of genes to be assayed in future studies, it can also be used to increase the utility of existing targeted gene expression data by using the existing gene set to impute predictable genes.</p><p>Gene expression covariance relationships are highly tissue-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and successful GGS-based expression prediction requires a stable tissue-specific co-expression structure. We demonstrate that in two very different cancer types, breast and HGSC, the same trends in predictable gene set size as a function of redundancy, correlation threshold, and DM set size were observed. The number of predictable genes was consistently much higher in breast cancer than in HGSC. When predicting gene expression, increasing the number of genes required to be correlated with a predictable gene tends to increase the prediction accuracy, since more predictor variables are added to the regression models. However, it also decreases the total number of eligible genes that could either be predicted or used for the prediction. The overall success of expression prediction depends on the redundancy and |r<sub>p</sub>| selected and may vary by tissue type. If the tissue-specific gene expression correlation structure has fewer but larger sets of correlated genes, then larger redundancy values will have little impact on the number of eligible genes. If, however, there are many small sets of correlated genes, high redundancy values would exclude many of the genes from being eligible. In selecting gene sets to assay, higher values for redundancy may be chosen to better accommodate probe failures, but such failures will result in decreased accuracy.</p><p>There are several key differences between our work and the National Institutes of Health Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program selection of a set of 1000 &#x0201c;landmark&#x0201d; genes that can be used to infer 80&#x000a0;% of the genome. The goal of the LINCS project is to increase the capacity of high throughput screening and generation of expression signatures for small molecules across cell lines. The 1000 genes were purposely selected based on their minimally correlated expression across a large number of cell lines, and their utility in inferring the expression of other genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In contrast, we designed GGS to tailor gene selection using organism-, disease-, and tissue-specific gene expression patterns, identify genes that can be imputed from a given candidate gene set, and select a user-specified number of additional genes to assay which maximize the gene expression information obtained. Additionally, we use a range of correlation thresholds and redundancy to identify gene sets whose values can be imputed with varying degrees of confidence, allowing the user to choose a set of parameters that balances cost and prediction accuracy.</p><p>While we demonstrate that GGS-augmented prognostic ovarian cancer gene sets greatly increase the number of genes that could theoretically be predicted, and the prediction models using these genes generalize across studies and platforms, GGS has several limitations. In order to apply our algorithm, a binary correlation matrix must be generated using readily available expression data, which may not exist for a given tissue type or disease. Also, while it is possible to consider higher order interaction between gene expression values, we simplify our method by only considering pairwise correlation between genes. Despite this simplistic modeling of co-expression relationships, we achieve high imputation accuracy across populations and platforms. Another possible limitation is that DM gene set performance can suffer from population or study variance in the correlational structure. For example, imputation accuracy is lower in the Bonome et al. data compared to the other data sets we evaluated, suggesting that the correlational relationships differ between these populations. Since there are various methods to define grade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and there have been changes over time in the groupings of histologic types of ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], this could potentially be due to differences in the characteristics of cases included in the studies. Finally, our choice of a greedy algorithm balances the need for DM sets that maximize the number of predictable genes while minimizing the running time, and therefore there is no guarantee that the DM set selected is optimal. A brute force approach which would guarantee the optimal DM set selection that truly maximizes the possible predicted genes would increase the running time by many orders of magnitude. In contrast, our greedy algorithm runs with the number of iterations equal to the number of DM genes the user desires. While a variety of methods could have been used to predict relative expression, we chose polynomial regression and random forest models because of their simplicity. Predicting relative expression is useful for associative analyses of subtype, outcome, or other sample features, and is more resilient to differences in batch, platform, and population than predicting absolute expression. If absolute expression is modeled and predicted, care should be taken to address these issues.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that GGS augments candidate gene sets selected for their biologic relevance by increasing the amount of gene expression information captured from the assay and potentially providing preliminary support for future work.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>For a given tissue, disease, organism, or model system, GGS can select a set of genes to directly measure that efficiently capture the expression levels of additional genes across populations and assay platforms. GGS can build from candidate gene sets as a cost-effective way to increase the amount of gene expression information obtained in very large studies where using a genome-wide measurement platform is not feasible. This improves the utility of existing studies and enhances the efficiency of future studies by allowing researchers to use both the directly measured and predicted expression values to test unknown and difficult to anticipate future hypotheses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Datasets and sample inclusion criteria</title><p>All data used for these analyses were de-identified and publicly available.

We chose the value 5 as a threshold as it consistently falls between the two distributions when using the 90th, 95th, and the 99th quantiles; values above 5 were considered truly expressed whereas those below 5 expressed at a low level or not at all. Analyses are restricted to those genes above the threshold (8,265 genes). We next count the number of genes correlated to at least one, two, or three other genes at the |0.60|, |0.65|, and |0.70| Pearson&#x02019;s correlation (|r<sub>P</sub>|) thresholds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">d</xref>).

Both approaches take as input parameters: 1) a binary adjacency matrix which indicates which pairs of genes are correlated above a certain threshold, 2) the number of genes the user wishes to directly measure, and 3) the fold redundancy. The binary adjacency matrix is created by applying a user selected correlation threshold (|r<sub>P</sub>|) to the gene by gene correlation matrix. Cells in the adjacency matrix are 1 if the two genes are correlated above the threshold and 0 otherwise. Redundancy is defined as the number of genes in the DM set that must be correlated with an unmeasured gene above the |r<sub>P</sub>| threshold in order to consider that unmeasured gene to be predictable. The ranked-degree approach sorts the genes by the number of genes that they are correlated with at a specified threshold, then selects the first <italic>n</italic> highest rank genes where <italic>n</italic> is the desired number of directly measured genes. In contrast, GGS iteratively constructs the DM gene set by looping over the following four key operations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) until the DM set reaches the specified size:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Sort the genes in the binary matrix by the number of genes that they are correlated with at a specified threshold</p></list-item><list-item><p>Add the gene with the maximum number of correlated genes to the DM gene set</p></list-item><list-item><p>Add any genes which are now predictable (i.e., correlated beyond the |r<sub>P</sub>| threshold to the redundancy number of genes in the DM set) to the predictable set</p></list-item><list-item><p>Remove all edges with the new DM and predictable genes (i.e., set all cells in those genes&#x02019; rows and columns to 0)</p></list-item></list></p><p>Given an undirected gene co-expression graph G&#x02009;=&#x02009;(V,E) for which |V|&#x02009;=&#x02009;<italic>n</italic> and a user specified <italic>k</italic> where |DM|&#x02009;=&#x02009;<italic>k</italic>, the time complexity required to sort the nodes by their degree is O(<italic>n</italic> log(<italic>n</italic>)) and the time required to remove edges is bound by O(<italic>n</italic><sup>2</sup>) resulting in an overall time complexity of O(<italic>kn</italic><sup>2</sup>).

If candidate genes are provided, GGS automatically adds all of them to the DM set and proceeds as described above. We examined the performance of GGS with two candidate gene sets developed to predict survival published by Yoshihara et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] (126 genes) and TCGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] (200 genes).

These |r<sub>P</sub>| cutoffs correspond to r<sup>2</sup> values for which one member of the gene-by-gene pair explains 36, 42, or 50&#x000a0;% of the variance of the other respectively. We further assessed the performance of GGS by performing a parameter sweep across DM set sizes of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400, for a total of 144 GGS runs.

Genes in the DM set that were correlated with the specific predictable gene above the specific value of |r<sub>P</sub>| were used as predictors, and when there were at least 2 predictors for a predictable gene, a random forest of regression trees (R package randomForest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]) was used to generate the model.
