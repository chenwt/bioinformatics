By applying EMSA and ChIP methodologies in mouse erythroleukemia cells we show that GATA1 and PU.1 bind in vitro and in vivo the proximal promoter region of the RPS19 gene which is frequently mutated in Diamond-Blackfan Anemia. Moreover, ChIPseq data analysis also demonstrates that several RP genes are enriched as potential GATA1 and PU.1 gene targets in mouse and human erythroid cells, with GATA1 binding showing an association with higher ribosomal protein gene expression levels during terminal erythroid differentiation in human and mouse. Our results suggest that RP gene expression and hence balanced ribosome biosynthesis may be specifically and selectively regulated by lineage specific transcription factors during hematopoiesis, a finding which may be clinically relevant to ribosomopathies.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by interdepartmental funding by the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (ISV), by the National Institute of Diabetes and Kidney Diseases (RO1DK083389 to JS) and Fondazione Cariplo (2012.0517 to JS).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="18"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ribosome biogenesis is a highly coordinated process leading to the stoichiometric assembly of all ribosomal components. In eukaryotes, 4 rRNAs and 80 different ribosomal proteins (RPs) are produced, processed and assembled into functional ribosomes [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140077.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. RP biosynthesis is regulated at multiple levels by transcriptional, translational and post translational mechanisms so that RP balance is achieved [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140077.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In higher eukaryotes little is known about the transcriptional regulation of RP genes which are scattered in different chromosomes and possess distinct promoters sharing certain structural features but no common motifs [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140077.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Despite ubiquitous RP gene expression and functions across all tissues, RP gene haploinsufficiency leading to perturbation of balanced ribosome assembly results in clinical syndromes with highly specific phenotypes in man, including bone marrow aplasia and cancer susceptibility [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For example, RPS14 haploinsufficiency leads to hypoplastic/macrocytic anemia in 5q deletion (5q<sup>-</sup>) syndrome, an acquired hematological disorder [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140077.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a genetic syndrome caused by heterozygous mutations in several RP genes involved in the biogenesis of the small and large ribosomal subunits, such as RPS10, RPS26, RPS24, RPS17, RPS7, RPL35a, RPL11, RPL5, RPL26, RPL15 and RPS19, which account for ~60&#x02013;70% of DBA cases [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. DBA is predominantly characterized by anemia, macrocytosis and reticulocytopenia, however its molecular pathogenesis pathways remain poorly understood [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is known that DBA specifically relates to the decline or absence of erythroid progenitors in an otherwise normocellular bone marrow, with the defect shown to occur at the stage of BFU-E and early CFU-E progenitors failing to differentiate to mature red blood cells [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140077.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>A number of non-mutually exclusive mechanisms have been proposed to account for the hematopoietic specificity of DBA, including an increased sensitivity of erythroid precursors to apoptosis and the high demands imposed on protein synthesis by hemoglobin accumulation [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140077.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140077.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Indeed, ribosome number and activity appear to be heavily modulated during physiological terminal erythroid differentiation, in that ribosome numbers peak in early proerythroblast differentiation, followed by a gradual decline in RP gene transcription and ribosome formation with terminal differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140077.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thus, given the dynamic nature of ribosome number and function during erythroid maturation and the specific hematopoietic phenotypes in RP gene haploinsufficiency, we reasoned that hematopoietic transcription factors (TFs) are implicated in balanced ribosome biosynthesis during erythropoiesis by specifically regulating RP gene transcription. This is supported by the recent identification of rare GATA1 mutations, resulting in the expression of a short isoform of the GATA1 protein (GATA1s) in DBA patients with no detectable mutations in RP genes [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140077.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Despite this evidence, an investigation of potential RP gene regulation in erythroid cells by hematopoietic TFs has not been systematically undertaken in the past.</p><p>Here, we describe the binding of several RP genes, including genes mutated in DBA, by the GATA1 and PU.1 TFs in murine erythroleukemic (MEL) cells, a well characterized cellular model of erythropoiesis. GATA1 and PU.1 are considered master regulators of the erythroid and myeloid-lymphoid lineage transcription programs, respectively, and are known to be functionally cross-antagonistic [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We also used publicly available ChIPseq data to determine GATA1 and PU.1 occupancies in all RP gene promoter regions in mouse and human erythropoiesis models of fetal and adult origin. We also related GATA1 occupancy profiles to RP gene expression levels during late erythroid differentiation in mouse and human. Our results support the notion that GATA1 and PU.1 are implicated in the transcriptional regulation of RPs in hematopoiesis and shed new light on the potential molecular links between ribosome production and erythropoiesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Mouse erythroleukemic (MEL) cells (clone 745-PC&#x02013;4) were derived from the MEL 745 cell line, originally isolated by Friend et al.

Binding of PU.1 at position -653bp in probe P was indeed confirmed as the protein complex detected by EMSA (<xref rid="pone.0140077.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, lane P) was supershifted by an anti-PU.1 antibody (<xref rid="pone.0140077.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, lane Ps), or abolished by use of a mutated probe (<xref rid="pone.0140077.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, lane Pm), or by an excess of cold PU.1 competitor (<xref rid="pone.0140077.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, lane Pcom). Consistent with the rapid PU.1 down-regulation upon MEL cell differentiation (panel E in <xref rid="pone.0140077.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), PU.1 binding to the RPS19 probe is hardly detectable as early as 6 hours into the induction of MEL erythroid maturation (data not shown).</p><p>Probe GP spans the PU.1 and GATA1 sites at positions -709bp and -694bp of the RPS19 gene, respectively. Incubation with MEL nuclear extracts revealed two discrete TF complexes (<xref rid="pone.0140077.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Inclusion of an anti-GATA1 (lane GsP) or of an anti-PU.1 (lane GPs) antibody resulted in a diminished GATA1-DNA complex, as presumably the addition of the GATA1 antibody prevented this complex from entering the gel, or a supershifted PU.1 complex, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0140077.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Interestingly, the GATA1-specific complex does not appear to diminish when using the anti-PU.1 antibody and <italic>vice versa</italic>, suggesting independent binding of the two TFs to the probe. Furthermore, when using probes mutated for the binding of either factor (<xref rid="pone.0140077.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>, lanes GmP and GPm), loss of binding of the corresponding TF is not accompanied by a concomitant increase in binding of the antagonistic TF. These data confirm that the two MEL nuclear protein complexes binding to the RPS19 proximal promoter motifs contain GATA1 and PU.1, as predicted by our analysis above. PU.1 binding appears to rapidly decline with MEL differentiation, whereas GATA1 binding remains clearly detectable throughout this period (<xref rid="pone.0140077.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1E Fig</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>In vivo RPS19 promoter occupancy by PU.1 and GATA1 during MEL cell terminal differentiation</title><p>We next assessed GATA1 and PU.1 binding to the RPS19 proximal promoter region <italic>in vivo</italic>, by interrogating a series of ChIPseq data from several models of erythropoiesis [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140077.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

In fact, RP gene transcriptional regulation in general remains poorly characterized [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Here, we asked whether lineage-specific hematopoietic TFs might be involved in RP gene regulation in erythroid cells. We initially used a computational approach to identify consensus binding motifs for the key hematopoietic TFs GATA1 and PU.1 in a region upstream of the start codon of the murine RPS19, at positions -694bp and -709bp. We verified by EMSA <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of GATA1 and PU.1 to these motifs in nuclear extracts from MEL cells. Furthermore, we confirmed these findings <italic>in vivo</italic> by ChIP assays using chromatin from MEL cells, further supported by ChIPseq data in mouse fetal liver erythropoiesis. We next used publically available ChIPseq data to extend our observations of GATA1 and/or PU.1 erythroid-specific occupancies to many additional RP genes and, moreover, we confirmed by ChIP the GATA1 and/or PU.1 binding in MEL chromatin for a subset of RP genes that are mutated in DBA. Importantly, our observations were also extended to human erythropoiesis where we observe higher GATA1 occupancies of RP genes in the adult compared to the fetal stage of erythropoiesis. We further describe a difference in the timing of RP gene transcriptional decline in mouse versus human erythroid differentiation, in that this appears to take place at a later differentiation stage in human cells. Lastly, we find that despite the overall decline in RP gene expression levels, GATA1 binding is associated with higher expressed RP genes throughout erythroid terminal differentiation stages in human and in mouse.</p><p>The GATA1 and PU.1 binding sites upstream of the RPS19 promoter that we describe here coincide with a region of high sequence conservation between the mouse and human Rps19 genes previously described by Da Costa et al.[<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The clustered PU.1 and GATA1 motifs (<xref rid="pone.0140077.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) are conserved between mouse and human, whereas the second, more downstream PU.1 site is not (not shown). ChIPseq data show the presence of two GATA1 peaks in the mouse RPS19 upstream promoter region, suggesting that it may bind to both regions (<xref rid="pone.0140077.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, panel A in <xref rid="pone.0140077.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>). Analysis of GATA1 ChIPseq data in human erythroid cells shows the presence of one strong binding peak upstream of the RPS19 promoter. This peak spans a sequence that is 62% identical between human and mouse and it includes the homologous PU.1 and GATA1 motifs that we identified in the mouse sequence (not shown). In addition, this region falls within a block of high information content (BHIC) in a multi-species alignment of the RPS19 extended genomic locus [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], further supporting a regulatory role for these sequences in RPS19 expression.</p><p>By expanding our studies to include all RP genes using publicly available ChIPseq data in erythroid cells (<xref rid="pone.0140077.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>), we found that GATA1 and, to a lesser extent, PU.1 bind to the majority of RP genes in erythroid cells (<xref rid="pone.0140077.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>). Interestingly, PU.1 occupancy of RP genes is also clearly observed in macrophages (<xref rid="pone.0140077.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>), with an almost complete overlap with PU.1 RP gene occupancies in erythroid cells. These data clearly establish RP genes as PU.1 targets in hematopoiesis extending beyond the erythroid lineage. Importantly, ribosome biosynthesis genes have been reported previously as being GATA1 and PU.1 targets in erythroid cells [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140077.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], further supporting the involvement of these TFs in controlling ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>How might PU.1 and GATA1 binding serve to regulate RP gene expression in erythroid cells? Recent observations suggest that PU.1 acts primarily as an activator of non-erythroid genes in proliferating erythroid progenitors [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140077.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, we propose that PU.1 maintains RP gene expression in immature erythroid cells. As PU.1 has been reported to bind to common subsets of genes in different hematopoietic lineages [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], it is likely that PU.1 functions in RP gene activation in immature erythroid cells are conserved in other hematopoietic lineages, such as macrophages. As cells commit to terminal erythroid differentiation, GATA1 occupies target RP genes which are not completely overlapping with those occupied by PU.1 in erythroid progenitors. Interestingly, GATA1 occupancy of RP genes in immature erythroid cells is reduced with terminal erythroid differentiation (<xref rid="pone.0140077.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). This could be due to the global condensation of chromatin that takes place with erythroid maturation, which could result in reduced access of the GATA1 antibody to its epitope in crosslinked chromatin in maturing erythroid cells, and/or in disengagement of GATA1 protein from chromatin as this undergoes condensation. Regardless, we do find a clear correlation of GATA1 occupancy with relatively higher absolute expression of target RP genes compared to non-GATA1 target RP genes throughout terminal erythroid differentiation in mouse and human (Figs <xref rid="pone.0140077.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0140077.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), suggesting an activating role for GATA1 in this context. It may be possible that GATA1 binding in immature erythroid cells serves to fine tune expression of a subset of RP genes in preparation for the high demands of hemoglobin synthesis. This scenario may be in line with the concept of &#x0201c;specialized ribosomes&#x0201d; having a unique composition or activity in different tissues [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140077.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Taken together, we propose a model whereby PU.1 serves as an activator of a subset of RP genes in early erythroid progenitors (and potentially in earlier stages of hematopoiesis and in other lineages). Upon commitment to terminal erythroid differentiation, as PU.1 expression is repressed by GATA1, the latter takes over the regulation of a non-overlapping subset of RP genes long enough to sustain massive hemoglobin synthesis against a backdrop of global RP gene down-regulation.</p><p>Our data on the dynamic GATA1 occupancies of RP genes in erythroid cells raise the prospect of GATA1 directly regulating RP gene expression in the erythroid lineage, thus providing an additional mechanism for GATA1&#x02019;s implication in DBA. It also raises the prospect that mutations in TF binding motifs in RP gene regulatory regions, which are not routinely screened in diagnosis, may be an alternative underlying cause of DBA. According to our model, mutations in GATA1 (or PU.1) binding motifs in RP gene regulatory elements resulting in reduced RP gene expression and/or mutations resulting in the production of GATA1s which may be deficient in properly regulating RP gene expression in erythroid differentiation, would lead to RP imbalance and disease [<xref rid="pone.0140077.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This model also raises the intriguing possibility that full length GATA1 can promote its self-translation during terminal erythroid differentiation by directly regulating the expression of components of the translational machinery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0140077.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Analysis of HMBA induced MEL cell differentiation.</title><p>MEL cells grown in culture for 96 hr in the presence of HMBA (5mM) were assessed for their proliferation potential (A), cell viability (B), and differentiation capacity (accumulation of benzidine-positive stained hemoglobin-containing cells) (C) as described in Materials and Methods.
