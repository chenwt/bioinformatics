Prerequisites for successful analyses include high quality annotated genome assemblies and that techniques designed for use with model organisms be tested and optimised for use with these insects. We aimed to test and improve genomic tools for studying the major malaria vector <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To guide future RNAseq transcriptomic studies of <italic>An. funestus</italic>, we compared two methods for enrichment of non-ribosomal RNA for analysis: enrichment of polyadenylated RNA and ribosomal RNA depletion using a kit designed to deplete human/rat/mouse rRNA. We found large differences between the two methods in the resulting transcriptomes, some of which is due to differential representation of polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated transcripts. We used the RNAseq data for validation and targeted manual editing of the draft <italic>An. funestus</italic> genome annotation, validating 62&#x000a0;% of annotated introns, manually improving the annotation of seven gene families involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics and integrated two published transcriptomic datasets with the recently published genome assembly.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The mRNA enrichment method makes a substantial, replicable difference to the transcriptome composition, at least partly due to the representation of non-polyadenylated transcripts in the final transcriptome. Therefore, great care should be taken in comparing gene expression data among studies. Ribosomal RNA depletion of total RNA using a kit designed to deplete human/rat/mouse rRNA works in mosquitoes and, we argue, results in a truer representation of the transcriptome than poly(A) selection. The <italic>An. funestus</italic> genome annotation can be considerably improved with the help of these new RNAseq data and further guided manual gene editing efforts will be of great benefit to the <italic>Anopheles</italic> research community for studies of this insect&#x02019;s genome and transcriptome.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-015-2114-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Anopheles funestus</italic></kwd><kwd>Mosquitoes</kwd><kwd>Transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>RNAseq</kwd><kwd>Genome annotation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p><italic>Anopheles funestus</italic> is a major vector species of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Similar to the more extensively studied vector species <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, resistance to commonly used insecticides is a growing problem in <italic>An. funestus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Efforts to improve the design and implementation of resistance management strategies require a good understanding of the molecular basis of resistance. Use of genomic tools is paramount to achieve this goal. In contrast to <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, for which significant progress has been made in its genomics since its genome was sequenced more than a decade ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], <italic>An. funestus</italic> has received much less attention. However, progress is being made as the genome of <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic> was recently sequenced as part of a program to sequence a number of Anopheles species genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The draft genome assembly, in the form of unplaced scaffolds not assembled into chromosome sequences, is publicly available via the VectorBase web resource [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The draft genome assembly has been annotated, using the genome annotation pipeline MAKER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, this annotation has not been extensively manually curated and is inaccurate for a number of known genes of interest such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenase and glutathione S-trasferase (GST) genes. Thus, more efforts are currently needed to maximise the usefulness of the <italic>An. funestus</italic> genome and allow more studies to be performed such as transcriptome profiling or genome-wide association studies. One approach to optimise the quality of this genome is to use RNAseq to improve genome annotation.</p><p>RNAseq is a powerful method to study the transcriptomes of organisms, providing a rich dataset allowing transcriptional profiling as well as the identification of novel transcripts, alternative splicing and detection of expressed sequence polymorphisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However in the case of Anopheles mosquitoes, limited information have been generated to determine the best methodology for library preparation to ensure an accurate profiling of transcriptomes, notably between the enrichment of polyadenylated (poly(A)) RNA transcripts and the alternative method of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) depletion. Methods of mRNA enrichment have been shown to have an effect on the observed transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Comparisons of poly(A) mRNA enrichment with rRNA depletion methods report that the depletion methods result in more reads aligned outside of annotated gene coding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This may be due to the presence of novel transcripts and/or a greater proportion of genomic DNA in the library. Also, the greater number of reads aligned within introns in depletion libraries could be derived from immature transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Depletion libraries show more even read distribution less 3&#x02032; bias than poly-A libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>In malaria-transmitting mosquitoes, insecticide resistance is often due to &#x02018;metabolic resistance&#x02019;: up-regulation of genes involved in detoxification, such as cytochrome P450 and GST genes. This is particularly the case in <italic>An. funestus</italic>, for which pyrethroid resistance is caused by metabolic resistance and not by target site resistance, such as mutations in the voltage gated sodium channel gene. As there are no known genomic biomarkers to detect metabolic resistance, transcriptomic analyses are necessary. These analyses have commonly used microarrays to detect up-regulated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. RNAseq may offer advantages over microarrays in that unannotated, or poorly annotated, transcripts can be defined and corrected using the sequence alignment, which is more data-rich than the results of microarray analysis. This data richness includes information on alternative splicing, as well as non-protein-coding RNA transcripts (ncRNA) that may play a role in differential gene expression.</p><p>Here, we perform an RNAseq experiment on <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic> (FANG strain), primarily to compare two methods to enrich messenger RNA (mRNA) relative to ribosomal RNA (rRNA): ribosomal depletion and poly(A) selection. We compare the results of both methods applied to total RNA from the same individual mosquitoes and identify the most differentially represented transcripts between the methods to identify non-polyadenylated transcripts. We use the RNAseq data along with published <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies of <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic> transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] to improve the genome annotation for selected genes, focusing on detoxification associated gene families.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of transcriptome sequencing libraries</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from pools of whole mosquitoes of the <italic>An. funestus</italic> FANG colony. Extracts showed a pink colouration, probably due to eye pigments. It was not known if this would affect the sequencing library quality, so one sample was split and bead clean-up carried out on one of the sub-samples, to compare results with its uncleaned counterpart and assess whether this discolouration had any effect on the sequencing results. BioAnalyzer traces of total RNA (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) showed evidence of the &#x02018;hidden break&#x02019; reported in other insect total RNA samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]: two peaks of approximately 2000&#x000a0;bp representing 18S rRNA and the 28S rRNA subunits alpha and beta. The total RNA traces also showed some &#x02018;spikiness&#x02019; the cause of which was unclear. The profile of degraded RNA tends to look smoother, with a broad peak extending left of the major 18S/28S rRNA peaks. Whether this spikiness would affect the sequencing results was not known at this stage.</p><p>After Ribo-Zero rRNA depletion or poly(A) mRNA enrichment, BioAnalyzer traces suggested that all samples were of sufficient quality for RNAseq library preparation, with no obvious quality differences among samples within each method (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The amount of rRNA remaining in the samples appeared to be much lower for Ribo-Zero depleted samples than for poly(A) enriched samples, where even after 3 rounds of poly(A) selection, samples displayed a large peak near 2000&#x000a0;bp (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Later analysis indicated that this peak may represent mitochondrial 16S rRNA.</p><p>Initial quality checking of the sequence read data showed that the 8 libraries were evenly represented in the sequenced pool (median 61,229,870 reads per library; range 44,384,316 to 68,640,804 reads) and of good quality, with little read trimming due to sequenced adapters or low quality base calls (full details in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Alignment of sequence reads to reference genome</title><p>All read libraries were aligned to a reference consisting of 1392 scaffolds derived from the <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic> FUMOZ colony with the <italic>An. funestus</italic> mitochondrial genome sequence added. Broad alignment metrics are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Overall, a median of 35,309,124 (range 21,002,025 to 38,878,773), or 57&#x000a0;% (range 35&#x000a0;% to 59&#x000a0;%) of the reads to be aligned could be aligned. Alignment of spliced reads is more difficult than for unspliced reads and leads to lower proportions of the starting libraries being aligned, but this alone is unlikely to account for the relatively low alignment rate. The incompleteness of the reference genome sequence and high levels of sequence polymorphism and genetic divergence between laboratory colonies FANG (derived from Angola) and FUMOZ (from Mozambique, used for sequencing the reference genome) may also contribute to it. A greater proportion of the poly(A) than the Ribo-Zero libraries tended to be aligned (mean difference 11&#x000a0;%, median 8&#x000a0;%). For the sample where an initial bead clean-up was applied (&#x0201c;F1_XP&#x0201d;), the proportion of reads aligned for the Ribo-Zero library (&#x0201c;F1_XP_RZ&#x0201d;; 55&#x000a0;%) was greater than for the uncleaned sample (&#x0201c;F1_RZ&#x0201d;; 35&#x000a0;%). This difference was not seen for poly(A) libraries (59&#x000a0;% for both &#x0201c;F1_XP_PA&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;F1_PA&#x0201d;). This suggests that the purity of the sample may affect the efficacy of the rRNA depletion reaction, which is supported by the ribosomal RNA mapping results shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Metrics describing the transcriptome alignments</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Sample ID</th><th>Reads to align (R1&#x02009;+&#x02009;R2)</th><th>Aligned reads (%)<sup>a</sup>

As the RNAseq protocol used is strand-specific, tags can be aligned sense or antisense to a feature, which mean different things: i.e. that antisense tags come from an antisense transcript, rather than from the primary annotated transcript. Sense and antisense tag counting was performed for each sequence alignment.</p><p>To assess how much ribosomal RNA was represented in each sequence library (i.e. the success of the mRNA enrichment procedure) gene features annotated as rRNAs were extracted from the genome annotation. There were ten of these features (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>): 8 resulting from automated annotation of the genome assembly and 2 annotated on the mitochondrial genome. For putative nuclear 28S and 18S rRNA genes, poly(A) mRNA enrichment almost always (except for the F1_XP sample pair) resulted in fewer tags from these genes than Ribo-Zero rRNA depletion. Putative 5.8S rRNA genes rarely showed any tags (possibly due to ambiguous read alignment arising from non-uniqueness among multiple 5.8S rRNA copies in the reference genome or to their small size). The mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene showed the same trend as for nuclear 28S and 18S rRNA genes. However, the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene showed the opposite trend, with more tags in the poly(A) mRNA enriched libraries than in the Ribo-Zero depleted libraries.</p><p>Tag counting is summarised in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. As counting used annotated genomic features, antisense counts should be much lower than sense counts. This was the case, with a ten-fold greater assignment of tags to features in the sense orientation than antisense. The count data generated for each genomic feature is the data analysed in differential gene expression (DGE) analysis. Therefore, in general, the more sense tag-count data available, the greater the power of DGE analysis to detect differential gene expression. Overall, the poly(A) mRNA-enriched libraries produced more &#x0201c;on target&#x0201d; sense tags, as a proportion of all aligned tags (between 7.5 and 9.2&#x000a0;% more than Ribo-Zero), as might be expected given enrichment on the poly(A) tails of mRNA transcripts (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). However, after excluding tag counts from 10 putative rRNA genes, the differences between Ribo-Zero and poly(A) samples were less marked and for all samples (between 1.3 and 2.7&#x000a0;% more on-target tags for poly(A) ). Overall, &#x0201c;on target&#x0201d; sense tag counts (excluding rRNA genes) comprised around 47.9 to 56.4&#x000a0;% of the total aligned tags. This relatively low proportion probably reflects the fact that 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; un-translated regions (UTRs) are rarely predicted by automated annotation pipelines, so a large proportion of tags from mRNA transcripts are not counted as such when using gene models mostly comprising protein coding regions. Overall (excluding rRNA genes), our differential &#x0201c;gene expression&#x0201d; analysis would be based on between 6.6 and 13.4 million tags per sample.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Summary of sense tag counting</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Sample</th><th>Total tags<sup>a</sup>

When the treatment effect is the dominant term of variation, the sample groups can be clearly separated by statistical tools. If the treatment effect is weak compared to the technical and biological variation the samples will be difficult to discriminate based on the data. Here, the treatment effect is the difference between poly(A) and Ribo-Zero mRNA enrichment methods and a large treatment effect indicates that the mRNA enrichment/rRNA depletion method greatly affects the composition of the transcriptome. We assessed these effects.</p><p>Initial visual inspection of sequence alignments indicated that the Ribo-Zero libraries showed more &#x02018;background&#x02019; alignments (reads aligned in intergenic and intronic regions) than the poly(A) datasets. It is not certain whether this represents real, un-polyadenylated transcripts or possible erroneous sequencing of DNA. However, as samples came from the same pool and were DNase treated prior to being split, any difference in the amount of DNA being sequenced should be due to specific differences in the enrichment/depletion process.</p><p>As an initial gene-wise analysis of gene expression levels, reads or read pairs (&#x0201c;tags&#x0201d;) mapped in the sense orientation to annotated gene models were counted for each sample. One caveat to this analysis is that the gene models used to generate tag counts were from a draft genome annotation and therefore were likely to contain errors. 257 of the 13,793 annotated features had sense tag counts of zero in all eight samples and were not analysed. To assess variation in the data, log<sub>2</sub> sense tag counts per gene were plotted among sample pairs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These give an indication of how similar are samples belonging to the same group and how different are samples from different sample groups. The associated correlation coefficients are displayed as a correlation heatmap (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA), using log<sub>2</sub> sense tag counts per gene, was used to plot each sample relative to all others (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These analyses showed very low technical variation between the cleaned and uncleaned FANG-1 samples and greater biological variation among FANG-1, FANG-2 and FANG-3 samples. Ribo-Zero samples showed more biological variation than poly(A) samples, though this was mainly due to the FANG-2 Ribo-Zero sample, which was a clear outlier (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). FANG-2 Ribo-Zero was the smallest sample library, with around 44 million reads compared to around 55&#x02013;62 million reads for the other samples, which may be associated with this result. Together, these assessments indicate that the mRNA enrichment method has a large effect on the sequenced transcriptomes of the samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Analysis of differential transcriptome composition between mRNA enrichment methods</title><p>To assess differences between the transcriptomes due to the mRNA enrichment method applied, differential gene expression (DGE) analysis was carried out to identify significantly differentially represented annotated genome features. First, as technical variation due to pre-enrichment sample cleaning of FANG-1 was low and to make full use of the data, the mean tag counts for cleaned and uncleaned samples were calculated and used in the DGE analysis. The data were modelled using a generalized linear model in a one-factor (mRNA enrichment method) experiment with two levels (&#x0201c;Ribo-Zero&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;poly(A)&#x0201d;). Full results of the analysis are shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the relationship between log<sub>2</sub> fold change in expression between Ribo-Zero and poly(A) and mean expression level across all samples. The power in the data to discriminate between Ribo-Zero and poly(A) samples (clearly shown by PCA) is reflected in the large number of significantly differentially represented transcripts among the two transcriptomes. This analysis indicates that results based on Ribo-Zero and poly(A) mRNA enrichment may be very different from one another. Great care must therefore be taken when comparing results derived using the different methods.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Plot of differential transcript abundance in Ribo-Zero and poly(A) transcriptomes.

Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> lists the 20 features most over- or under-represented in the Ribo-Zero transcriptome relative to poly(A). The two most over-represented features in the Ribo-Zero transcriptomes were ncRNAs, suggesting a large population of non-polyadenylated transcripts, including many ncRNAs, may exist in the cells and be under-represented in poly(A) transcriptomes. Two histone genes (histone H2A and H3) were over-represented in the Ribo-Zero transcriptome, consistent with the occurrence of replication-dependent, unpolyadenylated and replication-independent, polyadenylated histone forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Also, three genes with Cadherin domains were over-represented in the Ribo-Zero transcriptome. In other systems, Cadherin is among a set of genes controlled at the translational level by cytoplasmic polyadenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. If this were occurring in <italic>An. funestus</italic>, we would expect transcript forms with short poly(A) tails to be over-represented in the Ribo-Zero transcriptome. Further investigation would be needed to confirm if this is the case. Among the genes over-represented in the poly(A) transcriptome were a number of putative core metabolic genes such as transcription-associated proteins and ribosomal proteins. A study of poly(A) tail length in yeast showed that ribosomal proteins had long poly(A) tails [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We speculate that preferential enrichment of transcripts with longer poly(A) tails may affect the resulting transcriptome composition.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>The most significantly differentially represented genome features between Ribo-Zero and poly(A) transcriptomes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Gene ID</th><th>logFC (Ribo-Zero/poly(A))<sup>a</sup>

After removing transcripts that overlapped those predicted in the AfunF1.2 annotation, more remained in the Ribo-Zero transcriptome (nearly 5,000) that in the poly(A) transcriptome (around 1,000), suggesting the presence of transcripts not detected in the poly(A) transcriptome. Some of this difference could be due to an increased amount of immature transcripts (that are neither fully spliced nor polyadenylated) and/or a greater contribution from DNA contamination in the Ribo-Zero samples (which are subjected to less PCR amplification specifically of transcripts).

Of these, 28,346 (61.64&#x000a0;%) were validated by at least 10 reads in the FANG-1, 2 and 3 poly(A) data sets (31,927 introns, 72.91&#x000a0;%, were validated by at least 1 read in the same data set).

To carry out analyses of gene expression relevant to insecticide resistance, we have piloted the use of RNAseq. In addition, we have improved the genome annotation for a number of gene families with roles in the detoxification of xenobiotic agents.</p><p>As reported in other eukaryotic systems, the method used to enrich for mRNA relative to rRNA has a large effect upon the observed transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Functional classes of genes are differentially represented in poly(A) mRNA-enriched and Ribo-Zero rRNA-depleted transcriptomes, with greater representation of ribosomal proteins with poly(A) and membrane-associated proteins with Ribo-Zero. Genes with both poly(A)&#x02009;+&#x02009;and poly(A)- transcripts, such as histones, and ncRNA, such as signal recognition particle RNAs, were also highly represented in the Ribo-Zero transcriptome. The Ribo-Zero libraries show a higher proportion of reads aligning outside of annotated exons, which may represent a combination of novel, poly(A)- transcripts and the introns of immature transcripts.</p><p>In making recommendations for which method to use for studies of the transcriptomes of mosquitoes, several factors should be considered. For analyses of differential gene expression, power to detect different expression levels is proportional to the number of reads aligned to each gene. Poly(A) mRNA enrichment does provide more of this &#x02018;on-target&#x02019; data than Ribo-Zero rRNA depletion, yet the difference is less striking after accounting for rRNA genes, in particular a highly poly(A)-enriched mitochondrial 16S rRNA. The transcriptome profiles of poly(A) samples were more highly correlated with each other than Ribo-Zero samples, indicating that power to detect differential gene expression would be greater for poly(A) mRNA-enriched samples. However, we argue that Ribo-Zero rRNA depletion produces a truer representation of the transcriptome because (i) there is less PCR amplification of transcripts, which can bias the final results and (ii) The transcriptome includes the poly(A)- fraction, which may be functionally relevant. Due to the large effect that the mRNA enrichment method has on the transcriptome obtained, researchers should be very careful in comparing results obtained using different methods.</p><p>The draft genome annotation of <italic>An. funestus</italic> is currently inadequate for detailed studies of gene expression targeted at insecticide resistance mechanisms. Major gene families involved in detoxification of xenobiotic substances, such as cytochrome P450 and GST genes, are not well annotated by automated approaches. Manually edited gene models for these gene families are being incorporated into the genome annotation at the time of writing (Dr. Craig Wilding and Dr. Dan Lawson, personal communications). We extended this annotation improvement to 7 more key detoxification genes families: 4 associated with phase I; 2 with phase II and 1 with phase III. This effort offers a major improvement of the utility of the <italic>An. funestus</italic> genome as a tool to study insecticide resistance in this species. Accurate annotation of these gene families is particularly important for <italic>An. funestus</italic>, as insecticide resistance appears to be primarily mediated by detoxification of the compounds in this species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Mosquito samples used in the study</title><p>The study used <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic> mosquitoes of the FANG laboratory colony, a fully insecticide susceptible colony derived from Angola [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].
