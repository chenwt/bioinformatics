To date many studies have been performed in the investigation of miRNAs of numerous bilaterians, but limited numbers of miRNAs have been identified in the few species belonging to the clade Lophotrochozoa. In the current study, deep sequencing was conducted to identify the miRNAs of <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic> (Lophotrochozoa) at a genomic scale, using 21 libraries that included different developmental stages and adult organs. A total of 100 hairpin precursor loci were predicted to encode miRNAs. Of these, 19 precursors (pre-miRNA) were novel in the oyster. As many as 53 (53%) miRNAs were distributed in clusters and 49 (49%) precursors were intragenic, which suggests two important biogenetic sources of miRNAs. Different developmental stages were characterized with specific miRNA expression patterns that highlighted regulatory variation along a temporal axis. Conserved miRNAs were expressed universally throughout different stages and organs, whereas novel miRNAs tended to be more specific and may be related to the determination of the novel body plan. Furthermore, we developed an index named the miRNA profile age index (miRPAI) to integrate the evolutionary age and expression levels of miRNAs during a particular developmental stage. We found that the swimming stages were characterized by the youngest miRPAIs. Indeed, the large-scale expression of novel miRNAs indicated the importance of these stages during development, particularly from organogenetic and evolutionary perspectives. Some potentially important miRNAs were identified for further study through significant changes between expression patterns in different developmental events, such as metamorphosis. This study broadened the knowledge of miRNAs in animals and indicated the presence of sophisticated miRNA regulatory networks related to the biological processes in lophotrochozoans.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program, 2010CB126401), National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 program, 2012AA10A405), National Natural Science Foundation of China (40730845), Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System (CARS-48), the Taishan Scholar and Scholar Climbing Programs of Shandong and Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province under Grant ZR2010DQ024.

They are vital components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that regulate target genes via complementary binding to their 3&#x02032; untranslated regions (3&#x02032; UTRs), and leads to either inhibition of translation or mRNA degradation <xref rid="pone.0104371-Bartel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104371-He1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. MiRNAs have been discovered in a wide variety of organisms, including animals, plants, viruses, and even unicellular organisms, and are known to participate in important life processes such as early development, cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and stress responses <xref rid="pone.0104371-Reinhart1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104371-Brennecke1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Given their importance in so many developmental processes, researchers have focused much attention on their identification in a wide variety of species. The latest release of the miRNA database (miRBase 20) contains 24,521 hairpin precursors (pre-miRNA) in 206 species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mirbase.org/">http://www.mirbase.org/</ext-link>) <xref rid="pone.0104371-Kozomara1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The species with the most reported miRNAs is <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, with a total of 1,872 precursors <xref rid="pone.0104371-Kozomara2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, the investigation efforts of miRNAs in Lophotrochozoa have been relatively limited. There are only 461 precursors in this group with 65 in Mollusca, and only a few of these molluscan miRNAs have been studied in detail <xref rid="pone.0104371-Wheeler1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Many biological issues, such as the relationships between miRNAs and the evolution of animal genomes, cannot be clarified unless comprehensive data are available for species throughout the animal kingdom.</p><p>Although 258 mature miRNAs in pearl oyster <italic>Pinctada martensii</italic> have been reported to be identified with Solexa deep sequencing <xref rid="pone.0104371-Jiao1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, few supports were provided to meet the miRNA requisite criteria for miRNA annotation proposed in recent reports <xref rid="pone.0104371-Kozomara2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104371-Tarver1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This illustrates the problem faced by the miRNA database that some early entries were actually poorly predicted and may be not <italic>bona fide</italic> miRNAs <xref rid="pone.0104371-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104371-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. As a result, relatively stricter annotation criteria based on miRNA biological processing were recently proposed for miRNA annotation in deep sequencing experiment. In animals, the precursor (pre-miRNA) is produced in the nucleus and exported into the cytoplasm. The DICER enzyme then recognizes the stem-loop and cleaves the loop region with two nucleotide overhangs at both 3&#x02032; ends <xref rid="pone.0104371-Tsutsumi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Subsequently, the duplex produced two separate strands (miRNAs from 5p and 3p arms). Because much evidence suggests that both 5p and 3p miRNAs may be biologically functional, high-confidence miRNAs are requested to be supported by reads from both arms of the precursor <xref rid="pone.0104371-Kozomara1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>In order to identify novel Bivalvia miRNAs and broaden the knowledge of miRNAs in animals, we conducted deep sequencing experiments in the Pacific oyster <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic>, and annotated the miRNAs according to the recently proposed criteria. <italic>C. gigas</italic> is a relatively well-studied lophotrochozoan that undergoes indirect development <xref rid="pone.0104371-Hadfield1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Dramatic changes occur during its larval development. The trochophore is a typical development stage in oyster and many other lophotrochozoans. The larvae later develop into phylotypic stages, such as the veliger in molluscs <xref rid="pone.0104371-Slack1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The oyster also changes from the planktonic larval stage to the sessile adult stage through metamorphosis, a complex process requiring intricate gene regulation mechanisms. Several studies have focused on the biological regulation processes at the gene, mRNA, or protein levels <xref rid="pone.0104371-Genard1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104371-Huan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, no study focused on the role of miRNA regulation during development has yet been reported in molluscs. The recent release, sequenced with the next generation technique, of the complete genome assembly of <italic>C. gigas</italic><xref rid="pone.0104371-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> serves as an excellent reference for genome wide identification of the oyster's miRNAs. It also allows the analysis of characteristics of miRNA regulation in <italic>C. gigas</italic> at the whole genome level. Therefore, in the current study, through deep sequencing, we identified the miRNAs of <italic>C. gigas</italic> and then determined their expression patterns during different developmental stages and in different organs. Our findings not only extend the repertoire of lophotrochozoan miRNAs, but also provide further insights into the function and the evolution of miRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Profiles of oyster miRNA</title><p>An average of 14.08 million reads (from 10.75 M to 21.82 M) was obtained using 21 libraries (Tables S1 &#x00026; S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104371.s009">File S1</xref>).

The low proportion of miRNAs in the egg maybe due to the abundance of piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) detected in the egg or that it contains the largest proportion of expressed repeat elements of all the developmental stages. A total of 100 loci were predicted to encode pre-miRNAs that produce <italic>bona fide</italic> miRNAs in the Pacific oyster genome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104371-t001">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104371.s002">S4</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104371.s003">S5</xref>), <italic>i.e.</italic>, which met the requisite criteria for miRNA annotation proposed in recent reports <xref rid="pone.0104371-Kozomara2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104371-Tarver1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These miRNAs represent most of the families identified in related taxa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104371.s004">Table S6</xref>). The average length of these precursors was 79 bp (71&#x02013;91 bp). All of the precursors were supported by mature sequences from both arms of the hairpin. Most of the miRNAs were confirmed by more than two experiments and the read number was &#x0003e;100 in at least one single experiment. All of the candidate precursors could be mapped onto only one site in the genome except for the <italic>cgi-miR-124</italic>, and they all had at least 16 nucleotides (nt) that were complementary between the guide miRNA and the star miRNA region. At the same time, some predicted loci that folded well, but failed to meet the criteria (e.g. too few reads), are also provided in the supplementary information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104371.s005">Table S7</xref>). One of these candidate loci, <italic>mir-184</italic>, had as many as 67 hits in BLAST searches of the oyster genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104371.s006">Table S8</xref>), and produced 14 types of miRNAs (Figure S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104371.s009">File S1</xref>). These hits located two loci: 718110&#x0223c;722565 bp of scaffold121, and 63164&#x0223c;67661 bp of scaffold43150.

This proportion was comparable with that in vertebrates and fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (39&#x02013;70%) <xref rid="pone.0104371-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104371-GriffithsJones1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> but was higher than that in the silk worm <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (9%) <xref rid="pone.0104371-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, the nematodes <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (17%) <xref rid="pone.0104371-GriffithsJones1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and <italic>Brugia pahangi</italic> (16%) <xref rid="pone.0104371-Winter1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Two precursors overlapped with the <italic>in silico</italic>-predicted exons, but were poorly supported by EST or homology genes. Thus, we manually checked the gene models and found that these two precursors were actually non-exonic (Figures S2 &#x00026; S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104371.s009">File S1</xref>). As a result, all of the precursors were intronic, with 38 (38%) located in the sense strand and 11 (12%) located in the antisense strand. We divided the whole oyster genome sequence into contiguous windows based on the average length of the precursors (79 bp). The frequency of windows located within the gene region on the sense strand was significantly less (20%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) than that of the precursors. This indicated that oyster miRNAs were preferentially located in intragenic regions rather than intergenic regions. Furthermore, the distribution of miRNAs was not random throughout the genome. We observed that most of the 49 intergenic precursors were far away from gene regions. When we extended the frames by 500 bp, 1,000 bp, or 2,000 bp upstream and downstream of the precursors, only five additional precursors overlapped with gene regions and the proportion of intragenic sequences around precursors increased slightly from 49% to 54%. In contrast, the percentage of contiguous windows in the divided genome overlapping gene regions increased from 41% to 61% at 1,079 bp (500 bp upstream plus 79 bp windows plus 500 bp downstream), 2,079 bp, and 4,079 bp lengths (Figure S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104371.s009">File S1</xref>). The intronic distribution for intragenic precursors and the distance from gene regions of intergenic precursors indicated that the physical distribution of oyster miRNA was constrained by some undefined biological mechanisms. Indeed, some characteristics of physical location, such as intragenic distribution and clustering, are common in the genomes of many organisms <xref rid="pone.0104371-GriffithsJones1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Such constraints may allow miRNAs to be transcribed efficiently within the same primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) and may also be important during miRNA genesis <xref rid="pone.0104371-Chapman1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104371-CampoPaysaa1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, reasons for intergenic miRNAs to be distant from gene regions have seldom been discussed. For this study, there may be a bias since only a few intergenic miRNAs were assayed. It is also possible that this observation might due to the biogenesis mechanism of miRNAs, which starts with the transcription of several hundred nucleotides of pri-miRNAs. The miRNA genes may have integrated coding and regulatory regions, as is the case for protein coding genes <xref rid="pone.0104371-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, thereby causing a requirement for increased distance between precursors and neighboring genes.</p><p>The clustering of miRNAs <xref rid="pone.0104371-CampoPaysaa1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> was also common in the oyster genome. In this study, we defined contiguous precursors with a maximum gap of 10 Kbp as a cluster. A total of 53 precursors (53%) formed 20 clusters (Table S9 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104371.s009">File S1</xref>). Forty eight precursors (91% of the 53) from 18 clusters encoded conserved miRNAs. Most of these conserved precursors were duplicated, such as the <italic>mir-9</italic> and <italic>mir-2</italic> families. For the two clusters encoding novel miRNAs (clusters 19 &#x00026; 20 shown in the Table S9 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104371.s009">File S1</xref>), the sequences of the clustered mature miRNA were different, indicating their different origin. Indeed, miRNAs from different families that clustered together have also been observed in other organisms, such as the conserved mir-17-92 cluster in vertebrates <xref rid="pone.0104371-Mendell1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104371-Tanzer1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Therefore, we speculate that there might be an underlying mechanism for selecting novel miRNAs in particular hotspot regions throughout the genome. According to the accidental origin hypothesis, which refers to stem-loop-like sequences as one of the most common local structures in the genome <xref rid="pone.0104371-Tanzer1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, if a novel miRNA evolved from a stem-loop-like sequences, it might be easier for its neighbor stem-loop-like sequences to be co-transcribed and spliced into precursors than other sites. Clustered precursors with distinct sequences may have evolved in this way.</p><p>Intragenic miRNAs are generally neither located in the same gene in different species, nor co-expressed at the same level as the host gene <xref rid="pone.0104371-Behura1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In most animals studied, <italic>mir-2</italic> is located in the intergenic region. However, in oyster, one cluster containing six <italic>mir-2</italic> was located in the intronic region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104371.s002">Table S4</xref>) of the <italic>protein phosphatase 4, regulatory subunit 1</italic> (<italic>PPP4R1</italic>, CGI_10023188) gene. The other <italic>mir-2</italic> was located in the intronic region of the gene <italic>structural maintenance of chromosomes 4</italic> (<italic>SMC4</italic>, CGI _10009524). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, there is only one <italic>mir-2</italic> but it is also located in the intron of the <italic>ppfr-1</italic> gene, an ortholog of the <italic>PPP4R1</italic> gene. However, the cluster of <italic>mir-2</italic> in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is located in the intron of the gene <italic>spitz</italic> while another member of the <italic>mir-2</italic> family, <italic>mir-13</italic>, is located in the intron of the <italic>CG7033</italic> gene. This suggests that the position of <italic>mir-2</italic> intronically embedded in <italic>PPP4R1</italic> is conserved between the oyster and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and may represent the genomic organization of their common ancestor.

Furthermore, the expression patterns of the six <italic>mir-2</italic> in the intron of <italic>PPP4R1</italic> (CGI_10023188) had a similar expression pattern to the host gene (the largest Pearson correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.93 for the six <italic>mir</italic>-2, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6.06E-08, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104371.s007">Table S10</xref>), which supported a previous report that miRNAs were co-expressed with their host genes <xref rid="pone.0104371-Baskerville1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, the co-expression pattern was not common for all the 49 oyster intronic precursors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104371.s007">Table S10</xref>). Taking the <italic>cgi-miR-33</italic> (m0361_5p) for example, the host gene <italic>Sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1</italic> (<italic>SREBF-1</italic>, CGI_10004108) only showed a weak co-expression pattern (<italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.58, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02) with this miRNA. Actually, strong co-expression relationships (<italic>r</italic>&#x0003e;0.8, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) of the host genes and their intragenic miRNAs were detected only in 21 of the 76 pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104371.s007">Table S10</xref>). This result suggests that parallel transcription of miRNAs with their host gene might not result in the similar co-expression patterns of the mature mRNA and miRNA. Plausible mechanisms to explain the abundance differences of the miRNA and mRNA of the host gene can be proposed. Firstly, the difference in the biogenesis pathways between miRNA and mRNA could have an influence. Different proteins regulate the maturation steps for these two type of RNAs, thus resulting in differential biosynthesis duration after transcription. Secondly, the RNAseq-detected relative abundance ratio of the free molecules might not be the real abundance ratio of mRNA and miRNA in cell. The miRNA abundance can be controlled by binding multiple mRNAs <xref rid="pone.0104371-Seitz1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> which share common miRNA regulatory elements (MRE) <xref rid="pone.0104371-Salmena1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The bound miRNAs will not be isolated and sequenced by the RNAseq technique. In addition, the degradation system of the miRNA and mRNA could be controlled by different mechanisms, resulting in the abundance ratio inconsistency in different samples. The mRNA can be regulated by miRNA, siRNA and some other molecules, while miRNA may be regulated by circular RNAs (circRNAs) <xref rid="pone.0104371-Memczak1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This will lead to different longevity in the cell for the two types of molecules, thus resulting in the non-linear correlation of the expression level of miRNA and the host gene mRNA.</p><p>In addition, the <italic>cgi-miR-1991</italic> embedded between genes <italic>CgPost2</italic> and <italic>CgPost1</italic> in the Hox cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104371-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

Most of the assignments were to Bilateria (80 miRNAs from 45 precursors) and Protostomia (43 from 22 precursors), as well as novel oyster miRNAs (31 from 19 precursors). The expression patterns were significantly different among different groups of miRNAs. The deeply evolved Bilateria and Protostomia miRNAs had low expression levels from the trochophore to veliger stages, whereas those of Eutrochozoa and younger miRNAs were highly expressed during this development period. As a result, the miRNA profile age index (miRPAI) from the trochophore to veliger stages was higher than that at other stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104371-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The trochophore is the main characteristic of Trochozoans <xref rid="pone.0104371-Voronezhskaya1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and the veliger larvae are thought to correspond to the phylotypic stage in Mollusca <xref rid="pone.0104371-Slack1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The transition from the trochophore to the D-shaped veliger larvae when most of the organs form within about 10 hours is probably the most dramatic event during oyster development. Therefore, novel miRNAs may play an important role in novel body plan development during this stage. In this context, the age of the miRNAs profile was younger during this ontogenetic period than others.</p><fig id="pone-0104371-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0104371.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>The miRPAI curve during oyster development.</title><p><bold>A</bold>.

If the reads of a miRNA were only sequenced in a few samples or the variation of expression level was high among different samples, the miRNA was considered to be specially expressed in certain development stages or organs, and may indicate the specialization of its biological function. We found that miRNAs with a deeper origin were detected in more samples while the variation of the expression level (<italic>CV</italic> of RPM, reads per million) was lower than oyster novel miRNAs (Figures S5 &#x00026; S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104371.s009">File S1</xref>). The results indicated that conserved miRNAs functioned in a more global pattern whereas the novel ones were more specific.
