    "Down syndrome (DS, trisomy 21), is the most common viable chromosomal disorder, with an incidence of 1 in 800 live births. Its phenotypic characteristics include intellectual impairment and several other developmental abnormalities, for the majority of which the pathogenetic mechanisms remain unknown. In this \"Data in Brief\" paper, we sum up the whole genome analysis by mRNA sequencing of normal and DS induced pluripotent stem cells that was recently published by Hibaoui et al. in EMBO molecular medicine."
