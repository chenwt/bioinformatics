Transcript storage occurs at specific stages of gametogenesis and is particularly important in oogenesis as stored maternal mRNA is used to sustain <italic>de novo </italic>protein synthesis during the early developmental stages until the embryonic genome gets activated. In many cases, stored mRNA can be several times more abundant than mRNA ready for translation. In order to identify active mRNA in bovine oocytes, we sought to develop a method of isolating very small amounts of polyribosome mRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The proposed method is based on mixing the extracted oocyte cytoplasm with a preparation of polyribosomes obtained from a non-homologous source (<italic>Drosophila</italic>) and using sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation to separate the polyribosomes. It involves cross-linking the non-homologous polyribosomes and neutralizing the cross-linking agent. Using this method, we show that certain stages of oocyte maturation coincide with changes in the abundance of polyribosomal mRNA but not total RNA or poly(A). We also show that the abundance of selected sequences matched changes in the corresponding protein levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We report here the successful use of a method to profile mRNA present in the polyribosomal fraction obtained from as little as 75 mammalian oocytes. Polyribosomal mRNA fractionation thus provides a new tool for studying gametogenesis and early development with better representation of the underlying physiological status.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Gametogenesis and embryonic development in mammals involve several major cellular events marked by an unusual mode of messenger RNA management. In nearly all animal species, mRNA molecules are stored in the developing oocyte until use during maturation or after fertilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These stored mRNAs direct protein synthesis during the period of transcriptional silence, which begins when the germinal stage oocyte reaches its full size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and lasts until embryonic genome activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In cattle, this size is approximately 120 &#x003bc;m within a follicular antrum 3-5 mm in diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. During the period covering the remaining follicular development (i.e. from 3 to 25 mm in antral diameter), the post-LH-surge oocyte maturation, fertilization and the onset of embryonic genome activation, very little genomic transcription occurs. It is generally believed that transcript storage begins in the early stages of oogenesis and may thus last for several weeks. It is also believed that the transcripts are stored in a particulate form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and lack the poly(A) portion, although the latter detail remains the subject of debate. It has been reported that shortening the poly(A) tail to less than 50 nucleotides stabilizes the mRNA molecule and keeps it from being either degraded or translated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>So far, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the steps that occur during this transcriptional silencing period. Early development is characterized by major fluctuations in the abundance of total and messenger RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], with specific waves of maternal RNA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These observations have led to the belief that measurement of messenger abundance provides little useful information about cells that are storing RNA, since it does not distinguish between mRNA that is 1) stabilized and stored and thus not contributing to any cellular function; 2) recruited and on its way to degradation, not contributing to the translation process and 3) recruited and being translated in <italic>de novo </italic>protein synthesis. In order to avoid the contribution of the stored or decaying molecules to the mRNA abundance measurements, we seek to provide a mean to isolate the mRNA population bound to the translation apparatus. Messenger RNAs engaged in translation are found to be bound by ribosomes throughout the cytosol either freely or attached to the cytoskeleton while dormant or stored transcripts are accumulated in diverse forms of ribonucleoprotein complexes and particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It is also well known that actively translated messengers are bound by multiple ribosomal units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The composition of these different particles makes it possible to fractionate them by density gradient. Profiling of polyribosomal mRNA through standard sucrose gradient fractionation procedure requires considerable starting material (e.g. 200 &#x003bc;g of total RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]). A recent publication reports the development of a method suitable for input material not fewer than five <italic>Xenopus </italic>laevis oocyte, eggs or early embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Considering the <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocyte contains about 15,000 times more total RNA comparatively to the bovine counterpart (respectively 6 &#x003bc;g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and 340 pg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]), the method still requires too much input for work on mammalian early development. The relative scarcity of mammalian oocytes, egg and embryonic tissues is another impediment to increasing understanding of mammalian gametogenesis and early development, since the choice of methods suitable for handling such minute quantities of material is severely limited. Pre-amplifying the entire transcriptome offers the possibility of studying the fluctuations in transcript abundance in these tissues. Minute amounts of initial RNA can be amplified with success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and provide sufficient output for high throughput approaches such as microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] or systematic deep sequencing (RNAseq) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, the isolation of polyribosomes from mammalian oocytes or early embryos has been reported only twice and resulted in limited success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The methodology used by De Leon and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] involves spiking a small sample with a large amount of genetically homologous material to confirm the polyribosomal nature of the RNA molecules being studied. However, the inability to distinguish between the spike and the sample prevented identification of oocyte/embryo mRNA molecules. In contrast, the approach used by Potireddy and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] allowed mRNA identification but could not confirm the polyribosomal nature of the isolated fraction nor exclude the presence of non-polyribosomal contaminants. We therefore sought to combine the advantages of each method by devising means of confirming the polyribosomal nature of the extracted mRNAs while maintaining the possibility of identifying them and determining their relative abundance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Preparation of the inert carrier</title><p>In order to develop a polyribosomal isolation method that could be performed with very small quantities of sample material, we used an RNA carrier fraction.

To determine the optimal concentration of formaldehyde that would provide a useful carrier and minimize downstream interference, a dose-response experiment was done. At lower concentrations (i.e. 0.2% and 0.37%), cross-linking was slight, as indicated by the recovery of almost all of the initial RNA in sucrose density gradient fractions. At a concentration of 1% formaldehyde, approximately 10% of the RNA could be recovered while at the highest concentration tested (3.37%), less than 1% of the initial RNA input could be recovered (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The micro-electrophoretic profile confirmed the extremely low level of RNA recovered following the 3.37% formaldehyde treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B-C</xref>). This latter treatment was used and an additional step was included to neutralize excess formaldehyde prior to adding the SL2 cell carrier polysome preparation to the experimental samples.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of cross-linking on recovery of RNA extracted from <italic>Drosophila </italic>SL2 cells</bold>.

Since tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane molecule (THAM or Tris) has been suggested for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], tests were conducted to determine the conditions under which it would efficiently inactivate residual formaldehyde in SL2 cell extract. The impact of pH was also tested since polyribosome extraction was done at a lower pH than in the Sutherland study. The impact of pH was found not significant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). At a concentration of 0.5 M, Tris was found comparable to 0.1 M glycine and thus could not be considered more efficient.

The collection of mammalian oocytes and early stage embryos is challenging and resource-intensive. Therefore, samples rarely contain more than 100 oocytes/embryos. Their scarcity imposes a method suited to handling minute quantities of material. For instance, protein profiling and identification of differentially expressed candidates requires several hundreds to thousands of mammalian oocytes or early embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Similarly, these tissues do not provide a much better source of RNA considering for example that a single Xenopus oocyte contains about 6 &#x003bc;g of total RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] comparatively to only 340 pg in the bovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Nonetheless, the wide array of amplification procedures now available has made it possible to focus on the transcriptome rather than the proteome. Study of the transcriptome generally assumes that mRNA levels are indicative of cellular status and reflect corresponding protein levels. However, this assumption does not apply to cells containing large amounts of stored mRNA, such as mammalian oocytes and early blastomeres. In these cases, mRNA bound to polyribosomes and therefore likely being translated is considered a better indicator of gene activity and developmental stage.</p><p>The first important step for polyribosomal RNA extraction is thorough lysis of the cells. The greatest difficulty encountered when working with oocytes or pre-hatching embryos is the challenge of breaking down the zona pellucida. This porous glycoprotein coat is composed of a dense net of fibril bundles that evolves during oocyte maturation and fertilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The bovine zona pellucida is particularly resistant, with a thickness averaging 26.9 &#x003bc;m compared to 14.5 &#x003bc;m for ovine and 11.4 &#x003bc;m for murine oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Since the lysis buffer used in the polyribosome isolation procedure is relatively mild to disrupt the cytoplasmic membrane and liberate intact polyribosomes, an additional treatment was required to efficiently disrupt the sturdy zona pellucida to liberate the cellular contents. We found that freeze/thaw cycles, effective for mouse oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], are ineffective against the bovine zona pellucida and that digestion with pronase produced irreproducible results due to residual protease activity. The previously used acidic (pH 2.1 to 2.5) Tyrode buffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] was also tested, but changes in the granular appearance of the oocyte cytoplasm suggested disruption of the cytoskeleton, to which polyribosomes are believed to be bound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Moreover, removal of the zona pellucida by acidic treatment has been reported to lead to embryo death and increased frequency of abnormalities in surviving embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], suggesting damage to the embryo development program in which polyribosomes are involved. The only acceptable option appeared to be mechanical breakage of the zona with zirconia-silica beads in the presence of passive lysis buffer (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). This approach seemed to work since the zona and its contents were completely dissolved within a few minutes.</p><p>To our knowledge, extraction of polyribosomes from oocytes and early embryos has been reported only twice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In the first case, mouse liver polyribosomes acted as a carrier of polyribosomal mRNA extracted from [<sup>3</sup>H]-uridine-labelled mouse oocytes. This attractive method allows confirmation of the presence of oocyte polyribosomes, but does not allow any identification or even relative quantification of the associated mRNA, since it cannot be distinguished from that of the liver polyribosomes. The second study involved a method that allowed identification of the transcripts but could not confirm their polyribosomal nature nor exclude the presence of non-polyribosomal contaminants.</p><p>We have developed a method in which a heterologous carrier is used and which allows identification of extracted mRNA and confirmation of its polysomal nature. This involved determining optimal conditions for cross-linking the exogeneous polyribosomes. UV cross-linking was incomplete and prolonging the exposure led to RNA fragmentation (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Formaldehyde cross-linking, which binds more specifically via free amino groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] was found more effective than UV. Before adding the carrier preparation to the biological sample, it was necessary to neutralize the excess formaldehyde, which is normally done with glycine. A recent study of the efficiency of glycine suggests using stronger nucleophiles such as Tris or lowering the solution pH as quick and efficient means of quenching residual formaldehyde [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Tris was the preferred option, since it was not clear that lowering the pH would neutralize the formaldehyde without damaging the polyribosomes.</p><p>Using the method described here, the polyribosomal nature of the isolated bovine RNA can be inferred from its position in the sucrose gradient. Further validation was obtained using EDTA to disrupt the polyribosomes by sequestering Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The shift observed in the abundance of the amplified <italic>CDK1 </italic>fragment towards lower density fractions following this disruption is indicative of the polyribosomal nature of the bovine mRNA in the higher density fractions.</p><p>The strength of the approach used here was assessed by quantifying the abundance of selected mRNA of genes known to be involved in oocyte maturation. Following the luteinizing hormone surge, the oocyte resumes meiosis and undergoes a sequence of events involving germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), first polar body extrusion and a second arrest at the metaphase of the second meiosis (MII) in preparation for fertilization. It is known that maturation promoting factor (MPF), a heterodimer composed of cyclin B1 (CCNB1) and cyclin-dependant kinase 1 (CDK1, formerly known as p34<sup>cdc2</sup>), must be activated for meiosis to resume. Once meiosis reaches the MII stage, the role of the CSF is to halt cell cycle until the ovule is fertilized (For reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]). We previously observed that in cattle, the GV-stage oocyte lacks the CCNB1 component but contains the CDK1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. For activation of MPF, <italic>CCNB1 </italic>must be translated immediately after meiosis resumes but before germinal vesicle breakdown. Consistent with these observations, <italic>CCNB1 </italic>mRNA was found in the polyribosomal fraction at the GV stage, in addition to <italic>CDK1 </italic>mRNA. CSF is activated during a later stage of oocyte maturation prior to its involvement in arresting the cell cycle. However, it has been found that MOS is expressed readily during early stages of oocyte maturation, since it is involved in CCNB1 accumulation and displays an MPF stabilizing activity at the MII stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Following fertilization, both the MPF and CSF are rapidly degraded. Consistent with the activation of MPF, our results showed that levels of <italic>CDK1 </italic>mRNA and <italic>CCNB1 </italic>mRNA present on polyribosomes increased during the initial step of maturation while <italic>MOS</italic>, known to be involved throughout oocyte maturation, was equally present at all stages. This physiologically relevant profile was not observed when targeting total or poly(A)-bearing RNA. This is a strong confirmation that transcript abundance measured as total maternal mRNA pool need to be interpreted with care due to the contribution of the large contents of stored thus physiologically inert mRNAs.</p><p>Finally, we also investigated the proportionality between specific polyribosomal mRNAs and their corresponding protein products. By definition, polyribosomal RNA encodes protein to be newly synthesized. In contrast, the protein content of a candidate results from both its synthesis and turnover rates. Nevertheless, of the three mRNA sequences studied in parallel by Western blot, all showed a shift in total protein that matched the shift in their polyribosomal status, confirming the added value of polyribosome-bound mRNA studies in terms of physiological information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study of oocyte maturation and early development faces a major challenge regarding the physiological relevance of the abundance of total RNA or even poly(A) RNA. The presence of stored and hence inactive maternal RNA that marks developmental stages prior to embryonic genome activation can bias the subsequent interpretation of these measurements. We provide evidence that the study of polyribosomal mRNA offers a better option for studying the physiology underlying gametes and embryonic development especially when the cells are bearing large amounts of stored RNA. The procedure developed in the present study was shown to be robust and efficient for isolating polyribosomal mRNA from small amounts of cells. This polyribosomal mRNA can then be used for downstream transcriptomic studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (St-Louis, MO) unless specified otherwise.</p><sec><title>Oocyte recovery and selection</title><p>Germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes were produced as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] from bovine ovaries collected at a commercial slaughterhouse and transported to the laboratory in a saline solution containing antimycotic agent. Cumulus oocyte complexes (COC) selected on the basis of having at least five layers of cumulus were washed three times in HEPES-buffered Tyrode's medium supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mM pyruvic acid and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml gentamycin. Groups of approximately 50 COCs were placed in four-well Petri dishes containing 0.5 ml of maturation medium (composed of modified synthetic oviductal fluid medium with 0.8% bovine serum albumin, modified Eagle's medium non essential amino acids, modified Eagle's medium essential amino acids, 1 mM glutamine, 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml follicle-stimulating hormone, 5 &#x003bc;g/ml luteinizing hormone and 1 &#x003bc;g/ml 17&#x003b2;-estradiol) under 0.5 ml of mineral oil. Germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and metaphase II (MII) oocytes were obtained by incubating COCs at 38.5&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 6 and 24 hours respectively. Maturation was stopped upon transfer to PBS-cycloheximide. Cumulus cells were removed by vortexing the tissue in PBS containing 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of cycloheximide to prevent translation and ribosome run off. The denuded oocytes were washed at least three times with PBS-cycloheximide to remove any remaining cumulus cells.</p><p>Groups of 75 GV, GVBD or MII oocytes collected for polyribosomal extraction were separated from the PBS-cycloheximide by centrifugation at low speed.</p></sec><sec><title>Carrier preparation</title><p>Since a single bovine GV oocyte, even though enriched with stored RNA, may contain as little as 340 pg of total RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and polyribosomal mRNA represents only a small fraction of this total, conventional extraction methods for obtaining a UV-distribution profile on sucrose density gradient would require an unobtainable number of oocytes. We therefore devised an inert polyribosome support to serve as a marker and carrier in the sucrose gradient, allowing us to observe the distribution of single ribosomes and polyribosomes. RNA extracted from drosophila SL2 cells was used as a carrier because of its phylogenetic distance from cattle.</p><p>SL2 cells were cultured at 28&#x000b0;C in complete Schneider's Drosophila Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 50 U/ml penicillin G and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin sulphate (Invitrogen). To enhance translation and therefore increase the number of polyribosomes, these cells were starved for 3 hours in serum-free medium then stimulated for at least 150 min by adding 33% of fresh medium and 6.25% of heat-inactivated foetal calf serum to the medium. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,200 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 3 min at 4&#x000b0;C in the presence of 100 &#x003bc;g/ml cycloheximide and lysed in polyribosome lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.7, 150 mM KCl, 1.25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% IGEPAL, 0.5% deoxycholate, 200 &#x003bc;g/ml cycloheximide, 1000 U/ml Protector&#x02122; RNase inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) supplemented with complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) followed by triturating. The homogenate was then clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 20 min at 4&#x000b0;C and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 260 nm using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE, USA).

All cross-linking was done on ice for 45 min. Residual formaldehyde was neutralized by adding 0.1 M glycine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] or Tris-HCl at concentrations of 0.15 M to 1.5 M with the pH adjusted to 8.7 or 10.9, followed by 20 min on ice. Each cross-linked and neutralized extract was then processed through the steps designed for isolation of polyribosomes from the gradient fractions. Cytoplasmic samples were mixed with guanidium isothiocyanate solution and the RNA fraction was ethanol precipitated overnight. The pellet was further purified by column chromatography (PicoPure, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Cross-linking efficiency was based on the yield of total RNA thus recovered. It was expected that with increased cross-linkage, more RNA would be covalently bound to and eluted with the protein fraction. The RNA-containing fraction eluted from the column was analyzed using a 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). To determine if the formaldehyde-treated material retained the potential to generate a normal polyribosomal fractionation profile, it was subjected to isokinetic sedimentation in sucrose density gradient as described below and the generated UV profile distribution was compared to one from an untreated sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Oocyte sample preparation</title><p>Since the polyribosome lysis buffer is unable to dissolve the bovine zona pellucida, oocytes were strongly vortexed with 1.0 mm zirconia-silica beads (BioSpec, Bartlesville, OK) in 50 &#x003bc;l of passive lysis buffer (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The lysis product was transferred to a clean Eppendorf tube and the beads were discarded. Cell debris were removed by centrifuging at 12,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 20 min. The clarified solution was added to 100 &#x003bc;l of drosophila carrier.

The linear gradients were kept at 4&#x000b0;C until use. Cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed by sedimentation velocity in the sucrose gradients for 3 h at 34,000 rpm using a SW 60 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). The gradients were processed using a BR-188 Density Gradient Fractionation System (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Fractions of 350 &#x003bc;l were collected with continuous monitoring of absorbance at 254 nm using an Isco UA-6 detector (Teledyne Isco, Lincoln, NE, USA). The RNA-containing fractions were collected directly in 428 &#x003bc;l of 5.25 M guanidinium thiocyanate (pH 5.5) and 3 &#x003bc;l (5 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l) of linear polyacrylamide (Ambion, Austin, Texas, USA) were added to each as an RNA co-precipitant. Isopropanol was then added and the samples were left overnight at -20&#x000b0;C. The polyribosome-containing RNA precipitate thus obtained was then re-suspended in the extraction buffer provided with the RNA extraction PicoPure kit (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and RNA content was assayed using the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. The polyribosomal nature of the isolated fractions was verified by adding 100 mM of EDTA to the lysis buffer and the sucrose gradient solutions to sequester Mg<sup>2+ </sup>and thereby disrupt any polyribosomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Microarrays</title><p>The hybridizations were performed on the custom-made BlueChip v1.3 cDNA microarray. This microarray contains 1153 expressed sequence tags collected from four subtracted libraries made from oocytes and early embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. For the determination of the optimal microarray hybridization temperature to avoid potential contamination from the carrier (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) two technical replicates were performed for each tested temperature. To test the reproducibility of the polyribosomal isolation, six hybridization samples were prepared representing three biological replicates each performed in dye swap (two technical replicates). To test the method in a biological context (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), for each maturation stage, two biological replicates each containing 75 oocytes were used to generate hybridization samples.

Yields of antisense RNA were assayed on the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. For each microarray hybridization sample, 10 &#x003bc;g of antisense RNA was labelled using the ULS aRNA labelling kit (Kreatech, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). To obtain more concentrated and cleaner output, PicoPure columns (Molecular Devices) were used for aRNA purification. The resulting labelled purified probes were heat-denatured at 90&#x000b0;C for 5 min and 50 &#x003bc;l of SlideHyb buffer #1 (Ambion) was immediately added. The slides were hybridized in the SlideBooster hybridization chamber (Advalytix, San Francisco, CA, USA) at the tested temperature for 18 h. Slides were washed twice in low-stringency buffer (2&#x000d7; standard saline citrate (SSC)/0.5% sodium dodecyl sulphate) for 15 min at 60&#x000b0;C. Washes were repeated with high-stringency buffer (0.5&#x000d7; SSC/0.5% sodium dodecyl sulphate) in the same conditions.

Positive signal threshold values were determined based on a net intensity cut-off value calculated from the background values + 2 standard deviations.

A standard curve was generated using the template from a PCR product purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) and quantified with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. The standard curve consisted of five serial dilutions of the purified PCR products ranging from 0.1 pg to 0.01 fg. Quantification was achieved using the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, QC, Canada) following the manufacturer's recommendations. All reactions were conducted in a LightCycler 1.5 (Roche Diagnostics). Primer annealing and fluorescence acquisition temperatures are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. Specificity of amplification was determined by sequencing the amplicon for each target and by the presence of a single peak on the melting curve. Data normalization could only be accounted by using samples containing the same amount of oocytes. Since quantifications were performed on different RNA populations (i.e. total RNA, poly(A) bearing and polyribosomal mRNA), data normalization could not be performed across these groups. Furthermore, usual housekeeping gene candidates could not be used for data normalization across oocyte maturation stages since their respective transcript abundance been reported to be fluctuating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].
