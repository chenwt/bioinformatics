    "BACKGROUND: Clear-cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most- prevalent, chemotherapy resistant and lethal adult kidney cancer. There is a need for novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for ccRCC, due to its heterogeneous molecular profiles and asymptomatic early stage. This study aims to develop classification models to distinguish early stage and late stage of ccRCC based on gene expression profiles. We employed supervised learning algorithms- J48, Random Forest, SMO and Na√Øve Bayes; with enriched model learning by fast correlation based feature selection to develop classification models trained on sequencing based gene expression data of RNAseq experiments, obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. RESULTS: Different models developed in the study were evaluated on the basis of 10 fold cross validations and independent dataset testing. Random Forest based prediction model performed best amongst the models developed in the study, with a sensitivity of 89%, accuracy of 77% and area under Receivers Operating Curve of 0.8. CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that the prioritized subset of 62 genes and prediction models developed in this study will aid experimental oncologists to expedite understanding of the molecular mechanisms of stage progression and discovery of prognostic factors for ccRCC tumors."
