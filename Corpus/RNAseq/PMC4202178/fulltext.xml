Detection of renal cell carcinoma at an early stage is difficult and generally diagnosed incidentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Most cases can be treated effectively only if detected timely, increasing the survival rates of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The clear-cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common subtype of the renal cell carcinoma, characterized by clear cell morphology of the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. So far, early stage diagnosis is difficult due to the molecular complexity and divergent clinical behavior of ccRCC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Hence, there is an urgent need to determine candidate biomarkers for diagnosis and/or prognosis for stage specific distinction in ccRCC.</p><p>Advancements in high throughput technologies like Next Generation Sequencing have opened novel avenues in cancer research with renewed emphasis on diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutics. The launch of large scale comprehensive multi-node programs like International Cancer Genomic consortium [ICGC] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://icgc.org/">http://icgc.org/</ext-link>) and The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">http://cancergenome.nih.gov/</ext-link>) enables systematic studies on genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic levels for different cancer types that hold clinical and societal importance globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These projects are making data available to researchers in different levels 1, 2, 3, 4 (i.e. raw, processed, interpreted and summarized respectively) enabling genome informed personalized cancer medicine research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Along with advances and affordability of high throughput technologies and data, progress is also being made towards personalized and predictive medicine for clinical management of cancer patients. In order to analyze diverse and multidimensional cancer related data, machine learning techniques are being extensively applied for cancer prognosis as well as diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In ccRCC, clinical tumor staging by TNM staging system is used - as prognostic factor; determines treatment regimen of patient; confirmed to guide the surveillance protocols and to assess risk of metastatic renal cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although tumor stage being an effective prognostic factor, to our knowledge there has been no systematic studies characterizing gene expression data for tumor stage progression. Thereby, we hypothesized that identifying gene expression signature that correlates with clinical tumor stage progression might lead to discovery of a panel of prognostic molecular signatures for ccRCC tumors.</p><p>In this study, we have developed prediction models to discriminate clinical tumor stages- early stage (I, II) and late stage (III, IV) of ccRCC. The prediction models are trained on gene expression data of RNA<italic>seq </italic>experiments from TCGA by implementing state-of-art supervised machine learning algorithms. The gene expression signatures identified by feature selection approach, which enriched classifier training, helped us to efficiently classify the tumors based on their clinical tumor stage. Further, we found that amongst the implemented machine learning techniques, predictive models based on Random Forest algorithm performed the best with accuracy of 76.84% on independent data test, area under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (auROC) of 0.778.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The overall methodology followed in the article is summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of the overall strategy used in the study</bold>.

The patients with localized tumors (stage I and II) were class labeled as early stage whereas patients with locally advanced disease (stage III) and metastatic disease (stage IV) as late stage. The TCGA gene expression profile data available for 475 tumor samples and 20,534 genes had no significant batch effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and came with the "curse of dimensionality". An efficient fast filter feature selection method based on predominant correlation (fast correlation based feature selection) largely reduced the feature space from 20,534 genes to 62 gene expression profiles.</p><p>To analyze the details of selected training set genes used in development of prediction models for ccRCC, we first performed GO annotations in which the corresponding biological processes displayed very broad but consistency with cancer hallmarks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Secondly, the oncoprint visualization of the selected subset genes displayed alterations in all the genomic profiles in 83.6% of the TCGA ccRCC cases. Thirdly, ccRCC cases with alterations in the selected genes had better overall survival than cases without alteration in these genes. Lastly, the literature mining of the selected genes revealed that 42 out of 62 genes are already reported in literature for its involvement in cancer progression or detection, either ccRCC or any other type of cancer. This indeed increased our confidence on the applicability of 62 selected genes for development of prediction model as well as the prioritized list to be analyzed for therapeutic and prognostic potential in case of ccRCC.</p><p>We found that the prediction model based on Random Forest algorithm is the best classifier followed by Na&#x000ef;ve Bayes and SMO, which performed reasonably better than J48 based prediction model. The results demonstrate that early stage and late stage ccRCC tumors can be classified with high sensitivity using gene expression profiles. Our observations re-emphasizes the fact that machine learning based models will play important role in the developing field of predictive and personalized medicine.</p><p>Our study also illustrates a new method for classification in ccRCC, wherein tumor stage information can be derived from the molecular features, instead of tumor size. In future, availability of additional ccRCC tumor patients and inclusion of more feature vectors like miRNA expressions, protein expression and SNP profiling data could further enhance the accuracy of the prediction models given the fact that ccRCC tumors typically have heterogeneous molecular profiles. Though we tested the prediction models on independent testing datasets of 95 patients, the outcome of such models needs to be interpreted judiciously before incorporation into a clinical set up. We anticipate that the selected gene expression features and the prediction models developed in this study would expedite the challenge for discovering molecular prognosis factors and stage progression molecular signatures in ccRCC tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>An empirical approach has been employed in this study to develop classification model for tumor stage progression in ccRCC based on gene expression profiles. We have identified a subset of 62 genes by feature selection, the expression profiles of which predominantly correlates with tumor-stage of the patient given the heterogeneous data in terms of tumor stage, age group and gender of the patient. We report that Random Forest based prediction model accurately and reliably classifies patient tumor stages. We anticipate that such prediction models based on the molecular correlates could contribute to the optimal management of patients in ccRCC. Currently, the prediction models generated are available upon request to the authors. To the best of our knowledge, we are reporting the first prediction model to classify ccRCC tumor stage based on gene expression profiles.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Declarations</title><p>Publication of this work was funded by International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, New Delhi, India.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ZJ and DG designed the study.
