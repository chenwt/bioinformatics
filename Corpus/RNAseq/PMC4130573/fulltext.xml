The phenotypic effects of the four <italic>S</italic> alleles range from solid colour (<italic>S</italic>) to extreme white spotting (<italic>s<sup>w</sup></italic>). We have investigated four candidate mutations associated with the <italic>s<sup>w</sup></italic> allele, a SINE insertion, a SNP at a conserved site and a simple repeat polymorphism all associated with the <italic>MITF-M</italic> promoter as well as a 12 base pair deletion in exon 1B. The variants associated with white spotting at all four loci were also found among wolves and we conclude that none of these could be a sole causal mutation, at least not for extreme white spotting. We propose that the three canine white spotting alleles are not caused by three independent mutations but represent haplotype effects due to different combinations of causal polymorphisms. The simple repeat polymorphism showed extensive diversity both in dogs and wolves, and allele-sharing was common between wolves and white spotted dogs but was non-existent between solid and spotted dogs as well as between wolves and solid dogs. This finding was unexpected as <italic>Solid</italic> is assumed to be the wild-type allele. The data indicate that the simple repeat polymorphism has been a target for selection during dog domestication and breed formation. We also evaluated the significance of the three <italic>MITF-M</italic> associated polymorphisms with a Luciferase assay, and found conclusive evidence that the simple repeat polymorphism affects promoter activity. Three alleles associated with white spotting gave consistently lower promoter activity compared with the allele associated with solid colour. We propose that the simple repeat polymorphism affects cooperativity between transcription factors binding on either flanking sides of the repeat. Thus, both genetic and functional evidence show that the simple repeat polymorphism is a key regulator of white spotting in dogs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was supported by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, and the Swedish Research Council.

There is an extensive diversity of white spotting patterns within and between dog breeds caused by genetic factors and stochastic effects during melanocyte development. White spotting indicates an absence of melanocytes in the hair follicles and/or skin due to a failure of melanoblast migration, proliferation or survival during development. In dogs, there is one major white spotting (<italic>S</italic>) locus that was defined by C. Little during the 1950s <xref rid="pone.0104363-Little1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. He described four different alleles at this locus with phenotypic effects ranging from solid (<italic>S</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104363-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), to a completely white coat, caused by homozygosity for the <italic>Extreme white</italic> allele (<italic>s<sup>w</sup></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104363-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The two intermediate phenotypes were named Irish spotting (<italic>s<sup>i</sup></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104363-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) and piebald (<italic>s<sup>p</sup></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104363-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Irish spotting is characterized by modest white spotting, often present as a white collar and a white belly, as demonstrated by breeds such as the Bernese Mountain dog and Basenji. Piebald-coloured dogs display limited to extensive white spotting and the phenotype is observed in several breeds, including the Beagle and Fox Terrier. Two <italic>S</italic> alleles are segregating in Boxers: <italic>Solid</italic> (<italic>S</italic>) and <italic>Extreme white</italic> (<italic>s<sup>w</sup></italic>). These give rise to three different phenotypes: solid (<italic>S/S</italic>), flash (<italic>S/s<sup>w</sup></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104363-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and extreme white (<italic>s<sup>w</sup>/s<sup>w</sup></italic>). The flash (<italic>S/s<sup>w</sup></italic>) phenotype is similar to Irish spotting (<italic>s<sup>i</sup>/s</italic><sup>i</sup>) and is therefore often called pseudo-Irish.</p><fig id="pone-0104363-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0104363.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Overview of the different phenotypes included in the study.</title><p>(A) Solid (<italic>S/S</italic>) Bull terrier, (B) white Bull terrier (<italic>s<sup>w</sup></italic>/<italic>s<sup>w</sup></italic>), (C) flash (<italic>S/s<sup>w</sup></italic>) Bull terrier, (D) Irish spotting (<italic>s<sup>i</sup></italic>/<italic>s<sup>i</sup></italic>) in a Bernese Mountain Dog, (E) piebald (<italic>s<sup>p</sup></italic>/<italic>s<sup>p</sup></italic>) Beagle, (F) wolf.

Fine-mapping to a 100 kb region which included <italic>MITF</italic> was achieved by including a second breed, bull terrier, segregating for the same two alleles <xref rid="pone.0104363-Karlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p><italic>MITF</italic> was an obvious candidate gene because it encodes a transcription factor controlling neural crest-derived melanocyte development and migration <xref rid="pone.0104363-Levy1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104363-Steingrmsson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. <italic>MITF</italic> has nine alternative promoters that produce multiple isoforms expressed in different tissues. All isoforms share the sequence encoded by exons 2&#x02013;9, but have unique amino acids in their N-termini, determined by distinct first exons. There is clear conservation across mammals at this gene, as several of the MITF isoforms expressed in human and mouse have also been identified in dog <xref rid="pone.0104363-Tsuchida1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, including the melanocyte-specific MITF-M isoform.</p><p>To date, 29 mutations in murine <italic>Mitf</italic> have been identified which affect the development and function of melanocytes in the skin, eye and inner ear <xref rid="pone.0104363-Montoliu1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Some variants affect vision by reducing eye size (microphtalmia) or cause early onset hearing disorders <xref rid="pone.0104363-Steingrmsson2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In humans, deleterious <italic>MITF</italic> mutations cause disorders of vision and hearing, including the Waardenburg and Tietz syndromes <xref rid="pone.0104363-Steingrmsson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104363-Tassabehji1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104363-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Deafness has also been recorded in white dogs, where approximately 2% of white dogs (<italic>s<sup>w</sup>/s<sup>w</sup></italic>) present with bilateral deafness and 18% are unilaterally deaf <xref rid="pone.0104363-Strain1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The majority of mutations reported in mice and humans that cause severe pleiotropic effects are generally loss-of-function mutations affecting the coding regions <xref rid="pone.0104363-Blake1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This is not the case with dog <italic>MITF</italic> alleles. A comparison of <italic>S</italic> and <italic>s<sup>w</sup></italic> haplotypes, using BACs from an <italic>S/s<sup>w</sup></italic> heterozygote, across the 100 kb canine white spotting candidate region revealed 124 sequence polymorphisms, all of which were located in non-coding regions <xref rid="pone.0104363-Karlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This demonstrated that the extreme white coat colour phenotype is controlled by one or several regulatory mutations. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the fact that coloured patches on white spotted dogs display normal pigmentation. Thus, this suggests that the canine <italic>MITF</italic> variants primarily affects migration and survival of melanocytes during development, but have no or only minor effects in mature melanocytes in the hair follicle; pigmentation of the hair requires MITF protein expression <xref rid="pone.0104363-Widlund1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Further analysis of these 124 polymorphisms resulted in a short list of three candidate mutations within or in the vicinity of the <italic>MITF-M</italic> promoter, and one in the <italic>MITF-1B</italic> exon located upstream of <italic>MITF-M</italic>. The first of these is a canine-specific short interspersed nucleotide element (SINEC-Cf element), located about 3 kb upstream of the <italic>MITF-M</italic> transcription start site (TSS). The SINE insertion was only found in dogs presenting the extreme white (<italic>s<sup>w</sup>/s<sup>w</sup></italic>) or piebald (<italic>s<sup>p</sup>/s<sup>p</sup></italic>) phenotypes, and was absent in Irish-spotted (<italic>s<sup>i</sup>/s<sup>i</sup></italic>) and solid (<italic>S/S</italic>) dogs <xref rid="pone.0104363-Karlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This very strong association between the SINE insertion and the extreme white and piebald phenotypes was confirmed in a subsequent study based on 324 dogs from 45 breeds although a few exceptions from this rule were noted <xref rid="pone.0104363-Schmutz1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The second candidate (SNP#21), a SNP located approximately 1.2 kb upstream of <italic>MITF-M</italic> TSS, occurs in a highly conserved region and the <italic>A</italic> allele at this locus is associated with white spotting alleles <xref rid="pone.0104363-Karlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The third polymorphism is a variable length polymorphism (Lp) approximately 100 bp upstream of the <italic>MITF-M</italic> TSS. Long variants of the Lp (LpWhite) are associated with all three white-spotting alleles (<italic>s<sup>w</sup></italic>, <italic>s<sup>p</sup></italic> and <italic>s<sup>i</sup></italic>), whereas all solid dogs examined carried short Lp variants <xref rid="pone.0104363-Karlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, from here on named LpSolid. The fourth candidate mutation, a 12 bp deletion in exon 1B (Exon1B_del) also showed a very strong association with white spotting. It was found on all <italic>Extreme white</italic> and <italic>Piebald</italic> chromosomes tested, but it was also found in the heterozygous state in 4 out of 76 solid dogs. This previous work showed that the <italic>Extreme white</italic> and <italic>Piebald</italic> alleles share the same sequence variants for the SINE, SNP#21, Lp and Exon1B_del polymorphisms, implying that other sequence variants must explain the phenotypic differences between the two alleles.</p><p>The aims of the current study were two-fold: (<italic>i</italic>) to screen for the presence of the candidate mutations in wolves that are expected to have the <italic>S</italic> wild-type genotype and (<italic>ii</italic>) to evaluate the functional significance of the candidate mutations associated with the <italic>MITF-M</italic> promoter, alone and in combination. Given the high level of conservation across mammals at this region, any mechanistic insights gained in the canine model could also be used to further understand the role of the master melanocyte regulator, MITF.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>MITF</italic> haplotype diversity in wolves</title><p>A causal mutation with a major effect on white spotting is expected to be rare or absent in wolves.

In this analysis, we used a conservative approach and so did not designate new alleles unless supported by multiple clones from the same individual. To confirm the utility of this approach we first confirmed the composition of some alleles previously determined by direct sequencing, followed by a screen of 17 wolves (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104363-t002">Table 2</xref>). The screen revealed an extensive diversity in wolves since as many as 15 alleles were found.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0104363-t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id

The disrupted C<sub>X</sub> mononucleotide repeat (C<sub>7</sub>AC or C<sub>6</sub>AC<sub>3</sub>) observed in 50% of wolf Lp alleles is responsible for the long branch, which separates these haplotypes from the torso.

Whilst only six haplotypes contained the SINE element, these included all haplotypes associated with the piebald and extreme white phenotypes. Three of these (32B+, 35A+ and 35B+) were also observed in wolf. Strikingly, a fourth haplotype (35D&#x02212;) found in wolves was associated with Irish white spotting, in contrast none of the haplotypes found in solid dogs were shared with wolves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104363-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104363-t002">Table 2</xref>). This result shows that Lp alleles cannot on their own be causal for the extreme white and piebald phenotypes, since we found several wolves sharing the Lp alleles associated with these phenotypes.</p><p>The Exon1B-Del polymorphism was screened in all wolf samples and the deletion was only found in wolves from Scandinavia and the allele frequency was estimated at 18% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104363-t001">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, this 12 bp deletion could be a derived mutation in dogs, since we cannot exclude the possibility that the presence of the deletion in Scandinavian wolves could be due to dog-wolf hybridization in the past. However, this result also indicates that it is very unlikely that the Exon1B_Del polymorphism is the sole causal mutation underlying extreme white or piebald white spotting, since such phenotypes are not observed in the Scandinavian wolf population.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Transcriptional activity is affected by the SINE insertion and in particular the length polymorphism (Lp)</title><p>Luciferase reporter assays in human melanoma 624mel cells were performed to test the functional significance of the region containing the SINE insertion located about 3.1 kb upstream of the <italic>MITF-M</italic> TSS and the Lp located within the <italic>MITF-M</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104363-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

White spotting in dogs can be traced back as long as there are written records or dog portraits, and have been present for thousands of years. Changes in coat colour occur during the domestication due to selection against wild-type colour; as a measure to facilitate animal husbandry (less camouflage), to facilitate the identification of undesired domestic/wild crossbred animals or for fashion and because of relaxed purifying selection <xref rid="pone.0104363-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In fact, Columella, the Roman authority on agriculture, wrote already in the first century AD that shepherds prefer white sheep dogs &#x0201c;because it is unlike a wild beast, and sometimes a plain means of distinction is required in the dogs when one is driving off wolves in the obscurity of early morning or even at dusk&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0104363-Forster1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Our previous study demonstrated that the <italic>Extreme white</italic> (<italic>s<sup>w</sup></italic>) allele in Boxers is not associated with coding changes in <italic>MITF</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0104363-Karlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This conclusion was achieved by taking advantage of the fact that the reference individual (Tasha) for the dog genome assembly showed the flash phenotype (<italic>S/s<sup>w</sup></italic>). This allowed us to sequence BACs representing each of the two alleles. A careful examination of the entire non-coding region showing the strongest association to white spotting, combined with a screen across a diverse panel of dogs, revealed four candidate mutations that showed the strongest association to white spotting. The present study demonstrated that none of these four candidates could be the sole causal mutation for <italic>Extreme white</italic>. This is because the four candidate mutations either occur at a relatively high frequency in the wild ancestor of dogs or do not perfectly co-segregate with phenotype among dog breeds. It is possible that these candidate mutations have an effect on pigmentation in wolves and they may even cause some subtle forms of white spotting, as this could be difficult to notice in a wolf with its long fur, basic grey colour and greying with age effect. However, we are convinced that the <italic>Extreme white</italic> allele is not common in wolves, as to the best of our knowledge Extreme white has never been reported in wolves. This colour morph would also be strongly selected against in a natural population due to both the lack of camouflage (except in arctic environments) and the well established association with deafness <xref rid="pone.0104363-Strain1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Our results combined with the previous characterization of the canine <italic>MITF</italic> locus strongly suggest that the different white spotting alleles (<italic>s<sup>w</sup></italic>, <italic>s<sup>p</sup></italic> and <italic>s<sup>i</sup></italic>) are not caused by three independent mutation events, but rather reflect haplotype effects due to different combinations of multiple causative regulatory mutations selected during dog domestication and breed formation. This interpretation is supported by the observation that there is more extensive sequence similarity among the <italic>s<sup>w</sup></italic>, <italic>s<sup>p</sup></italic> and <italic>s<sup>i</sup></italic> haplotypes than between any of these and haplotypes associated with solid colour <xref rid="pone.0104363-Karlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. For instance, <italic>Extreme white</italic> and <italic>Piebald</italic> alleles may share all four candidate mutations examined in this study. Thus, <italic>MITF</italic> in dogs is another example of &#x02018;evolution of alleles&#x02019; by consecutive accumulation of multiple causal mutations that occurs in domestic animals at loci under strong selection <xref rid="pone.0104363-Andersson2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>This study has provided strong genetic and functional evidence that the length polymorphism (Lp) in the <italic>MITF-M</italic> promoter is one of the causal polymorphisms. It is probably the most important regulatory mutation causing decreased <italic>MITF-M</italic> transcription, and consequently affecting white spotting in dogs. Firstly, we have not yet found any overlap between the Lp alleles associated with white-spotting or solid colour in dogs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104363-t002">Table 2</xref>). The white-spotting alleles had a longer C mononucleotide repeat and all, except the one found in Dalmatians, had a longer total repeat region. We detected an extensive genetic diversity of the Lp among wolves. We found as many as 15 different alleles when only examining 17 wolves. A very striking and unexpected observation was the considerable Lp allele-sharing between white-spotting alleles in dogs and wolves, but no allele-sharing between solid alleles and wolf alleles. This is unexpected because <italic>Solid</italic> is assumed to be the wild-type allele at this locus. We propose that the explanation for this pattern is that there has been selection both for and against white spotting (thus for solid colour in the latter case) during dog domestication and breed formation. In the early history of domestication there was selection against wild-type colours, while during breed formation there was selection for breed-specific colour such as white spotting in Boxers and solid black colour in Labradors. A repeat polymorphism like this is expected to have a very dynamic evolution, where new alleles are generated by slippage during DNA replication, consistent with the rich Lp diversity among wolves. Thus, the very tight Lp distribution observed in solid dogs and the lack of overlap with alleles found in wolves is hardly in agreement with selective neutrality.</p><p>The extensive Lp diversity may have no obvious phenotypic effects in wolves, because such effects may depend on epistatic interaction with other sequence polymorphisms not present in wolves at <italic>MITF</italic> or at other loci in the genome. However, it is also possible that the <italic>MITF</italic> polymorphisms contribute to coat colour diversity in wolves, ranging from dark grey to almost white colour. This is worth exploring using samples from phenotypically well-characterized wolves.</p><p>This study also provided functional data supporting the conclusion that the Lp directly affects white spotting. Luciferase reporter constructs containing the longer Lp variants, associated with <italic>Extreme white</italic> (<italic>s<sup>w</sup></italic>) in Boxers and Dalmatians and with the <italic>Irish spotting</italic> (<italic>s<sup>i</sup></italic>) allele in Bernese Mountain Dogs, had all significantly lower activities compared with constructs containing the short Lp <italic>Solid</italic> variant, indicating that the Lp affects <italic>MITF-M</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104363-g003">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104363-g004">4</xref>). The <italic>Extreme white</italic> (<italic>s<sup>w</sup></italic>) and <italic>Solid</italic> Lp variants in Boxers differ in size by four nucleotides, which corresponds to approximately one half turn of the DNA helix. This may have important consequences for the functional interaction between transcription factors binding to either flanking side of the Lp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104363-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Transcription factors that face the same side of the DNA helix in the context of the short Lp <italic>Solid</italic> variant will face opposite sides of the DNA helix in the Lp <italic>White</italic> variant, which is expected to result in reduced capacity to establish functional interaction. Previous studies have shown that transcription is markedly affected when crucial promoter elements are separated by half a helical turn <xref rid="pone.0104363-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104363-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In favour of such a scenario is the cluster of LEF1, SOX10 and PAX3 binding sites which are located approximately 200 bp upstream of the Lp. Importantly, the PAX3 and SOX10 transcription factors have been shown to physically interact and to be critical for <italic>MITF-M</italic> transcription <xref rid="pone.0104363-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Furthermore, a 10 bp insertion that disrupts a PAX3 binding site in the MITF-M promoter is causing the &#x0201c;splashed white&#x0201d; phenotype in horses <xref rid="pone.0104363-Hauswirth1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The corresponding PAX3 site in the dog promoter is the one located between the Lp and the TATA-box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104363-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). LEF1 is known to physically interact with MITF and to be involved in transcriptional self-activation of the <italic>MITF-M</italic> promoter <xref rid="pone.0104363-Saito1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Our data support previous findings from other species that the cluster of LEF1, SOX10 and PAX3 binding sites are crucial for <italic>MITF-M</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104363-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Our data also demonstrate that it is unlikely that the Lp region has a direct effect on transcription factor binding, as we observed no effect of the Lp variants unless the upstream 200 bp region containing the cluster of LEF1, SOX10 and PAX3 sites were included in the construct.</p><p>The SINEC-Cf insertion located about three kb upstream of the <italic>MITF-M</italic> transcription start site had a widespread distribution among wolf populations, implying that this must be an ancestral polymorphism rather than a recent derived mutation. However, the SINE insertion shows a very strong association to the <italic>Extreme white</italic> and <italic>Piebald</italic> haplotypes but is rare or absent among <italic>Solid</italic> and <italic>Irish</italic> spotting haplotypes (those associated with no spotting or the least white spotting). Our reporter assay data suggested that the SINE-region acts as a weak silencer element and that it acts in an additive mode together with the long Lp variants to reduce <italic>MITF-M</italic> promoter activity associated with <italic>s<sup>w</sup></italic> and <italic>s<sup>p</sup></italic>. The mechanism underlying the repressive function of the region containing the SINE insertion remains to be defined, but for example, SINE elements are known to be targets for DNA methylation <xref rid="pone.0104363-Ponicsan1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. It is possible that differential methylation within this region is involved in controlling <italic>MITF-M</italic> transcription. Unfortunately, we have not been able to analyse the <italic>MITF-M</italic> expression or methylation status during different stages of canine melanocyte development due to the implicit difficulties in sampling dog embryos.</p><p>SNP#21 occurs in the vicinity of an evolutionary conserved element but this actual nucleotide position is not strongly conserved. It could be a derived mutation since it is rare in wolves. The association between <italic>SNP#21*A</italic> and white spotting across breeds is far from perfect and the reporter assay did not reveal any effect on transcriptional regulation. However, this does not exclude the possibility that this substitution could have a minor effect on white spotting, as a reporter assay will never perfectly replicate transcriptional regulation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We also provided support for the possibility that the 12 bp deletion in exon 1B is a derived allele that promotes white spotting. This variant was only found in the highly inbred Scandinavian wolves, and was thought unlikely to be causative in the previous study because it was found at a low frequency in some solid dogs <xref rid="pone.0104363-Karlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, the present study has shown that no <italic>MITF</italic> polymorphism shows complete agreement with phenotype and in fact, the insertion in exon 1B, together with the Lp, shows the best concordance with white spotting. The deletion appears to be fixed in dogs with the extreme white and piebald phenotypes, but rare or absent in wolves, solid dogs and dogs with the Irish spotting phenotype. No functional assays were attempted for this polymorphism since it occurs in an exon and in our previous study we concluded that it was unclear if this exon is functional in carnivores <xref rid="pone.0104363-Karlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, recently released RNAseq data (January 2104; Broad CanFam3.1/canFam3; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">http://genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>) show that <italic>MITF</italic> exon 1B is transcribed in dogs and was found in one transcript from blood (CUFF.25976.1) and one from lung (CUFF.27047.1) Both transcripts originated from the derived allele associated with <italic>Extreme white</italic> and <italic>Piebald</italic>. This finding suggests that the 12 bp deletion in exon 1B may very well affect MITF function during the development of melanocytes. Thus, the extensive white spotting in Extreme white and Piebald dogs may be due to the combined effect of mutations affecting <italic>MITF-M</italic> transcription and a coding mutation in exon 1B.</p><p>The luciferase assay indicated that the Lp variant associated with <italic>Irish spotting</italic> had an even lower <italic>MITF-M</italic> promoter activity than the variants associated with <italic>Extreme white</italic> and <italic>Piebald</italic>, although the two latter alleles cause more extensive white spotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104363-g004">Figure 4</xref>). However, this is consistent with our interpretation that canine <italic>MITF</italic> alleles are not due to single mutations but the combined effect of multiple mutations in the <italic>MITF</italic> region. An important difference between <italic>Irish spotting</italic> and <italic>Extreme white</italic>/<italic>Piebald</italic> is that only the two latter alleles carry the SINE insertion upstream of <italic>MITF-1M</italic> and the 12 bp deletion in <italic>MITF-1B</italic>. Another interesting difference between these two groups of alleles is that <italic>s<sup>i</sup>/s<sup>i</sup></italic> homozygotes show a high degree of symmetric white spotting whereas <italic>s<sup>p</sup>/s<sup>p</sup></italic> and <italic>s<sup>w</sup>/s<sup>w</sup></italic> homozygotes show asymmetric white spotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104363-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This is probably not caused by the nature of the underlying mutations but rather a dosage effect, <italic>i.e.</italic> to which extent MITF function is affected during melanocyte development, because <italic>s<sup>w</sup>/S</italic> heterozygotes also show symmetric white spotting.</p><p><italic>MITF</italic> must be one of the loci in the dog genome that has been under strongest positive selection during domestication and breed formation. It is likely that Little's <xref rid="pone.0104363-Little1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> original classification of three white spotting alleles, <italic>Extreme white</italic>, <italic>Piebald</italic> and <italic>Irish spotting</italic>, is an underestimate and that a more extensive allelic diversity is created by combining the variability at the Lp with other sequence variants in the <italic>MITF</italic> region. For instance, Beagles are considered to be homozygous <italic>Piebald</italic> but as Little described, they vary extensively from almost solid coloured to a phenotype mimicking extreme white. It is still an open question whether this variability is caused by genetic heterogeneity at <italic>MITF</italic> or genetic variation at other loci affecting melanocyte development. In order to advance our knowledge about <italic>MITF</italic> it will be essential to make further genetic studies of dogs that are very well characterized for the white spotting phenotype. We recommend that coat colour is carefully registered when performing genome-wide associations studies of other traits or disorders in breeds with a variable white spotting phenotype, like the Beagle. Such studies will reveal the extent to which the variability in white spotting is caused by genetic heterogeneity at <italic>MITF</italic> or if the influence of yet unidentified modifying loci is at play. Furthermore, it is essential to resequence the entire <italic>MITF</italic> region from <italic>Piebald</italic> and <italic>Irish spotting</italic> chromosomes since they may harbour sequence variants in addition to the ones evaluated in the current study, which were detected in a sequence comparison of the <italic>Extreme white</italic> and <italic>Solid</italic> alleles from a single heterozygous dog <xref rid="pone.0104363-Karlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Design of luciferase constructs</title><p>The exact borders for the two genomic regions containing SINE and Lp were chosen based on the 7X regulatory potential and mammalian conservation in the corresponding human regions <xref rid="pone.0104363-Kolbe1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104363-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).
