SGs are currently used in the preparation of medicines, food products and neutraceuticals because of its sweetening property (zero calories and about 300 times sweeter than sugar). Recently, some progress has been made in understanding the biosynthesis of SGs in <italic>Stevia</italic>, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Additionally, the genomics of <italic>Stevia</italic>, a non-model species, remains uncharacterized.

A total of 80,160 unigenes were annotated, and 14,211 of the unique sequences were assigned to specific metabolic pathways by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Gene sequences of all enzymes known to be involved in SG synthesis were examined. A total of 143 UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT) unigenes were identified, some of which might be involved in SG biosynthesis.

Among 230 species of this genus, only two <italic>Stevia</italic> species (<italic>S. rebaudiana</italic> and <italic>S. phlebophylla</italic>) can produce SGs (steviol glycosides) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. SGs are non-caloric and non-cariogenic sweeteners with functional and sensory properties superior to many other high-potency sweeteners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Because of their sweetening property (zero calories and about 300 times sweeter than sugar), SGs have been used widely in the preparation of medicines, beverages and neutraceuticals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In general, SGs accumulate in <italic>Stevia</italic> leaves. Depending on the genotype and the growing and harvesting conditions, the concentration varies from 10% to 20% of the dry weight of leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Currently, <italic>Stevia</italic> is a major source of natural SGs, which have received increasingly greater interest among different research fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The SG produced by <italic>Stevia</italic> is a mixture of at least eight different types, including ST (stevioside), RA-RF (rebaudiosides A-F), rubusoside and dulcoside A, a new diterpene glycoside recently isolated from <italic>Stevia</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Some progress has been made in understanding the biosynthetic pathway of SGs, including the identification of 17 steps catalyzed by different enzymes. The initial seven steps are similar to steps within the MEP (methyl erythritol-4-phosphate) pathway, catalyzing pyruvate to isopentenyl diphosphate. Several genes have been demonstrated to be involved in the first seven steps, including <italic>DXS</italic>, <italic>DXR</italic>, <italic>MCT</italic>, <italic>CMK</italic>, <italic>MDS</italic>, <italic>HDS</italic>, <italic>HDR</italic> and <italic>IDI</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The GA (gibberellic acid) biosynthetic pathway (from isopentenyl diphosphate to kaurenoic acid) is involved in the next five pathways, in which 4 genes (<italic>GGDPS</italic>, <italic>CPPS</italic>, <italic>KS</italic> and <italic>KO</italic>) are thought to participate. The last five steps, from kaurenoic acid to RA, are specific to the SG biosynthetic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Four genes, including <italic>GGDPS</italic>, <italic>CPPS</italic>, <italic>KS</italic> and <italic>KO</italic> are involved in the last five steps. Additionally, P450-dependent monooxygenases and glycosyltransferases are assumed to be involved in the modification of the triterpenoid backbone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and UGTs (UDP-glycosyltransferases), including <italic>UGT85C2</italic>, <italic>UGT74G1</italic> and <italic>UGT76G1</italic>, are also proposed to participate in the RA biosynthetic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although the biosynthetic pathway of SGs has been extensively studied, the mechanism of biosynthesis and the genes involved in the pathway remain poorly understood.</p><p>SGs are the sweetest known natural sweeteners, but the taste perception of different SGs is strong depending on their patterns of glycosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Among different SGs, RA has a much better taste perception than ST, which is being applied as a substitute for saccharose and is used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, RA is a good replacement of ST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Many plant culture practices aiming to increase the leaf yield and RA content have been studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, molecular biology techniques have been scarcely used in the improvement of SG accumulation in <italic>Stevia</italic>, mostly due to the absence of available sequence information. Currently, there are only 160 sequences originating from <italic>Stevia</italic> that are available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. For this reason, it is difficult to isolate functional genes that govern important quality and agronomic traits of <italic>Stevia</italic>.</p><p>RNA-Seq, based on next-generation sequencing technology, is emerging as an attractive approach to understand transcriptome profiling. RNA-Seq provides a far more precise measurement of transcripts than other methods and has been successfully used for annotation, transcript profiling and/or SNP discovery in a number of plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, unlike microarrays, RNA-Seq does not require prior knowledge of gene sequences. In this study, we used Illumina RNA-Seq technology for identifying genes associated with SG biosynthesis in three <italic>Stevia</italic> geneotypes with different RA and ST contents. In total, 191,590,282 high-quality reads were generated, and 80,160 unigenes were obtained by <italic>de novo</italic> assembly. A total of 10,070 SSRs and 44,510 SNPs were also identified, which might be useful for <italic>Stevia</italic> molecular research. We also identified 636,2,464 and 2,041 unigenes with differential expression levels in SR-1, SR-2, and SR-3, as well as homologs of several unigenes involved in the SG biosynthetic pathway. Our study provides a platform of sequence information for global discovery of novel functional genes involved in the biosynthesis of SGs and demonstrates the powerful ability of high-throughput sequencing to identify candidate genes involved in novel metabolic pathways in non-model plant systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussions</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The leaves of three <italic>Stevia</italic>genotypes (SR-1, SR-2 and SR-3) have dramatically different amounts of ST and RA</title><p>To select different genotypes of <italic>Stevia</italic> for comprehensive characterization of genes associated with SG (especially ST and RA) biosynthesis, we used HPLC to analyze the ST and RA contents in the leaves from three <italic>Stevia</italic> genotypes (SR-1, SR-2 and SR-3). SR-1 had relatively higher RA, with 2.19% ST and 6.91% RA, whereas SR-2 had a preponderance of ST (12.87% ST and 0.02% RA).

All 20 primer pairs had amplicons in 3 <italic>Stevia</italic> varieties (SR_1, SR_2 and SR_3), of which 5 primer pairs showed polymorphism and this results indicated that molecular markers could be used for marker-assisted breeding in <italic>Stevia</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S2). As an alternative to SSRs, 44,510 SNP variations (in 11,000 unigenes) were also identified among the three genotypes (Additional files <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>).

We used the normalized-RPKM (reads per kilobase per million) to quantify the transcript level in reads, which facilitated the comparison of mRNA levels both within and between samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The three genotypes showed similar RPKM density distribution (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), which suggested that the transcript profiles of the three samples were similar. The RPKM density distribution of the three samples also showed that the transcripts were enriched at the RPKM region between 0.3 and 3.57; the percentages of transcripts in this region were 38.11%, 43.55% and 33.89% in SR-1, SR-2 and SR-3, respectively (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We identified the most abundantly expressed unigenes in <italic>Stevia</italic> leaf because they were considered important for <italic>Stevia</italic> development. We focused on the top 2% (598 unigenes) most highly expressed genes of each sample (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>). The RPKM of those unigenes were greater than 156, 163 and 186 in SR-1, SR-2 and SR-3, respectively. Interestingly, the abundantly expressed unigenes in the three samples were enriched in metabolic pathways according to both KEGG and GO analysis. This suggested that the genes involved in metabolism be dominant in the three genotypes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figures S3 and S4), and many metabolism products, such as SGs, be presented in <italic>Stevia</italic>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>

Consequently, we sought to analyze the differentially expressed unigenes in order to identify candidate genes involved in ST and RA biosynthesis. The DEGSeq program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] was used to identify the differentially expressed unigenes among SR-1, SR-2 and SR-3. For SR-1 vs SR-2, 636 unigenes were differentially expressed, including 248 genes that were obviously up-regulated in SR-1 and 388 genes that were obviously down-regulated. For SR-1 vs SR-3, 2,464 unigenes were differentially expressed (1,185 up-regulated and 1,279 down-regulated in SR-1), and for SR-3 vs SR-2, 2,041 unigenes were differentially expressed (1,156 up-regulated and 1,246 down-regulated in SR-3). Among these differentially expressed genes, 114 genes were differentially expressed among all threes genotypes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>

The 636 unigenes with differential expression between SR-1 and SR-2 were classified into 95 pathways by KEGG analysis, with clear enrichment in metabolic pathways (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S5A). Because the amount of ST in SR-1 was significantly lower than SR-2 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), some of the 248 up-regulated unigenes of SR-1 vs SR-2 were likely to be directly or indirectly involved in ST biosynthesis. Similarly, because the amount of RA in SR-1 was significantly higher than SR-2, some of the 338 down-regulated unigenes were likely to participate in the RA biosynthetic pathway. In support of these data, both the down-regulated and up-regulated unigenes were enriched in metabolic pathways as determined by KEGG analysis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S5B and C). The unigenes of SR-3 vs SR-2 were also enriched in metabolic pathways by KEGG analysis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S6A). However, the occurrence of 2,041 unigenes with differential expressions between SR-3 and SR-2 suggested that other differences may contribute to the relatively larger number of differentially expressed unigenes. The down-regulated and up-regulated unigenes of SR-3 vs SR-2 were enriched in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and metabolic pathways, consistent with roles in ST and RA biosynthesis, respectively (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S6B and C). In total, 315 overlapping unigenes were similar between the two comparisons (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>), which might narrow down the identification of genes that directly participate in the RA and ST biosynthetic pathway. As an example, one of the 315 unigenes (comp68371_c0; predicted as UGT76G1) is reported to be involved in the SG biosynthetic pathway. Additionally, two cytochrome P450s (comp57120_c0 and comp70800_c1), beta-1,3-glucanase (comp67196_c0) and beta-1,4-xylosidase (comp32324_c0) are good candidates for the SG biosynthetic pathway because they have all been reported to participate in the biosynthesis of SG precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, because the RA and ST amounts in SR-1 and SR-3 were similar, the overlapping unigenes of SR-1 vs SR-3 might also be helpful for excluding unigenes that were not significantly associated with the RA and ST biosynthetic pathways. We found 114 overlapping unigenes with SR-1 vs SR-3. Exclusion of these 114 unigenes from the 315 overlapping unigenes for SR-1 vs SR-2 and SR-3 vs SR-2 left 201 remaining unigenes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>), which were much more likely to be involved in the ST and RA biosynthetic pathways. This gene set included comp56279_c0 and comp57120_c0, which were predicted to encode UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>The expression pattern of genes involved in the SG biosynthetic pathway</title><p>Seventeen steps catalyzed by various enzymes have been identified in the SG biosynthetic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

All 3 samples had RIN values above 8.0. Sequencing libraries were generated using Illumina TruSeq&#x02122; RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA) following manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations, and 3 index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-linked magnetic beads. Fragmentation was carried out using divalent cations under elevated temperature in Illumina proprietary fragmentation buffer. First strand cDNA was synthesized using random oligonucleotides and SuperScript II. Second strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. Remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities and enzymes were removed. After adenylation of 3&#x02032; ends of DNA fragments, Illumina PE adapter oligonucleotides were ligated to prepare for hybridization. To select cDNA fragments of preferentially 200&#x000a0;bp in length the library fragments were purified with AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA). DNA fragments with ligated adaptor molecules on both ends were selectively enriched using Illumina PCR Primer Cocktail in a 10&#x000a0;cycle PCR reaction. Products were purified (AMPure XP system) and quantified using the Agilent high sensitivity DNA assay on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.

The left files (read1 files) from all libraries/samples were pooled into one big left.fq file, and right files (read2 files) into one big right.fq file. Transcriptome assembly was accomplished based on the left.fq and right.fq files using Trinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] with min_kmer_cov set to 2 and all other parameters set to default.

After sequence assembly, the unigene sequences were also aligned by BLASTX to protein databases such as Swiss-Prot, KEGG and COG, in order to retrieve proteins with the highest sequence similarity to the given unigenes along with putative functional annotations.

The GOseq method works with any procedure for identifying DEGs. Second, the likelihood of DEGs as a function of transcript length was quantified by fitting a monotonic function to DEGs versus transcript length. Finally, the DEGs versus length function was incorporated into the statistical test of each category&#x02019;s significance. This final step took into account the lengths of the genes that make up each category. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs was done using KOBAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. KOBAS is a standalone commandline program written in Python (2.3.4). It consists of three modules: kparser, blast2ko and pathfind.

The parsed information was managed with SQLite, a small C library that implements a self-contained, embeddable and zero-configuration SQL database engine. Blast2ko automatically annotated a set of new sequences (in FASTA format) with KO functional terms. Pathfind identified both the frequent and the enriched pathways in a given set of sequences.
