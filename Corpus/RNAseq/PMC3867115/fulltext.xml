Despite evident economic significance of these findings, the mechanism behind this increased resistance remained elusive. In this study, we found that increased resistance of the <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutants is due to constitutive activation of induced systemic resistance (ISR) signaling. We showed that <italic>ZmLOX3</italic> lacked expression in leaves in response to anthracnose leaf blight pathogen <italic>Colletotrichum graminicola</italic>, but was expressed constitutively in the roots, thus, prompting our hypothesis: the roots of <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutants are the source of increased resistance in leaves. Supporting this hypothesis, treatment of wild-type plants (WT) with xylem sap of <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutant induced resistance to <italic>C. graminicola</italic> to the levels comparable to those observed in <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutant. Moreover, treating mutants with the sap collected from WT plants partially restored the susceptibility to <italic>C. graminicola</italic>. <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutants showed primed defense responses upon infection, which included earlier and greater induction of defense-related PAL and GST genes compared to WT. In addition to the greater expression of the octadecanoid pathway genes, <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutant responded earlier and with a greater accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in response to <italic>C. graminicola</italic> infection or treatment with alamethicin. These findings suggest that <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutants display constitutive ISR-like signaling. In support of this idea, root colonization by <italic>Trichoderma virens</italic> strain GV29-8 induced the same level of disease resistance in WT as the treatment with the mutant sap, but had no additional resistance effect in <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutant. While treatment with <italic>T. virens</italic> GV29 strongly and rapidly suppressed Zm<italic>LOX3</italic> expression in hydroponically grown WT roots, <italic>T. virens</italic> &#x00394;sml mutant, which is deficient in ISR induction, was unable to suppress expression of <italic>ZmLOX3</italic>, thus, providing genetic evidence that SM1 function in ISR, at least in part, by suppressing host <italic>ZmLOX3</italic> gene. This study and the genetic tools generated herein will allow the identification of the signals regulating the induction of resistance to aboveground attackers by beneficial soil microorganisms in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>beneficial microorganisms</kwd><kwd>oxylipin</kwd><kwd>priming</kwd><kwd>hydrogen peroxide</kwd><kwd>root-to-shoot signaling</kwd><kwd><italic>Trichoderma</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Colletotrichum graminicola</italic></kwd><kwd>long distance signaling</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="53"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="9152"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants have evolved primary and secondary defense strategies to recognize and protect themselves against their enemies, rendering them resistant to the majority of their pests (Balmer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2013b</xref>; Fu and Dong, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2013</xref>). The primary defensive layer is often built upon constitutively present defensive structures or molecules, such as, thorns, needles, trichomes, cell wall barriers, and preformed antimicrobial compounds (Pieterse et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2009</xref>; Balmer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2013a</xref>). However, many microbes and herbivores are able to breach this primary layer of defense. To overcome the attenuation, host plants utilize a secondary defensive strategy that is often associated with sophisticated mechanisms of induced resistance (Van der Ent et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2009a</xref>). Such inducible defense is often characterized by increased resistance against a broad-spectrum of potential pests both locally and systemically in the distal parts from the site of primary invasion (Spoel and Dong, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2012</xref>; Balmer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2013a</xref>; Walters et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2013</xref>). This mechanism, known as systemic acquired resistance (SAR), is employed by plants to restrict pathogen expansion in systemic tissue through necrosis at the local site upon primary infection, and typically characterized by the increased level of salicylic acid (SA) and activation of SA-responsive genes, such as those encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins (Durrant and Dong, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2004</xref>; Vlot et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2008</xref>).</p><p>Another class of inducible defense, known as &#x0201c;induced systemic resistance&#x0201d; (ISR) is activated upon colonization of roots by mutualistic microbes (Choudhary et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2007</xref>; Pozo and Azcon-Aguilar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2007</xref>; Van Wees et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2008</xref>; Van der Ent et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2009a</xref>; Shoresh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2010</xref>; Balmer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2013b</xref>; Walters et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2013</xref>). A number of beneficial microorganisms are known to induce ISR in monocots and dicots through ethylene (ET) and jasmonate (JA)-dependent signaling pathways (Van der Ent et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2009b</xref>). Previous studies have shown that colonization of maize roots by <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. triggers systemic resistance to foliar infection by <italic>Colletotrichum graminicola.</italic> Various elicitors of ISR have been isolated from <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp., and a recent study has shown that a secreted hydrophobin-like elicitor, SM1, plays an essential role in the elicitation of ISR in maize and other crops, as &#x00394;<italic>sm1</italic> mutant lacks the ability to induce ISR (Djonovic et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2007</xref>).</p><p>There are a number of differences between SAR and ISR. JA, ET (Bostock, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2005</xref>; Thaler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2012</xref>), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including green leaf volatiles (GLVs) (Pieterse et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2009</xref>; Mathys et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2012</xref>; Weller et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2012</xref>; Balmer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2013b</xref>) are implicated as signals in ISR, while SA and its methyl derivative, along with several other recently identified metabolites might act as the signaling molecules in SAR. It is reported that activation of several PR proteins, e.g., PR1, PR2, and PR5 are not associated with the ISR pathway (Van Wees et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">1999</xref>; Ryu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2004</xref>; Ton et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2007</xref>), and generally ISR is independent of the SA signaling pathway (Pieterse et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">1996</xref>). It has been argued that due to the fitness costs of constitutively expressing ISR or SAR, plants have evolved these inducible mechanisms when encountered with pathogens or insects that break through their first layer of defense (Heil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2001</xref>; Heil and Baldwin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2002</xref>). Thus, a number of negative regulators of these JA- and SA-inducible pathways have likely evolved coordinately (Chini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2007</xref>; Hu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2013</xref>).upon appropriate stimulation, such us some interaction with pathogens, insects or mutualistic microorganisms, a unique physiological state known as &#x0201c;priming&#x0201d; can be induced. Priming involves subtle regulation of defense related pathways in local and systemic tissues that follow faster and/or greater induction of defense mechanisms upon future encounters (Conrath et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2006</xref>). Priming protects plants against a broad range of biotic (Conrath et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2006</xref>) as well as abiotic challenges (Harman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2004</xref>; Waller et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2005</xref>; Baltruschat et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2008</xref>; Mastouri et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2012</xref>) and ecological studies have shown that the benefits associated with priming outweighs the cost (van Hulten et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43a">2006</xref>).</p><p>In our previous studies (Gao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>; Isakeit et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2007</xref>), we found that disruption of a 9-lipoxygense (9-LOX) of maize, <italic>ZmLOX3</italic>, resulted in a remarkable increase in resistance to multiple seed, root, leaf, and stem fungal pathogens, including seed contaminating mycotoxin-producing <italic>Fusarium verticillioides</italic>, southern leaf blight caused by <italic>Cochliobolus heterostrophus</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and stalk rots caused by both <italic>F. verticillioides</italic> and <italic>C. graminicola</italic>, respectively. Although this resistance is effective against a broad range of pathogens in diverse organs, but regardless of infection, <italic>ZmLOX3</italic> transcripts are hardly detectable in the aboveground organs (Gao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>). Moreover, changes of a set of defense-related genes, including JA/SA/ET-responsive and biosynthetic genes, as well as endogenous levels of JA, SA, and ET were specifically elevated in the roots, but not in the leaves of <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutants (Gao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>). This prompted our major hypothesis tested in this study: the abnormal constitutive activation of all three major defense pathways in the roots of <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutant are responsible for the production of yet to be identified signal(s) responsible for constitutively active systemic resistance in all aboveground organs of maize against distantly-related pathogens.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Colletotrichum graminicola</italic> susceptibility factor, <italic>ZmLOX3</italic>, accumulates preferentially in belowground tissue of maize.

Defense related genes are upregulated in both local and systemic tissues of the host as early as 12 h post inoculation (hpi) (Vargas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2012</xref>; Balmer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2013b</xref>), and continue to increase to peak at ~60 hpi when the pathogen switches to the necrotrophic stage of its life cycle. These findings indicate that the pathogen does not suppress the common defense mechanisms of the host. Instead, it has been suggested that <italic>C. graminicola</italic> switches lifestyles to evade the increasing host defense machinery against biotrophic pathogens (Vargas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2012</xref>). Defense, therefore, seems life-style dependent on a subset of distinct biochemical processes. Maize plants accumulate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in cells adjacent to the fungal hyphae, suggesting its involvement in defense against <italic>C. graminicola</italic> (Vargas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2012</xref>) and in promoting cell wall lignification around the site of pathogen penetration (Torres and Dangl, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40a">2005</xref>). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation is suggested to limit growth of hemibiotrophic fungi such as <italic>Septoria tritici</italic> during both biotrophic and necrotrophic stages (Shetty et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2007</xref>), while the pathogenicity of the <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> is shown to be directly related to the ability to scavenge and detoxify ROS (Huang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2011</xref>).</p><p>To test our hypothesis and probe the molecular mechanism underlying the systemic resistance observed in <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutant, as well as to identify the potential molecules responsible for ISR-like activity, we performed a series of experiments using the xylem sap collected from <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutant roots. We found that WT plants treated with the sap of <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutant showed enhanced resistance to <italic>C. graminicola</italic>, which was almost identical to the levels of ISR induced in WT maize when colonized by the beneficial fungus <italic>T. virens</italic>, and the resistance levels observed in the untreated <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutant. However, no such ISR-like activity was observed in either WT or <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutant in response to xylem exudates from WT, suggesting the constitutive nature of ISR signaling in the <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutant. The results of comparative gene expression revealed that ISR-inducing strain of <italic>T. virens</italic> down-regulates <italic>ZmLOX3</italic> in host roots. In contrast, the mutant strain, in which ISR-inducing SM1 protein was deleted, was not able to suppress expression of <italic>ZmLOX3</italic>. These results explain for the first time the molecular mechanism of the remarkable resistance of <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutant to multiple pathogens, and implicate the <italic>ZmLOX3</italic> gene as a target for SM1-mediated ISR elicitation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant and fungal materials</title><p>The <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutants were identified using a reverse genetics resource generated by <italic>Mu</italic>-transposable element-insertional mutagenesis as described previously (Gao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2008</xref>). Both the mutant and wild type plants (WT) are near-isogenic lines (NILs) at the backcross 7 (BC7) genetic stage in the B73 background. In addition to B73, the <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutant allele has been backcrossed into FR2128 four times (BC<sub>4</sub>), and the increased resistance of <italic>lox3-4</italic> in this genetic background is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>. For the remaining experiments, the mutant in the B73 genetic background was used so that it can be directly compared to the B73 line (hereafter designated WT). The mutant and WT seeds were grown at approximately 25&#x02013;28&#x000b0;C in commercial soil (Metro-Mix 366; Scotts-Sierra Horticultural Products, Marysville, OH, U.S.A.) under 14 h of daylight with 150 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (Quantum Meter; Apogee Instruments, Logan, UT, U.S.A.). The seedlings were grown in long conical tubes (20.5 by 4 cm) for 2&#x02013;3 weeks until they had three fully expanded leaves (V3 developmental stage). To study the effect of root colonization by <italic>T. virens</italic> on <italic>C. graminicola</italic> disease development, WT and <italic>lox3-4</italic> seed were treated with <italic>T. virens</italic> GV29-8 strain according to Djonovic et al.

This system was chosen to prevent contamination with microbes and allow root sampling with minimal mechanical damage (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1A</xref>). Briefly, disinfected seeds were germinated over 2 days on LDB medium and microbe-free germinated seedlings were transferred to hydroponic vessels containing half-strength Murashige and Skoog (1/2 MS) medium amended with Gamborg's vitamins (pH = 5.6) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A).

The first droplet of sap was discarded and subsequent droplets were collected for 8 h and stored on ice. The plants were periodically recut when cut site sealed, the next droplets were discarded as above. Sap collected from plants of the same genotype was mixed thoroughly before freezing in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until needed for the experiments. B73 plants were grown to the V4 stage to match the developmental stage of the collected sap. WT and <italic>lox3</italic>-<italic>4</italic> sap were thawed and diluted 1:1 with sterile distilled water to reduce viscosity. Plants were placed horizontally in a sterilized tray and two 1 cm long incisions were made between the first and second leaves (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1C</xref>). The incisions were made halfway through the depth of the stem so as not to puncture the backside, and then 50 &#x003bc;l of diluted sap was added to each incision. Masking tape was used to seal the wound sites and to ensure that the sap did not leak out.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction, semi-Q-RT-PCR and Q-RT-PCR analysis</title><p>Leaves from the mutant and WT plants were harvested at designated times after inoculation and were immediately frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>, and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.

Total RNA was extracted from tissues using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH, U.S.A) and treated with DNase according to the manufacturer's instructions (RNase-free DNase kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA, U.S.A). For semi-quantitative PCR (semi-Q-RT-PCR) experiments, 1 &#x003bc;g of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis as described previously (Gao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>) with GAPc used as a reference gene.</p><p>For quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) assays, a one-step qPCR procedure was performed using Thermo Scientific Verso One-Step RT-qPCR Kits (Thermo Scientific, Waltha, MA, U.S.A). Reactions were optimized for RNA and primer concentrations with each 10 &#x003bc; l reaction consisting of 40 ng of DNase-free RNA and 200 nM primers. Q-RT-PCR analysis was performed with an Applied Biosystem StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR instrument. Primers used in this study are described in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">1</xref>. The PCR program consisted of a 15 min cDNA synthesis step at 50&#x000b0;C, followed by polymerase activation step of 15 min at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95&#x000b0;C, 30 s at 56&#x000b0;C, and 30 s at 72&#x000b0;C followed by a melt curve analysis.

One of the functions of SM1-mediated signaling is the down-regulation of expression of the host gene, <italic>ZmLOX3</italic>, which, in turn, results in de-repression of several defense and signaling host molecules including 9/13-LOX products (such as JA, traumatin, green leaf volatiles, or other oxylipins derived either from C18:3 or C18:2 polyunsaturated fatty acids) and ET. Some of these metabolites, their derivatives or their precursors are transported via xylem into aboveground organs where they signal changes in transcription of a number of defense-related genes including, upregulation of pathogenesis-related genes (e.g., PR5), phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), several defense related LOXs such as LOX1, LOX2, LOX9, and other genes required for biosynthesis of JA, ROS, NO, and cell-wall fortification (e.g., lignin), phytoalexins, and other defense-related metabolites. In addition to up-regulation of defense genes, the host susceptibility genes that promote colonization of tissues by diverse pathogens are down-regulated. This includes LOX10 and LOX5 genes shown to promote disease (Christensen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2009</xref>; Park, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2011</xref>). Collectively, these reprogramming in metabolome and transcriptome results in heightened defense status known as ISR in systemic tissues leading to increased resistance upon pathogen attack.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-04-00510-g0008"/></fig><p>Interestingly, both <italic>ZmLOX5</italic> and <italic>ZmLOX10</italic> were down-regulated in response to <italic>C. graminicola</italic> in leaves of WT plants treated with <italic>lox3-4</italic> sap, while in plants treated with WT sap, <italic>ZmLOX5</italic> expression was similar to control and <italic>ZmLOX10</italic> was up-regulated. Our previous work showed that both <italic>lox5</italic> (Park, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2011</xref>) and <italic>lox10</italic> (Christensen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2009</xref>) mutants were more resistant to <italic>C. graminicola</italic>, suggesting that these two genes are susceptibility factors in maize. Suppression of these two genes in the <italic>lox3-4-</italic>sap treated plants is a logical explanation of yet another mechanism behind increased resistance in <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The role of these genes in the <italic>lox3</italic> mutant background is currently under investigation through generation of double mutants in our laboratory.</p><p>Previous analyses showed that JA, ET, SA, and genes involved in JA biosynthesis pathway including <italic>LOX8</italic>, <italic>AOS</italic>, <italic>AOC</italic>, and ethylene biosynthesis gene <italic>ACO31</italic>, are up-regulated in <italic>lox3-4</italic> maize roots (Gao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2008</xref>). These findings suggest that JA and/or ethylene may themselves be mobile signals present in the <italic>lox3-4</italic> sap that activate systemic resistance. Alternatively, increased JA/ethylene levels result in transcriptional activation of other pathways that produce the systemic mobile signal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p><p>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NO are synergistic in their signaling of defense responses, especially to biotrophs and hemibiotrophs (Mittler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2004</xref>; Besson-Bard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2008</xref>). Earlier and higher accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NO in response to <italic>C. graminicola</italic> and/or ALA treatment together with earlier induction and greater expression of diverse set of defense related genes, <italic>PR1</italic>, <italic>PAL</italic>, <italic>GST</italic>, and <italic>MPI</italic>, in <italic>lox3-4</italic> leaves may explain the increased resistance of this mutant. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was shown to limit growth of hemibiotroph <italic>Septoria tritici</italic> (Shetty et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2007</xref>) and the ability to scavenge and detoxify ROS is directly related to growth and virulence of hemibiotroph <italic>M. oryzea</italic> (Huang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2011</xref>) and necrotroph <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic> (Veluchamy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2012</xref>). In <italic>C. graminicola</italic> infected B73, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> started to accumulate at ~36 hpi, which is similar to previous reports (Vargas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2012</xref>). However, <italic>lox3-4</italic> mutants started to accumulate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> earlier (~24 hpi). In addition to direct effect on fungal growth, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is associated with cell wall lignification and cross-linking of cell wall proteins that further limits fungal growth. Continued increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> when fungi enter the necrotrophic stage is suggested to contribute to plant cell death and disease development. <italic>lox3-4</italic> leaves continued to accumulate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> even at ~72 hpi, during the necrotrophic stage. Significant increase of <italic>GST</italic> expression in the leaves of mutant plants compared to wild type may help explain the lesser extent of necrotrophic lesion in these plants compared to WT, since GST is associated with quantitative disease resistance in maize and is implicated in resistance to multiple maize diseases (Wisser et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2011</xref>).</p><p>A recent study has implicated an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> 9-lipoxygenase, AtLOX5, and its 9-oxylipins in susceptibility to foliar green peach aphid (GPA) (Nalam et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2012</xref>), and showed that the movement of GPA inducible 9-oxylipins via xylem sap facilitate GPA growth and host colonization. These studies and our previous reports (Gao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>; Christensen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2009</xref>; Park, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2011</xref>) identified <italic>AtLOX5</italic>, <italic>ZmLOX3, ZmLOX5</italic>, and <italic>ZmLOX10</italic> as &#x0201c;susceptibility factors&#x0201d; and possible targets for pathogen or insects manipulation. This raises the question of why these genes have perpetuated throughout plant evolution. The unprecedented observation that <italic>ZmLOX3</italic> is downregulated by a beneficial root-colonizing fungus provides a possible explanation. Ubiquitous <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. with a wide host range may naturally downregulate this and/or other LOX genes in the host leading to de-repression/activation of ISR only when needed. The ecological cost of expressing secondary defense mechanisms such as SAR and ISR justifies the presence of their negative regulators at one or multiple layers, whose down-regulation in response to environmental cues allows for initiation and activation of the secondary defense processes. Besides <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp., other ISR inducing microorganisms interact with maize roots in the rhizosphere and it is yet to be seen whether suppression of 9-LOXs by mutualistic rhizosphere microbes such as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria is conserved. Whether this gene is permanently suppressed in colonized plants remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr. Seth Murray, Texas A&#x00026;M University and his graduate and undergraduate students for the continuous help with field-related part of our research program.
