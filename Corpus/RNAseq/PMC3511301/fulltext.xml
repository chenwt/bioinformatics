Both in soil and <italic>in planta</italic>, rhizobia spend non-growing periods resembling the stationary phase of <italic>in vitro</italic>-cultured bacteria. The primary objective of this work was to better characterize gene regulation in this biologically relevant growth stage in <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic>. By a tap-tag/mass spectrometry approach, we identified five sigma factors co-purifying with the RNA polymerase in stationary phase: the general stress response regulator RpoE2, the heat shock sigma factor RpoH2, and three extra-cytoplasmic function sigma factors (RpoE1, RpoE3 and RpoE4) belonging to the poorly characterized ECF26 subgroup. We then showed that RpoE1 and RpoE4 i) are activated upon metabolism of sulfite-generating compounds (thiosulfate and taurine), ii) display overlapping regulatory activities, iii) govern a dedicated sulfite response by controlling expression of the sulfite dehydrogenase SorT, iv) are activated in stationary phase, likely as a result of endogenous sulfite generation during bacterial growth. We showed that SorT is required for optimal growth of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> in the presence of sulfite, suggesting that the response governed by RpoE1 and RpoE4 may be advantageous for bacteria in stationary phase either by providing a sulfite detoxification function or by contributing to energy production through sulfite respiration. This paper therefore reports the first characterization of ECF26 sigma factors, the first description of sigma factors involved in control of sulphur metabolism, and the first indication that endogenous sulfite may act as a signal for regulation of gene expression upon entry of bacteria in stationary phase.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by the D&#x000e9;partement Sant&#x000e9; des Plantes et Environnement of INRA.

In laboratory conditions, starvation is mimicked by exhaustion of a growth-limiting element from the culture medium, most often the carbon source, and leads bacterial cells to transit from exponential growth to the so-called stationary phase, characterized by the absence of visible growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Nystrm1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-NavarroLlorens1">[2]</xref>. Bacteria have evolved a number of different strategies that make them able to survive these famine periods. Those strategies mainly rely on global reorganization of gene expression, resulting in a number of morphological, physiological and metabolic changes, some of which confer multiple stress resistance to the cells and thus improve their ability to survive on the long term <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-NavarroLlorens1">[2]</xref>. Among the regulators involved in this reprogramming are alternative sigma factors, which by associating with RNA polymerase (RNAP) change its specificity of promoter recognition. In exponential phase, the vegetative sigma factor is responsible for the transcription of housekeeping genes. At the onset of stationary phase, various signals and mechanisms make alternative sigma factors available for interacting with the core RNAP, thus allowing the holoenzyme to recognize new promoters and express new sets of genes. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the master general stress response regulator RpoS is the main sigma factor in charge of gene expression in stationary phase, as it controls the transcription of several hundreds of genes involved in functions as diverse as acquisition of multiple stress resistance, redirection of metabolism or structuration of the cell envelope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Hengge1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Battesti1">[4]</xref>. Other alternative sigma factors, such as the heat shock sigma factor RpoH or the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor RpoE are also active at the end of exponential phase and upon entry in stationary phase, respectively, and mainly control the expression of chaperones and proteases involved in folding and degradation of cytoplasmic and secreted proteins, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Fredriksson1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Costanzo1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Wagner1">[7]</xref>.</p><p><italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterium belonging to the &#x003b1;-subclass of Proteobacteria.

Nevertheless, double <italic>rpoH1 rpoH2</italic> mutants have a strong symbiotic phenotype (absence of root nodules) which suggests that both sigma factors may have partly redundant functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Ono1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Bittner1">[25]</xref>.

The objective of this work was to explore the possibility that other sigma factors, in addition to RpoE2, are among these regulators. Using a combined tandem affinity purification/mass spectrometry approach, we identified RpoH2, RpoE1, RpoE2, RpoE3 and RpoE4 as possible interactors of the RNAP in stationary phase, which suggests that these sigma factors may be active under this condition. According to a recent classification RpoE1, RpoE3 and RpoE4 belong to the same subgroup (known as ECF26) of ECF sigma factors, which are poorly characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Staron1">[31]</xref>. RpoE1 and RpoE4 were further studied here and suggested to be directly or indirectly activated by endogenous generation of sulfite, either naturally upon entry in stationary phase, or upon metabolism of exogenously added sulfonated compounds. Interestingly, RpoE4 controls a response required for efficient growth in the presence of sulfite, suggesting that it may be advantageous for bacteria in stationary phase by providing either a sulfite detoxification function or an energy input through sulfite respiration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions</title><p>The strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050768-t001">Table 1</xref>. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37&#x000b0;C. <italic>S. meliloti</italic> strains were grown at 28&#x000b0;C, either in LB medium supplemented with 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (LBMC; strain constructions and precultures), or in Vincent minimal medium (VMM; 7.35 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5.74 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 18.7 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 456 &#x000b5;M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 35 &#x000b5;M FeCl<sub>3</sub>, 4 &#x000b5;M biotine, 48.5 &#x000b5;M H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>, 10 &#x000b5;M MnSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 &#x000b5;M ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 &#x000b5;M CuSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.27 &#x000b5;M CoCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 &#x000b5;M NaMoO<sub>4</sub>; pH&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7) containing either 10 mM sodium succinate (VMMS), or 100 mM taurine (liquid VMMT) or 20 mM taurine (solid VMMT) as carbon sources.

Five alternative sigma factors were found among these proteins: the general stress response regulator RpoE2, the heat shock sigma factor RpoH2 and three extracytoplasmic function sigma factors (RpoE1, RpoE3 and RpoE4) belonging to the poorly characterized ECF26 subgroup.

A common feature of thiosulfate and taurine metabolisms is the generation of sulfite that could therefore be the actual stimulus for activation of RpoE1 and RpoE4. However, RpoE1 and RpoE4 activation in stationary phase was observed in minimal medium without addition of any known sulfite-generating compound. The following data suggest that RpoE1 and RpoE4 are activated in stationary phase by endogenous bacterial production of sulfite.</p><p>A first indication that bacteria endogenously generate sulfite came from the observation that expression of the <italic>rpoE1-lacZ</italic> fusion in stationary phase was more than 2-fold higher (t test, p&#x0003c;0.05) in the <italic>rpoE4</italic> mutant than in the wt strain, and that this expression was completely RpoE1-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050768-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). As the <italic>rpoE4</italic> mutation results in a decreased <italic>sorT</italic> expression and thus a lower sulfite oxidation (see above), these data suggested that RpoE1 was over-activated in the <italic>rpoE4</italic> mutant as a consequence of sulfite accumulation.</p><p>To confirm that <italic>S. meliloti</italic> generates sulfite during growth, we assayed the presence of sulfite in culture supernatants of cells grown to either exponential or stationary phase in minimal medium plus succinate as carbon source. Unfortunately, sulfite levels were around or below the detection threshold of the sulfite assay (&#x0223c;1&#x02013;1.5 &#x000b5;M) in cultures of the wt strain, presumably because of efficient sulfite oxidation. To increase the sensitivity of the test, we repeated it on cultures of the &#x00394;<italic>sorT</italic> mutant, where sulfite should accumulate. Although sulfite could not be detected in culture supernatants of exponentially growing &#x00394;<italic>sorT</italic> cells, a low but reproducible level of sulfite (2.7&#x000b1;0.6 &#x000b5;M) was detected in stationary phase, suggesting that sulfite is generated endogenously by <italic>S. meliloti</italic> during growth in this medium, and could therefore be responsible for RpoE1 and RpoE4 activation.</p><p>We therefore tested whether RpoE1 and RpoE4 activation in stationary phase correlates with endogenous sulfite levels, by comparing the stationary phase expression of the P<italic>rpoE1-</italic> and P<italic>rpoE4-lacZ</italic> fusions in wt and &#x00394;<italic>sorT</italic> backgrounds.

The observed over-activation of RpoE1 and RpoE4 in stationary phase in the <italic>sorT</italic> background was not due to a general, unspecific effect on sigma factors since in a control experiment, an RpoE2-dependent P<italic>rpoE2-lacZ</italic> fusion was up-regulated in stationary phase at similar levels in &#x00394;<italic>sorT</italic> and wt backgrounds (not shown). Note that <italic>rpoE1</italic> expression was partly RpoE4-dependent in stationary phase in the <italic>sorT</italic> background, which provides another indication of the overlapping regulatory activities of RpoE1 and RpoE4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050768-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).

Sulfite is also known as a final product of the catabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids in eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Griffith1">[51]</xref>. Because of its high reactivity with biological macromolecules, sulfite is toxic to bacterial cells, which have thus evolved mechanisms to detoxify sulfite.

We found that RpoE1 and RpoE4 are activated in the presence of exogenously added thiosulfate or taurine, as well as in stationary phase, likely as a result of natural endogenous sulfite accumulation during growth. The origin of sulfite in the latter case is not known. We hypothesize that it could result from the catabolism of sulfur-containing molecules, such as the amino acids cystein and methionine, which may be used as alternative carbon sources upon exhaustion of succinate from the medium. Alternatively, sulfite produced as an intermediate of sulfate assimilation may accumulate upon entry into stationary phase.</p><p>RpoE1 and RpoE4 not only respond to the same stimulus (sulfite), but also display redundant regulatory activities, owing to overlapping recognition sequences in their target promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050768-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). These shared features support their supposed common ancestral origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Staron1">[31]</xref>.

The extent of regulatory overlap between RpoE1 and RpoE4 was dependent on the conditions tested, as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050768-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>. Thus, in stationary phase (wt or <italic>sorT</italic> backgrounds) or in exponential phase in the presence of thiosulfate, no or little overlap was detected. In particular, RpoE1 did not control RpoE4 targets in these conditions, presumably because of a weak RpoE1 activation. In the presence of taurine, however, both sigma factors were strongly activated and were almost fully redundant. We assume that these progressive levels of activation result from i) the different susceptibility of activation of the sigma factors at a given sulfite concentration, RpoE4 being more sensitive to the presence of sulfite than RpoE1, and ii) the different sulfite concentrations present in various conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050768-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Thus, thiosulfate is likely a weaker sulfite donor than taurine, as supported by the fact that growth of the <italic>rpoE4</italic> mutant is not affected in the presence of thiosulfate, whereas it is severely reduced in the presence of taurine. Accordingly, no specific enzyme for thiosulfate assimilation is encoded by the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Wilson1">[39]</xref>.

Altogether, these data are in agreement with our finding that RpoE1 is most active in stationary phase. Strikingly, the SMc02156 product was found by Wilson and Kapler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Wilson1">[39]</xref> as one of the major proteins co-purifying with SorT. Whether this reflects a true relationship with the sulfite-oxidizing enzyme, or simply that SMc02156 is an abundant contaminating protein in the conditions of SorT purification (i.e. culture in the presence of taurine) is presently unknown.</p><p>SorT is a dimeric molybdenum-containing sulfite dehydrogenase which catalyses oxidation of sulfite into sulfate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Wilson1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Kappler3">[52]</xref>. We showed here that SorT and its regulator RpoE4 are both needed for optimal growth of <italic>S. meliloti</italic> in a medium containing taurine as sole carbon source. We propose two hypotheses to explain this requirement. First, SorT may participate in sulfite detoxification. In its absence, residual growth may be allowed by the presence of three additional sulfite-oxidizing enzymes in <italic>S. meliloti</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Wilson1">[39]</xref>. Accordingly, we found that all three corresponding genes (SMa2103, SMb20584 and SMc01281) are up-regulated in the presence of taurine, both in the wt and the <italic>rpoE1 rpoE4</italic> mutant strains (not shown). Alternatively or in addition, sulfite oxidation by SorT, if coupled to the respiratory chain, may contribute to energy production and therefore significantly affect cell growth. Sulfite respiration was previously reported in another chemoheterotrophic bacterium, <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Myers1">[64]</xref>, and was suggested to occur in <italic>S. meliloti</italic> (cited as unpublished data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Wilson1">[39]</xref>). In this context, recent biochemical analyses suggested that the proteins encoded by the two genes forming an operon with <italic>sorT</italic>, a cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (SMc04048) and a pseudoazurin (SMc04047 or <italic>azu2</italic>), may function as acceptors for electrons generated from sulfite oxidation by SorT, and link it to the electron transport chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Low1">[40]</xref>. SorT is a periplasmic enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Wilson1">[39]</xref> indicating that sulfite has to transit via the periplasm in order to be oxidized. Although thiosulfate metabolism in <italic>S. meliloti</italic> is unknown, the desulfonation step of taurine catabolism takes place in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Brggemann1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Denger1">[65]</xref>. The requirement for the periplasmic SorT for optimal growth on taurine as well as the presence of sulfite in culture supernatants implies that sulfite is exported from the cells. <italic>S. meliloti</italic> proteins involved in sulfite export are not known, but a gene of the taurine degradation locus was postulated to encode a putative sulfate transporter (SMb21531 or <italic>tauZ</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Denger1">[65]</xref>) that may be involved in sulfite export. In stationary phase, RpoE4 and SorT may provide the bacteria a means of sulfite detoxification, or contribute to energy production through sulfite respiration. In addition, sulfite was suggested to be part of the antimicrobial defense in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Mitsuhashi1">[42]</xref>. It is not known whether legume plants synthesize sulfite in response to rhizobial infection, but the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> sulfite response is not essential for symbiosis with <italic>Medicago</italic>.</p><p><italic>sorT</italic> expression is controlled by RpoE4, whose operon is located just upstream of <italic>sorT</italic>. Strikingly, in <italic>Starkeya novella</italic>, despite the absence of experimental evidence, Kappler and colleagues speculated that the <italic>sorAB</italic> genes, which encode a heterodimeric sulfite-oxidizing enzyme, were up-regulated in the presence of thiosulfate through the action of a sigma factor (RpoE) whose operon is located just upstream of <italic>sorAB</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050768.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). Potential promoter sequences recognized by RpoE upstream of <italic>sorA</italic> were even predicted (although not experimentally tested) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Kappler1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0050768-Kappler2">[48]</xref> which almost perfectly match the <italic>S. meliloti</italic> RpoE4 recognition sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050768-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Interestingly, a similar genomic organization, i.e. the co-localization of genes encoding an ECF26 sigma factor, its putative anti-sigma factor and one or several putative enzymes involved in sulfite oxidation, is found in other &#x003b1;-Proteobacteria including another <italic>S. meliloti</italic> species (AK83), <italic>S. medicae, Xanthobacter autotrophicus</italic>, <italic>Methylobacterium chloromethanicum, M. radiotolerans</italic>, <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> and <italic>Roseovarius nubinhibens</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050768.s004">Fig. S4A</xref>). Moreover, promoter sequences similar to those recognized by RpoE4 could be found upstream of the sulfite-oxidase encoding genes in most of these bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050768-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Finally, a similar genetic organization is present in &#x003b2;-Proteobacteria of the <italic>Delftia</italic>, <italic>Comamonas</italic> and <italic>Acidovorax</italic> genera (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050768.s004">Fig. S4B</xref>), although in these cases the ECF sigma factor is more distantly related to RpoE4. Altogether, these observations suggest that mechanisms similar to those described in this study preside at transcriptional regulation of sulfite oxidizing enzymes in a wide range of bacteria.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0050768.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>rpoE1</italic></bold><bold> and </bold><bold><italic>rpoE4</italic></bold><bold> are up-regulated in the presence of thiosulfate or taurine.</bold> Expression levels of <italic>rpoE1</italic> and <italic>rpoE4</italic> were measured by qRT-PCR from strain GMI11495 (wt) either grown with sodium succinate (white bars) or taurine (pale grey bars) as carbon source, or with succinate plus 20 mM thiosulfate (dark grey bars).
