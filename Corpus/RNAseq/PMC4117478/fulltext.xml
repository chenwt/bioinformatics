Among these modifications, the addition of 5&#x02032; cap structure has been found to regulate turnover and localization. Here we report a study of the cap structure of human short (&#x0003c;200 nt) RNAs (sRNAs), using sequencing of cDNA libraries prepared by enzymatic pretreatment of the sRNAs with cap sensitive-specificity, thin layer chromatographic (TLC) analyses of isolated cap structures and mass spectrometric analyses for validation of TLC analyses. Processed versions of snoRNAs and tRNAs sequences of less than 50 nt were observed in capped sRNA libraries, indicating additional processing and recapping of these annotated sRNAs biotypes. We report for the first time 2,7 dimethylguanosine in human sRNAs cap structures and surprisingly we find multiple <italic>type 0</italic> cap structures (mGpppC, 7mGpppG, GpppG, GpppA, and 7mGpppA) in RNA length fractions shorter than 50 nt. Finally, we find the presence of additional uncharacterized cap structures that wait determination by the creation of needed reference compounds to be used in TLC analyses. These studies suggest the existence of novel biochemical pathways leading to the processing of primary and sRNAs and the modifications of their RNA 5&#x02032; ends with a spectrum of chemical modifications.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (U54HG004557) to PC, a research grant for RIKEN Omics Science Center from MEXT to Yoshihide Hayashizaki, and a research grant from MEXT to the RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies.

Many of these roles are dependent on co- or post-transcriptional chemical modifications. Among these modifications is the addition of 7-methylguanosine cap (7 mG) to the 5&#x02032; termini of elongating mRNA transcripts. This modification has been observed to play important roles in the extra-nuclear transport, translation and overall RNA stability <xref rid="pone.0102895-Shimotohno1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Beyond helping to regulate long (&#x0003e;200 nt) mRNAs, several biotypes of short (s) RNAs have been observed to possess 5&#x02032; cap structures <xref rid="pone.0102895-Banerjee1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. sRNAs have been observed to possess a trimethylated version (2,2,7 mG) of the 7 mG cap structure. This modification has been reported as part of short nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). These short capped RNAs have been intensively studied for their role in gene expression, splicing regulation and long RNA editing <xref rid="pone.0102895-Matera1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Other modifications of 5&#x02032; caps have been found, in particular a &#x003b3;-mono-methyl cap structure for the U6 snRNA <xref rid="pone.0102895-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102895-OMullane1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and 2,7 mG in virus RNAs <xref rid="pone.0102895-Hsuchen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102895-Benarroch1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In contrast, other well-characterized sRNA biotypes such as microRNAs (miRNAs), Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and most snoRNAs, lack a 5&#x02032; cap structure, as demonstrated by the ability of cloning experiments to selectively capture these monophosphate 5&#x02032; ends without a cap <xref rid="pone.0102895-Kawaji1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>While the use of a combination of 5&#x02032; cap dependent cloning (using cap analysis of gene expression, CAGE and RNA Annotation and Mapping of Promoters for the Analysis of Gene Expression, RAMPAGE) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) has allowed for the discovery and mapping of novel long and short capped RNAs, the landscapes of modifications observed at the 5&#x02032;ends of these RNAs are largely unexplored. Results from FANTOM and ENCODE projects both indicate that the total number of capped long transcripts is much greater than the protein coding RNAs in mouse <xref rid="pone.0102895-Carninci1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and human samples <xref rid="pone.0102895-Imanishi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102895-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The variety of the types of 5&#x02032; end modifications for sRNAs is particularly unexplored. A cause for this dearth of knowledge lies primarily in the reasoning that sRNAs cannot be mapped as accurately as long RNAs as well as that these sRNAs are random short-lived degradation products of long RNAs and thus are biologically unimportant.</p><p>These views have more recently come under reconsideration with the identification of novel biotypes of biologically active sRNAs. For example, sRNAs derived from processed snoRNAs <xref rid="pone.0102895-Taft1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and tRNAs <xref rid="pone.0102895-Kawaji1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102895-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> have been identified as being involved in gene regulation and cell proliferation, respectively. Additionally, promoter/termini-associated sRNAs (PASRs and TASRs, respectively) have been identified which when present are able to have a repressive effect on transcription <xref rid="pone.0102895-FejesToth1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102895-Kapranov1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Notably, characterization of PASRs indicates that these sRNAs appear to be capped because these RNAs can be selectively immunoprecipated by antibodies raised against 7 mG and 2,2,7 mG cap structures <xref rid="pone.0102895-McCue1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102895-Mazires1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Other capped sRNAs and a cytosolic capping protein complexes have been identified during studies involving the cleavage and recapping of long RNAs <xref rid="pone.0102895-FejesToth1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102895-Otsuka1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

All naturally occurring 5&#x02032;-monophosphorylated molecules (e.g. miRNAs) that are in the total RNA pool are rendered incapable for inclusion in capped RNA libraries. We refer to these libraries derived from 5&#x02032; capped RNAs as capped sRNA libraries. A separate sequencing library is created for RNAs already possessing a 5&#x02032; phosphate in the starting RNA pool, which we called sRNA library.</p><p>To determine the length of the capped and uncapped sRNAs, we used sequencing read lengths of single end 101 nt.

Interestingly, cap structures are detected for both long and short RNAs. The conventional functional roles of these cap structures are to assist the capped RNAs in slowing the turn-over, controlling translation <xref rid="pone.0102895-Banerjee1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102895-RoChoi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102895-RoChoi2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and assisting in sub-cellular localization <xref rid="pone.0102895-Camper1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102895-Dimock1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The cap structures found on sRNA appear to be either added onto the original RNA during transcription (e.g. snoRNAs), or as previously reported, have been added after processing using a novel mechanism <xref rid="pone.0102895-FejesToth1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>snRNAs were enriched the <italic>IP K121</italic> libraries, suggesting that our immunoprecipitation was at least partially effective. It also enriched the libraries for short tags that aligned to TSS, suggesting that these sRNAs are capped <xref rid="pone.0102895-FejesToth1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This result was confirmed by the sRNA CAGE libraries where 26.6% of the tags aligned to TSS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102895.s001">Figure S10 in File S1</xref>), similarly to the promoter-associated sRNAs (PASRs) reported by Kapranov et al <xref rid="pone.0102895-Kapranov1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This observation support the idea that those transcripts have either 7 mG or 2,2,7 mG caps.</p><p>The capped sRNA libraries contained snoRNAs and tRNAs sequences that were remarkably enriched as shorter than 50 nt in length, indicating possible processing of these already sRNAs given that the native transcripts are longer than 70&#x02013;150 nt. We found that 4% and 32% of the reads aligned to known tRNA and to snoRNA loci, respectively, in these libraries. Nuclear transport of tRNA fragments has been previously reported in several studies on different organisms consistent of a possible functional role for these processed RNAs <xref rid="pone.0102895-Zaitseva1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102895-Hanada1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Alternatively, these tRNA fragments could possess 5&#x02032; triphosphate originating from the incompleteness of our enzymatic treatments. This possibility would be consistent with the observed presence of miRNA sequences in the capped sRNA libraries.</p><p>By pyrophosphatase cleavage and TLC, we detected a series of 5&#x02032; monophosphate ribonucleotides which were reported previously as internal modified bases (1 mG, 2 mG, 2,2 mG, Cm) in tRNAs and rRNAs <xref rid="pone.0102895-Iwanami1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102895-Rozenski1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. This observation raises the the possibility that these modified nucleotides are the result of non-specific degradation of the analyzed sRNA. However, this possibility is unlikely since accidental degradation to single nucleotides is unlikely as alkaline hydrolysis requires incubation for at least 12 h with a strong base <xref rid="pone.0102895-Lipkin1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and enzymatic digestion requires the combination of different RNases <xref rid="pone.0102895-Helm1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102895-Helm2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, both of which being very extreme conditions comparing to our procedure for cap isolation. Importantly, these simple modified bases were not confirmed in our mass spectroscopy experiments, suggesting that their relative abundance is likely to be lower than the methylguanosine caps and under the sensitivity limits for mass spectroscopy.</p><p>To our knowledge, we report here for the first time that 2,7 dimethylguanosine in human sRNAs at reasonably abundant amounts. In humans, 7 mG caps are hypermethylated by the guanine-N2 methyltransferase TGS-1 (Trimethylguanosine Synthase 1), which is inefficient in methylating other substrates, such as non-methylated G or 2 mG <xref rid="pone.0102895-Benarroch1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The kinetic of conversation from 7 mG to 2,2,7 mG has not as yet been reported to occur <italic>in vivo</italic>. 7 mG and 2,2,7 mG cap structures were double confirmed by 2D-TLC analysis and tandem mass spectroscopy in sRNA shorter than 50 nt. 2,2,7 mG was detected in all sRNA fractions, associated with Am (all fractions), or m6Am, Cm, Gm and Um (&#x0003c;200 nt fraction). We also found typical cap structure structures in RNAs shorter than 50 nt (7mGpppUm, 7mGpppA, 7mGpppG).</p><p>A study on human TGS-1 <italic>in vitro</italic> showed the conversion of 90% of 7mGpp substrate to 2,7mGpp after 5 min of incubation, while the conversion of more than 50% of 2,7mGpp to 2,2,7mGpp required 15 min of treatment <xref rid="pone.0102895-Hausmann1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The efficiency of TGS-1 on both substrates was also proven by Benarroch et al <xref rid="pone.0102895-Benarroch1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, who reported similar catalytic efficiencies for the 2,7 mG and 2,2,7 mG synthase reactions. Thus, given their short half-life, it is tempting to speculate that the 2,7 mG caps that we detected are not intermediate products. We observed this modified cap structure using TLC and mass spectrometry on sRNA longer than 100 nt.</p><p>2,7 mG cap was reported previously in Sinbis virus 28S rRNA and protozoan parasite like <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> which has cap guanine-N2 methyltransferase TGS-2 enzymes but not TGS-1 <xref rid="pone.0102895-Hausmann2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. This is consistent with not only the possibility of the existence of individual transcripts that carry this type of modification but also with the possibility of the presence of uncharacterized TGS-2 enzyme in human cells or pathways that stop after the first methylation by TGS-1.</p><p>Caps are classified as <italic>type 0</italic>, <italic>I</italic>, <italic>II</italic>, etc. according to the number 2&#x02032;-O-methylated nucleotides that follow the 5&#x02032;-5&#x02032; bond. In mRNAs, <italic>type I</italic> (or higher) caps increase the translation efficiency <xref rid="pone.0102895-Kuge1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, affect the interaction with eIF4E <xref rid="pone.0102895-Zuberek1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, and the transport to the cytoplasm <xref rid="pone.0102895-Camper1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102895-Dimock1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Mass spectrometry allowed us detect 2&#x02032;-O methylation on the first nucleotide and therefore distinguish <italic>type 0</italic> from the other types. In this study, surprisingly we found multiple <italic>type 0</italic> cap structures (mGpppC, 7mGpppG, GpppG, GpppA, and 7mGpppA) in RNA length fractions shorter than 50 nt. Thus, these sRNAs cannot be degradation products of mRNA 5&#x02032; end, suggesting other mechanisms such as cleavage and recapping from longer precursor RNAs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of <italic>type 0</italic> cap structure in human RNAs.</p><p>We also found the 5&#x02032;-5&#x02032; dinucleotides GpppmAm and GpppmC, for which the TLC data suggests that G is the outer 5&#x02032; cap nucleotide and Am or mC are the next nucleotides, because in all length fractions Gp was the most abundant nucleotide by TLC. Interestingly, our TLC results also showed a spot that may be mCp, leaving open the possibility of a mCpppG cap. This result would be unusual and in need of additional confirmation.</p><p>Our study also suggests the presence of additional uncharacterized cap structures due to the absence of a reference compound in TLC and thus making the structural information obtained from mass spectroscopic data difficult to interpret. While performing positive control TLC analysis to test the ability of T4 PNK to phosphorylate nucleosides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0102895.s001">Figure S8 in File S1</xref>) we could observe two spots similar to what we call unknowns X1 and X4. Those spots may reflect the possibility of the phosphorylation of both 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; position of the nucleoside. However, formal validation of this possibility awaits further testing.</p><p>Finally, combining cDNA cloning of sRNAs, precipitation by anti-methylguanosine antibodies, thin layer chromatography and mass spectroscopy, we observe the unambiguous presence of caps on sRNAs, not only in the size range corresponding to the annotated snRNAs, but also in the size range of tRNAs (&#x0223c;75 nt) and in the sRNAs shorter than 50 nt. In this size range, where we found sRNAs aligning to the transcription start and termination sites in known genes. We also found <italic>type 0</italic> variants of these caps, which may be produced by cytoplasmic capping. This analysis approach opens the possibility of highly promiscuous 5&#x02032; end modifications of both long and short RNAs or a novel landscape of structural cap modifications with possible novel biological roles. Further investigation of the biogenesis of these RNAs will be needed to understand if they are the direct product of short-range transcription or if they are the cleavage product of longer templates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0102895.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p><bold>Contains the supplementary figures and their legends.</bold></p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0102895.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Augusto Barbosa for providing us with TGS-2 Plasmid and technical advices, Remy Bordonne for providing us with SF-h TGS-1, Irina Voineagu and H.
