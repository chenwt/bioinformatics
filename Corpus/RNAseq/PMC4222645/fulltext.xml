We assayed genome-wide <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> regulatory differences between maize and its wild progenitor, teosinte, using deep RNA sequencing in F<sub>1</sub> hybrid and parent inbred lines for three tissue types (ear, leaf and stem). Pervasive regulatory variation was observed with approximately 70% of &#x0223c;17,000 genes showing evidence of regulatory divergence between maize and teosinte. However, many fewer genes (1,079 genes) show consistent <italic>cis</italic> differences with all sampled maize and teosinte lines. For &#x0223c;70% of these 1,079 genes, the <italic>cis</italic> differences are specific to a single tissue. The number of genes with <italic>cis</italic> regulatory differences is greatest for ear tissue, which underwent a drastic transformation in form during domestication. As expected from the domestication bottleneck, maize possesses less <italic>cis</italic> regulatory variation than teosinte with this deficit greatest for genes showing maize-teosinte <italic>cis</italic> regulatory divergence, suggesting selection on <italic>cis</italic> regulatory differences during domestication. Consistent with selection on <italic>cis</italic> regulatory elements, genes with <italic>cis</italic> effects correlated strongly with genes under positive selection during maize domestication and improvement, while genes with <italic>trans</italic> regulatory effects did not. We observed a directional bias such that genes with <italic>cis</italic> differences showed higher expression of the maize allele more often than the teosinte allele, suggesting domestication favored up-regulation of gene expression. Finally, this work documents the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> regulatory changes between maize and teosinte in over 17,000 genes for three tissues.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Modification of <italic>cis</italic> regulatory elements to produce differences in gene expression level, localization, and timing is an important mechanism by which organisms evolve divergent adaptations. To examine gene regulatory change during the domestication of maize from its wild progenitor, teosinte, we assessed allele-specific expression in a collection of maize and teosinte inbreds and their F<sub>1</sub> hybrids using three tissues from different developmental stages. Our use of F<sub>1</sub> hybrids represents the first study in a domesticated crop and wild progenitor that dissects <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> regulatory effects to examine characteristics of genes under various <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> regulatory regimes. We find evidence for consistent <italic>cis</italic> regulatory divergence that differentiates maize from teosinte in approximately 4% of genes. These genes are significantly correlated with genes under selection during domestication and crop improvement, suggesting an important role for <italic>cis</italic> regulatory elements in maize evolution.

Variation in CREs allows for the deployment of tissue specific patterning of gene expression, differences in developmental timing of expression, and variation in the quantitative levels of gene expression. Furthermore, modification of CREs, as opposed to coding sequence changes, are assumed to have less pleiotropy and consequently have a lower risk of unintended deleterious effects in secondary tissues. The importance of CREs for the development of novel morphologies is supported by the growing catalog of examples for which differences in gene specific CREs between closely related species contributed to the evolution of diversity in form <xref rid="pgen.1004745-Stern1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>While compelling evidence for the importance of CREs in evolution has come from mapping causative variants to CREs, additional evidence has emerged from genomic analyses that show abundant <italic>cis</italic> regulatory variation both within <xref rid="pgen.1004745-Springer1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004745-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and between species <xref rid="pgen.1004745-Tirosh1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004745-McManus1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Some studies have reported a bias such that genes with <italic>cis</italic> differences between species or ecotypes show preferential up-regulation of the alleles of one parent, possibly as a result of natural selection <xref rid="pgen.1004745-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004745-McManus1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004745-He1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>cis</italic> differences are a key element of adaptive evolution, divergence for <italic>cis</italic> regulation between yeast species is more often associated with positive selection than <italic>trans</italic> divergence <xref rid="pgen.1004745-Emerson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004745-Schaefke1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Crop plants offer a powerful system for the investigation of evolutionary mechanisms because they display considerable divergence in form from their wild progenitors, yet exhibit complete cross-fertility with these progenitors <xref rid="pgen.1004745-Doebley1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004745-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. QTL fine-mapping experiments have provided multiple examples of modified CREs that underlie trait divergence between crops and their ancestors.

These diverse modifications suggest that changes in CREs offer a powerful means to fine-tune gene expression to generate new plant morphologies.</p><p>Several transcriptional profiles contrasting crops and their ancestors have been performed, although the experimental designs used did not allow separation of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> effects.

The data suggest massive alterations in gene expression profiles accompanied domestication. Work in cotton and maize shows a more frequent up-regulation of genes in the crop as compared to the wild ancestor, however whether this was due to <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> effects was not discernible <xref rid="pgen.1004745-Rapp1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004745-SwansonWagner1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we used RNAseq to parse genome-wide expression differences between maize and its progenitor, teosinte (<italic>Zea mays</italic> ssp. <italic>parviglumis</italic>), into <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> effects. Three tissue types were assayed: immature ear, seedling leaf, and seedling stem. Approximately 70% of the 17,000 genes assayed show evidence of regulatory divergence between maize and teosinte. Over 1,000 genes show <italic>cis</italic> divergence that is highly consistent across our sampled maize and teosinte lines. For &#x0223c;70% of genes with consistent <italic>cis</italic> effects, the <italic>cis</italic> effects are specific to a single tissue type. The number of genes with <italic>cis</italic> differences is greatest for the ear, which underwent a profound transformation in form during domestication.

This filtering resulted in 4,770 ear, 4,494 leaf, and 4,601 stem CCT genes (union of 8,396 genes). Next, we asked if genes on the filtered CCT list consistently favor expression of maize or teosinte alleles in the individual F<sub>1</sub> hybrids. The goal was to exclude CCT genes for which the significant overall <italic>cis</italic> effect was caused by a large expression bias in one or a few F<sub>1</sub> crosses.

Of the 17,579 genes assayed with at least 100 read depth in both the parents and F<sub>1</sub> hybrids, 14,421 were expressed in all three tissues. This high proportion of genes (82%) expressed in all tissues creates a false impression that sampling one tissue type at one point in developmental time provides a reasonable assay of all tissues at all developmental times. The discordant observations that CCT genes are mostly tissue specific, while genes overall are expressed in all tissues can be explained by tissue specific enhancers or repressors.</p><p>Among the sampled tissues, it is notable that ear has the largest number of overall (555) and tissue specific (336) CCT genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004745-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The greater number of ear CCT genes identified may be related to the profound morphological changes that differentiate the maize and teosinte ear.

Gene expression ratios for F<sub>1</sub>s (e.g. B73&#x000d7;TIL01) were then calculated by dividing total maize read depth by total teosinte read depth summed over all segregating sites in the gene. The parent expression ratios for individual maize-teosinte comparisons were calculated the same way from parental RNAseq reads, except total parental read depths at segregating sites were corrected for differences in total number of reads between the two parent lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004745.s028">Text S1</xref>).

To calculate the overall F<sub>1</sub> expression ratio, the maize and teosinte read depths from the F<sub>1</sub> hybrids were simply summed over all segregating sites in a gene and across all hybrids. The calculation of the overall parent expression ratio required weighting to avoid counting the parent reads multiple times for each of the F<sub>1</sub> comparisons in which it was a parent and to compensate for the fact that different parents had variable total numbers of reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004745.s028">Text S1</xref>). Only genes with a read depth of at least 100 in both the F<sub>1</sub> and its parent comparison were included. The result of these calculations was an overall F<sub>1</sub> and parent ratio of read counts for each gene. To check whether single F<sub>1</sub>s caused aberrant estimates of the <italic>cis</italic> effect with these overall ratios, we performed a <italic>drop1</italic> analysis and found that inclusion/excluding of single F<sub>1</sub>s had on negligible effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004745.s028">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004745.s005">Figure S5</xref>).

<xref rid="pgen.1004745-McManus1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In brief, two binomial tests were used to identify genes with maize&#x02236;teosinte expression ratios significantly different from 1&#x02236;1 in the F<sub>1</sub> hybrid and parent comparisons. Genes with an expression ratio significantly different from 1&#x02236;1 for the F<sub>1</sub> hybrid and/or parent comparison were then subjected to a Fisher's exact test to determine if the parent and F<sub>1</sub> hybrid maize&#x02236;teosinte expression ratios were different from one another. An FDR rate of 0.5% using Storey's q-value <xref rid="pgen.1004745-Storey1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> was used to compensate for the large number of statistical tests being performed.

We observed significant maize&#x02236;teosinte expression biases as small as 1.02-fold in the overall tests. Such small differences seem unlikely to have biological importance and genes showing these small differences are weak candidates for genes with <italic>cis</italic> expression variation that is causal in maize domestication and improvement. Therefore, we applied filters to identify candidates with the strongest and most consistent regulatory differences.</p><p>To narrow down the CCT gene list to candidate genes that show the strongest evidence for differential <italic>cis</italic> regulation between maize and teosinte, we applied two filters. (1) Genes with the strongest evidence for <italic>cis</italic> differences will fall in the CCT group and have data from a majority of sampled maize and teosinte parents. Thus, we filtered the initial list of CCT genes for those with data from at least fifteen F<sub>1</sub> hybrids that include at least three different maize inbreds and five different teosinte inbreds. (2) For genes with <italic>cis</italic> differences that contributed to maize domestication/improvement, the direction of the expression bias should be highly consistent among the individual F<sub>1</sub> hybrids. Consequently, CCT genes were classified for consistency of directionality of expression bias among the F<sub>1</sub>s with several levels of candidate genes partitioned at 100%, 90% and 80% of F<sub>1</sub>s showing the same directionality. In calculating these percentages, we used read depth for each F<sub>1</sub> at the gene to weight the contribution of the F<sub>1</sub>s to the overall percentage. We refer to the CCT genes with 100%, 90% and 80% consistent directionality among the F<sub>1</sub>s as the A-list, B-list and C-list, respectively. For comparative purposes, we made similar A, B and C lists of genes for the <italic>cis</italic> only or <italic>trans</italic> only classes.
