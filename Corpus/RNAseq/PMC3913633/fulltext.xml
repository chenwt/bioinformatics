Aquaculture practices for this species are still in their infancies and scientific studies are seldom undertaken, mainly because of difficulties in sampling. Thus for small tuna species like the Atlantic bonito only little is known about its biology and regarding the molecular background even less information is available. In the production of marine fish it is known that the most critical period is the larval stages, as high growth rates as well as significant developmental changes take place. In this study we have investigated the transcriptome of the Atlantic bonito of five larvae stages applying Illumina sequencing technology. For non-model species like aquaculture species, transcriptome analysis of RNA samples from individuals using Illumina sequencing technology is technically efficient and cost effective. In the present study a total number of 169,326,711 paired-end reads with a read length of 100 base pairs were generated resulting in a reference transcriptome of 68,220 contigs with an average length of 2054 base pairs. For differential expression analyses single end reads were obtained from different developmental stages and mapped to the constructed reference transcriptome. Differential expression analyses revealed in total 18,657 differentially expressed transcripts and were assigned to five distinguished groups. Each of the five clusters shows stage specific gene expression. We present for the first time in the Atlantic bonito an extensive RNA-Seq based characterization of its transcriptome as well as significant information on differential expression among five developmental larvae stages. The generated transcripts, including SNP and microsatellite information for candidate molecular markers and gene expression information will be a valuable resource for future genetic and molecular studies.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work has been carried out with financial support from the Commission of the European Communities, specific RTD programme of Framework Programme 7, Theme 2-Food, Agriculture, Fisheries and Biotechnology (Project SELFDOTT) and the Operational Program Life Long Learning from the General Secretary for Research and Technology, Greece Aristeia (ANnOTATE, 674).

Among the four allopatric species, <italic>Sarda australis</italic>, <italic>Sarda chiliensis</italic>, <italic>Sarda orientalis</italic> and <italic>S. sarda</italic>, only <italic>S. sarda</italic> inhabits the Atlantic and Mediterranean waters. Overall the Atlantic bonito has a wide geographical distribution covering the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean and its bordering seas <xref rid="pone.0087744-Ate1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087744-Zaboukas1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. It is an important marine fish species throughout its extent of distribution and is primarily exploited by coastal fisheries. In 2010 the total catch of Atlantic bonito was around 15,000 tons. The first successful aquaculture station was reported in 2011 within the European SELFDOTT project. For the production of marine fish, larval stages constitute a significant phase <xref rid="pone.0087744-YuferaConceicao1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> as high growth rates as well as important developmental changes occur. Biotic as well as abiotic conditions influences greatly early stages of marine fish concerning survival, the start of feeding as well as larval growth. Phenotypic characters used for identification comprises the yolk shape, position of oil globule (if present), number of myomers, position of anus, fin fold and melanophores <xref rid="pone.0087744-Kendall1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Concerning development of bonito species only a description of the larval growth in the Pacific bonito <italic>S. chiliensis</italic> (Cuvier) has been published <xref rid="pone.0087744-McFarlane1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The authors describe six basic stages of post-embryonic development based on ontogenetic changes in morphology and behavior. In addition two discrete metamorphic events during development are described with the first one being during the pre-juvenile stage and the second when the animals enter the juvenile stage <xref rid="pone.0087744-Youson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. To attain high quality juveniles and thus to assure the accessibility of healthy and well-developed juveniles the larval period is decisive. At molecular level some studies have been carried out in other fish species in order to assess differential gene expression of the egg and the early embryo <xref rid="pone.0087744-YuferaConceicao1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087744-Kimmel1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0087744-Yufera1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Post-embryonic larvae transcriptome assessment was addressed e.g. in the gilthead sea bream (<italic>Sparus aurata</italic>) by GS454 FLX sequencing <xref rid="pone.0087744-Yufera1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> in order to get insight into its larval development. Among gene expression studies in early development of fish, a set of transcripts were identified showing specific gene expression patterns <xref rid="pone.0087744-Bai1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0087744-Wen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> drawing attention to the function of early expressed genes. Nonetheless for small tuna species like the Atlantic bonito only little is known about the biology and regarding the molecular background even less information is available. The fast evolving sequencing technologies facilitated the investigation in a large variety of different sequencing projects in model but also in non-model organism. Today a vast amount of sequence data are available for many species including non-model fish species of commercial interest like the catfish (<italic>Ictalurus punctatus</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0087744-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087744-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, the gilthead sea bream <italic>S. aurata</italic><xref rid="pone.0087744-Yufera1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087744-GarciadelaSerrana1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and the European sea bass (<italic>Dicentrarchus labrax</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0087744-Sarropoulou4" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087744-Sarropoulou5" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However to the best of our knowledge, for economic epipelagic fish species like the Atlantic tuna or the Atlantic bonito only little genome and transcriptome information is published <xref rid="pone.0087744-Ate1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087744-Zaboukas1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087744-ErkanTosun1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. For the Atlantic bluefin tuna (<italic>Thunnus thynnus</italic>) in total 11, 453 sequences are published comprising 10,175 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and 1278 Nucleotide (NCBI, July 2012). Regarding the Atlantic bonito even less molecular information is available. Only 469 sequences are published at the NCBI nr database and none in the NCBI EST database and no Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) project has been published so far (NCBI, November 2013).</p><p>The aim of the present study was to assess the transcriptome and the gene expression profile of five developmental stages of the Atlantic bonito ranging from the pre-larvae up to the juvenile. The detection of a great variety of transcripts and possible isoforms isolated for the first time in the Atlantic bonito are described. Furthermore the expression profiles for the five developmental stages with stage specific gene expression are discussed including part of the muscle transcriptome showing significant differential gene expression at the later stages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>All procedures involving the handling and treatment of fish used during this study were approved by the HCMR Institutional Animal care and use committee following the three Rs (3 Rs, Replacement, Reduction, Refinement) guiding principles for more ethical use of animals in testing, first described by Russell and Burch in 1959.

At the second stage (5 dph) larval have developed a pigmented retinal epithelium, the lower jaw protrudes and melanophores are appearing on the dorsal surface, they are feeding exogenous food and have developed (although not fully) sensing and digestive systems. At the third stage (10 dph, flexion) the moving capacity of the individuals is improved allowing rapid acceleration towards prey and the digestive system is fully developed.

Most studies in non-model fish species have used GS454 Titanium technology for RNAseq and assessment of differential expression. However in order to obtain high throughput several runs have to be performed (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0087744-GarciadelaSerrana1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>) or/and differential expression can be detected by 3&#x02019; UTR tagging <xref rid="pone.0087744-Sarropoulou5" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In the present study a reference transcriptome of the Atlantic bonito was constructed using paired end reads (PE) of one Illumina lane (&#x0223c; 16 Gb, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087744-t001">Table 1</xref>) from equally mixed developmental stages. The paired-end reads generated resolve assembly problems due to repetitive regions. The number of contigs obtained after assembly are counted to 68,220 with an average length of 2054 bp and N50 of 3011 bp (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087744-t001">Table 1</xref>). For non-model species high throughput 454 sequencing which provides longer reads has been widely used up until today as <italic>de novo assembly</italic> of short reads without a reference transcriptome were still difficult. However using Illumina technology of sequencing paired-end reads facilitates the assembly and using a combined assembly and mapping strategy results in a reasonable and accurate reference transcriptome which is also strongly supported by the obtained results of sequence average length and N50 length. Transcripts expression profiles were assessed by high throughput single end sequence (SE) data from each developmental stage which was mapped against the reconstructed assembly using bowtie <xref rid="pone.0087744-Langmead1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087744-t003">Table 3</xref>). As for <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly PE reads are of importance, for assessing differentially expressed genes the sequencing depth is significant <xref rid="pone.0087744-Liu3" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087744-Oshlack1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0087744-Tarazona1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. PE does not give more statistical power than SE as a PE read and a SE read both count as a single tag. However for differential expression analysis only counting tags is critical. Thus by performing an additional Illumine SE sequencing for each stage separately the acquired sequencing depth for detection of differential expression was assured. In addition the high mapping percentages of the single reads obtained from each stage (&#x0223c;80%, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087744-t003">Table 3</xref>) confirm the high and accurate transcriptome assembly. Nevertheless RNAseq using NGS technology has to be considered as a scan of the transcriptome in order to set the basis for further functional studies on specific genes. In the present study transcripts were annotated by performing BLASTX and BLASTN searches against the databases of NCBI. Several transcripts are showing similar or even the same BLAST matches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087744.s004">Tables S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087744.s005">S4</xref>).

common step for microarray analysis is cluster analysis of differentially expressed genes. Cluster analysis permits to classify samples of entities into a small number of mutually exclusive groups based on the similarities among the entries. In the present study the obtained groups were confirmed by discriminant analysis in which up to 95% were successfully grouped in the predicted clusters. Four of the five clusters show exclusive up-regulation in one of the developmental stages, i.e. cluster 2 stage Bon 30, cluster 3 stage Bon 0, cluster 4 stage Bon 20 and cluster 5 stage Bon 5. Cluster 1 comprises a small set of genes showing up-regulation exclusively in stage Bon 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087744-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Transcripts of each cluster including their annotations are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087744.s002">Table S1</xref>. In addition, genes belonging to gene families with established roles in embryonic and developmental processes as described by Yufera et al. <xref rid="pone.0087744-Yufera1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> were identified to be differentially expressed between the five stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087744.s005">Table S4</xref>). Interestingly looking at genes belonging to the homeobox protein family showed that they were present and up-regulated in clusters 1, 3 and 5 but absent or low abundant in cluster 2 and 4. The former three clusters comprise mainly genes up regulated at the earlier stages i.e. stage 0 dph (clusters 3 and 5) and stage 5 dph (clusters 1 and 5). Cluster 4, with only two representatives of the homeobox protein family mainly comprises transcripts found to be up-regulated at stage 20 dph and cluster 2 with no representative of the homeobox protein family comprises mainly transcripts found to be up-regulated at stage 30 dph. This clearly shows the significance of the first three stages in relation to development as homeobox proteins are known to play an important role in pattern formation. Furthermore homeobox proteins like orthodenticle-related (OTX), LIM and visual system which are involved in eye formation are also found to be up- regulated in the first three stages studied. Eye formation is of importance for pelagic fish as they have to hunt for feeding. In zebrafish it has been shown that OTX transcription factors are required for retinal pigment epithelium development but unlike in mouse microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (<italic>Mitf</italic>) is not <xref rid="pone.0087744-Lane1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In the present study <italic>Mitf</italic> has been identified but does not show significant differential expression within the five stages. In contrast to <italic>Mitf</italic> the role of <italic>Otx</italic> in eye formation is conserved between zebrafish and other vertebrates indicating it importance in development. Besides transcripts which show differential expression between stages also transcripts were found exclusively in only one of the stages. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087744-g005">Figure 5</xref> shows a Venn diagram where stage Bon0 was used as reference stage. Consequently transcripts being present only in one of the other stages can be filtered out. The amount of stage specific transcripts varies from 1,490 in stage 5 to 2,187 found to be present only in stage 10. By enrichment analysis using those transcripts found only in stage Bon30 revealed that the majority of them are involved in muscle development. These results are to be expected as animals in the late larvae post-flexion stage form the characteristic body shape for scombrids and develop lateral muscle fields. In addition the inactive periods of the previous stages are not present and animals are more or less constantly active. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0087744.s004">Table S3</xref> shows all muscle genes found which were described in a previous study of fast skeletal muscle transcriptome of sea bream <xref rid="pone.0087744-GarciadelaSerrana1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Besides the identification of important transcripts of the Atlantic bonito muscle transcriptome this result also corroborate the experimental set up and analysis method used in the present study as it is in accordance to the physiology of the larvae development. Interestingly, network analysis of differentially expressed transcripts between stage Bon0 and stage Bon5 revealed that two isoforms are differentially expressed with regard to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087744-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Whereas the one isoform of the general transcription factor IIH subunit 2-like (comp55305_c0_seq1) is up-regulated the other one (comp55305_c0_seq2) is down-regulated. The two different forms of the transcript transcription factor IIH subunit 2-like were identified as main hubs in the network inferred by the LeMoNe algorithm. The two transcripts differ from each other only at the end of the 3&#x02019;UTR. However this region comprises two conserved 7 mers (PUF, and CFI, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0087744-t005">Table 5</xref>) where the one is present in comp55305_c0_seq1 and the other in comp55305_c0_seq2. Both conserved 7 mers were retrieved from Andreassen et al. <xref rid="pone.0087744-Andreassen1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> where authors describe in total 11 conserved 7 mers in the Atlantic salmon being significantly over-represented in the 3&#x02019;UTR. The Puf family is known to bind target sequences in the 3&#x02032;UTRs and in this manner to regulate mRNA expression whereas the CFI target sequence is in involved in polyadenylation site recognition.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0087744-t005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0087744.t005</object-id><label>Table 5</label><caption><title>Conserved 7-mers found in comp55305.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0087744-t005-5" xlink:href="pone.0087744.t005"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Motif</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Position</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Found in sequence</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Proteins known to bind3&#x02019;UTR target sequence</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TGTCTGT</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">658 bp</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comp55305_c0_seq1 and seq2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n/a</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TGTCTGT</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">918 bp</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comp55305_c0_seq1 and seq2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n/a</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TTGTATT</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2859 bp</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comp55305_c0_seq1 and seq2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CFI</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TTGTATT</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2807 bp</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comp55305_c0_seq2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CFI</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TGTAAAT</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1545 bp</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comp55305_c0_seq1 and seq2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PUF</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TGTAAAT</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2918 bp</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comp55305_c0_seq1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PUF</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study is the first report of a transcriptome study in the Atlantic bonito (<italic>S. sarda</italic>). We demonstrate that transcriptome analysis as well as assessment of differential expression of RNA samples using Illumina sequencing technology is technically efficient and with low cost. A total of 68,220 contigs have been constructed out of a total number of 169,326,711 100 bp paired-end reads. Differential expression between five important developmental stages has been assessed and stage specific genes were isolated. It has been shown that in earlier stages transcripts like homoebox genes are up-regulated whereas in the later stage transcripts important for muscle development are found to be higher expressed. The generated transcripts, microsatellite and SNP information for candidate molecular markers as well as gene expression information will be valuable information for future genetic and molecular studies in the Atlantic bonito and closely related species pinpointing also to the importance of studying the 3&#x02019;UTR as well as paralogues during development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0087744.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Supplemental figure to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087744-g008">figure 8</xref> in the manuscript. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0087744-g008">Figure 8</xref> shows only part of the 3&#x02032;UTR, which differs from each other.
