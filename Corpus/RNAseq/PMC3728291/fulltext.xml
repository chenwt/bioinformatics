Canada is the largest producer of linseed but there exists scope for significant yield improvements. Implementation of mechanisms such as male sterility can permit the development of hybrids to assist in achieving this goal. Temperature sensitive male sterility has been reported in flax but the leakiness of this system in field conditions limits the production of quality hybrid seeds. Here, we characterized a 2,588 bp transcript differentially expressed in male sterile lines of flax. The twelve intron gene predicted to encode a 368 amino acid protein has five WD40 repeats which, <italic>in silico</italic>, form a propeller structure with putative nucleic acid and histone binding capabilities. The LuWD40-1 protein localized to the nucleus and its expression increased during the transition and continued through the vegetative stages (seed, etiolated seedling, stem) while the transcript levels declined during reproductive development (ovary, anthers) and embryonic morphogenesis of male fertile plants. Knockout lines for <italic>LuWD40-1</italic> in flax failed to develop shoots while overexpression lines showed delayed growth phenotype and were male sterile. The non-viable flowers failed to open and the pollen grains from these flowers were empty. Three independent transgenic lines overexpressing the <italic>LuWD40-1</italic> gene had &#x0223c;80% non-viable pollen, reduced branching, delayed flowering and maturity compared to male fertile genotypes. The present study provides new insights into a male sterility mechanism present in flax.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The project was funded through Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada A-base grant No. 1785.

The anthers in these male sterile <italic>F<sub>2</sub></italic> lines sometimes developed to a stage where little viable pollen was produced suggesting an incomplete sterility mechanism. The male sterility phenotype was heritable because mostly male sterile plants gave rise to plants exhibiting the same phenotype. The sterile <italic>F<sub>2</sub></italic> plants also had smaller petals that seldom opened. In a reciprocal cross with the blue flower oilseed type as the female parent, one out of four <italic>F<sub>2</sub></italic> plants were male sterile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069124-Bateson1">[1]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study we observed the occurrence of male sterility in an <italic>F<sub>2</sub></italic> cross between oilseed type flax accession Double Low and cultivar AC McDuff.

This hypothesis is supported by studies where pollen and anthers showed expression of approximately 15,000 genes, all of which were highly regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069124-Twell1">[77]</xref>.</p><p>Near complete male sterility (&#x0223c;90% non-viable pollen) in a population arising from an <italic>F<sub>2</sub></italic> cross between oilseed type flax accession Double Low and cultivar AC McDuff was found in approximately 4% of the lines while 8% were partially sterile (&#x0223c;50% non-viable pollen). The occurrence of male sterility in the <italic>F<sub>2</sub></italic> generation did not follow any simple ratios of gene inheritance or interaction. Epigenetic mechanisms involving small RNAs and/or transposable elements (TE) which are highly expressed in pollen vegetative nucleus cells but not in female gametophytes must be investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069124-Slotkin1">[78]</xref>.</p><p>Although other WD40 proteins like YAO and OsLIS-L1 have been implicated in embryo development, plant height and pollen formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069124-Li1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069124-Gao1">[37]</xref>, they differ considerably from LuWD40-1 by their additional functional motifs. The Arabidopsis YAO, with its nuclear localization signal followed by seven WD40 repeats, is expressed ubiquitously in all plant tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069124-Li1">[35]</xref>.The rice OsLIS-L1 contains a LisH motif, a CTLH domain and nine WD40 repeats, out of which, four form the G<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> homology domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069124-Gao1">[37]</xref> indispensable for inducing male sterility. No other domains but the WD40 repeats could be identified in <italic>LuWD40-1</italic>. Moreover, we observed the phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069124-g006">Figure 6A&#x02013;D</xref>) in OE lines whereas our knockout lines did not produce shoots, suggesting conserved functions of different WD40 proteins in diverse pathways of plant morphogenesis and reproduction.</p><p>To explore the possibility of using <italic>LuWD40-1</italic> OE lines to develop hybrids, we crossed the male sterile flowers of OE lines with pollen from Prairie Grande. A total of ten out of 30 cross-pollinated flowers set seeds suggesting the fertile state of ovaries. The low rate of cross-pollination efficiency could be due to pollen incompatibility mechanisms. Constitutive expression of the <italic>LuWD40-1</italic> gene may also interfere with cellular processes affecting pollen tube growth in the style of OE lines similar to the Pollen tube Defective WD40 (PD40) gene in tobacco <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0069124-Hafidh1">[79]</xref>. More likely, it reflects the inherent difficulties associated with controlled crossing such as ovary receptivity and pollen developmental stage at the time of pollination.</p><p>The current study lays a foundation for the generation of male sterile flax lines providing basic physiological characterization of <italic>LuWD40-1</italic>. More insights can be gained by studying the pollen specific expression of this gene in flax to separate the negative effects on plant growth from the desired male sterility phenotype. It is imperative to understand the inheritance of this system for its implementation in the field.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0069124.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Sequence and schematic representation of the LuWD40-1 protein encoded by cDNA clone LuP1225D10.</bold> (A) Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of LuWD40-1 with 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; untranslated regions.
