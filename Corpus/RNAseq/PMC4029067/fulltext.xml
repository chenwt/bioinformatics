Such resistance can be the consequence of changes in proteins targeted by insecticides (target site mediated resistance), increased insecticide biodegradation (metabolic resistance), altered transport, sequestration or other mechanisms. As opposed to target site resistance, other mechanisms are far from being fully understood. Indeed, insecticide selection often affects a large number of genes and various biological processes can hypothetically confer resistance. In this context, the aim of the present study was to use RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for comparing transcription level and polymorphism variations associated with adaptation to chemical insecticides in the mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. Biological materials consisted of a parental susceptible strain together with three child strains selected across multiple generations with three insecticides from different classes: the pyrethroid permethrin, the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and the carbamate propoxur.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After ten generations, insecticide-selected strains showed elevated resistance levels to the insecticides used for selection. RNA-seq data allowed detecting over 13,000 transcripts, of which 413 were differentially transcribed in insecticide-selected strains as compared to the susceptible strain. Among them, a significant enrichment of transcripts encoding cuticle proteins, transporters and enzymes was observed. Polymorphism analysis revealed over 2500 SNPs showing&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;50% allele frequency variations in insecticide-selected strains as compared to the susceptible strain, affecting over 1000 transcripts. Comparing gene transcription and polymorphism patterns revealed marked differences among strains. While imidacloprid selection was linked to the over transcription of many genes, permethrin selection was rather linked to polymorphism variations. Focusing on detoxification enzymes revealed that permethrin selection strongly affected the polymorphism of several transcripts encoding cytochrome P450 monooxygenases likely involved in insecticide biodegradation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study confirmed the power of RNA-seq for identifying concomitantly quantitative and qualitative transcriptome changes associated with insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. Our results suggest that transcriptome modifications can be selected rapidly by insecticides and affect multiple biological functions. Previously neglected by molecular screenings, polymorphism variations of detoxification enzymes may play an important role in the adaptive response of mosquitoes to insecticides.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>Insecticide resistance</kwd><kwd>Mosquito</kwd><kwd>Dengue</kwd><kwd>Detoxification enzymes</kwd><kwd>Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase</kwd><kwd>CYP</kwd><kwd>Cuticle</kwd><kwd>Transporters</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Mosquitoes are vectors of several human diseases representing a major burden for public health worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Half of the world&#x02019;s population is exposed to malaria while dengue fever represents a burden in over 100 countries with 2.5 billion people at risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Since the 1950s, chemical insecticides have been massively used for controlling mosquito populations but their efficacy is now threatened by resistance mechanisms developed by insects. In absence of efficient alternatives, characterizing molecular mechanisms underlying resistance is a key step for improving resistance management strategies.</p><p>Resistance to insecticides can be the consequence of different mechanisms, such as a mutation of the proteins targeted by the insecticide (target-site insensitivity), a lower penetration of the insecticide, its sequestration, or its biodegradation (metabolic resistance) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Target-site insensitivity and metabolic resistance are known as the two main resistance mechanisms in mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Mutations causing target-site insensitivity are well-characterized in mosquitoes and molecular tests detecting these mutations are available for species of public health importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Metabolic resistance has been reported worldwide and usually involves detoxification enzymes such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s or CYPs for genes), carboxy/cholinesterases (CCEs), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and UDP glucosyl-transferases (UGTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, due to the large number of mosquito genes encoding detoxification enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] pinpointing those responsible for resistance remains challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Metabolic resistance has been mostly associated with an increased level of detoxification enzymes in resistant populations and multiple candidate genes have been identified by microarray screenings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In contrast, polymorphism variations potentially affecting the functionality of detoxification enzymes have been hardly studied in mosquitoes despite evidences suggesting that this phenomenon may play a role in insecticide resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Recently, polymorphism of a P450 gene has been associated with pyrethroid resistance in the mosquito <italic>culex pipiens</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and a reduction of sequence diversity in two P450 genes conferring resistance to pyrethroids has been observed in <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This suggests that a deep analysis of the polymorphism associated with resistance can improve our understanding of mechanisms developed by mosquitoes to resist insecticides. Today, such knowledge gap can be overcome by high throughput sequencing approaches such as mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which can generates concomitantly gene expression and polymorphism data over the whole transcriptome from a single experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>In this context, the aim of the present study was to use RNA-seq for investigating transcription level and polymorphism variations associated with adaptation to three insecticides from distinct chemical families in the mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. A susceptible strain was selected with the pyrethroid permethrin, the neonicotinoid imidacloprid or the carbamate propoxur, to produce three resistant strains. After ten generations of selection, the constitutive resistance level of each resistant strain was measured and the transcriptome of each strain was deep sequenced. After mapping cDNA reads to the genome, gene expression and polymorphism variations linked to insecticide selection were identified and compared across strains. Results are discussed in regards of known and new putative adaptive mechanisms conferring insecticide resistance in mosquitoes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Insecticide resistance levels</title><p>After ten generations of larval selection with the insecticides permethrin (Perm-R strain), imidacloprid (Imida-R strain) or propoxur (Propo-R strain), bioassays revealed a constitutive increased resistance of each selected strain to its respective insecticide as compared to the parental susceptible strain (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

When considering all clusters as a whole, a significant enrichment of transcripts related to immunity and cuticular proteins was observed. Cluster 1, representing transcripts strongly over transcribed in Perm-R strain included 5 hexamerins associated to cellular trafficking.

In addition, RNA-seq produces polymorphism data and useful information to re-annotate gene models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Despite recent studies pointing out the role of polymorphism variations in insecticide resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], such aspect has never been investigated at the transcriptome level in mosquitoes. Indeed, the only study using RNA-seq to investigate insecticide resistance in mosquitoes did not consider polymorphism variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In this regard, the present study represents the first attempt to use RNA-seq for examining concomitantly quantitative and qualitative transcriptome changes associated with resistance to different insecticides in mosquitoes.</p><sec><title>Insecticide selection and resistance levels</title><p>After 10 generations of selection, bioassays revealed a constitutive increased resistance of each selected strain to its respective insecticide compared to the susceptible parental strain. Although resistance levels were low as compared to what can be observed <italic>in natura</italic>, they were significant regarding the few generations of selection, the full susceptibility of the parental strain and the absence of target-site resistance alleles. The rapid rise of resistance suggests that alleles conferring a better fitness in presence of insecticides are already present in susceptible populations and can be promptly selected under a constant selection pressure. Although laboratory selection does not fully mimic adaptive processes occurring <italic>in natura</italic> (e.g. lower population sizes, different environment, no introduction of resistant alleles by migration &#x02026;), selecting all resistant strains from a single susceptible strain allowed minimizing variations related to different genetic backgrounds.

Such mapping efficiency appeared acceptable considering polymorphism variations occurring between the reference genome (Liverpool strain) and the parental strain used in our study (Bora-Bora strain). The high correlation of expression data obtained from cDNA library replicates confirmed the robustness of cDNA library construction and sequencing procedures. By applying high-stringency sequence quality and transcript coverage filtering, high fidelity transcription data were recovered for more than 13000 transcripts. Such detection level was comparable to those obtained with DNA microarrays at the same life stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. More than 2500 differential SNPs linked to insecticide selection were identified. Although our experimental design did not control for stochastic effects (genetic drift) and the presence of false positives is likely, transcripts affected by these differential SNPs represent strong candidates for further functional validation studies. Little overlap was found between transcripts differentially transcribed in selected strains and those affected by differential SNPs. This was expected as RNA-seq data are restricted to transcripts and did not cover regulatory regions often located outside transcript boundaries.

Such strong effect in the Imida-R strain was not associated to changes in the polymorphism of these transcripts, suggesting that insecticide selection is affecting their regulation rather than their conformation. Cuticle plays a crucial role in protecting insects from their environment. The vast majority of chemical insecticides are active by contact and changes in cuticle thickness or conformation have been suggested to contribute to resistance in mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].

For example, <italic>An. gambiae</italic> CYP6Z1 metabolizes the organochlorine DDT and the carbamate carbaryl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] while CYP6M2 metabolizes both DDT and pyrethroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].</p><p>Metabolic resistance of mosquitoes to pyrethroids has been mainly associated with an over expression of P450s able to metabolize them. Among the multiple candidates identified by microarray screenings, <italic>An. gambiae</italic> CYP6M2 and CYP6P3, <italic>An. funestus</italic> CYP6P9, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> CYP9J32, CYP9J24, CYP9J28, and <italic>Cx quinquefasciatus</italic> CYP6M10 and CYP4H24 have been validated as pyrethroid metabolizers [review in 18]. CYP6Zs and CYP6Ms have also been associated with pyrethroid resistance by QTL in <italic>An. funestus</italic> where resistance mainly relies on metabolic mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Recently, the central role of mosquito CYP6Zs in pyrethroid degradation pathway was revealed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. In the present study few P450s were found over transcribed in the Perm-R strain. Among them, CYP6BB2 was also found strongly over transcribed in pyrethroid resistant populations from Cuba and Cayman islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Unexpectedly, known <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> pyrethroid metabolizers or paralogs of those validated from other mosquito species were not found over transcribed in the Perm-R strain. However, a strong selection imprint was detected in the Perm-R strain in a P450 cluster in supercontig 1.371containing strong candidates CYP6Ms, CYP6Ns and CYP6Zs, suggesting that the selection of particular P450 variants can contribute to pyrethroid resistance. In mammals, it is well known that P450 variants can display different substrate specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. To date, such variations have been neglected in mosquitoes with only few studies pointing out P450 alleles associated with insecticide resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Finally, the strong selection imprint observed in these P450s might explain their unexpected under transcription in the Perm-R strain. Indeed, the apparent under expression of transcripts affected by differential SNPs might be the consequence of a mapping bias due to a higher divergence from the reference genome or an enrichment in low-expressed alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Although further analyses are required for investigating the role of allele-specific expression in resistance, our data supports the selection of particular detoxification enzyme variants by insecticides.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study primarily aimed at assessing the usefulness of RNA-seq to investigate insecticide resistance mechanisms in mosquitoes. Results confirmed that this technique produces high-quality gene expression data together with solid polymorphism data. Distinct responses to selection with insecticides from different chemical families were observed with a balance between gene expression and polymorphism variations. Polymorphism variations of P450 enzymes were strongly linked to pyrethroid selection. Although additional analyses are required to validate variants linked to resistance, such finding highlights the necessity to consider both gene expression and polymorphism variations for identifying candidate genes potentially involved in insecticide resistance. As sequencing costs are decreasing and new sequencing strategies and bioinformatics pipelines are developed, obtaining gene expression and polymorphism data from the same samples using high-throughput sequencing should now be considered as a valuable alternative to microarrays.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mosquito selection with insecticides and bioassays</title><p>The mosquito <italic>Ae. aegypti,</italic> was used in the present study. Mosquitoes were reared in standard insectary conditions (26&#x000b0;C, 14&#x000a0;h/10&#x000a0;h light/dark, 80% relative humidity) in tap water (larvae) and net cages (adults). Larvae and adults were fed with hay pellets and papers impregnated with honey respectively. Blood feeding of adult females was performed on mice. Mice were maintained in an animal house agreed by French Ministry of animal welfare (n&#x000b0; B 38 421 10 001) and used in accordance to EU laws and the relevant ethic committee recommendations (ComEth Grenoble - C2EA - 12). The laboratory strain Bora-Bora, originating from French Polynesia and fully susceptible to insecticides, was used as a parental strain to select three independent strains with the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin (Perm-R strain), the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid (Imida-R strain) and the carbamate insecticide propoxur (Propo-R strain). Both pyrethroid and carbamate insecticides are heavily used against mosquitoes and resistance to these insecticides has been reported worldwide. Neonicotinoids are marginaly used against mosquitoes but represent one possible alternative when resistance to other insecticide threatens the efficacy of mosquito control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Selection was performed by exposing early 4th-stage larvae for 24&#x000a0;h to a lethal dose of each insecticide. For each strain, the dose of insecticide was adjusted at each generation (4 to 6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L permethrin, 500 to 1000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L imidacloprid and 500 to 800&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L propoxur) in order to reach 60-80% larval mortality after 24&#x000a0;h exposure. Surviving larvae were transferred in clean tap water, fed with standard larval food and allowed to emerge. Adults were allowed to reproduce for 4&#x000a0;days and blood-fed to obtain eggs for the next generation. In order to limit bottleneck effects, each generation was seeded with more than 6000 individuals. Selection process was carried out in parallel for all strains during ten generations. During this process, the susceptible parental strain was maintained in similar condition without insecticide selection. Bioassays and molecular work were performed on early 4th-stage larvae of the 11th generation (G<sub>11</sub> larvae) bred in standard conditions and not exposed to insecticides.</p><p>To assess the constitutive resistance level of each selected strain, larval bioassays were conducted with permethrin, imidacloprid and propoxur comparatively to the susceptible parental strain. Five doses of each insecticide and four replicates of 25 larvae per dose were used. Doses of permethrin (1.5 to 6.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L), imidacloprid (150 to 2200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L) and propoxur (100 to 2000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L) were chosen in order to cover the whole mortality range after 24&#x000a0;h exposure. Lethal concentrations corresponding to 50% mortality (LC<sub>50</sub>) and their 95% confident intervals (CI<sub>95%</sub>) were then calculated with a probit approach for each strain using XL-Stat (Addinsoft, Paris, France). Resistance ratios (RR<sub>50</sub> based on LC<sub>50</sub> values) were calculated by comparison to the susceptible parental strain.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and cDNA libraries preparation</title><p>For each strain, total RNA was extracted from G<sub>11</sub> larvae obtained from three independent egg batches (three biological replicates per strain). Each biological replicate consisted of 180 larvae reared in 200&#x000a0;mL tap water in standardized insectary conditions. For each biological replicate, total RNA was extracted from 60 4th-stage larvae using the RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Total RNA quality and quantity were assessed with a Nanodrop ND1000 (Thermo Scientific, USA) and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA). After extraction, total RNAs from each biological replicate were pooled in equal quantity to obtain a total RNA mixture representative of 180 individuals. Total RNA pools from each strain were then used for preparing cDNA libraries using the mRNA-Seq Sample Prep Kit (Part 1004898 Rev D, Illumina, USA). Two replicates of cDNA libraries were prepared for each strain as follows. Briefly, mRNAs were purified using poly-T beads and chemically fragmented. These fragmented mRNAs were reverse-transcribed using Superscript II (Invitrogen) at 42&#x000b0;C for 50&#x000a0;min. Double-stranded cDNAs were then synthesized and mRNAs removed using DNA polymerase I and RNase H at 16&#x000b0;C for 2.5&#x000a0;hours. Double-stranded cDNAs were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) and processed for end-repair and 3&#x02032; adenylation using Klenow polymerase. Sequencing adaptors were then ligated using DNA ligase. Adapter-ligated cDNA libraries were then purified on 2% agarose gel based on a size range of 200&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;25&#x000a0;bp. Adapter-ligated cDNA libraries were then enriched by 15 PCR cycles with adaptor-specific primers using Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes Oy). Enriched cDNA libraries were then purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) before quality control analysis on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequencing, read mapping and genome re-annotation</title><p>Each double-stranded cDNA library was sequenced as single reads of 75&#x000a0;bp in a distinct flow cell lane with a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina) at the National Sequencing Center (Genoscope, Evry, France). Reads were then mapped to the <italic>Ae.aegypti</italic> genome sequence (Aaeg L1.2 gene set, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vectorbase.org">http://vectorbase.org</ext-link>) using the Tophat algorithm with default parameters (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu">http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu</ext-link>, release 1.0.14) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], leading to an average mapping rate of 80%. Bam files were then loaded into Genespring NGS version 12.5 (Agilent Technologies) for further analysis. Reads were then filtered based on the sequence quality (mean read quality&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;30 and with&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10 Ns) and mapping quality (alignment score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;98), and non-primary multiply mapped reads were removed. The remaining reads were used for all subsequent analyses. Read coverage was computed and genome annotation was challenged based on read distribution and coverage. Default feature detection parameters were used (min exon length percentile 10; min intro length percentile 10; max intron length percentile 90; min exon RPKM percentile 50; min gene RPKM percentile 50; min gene length percentile 10; min exon RPKM with respect to host gene percentage 75; min number of reads in exon 10). Modified exon-intron structures and new putative transcripts were proposed based on read coverage, read splicing events and distance with respect to existing genes and transcripts. Reads per Kilobase exon Model per Million sequenced reads (RPKMs) were calculated for all known and putative new transcripts. Transcript RPKM values were used for assessing the variability between library replicates for each strain.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential transcription analysis</title><p>In order to avoid estimating transcription ratios from low coverage transcripts, only the 13105 transcripts showing at least 0.5 RPKM per condition (~ 30 reads/kb) were considered for differential transcription analysis. Differential transcription of each transcript was then tested between insecticide-selected strains and the susceptible parental strain using an Audic-Claverie test (AC test) based on read counts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>] with a Benjamini and Hochberg&#x02019;s multiple testing correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Transcripts showing an adjusted P value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10<sup>-15</sup> and a fold change&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;3 in either direction were considered as differentially transcribed between insecticide-selected strains and the parental susceptible strain. RNA-seq transcription data from the Imida-R strain were compared with transcription data obtained from the same biological samples with the <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> 15&#x000a0;K DNA microarray as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Only the 326 transcripts showing significant adjusted P values in both techniques were considered.</p></sec><sec><title>Polymorphism detection and differential analysis</title><p>Detection of polymorphisms was performed based on the 174 million reads passing quality filters with the following parameters: confidence score threshold&#x02009;=&#x02009;100, coverage&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;20 reads, base quality cut off&#x02009;=&#x02009;5, ignore locations within or next to homopolymer stretches&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10 nucleotides. Among all detected polymorphism variations, only SNP substitutions were considered for differential polymorphism analyses. SNP allele frequencies were then computed between each insecticide-selected strain and the susceptible strain. Allele frequencies were considered as differential between an insecticide-selected strain and the susceptible strain (hereafter named as differential SNPs) if the following conditions were fulfilled: <italic>i)</italic> Total read coverage at SNP position between both strains&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50, <italic>ii)</italic> Strand bias at SNP position&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;50 for both strains and <italic>iii)</italic> Allele frequency difference between both strains&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;50% in either direction. Potential genic effects of SNPs were computed by comparing SNP with reference genome annotation. Genic effects were defined as 5&#x02032;UTR, Synonymous, Non-synonymous, Intronic, 3&#x02032;UTR and Intergenic (<italic>i.e.</italic> close but not within gene boundaries).</p></sec><sec><title>GO term enrichment analyses</title><p>Go term enrichment analyses were conducted on <italic>i)</italic> transcripts significantly over transcribed in insecticide-selected strains compared to the susceptible strain, <italic>ii)</italic> transcripts significantly under transcribed in insecticide-selected strains compared to the susceptible strain and <italic>iii)</italic> transcripts affected by differential SNPs in their coding sequence as compared to the susceptible strain. GO term enrichment analyses were performed separately on each transcript list versus all detected transcripts. Enrichment statistics were computed based on hypergeometric distribution and adjusted with Benjamini-Yekutieli&#x02019;s multiple testing correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] which takes into account the dependency among GO terms. GO terms showing an adjusted P value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05 were considered as significantly enriched in insecticide-selected strains compared to the susceptible strain.</p></sec><sec><title>Clustering analyses</title><p>All clustering analyses were performed with TM4 MEV version 4.3.02 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] using Euclidean distance and complete linkage algorithm with optimization of gene and condition trees. Transcripts significantly differentially transcribed (see above for thresholds) in any insecticide-selected strain compared to the parental susceptible strain were clustered based on their TR (log<sub>2</sub> ratios). Annotated transcripts represented in the main clusters were then assigned to nine biological categories based on their annotation (including GO terms). Categories were defined as follow: &#x02018;Detoxification', &#x02018;Kinases/Phosphatases', &#x02018;Other enzymes', &#x02018;Cuticle', &#x02018;Immunity', &#x02018;Hormones and neurotransmitters signaling', &#x02018;Transcription factors', &#x02018;Intra or extracellular trafficking/chaperonins&#x02019; and &#x02018;Structure&#x02019;. Enrichment of these categories compared to all detected transcripts was then computed using a one-side Fisher&#x02019;s exact test followed by Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Categories showing a corrected P value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 were considered significantly enriched. A similar clustering analysis was performed with differential SNPs (see above for detailed criteria) falling in coding regions. Clustering was performed as described above using allele frequency variations (-100% to +100%) in each strain as compared to the susceptible strain. Differential SNPs were assigned to nine different biological categories (see above) in regard of the nature of the transcript affected. For each cluster, biological category enrichment was computed versus all detected transcripts as described above.</p><p>Clustering analyses were then focused on transcripts encoding genes potentially involved in insecticide detoxification pathways (detoxification <italic>sensus lato</italic>). Clustering of both transcription level variations and differential SNPs were performed as described above. Separate analyses were conducted for cytochrome P450 monoooxygenases (CYPs) and other detoxification transcripts.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>JPD conceived and coordinated the study, prepared the samples, analyzed data and wrote the manuscript.
