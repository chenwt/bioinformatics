In order to observe adaptive and evolutionary capacities of polyploids, we compared the growth, primary metabolism and transcriptomic expression level in the leaves of the newly formed allotetraploid <italic>Coffea arabica</italic> species compared with its two diploid parental species (<italic>Coffea eugenioides</italic> and <italic>Coffea canephora</italic>), exposed to four thermal regimes (TRs; 18&#x02013;14, 23&#x02013;19, 28&#x02013;24 and 33&#x02013;29&#x000b0;C). The growth rate of the allopolyploid <italic>C. arabica</italic> was similar to that of <italic>C. canephora</italic> under the hottest TR and that of <italic>C. eugenioides</italic> under the coldest TR. For metabolite contents measured at the hottest TR, the allopolyploid showed similar behavior to <italic>C. canephora</italic>, the parent which tolerates higher growth temperatures in the natural environment. However, at the coldest TR, the allopolyploid displayed higher sucrose, raffinose and ABA contents than those of its two parents and similar linolenic acid leaf composition and Chl content to those of <italic>C. eugenioides</italic>. At the gene expression level, few differences between the allopolyploid and its parents were observed for studied genes linked to photosynthesis, respiration and the circadian clock, whereas genes linked to redox activity showed a greater capacity of the allopolyploid for homeostasis. Finally, we found that the overall transcriptional response to TRs of the allopolyploid was more homeostatic compared with its parents. This better transcriptional homeostasis of the allopolyploid <italic>C. arabica</italic> afforded a greater phenotypic homeostasis when faced with environments that are unsuited to the diploid parental species.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Coffea arabica</italic></kwd><kwd>Homeostasis</kwd><kwd>Natural allopolyploid</kwd><kwd>Primary metabolism</kwd><kwd>Temperature</kwd><kwd>Transcriptomic expression level</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Allopolyploidization has long been recognized as a major mechanism of adaptation and speciation in plants. Allopolyploid species, defined as interspecific hybrids in which chromosome sets are doubled, lead to permanent fixation of heterozygosity and hybrid vigor (<xref rid="pcv117-B18" ref-type="bibr">Chen 2010</xref>). Fixed heterozygosity is well documented as a source of genetic variation and phenotypic variability in polyploids (<xref rid="pcv117-B36" ref-type="bibr">Feldman and Levy 2005</xref>) and could contribute to a greater ecological tolerance of polyploids compared with their parents. Many phenotypic changes with a high adaptive value, concerning vigor, biomass and adaptation to biotic and abiotic stress, would enable the polyploids to occupy new ecological niches and seem to be conducive to their use in agriculture (<xref rid="pcv117-B68" ref-type="bibr">Osborn et al. 2003</xref>, <xref rid="pcv117-B17" ref-type="bibr">Chen 2007</xref>). A study by <xref rid="pcv117-B64" ref-type="bibr">Ni et al. (2009)</xref> focusing on allopolyploids of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> sp. revealed some better performances in allopolyploid individuals which could be assimilated to the heterosis seen in hybrids, but with the particularity of being fixed in the allopolyploidy context. In addition, allopolyploidy is often associated with enhanced stress tolerance. For example, the <italic>Spartina anglica</italic> allopolyploid is adapted to varied environments and also displayed better tolerance than its parental species to reducing conditions and to sulfite-rich sediments (<xref rid="pcv117-B1" ref-type="bibr">Ainouche et al. 2004</xref>, <xref rid="pcv117-B57" ref-type="bibr">Maricle et al. 2006</xref>, <xref rid="pcv117-B2" ref-type="bibr">Ainouche et al. 2009</xref>).</p><p>In order to observe adaptive and evolutionary capacities in allopolyploids, we used <italic>Coffea arabica</italic>, a tropical perennial species, as our study model. <italic>Coffea arabica</italic> is an allopolyploid species (2<italic>n</italic> = 4<italic>x</italic> = 44) resulting from the hybridization between <italic>Coffea eugenioides</italic> and <italic>Coffea canephora</italic> or ecotypes related to those diploid species (<xref rid="pcv117-B51" ref-type="bibr">Lashermes et al. 1999</xref>). The allopolyploid speciation of <italic>C. arabica</italic> took place in relatively recent times. The analysis of nucleotide substitutions dates the origin of the allotetraploid species <italic>C. arabica</italic> in a time interval spanning 10,000 or 150,000 years BP (<xref rid="pcv117-B15" ref-type="bibr">Cenci et al. 2012</xref>). In the wild state, the territory of <italic>C. canephora</italic> stretches from Central Africa to the Gulf of Guinea and Uganda. Compared with the vast territory occupied by <italic>C. canephora</italic>, the territories of <italic>C. arabica</italic> and <italic>C. eugenioides</italic> are more limited. The territory of wild <italic>C. eugenioides</italic> stretches from east to south-east Africa (Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda and Burundi). For its part, <italic>C. arabica</italic> comes from a limited region of south-western Ethiopia and the Boma Plateau of Sudan where no other <italic>Coffea</italic> species is represented. Thus, these three <italic>Coffea</italic> species also grow at different elevations and temperatures. The wild <italic>C. arabica</italic> species is found in high altitude tropical forests, between 1,200 and 1,950 m (<xref rid="pcv117-B29" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al. 2006</xref>), with a mean annual temperature optimum of 18&#x02013;21&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="pcv117-B26" ref-type="bibr">Damatta and Ramalho 2006</xref>). The wild <italic>C. canephora</italic> species comes from low to medium altitude equatorial rainforests, between 250 and 1,500 m (<xref rid="pcv117-B29" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al. 2006</xref>), with a mean annual temperature optimum of 22&#x02013;26&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="pcv117-B26" ref-type="bibr">Damatta and Ramalho 2006</xref>). Lastly, the wild <italic>C. eugenioides</italic> species is found in high altitude forests between 1,000 and 2,000 m, with a mean annual temperature optimum of 18&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="pcv117-B29" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al. 2006</xref>).</p><p>Temperature provides a good framework for testing homeostasis (vs. phenotypic plasticity), because many traits are highly sensitive to changes in thermal conditions (<xref rid="pcv117-B9" ref-type="bibr">Bita and Gerats 2013</xref>). In this study, we tried to establish performances of <italic>C. arabica</italic> compared with its parental diploid species under thermal regimes (TRs), representing a possible range of intertropical TRs. We compared the growth, primary metabolism and patterns of transcriptomic expression of these three species exposed to different TRs. Following the definition of <xref rid="pcv117-B80" ref-type="bibr">Schlitting and Smith (2002)</xref> and <xref rid="pcv117-B65" ref-type="bibr">Nicotra et al. (2010)</xref>, phenotypic plasticity is construed to encompass a diversity of phenomena spanning several hierarchical levels of organization and assumed to be mediated at the molecular level. Assuming that homeostasis (vs. phenotypic plasticity) is mediated at the molecular level (<xref rid="pcv117-B80" ref-type="bibr">Schlichting and Smith 2002</xref>, <xref rid="pcv117-B65" ref-type="bibr">Nicotra et al. 2010</xref>), we measured the level of gene expression in leaves taking an RNA sequencing (RNAseq) approach, and an index that globally measured the plasticity of the transcriptomes of the three species depending on the environment is calculated. Gene expression phenotypes can be also measured as a reaction norm in response to environmental variations (<xref rid="pcv117-B43" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins-Davis and Townsend 2009</xref>). The genes were classed according to their stability (i.e. plasticity) depending on the thermal environment and/or the species. Groups of genes corresponding to photosynthesis, coding for pigments and proteins involved in electron transport or genes coding for related aspects of carbon metabolism were particularly observed. Indeed, according to <xref rid="pcv117-B64" ref-type="bibr">Ni et al. (2009)</xref>, an up-regulation of these genes should be anticipated in the allopolyploid. The response of genes involved in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging network may also be of interest especially when growth temperatures become stressful for plants (18&#x02013;14 and 33&#x02013;29&#x000b0;C). Lastly, we particularly studied some key genes of the circadian clock, since alteration of the circadian rhythm would appear to play a major role in growth vigor and increased biomass in Arabidopsis allotetraploids (<xref rid="pcv117-B64" ref-type="bibr">Ni et al. 2009</xref>) and because they regulate the abundance of proteins involved in many primary metabolic pathways (<xref rid="pcv117-B45" ref-type="bibr">Hotta et al<italic>.</italic> 2007</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of this study was 3-fold. On the one hand, we studied a relatively recent natural allopolyploid in evolutionary terms, but with a sufficient number of generations to be stable, well regulated at the meiosis level and subjected to natural selection, whereas most studies were conducted with neosynthetic allopolyploid models (often poorly regulated at the meiosis level or/and presenting a high level of hybrid vigor). On the other hand, we studied a perennial tropical species, whereas annual temperate species were most often used in studies on phenotypic plasticity depending on TRs. Lastly, we used four contrasting tropical TRs, whereas most studies were carried out in a single environment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>The allopolyploid growth rate was similar to those of its parental diploid species depending on thermal regimes</title><p>We compared the slopes of the thermal reaction norms among the allopolyploid species <italic>C. </italic><italic>arabica</italic> and its diploid parental species (<italic>C. </italic><italic>canephora</italic> and <italic>C. </italic><italic>eugenioides</italic>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcv117/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>). A relative growth rate was calculated from the difference between the dry weights estimated before and after the period in phytotrons (at T0 and T11 weeks). The growth of the three species differed depending on the TRs. Under the coldest TR (18&#x02013;14&#x000b0;C), <italic>C. canephora</italic> growth appeared to be affected but no mortality was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcv117-F1">Fig. 1</xref>A). Conversely, <italic>C. eugenioides</italic> growth was greatly affected by the hottest TR (33&#x02013;29&#x000b0;C), with a mortality amounting to 52%. We considered that this TR was highly stressful for both species. On the other hand, the allopolyploid growth seemed stable whatever the TR, and no mortality was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcv117-F1">Fig. 1</xref>A). Its growth rate was similar to that of <italic>C. canephora</italic> under the hottest TR (33&#x02013;29&#x000b0;C) and to that of <italic>C. eugenioides</italic> under the coldest TR (18&#x02013;14&#x000b0;C).

Each of the 10 patterns involving differential expression is labeled with a Roman numeral and includes a graphical depiction (<xref rid="pcv117-B38" ref-type="bibr">Flagel and Wendel 2010</xref>), where <italic>Coffea canephora</italic> and <italic>Coffea eugenioides</italic> are on the outer edges and the polyploid patterns in the middle. Expression values on the same horizontal line indicate statistically equivalent expression, whereas expression values on higher or lower horizontal lines represent statistically significant up- or down-regulation, respectively. For example, the first gene expression pattern (I) represents genes for which no significance was noted in any comparison between the diploids and the allopolyploid whatever the thermal regime considered. Another example is the genes of pattern VIII in which expression in the <italic>C. canephora</italic> diploid genome was significantly greater than in the <italic>C. eugenioides</italic> diploid genome, with gene expression in the allopolyploid being significantly different from both but with an intermediate value, whatever the thermal regime considered. Finally, pattern X can represent several patterns (only one graphical depiction is presented here), as it involves genes whose differential expression was variable depending on the thermal regime (i.e. significant differences between thermal regimes and/or significant differences between species under two thermal regimes maximum). The 10 patterns were binned in five categories (color codes), representing &#x02018;no change&#x02019; (yellow), &#x02018;<italic>C. eugenioides</italic> dominant-like&#x02019; (green), &#x02018;<italic>C. canephora</italic> dominant-like&#x02019; (blue), &#x02018;transgression&#x02019; (purple), &#x02018;additivity&#x02019; (orange) and &#x02018;not stable&#x02019; (gray).

These genes are of particular interest, since the circadian clock synchronizes biochemical, metabolic and physiological cycles to environmental changes such as temperatures. It appeared that levels of Late elongated hypocotyl (LHY; Cc02_g39990) and Gigantea (GI; Cc10_g15270) transcripts, two key genes in the circadian clock, were modulated by temperature. For these two genes, we found very strong variations across TRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcv117-F5">Fig. 5</xref>A, B). The expression of LHY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcv117-F5">Fig. 5</xref>A) was very weak under the two hottest TRs and greatly increased under the highest TR (18&#x02013;14&#x000b0;C).

The transcript CcFAD3 (Cc01g14330) was very poorly expressed in coffee leaves (data not shown), whereas CcFAD7/8 (Cc02g06400) exhibited high transcript levels in the three species, suggesting a major role for this gene in the leaf C18:3 content. The CcFAD7/8 expression level displayed differential expression between species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcv117-F6">Fig. 6</xref>E) We observed that the allopolyploid transcript level was at the same level as that of <italic>C. canephora</italic> under the hottest TRs (28&#x02013;24 and 33&#x02013;29&#x000b0;C) and significantly higher than that of <italic>C. eugenioides</italic>, but at a higher level than that of <italic>C. canephora</italic> under the coldest TRs (18&#x02013;14 and 23&#x02013;19&#x000b0;C). For other metabolites such as sucrose, stacchyose, rafinose, ABA and its catabolites, we did not observe any significant correlation with upstream genes in biosynthetic pathways.

MYB transcription factors are key components in ABA signaling (<xref rid="pcv117-B88" ref-type="bibr">Yamaguchi-Shinozaki et al. 2006</xref>). <xref rid="pcv117-B47" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al.

In our study, <italic>C. canephora</italic> displayed very good adaptation to the hottest TRs, with an optimum occurring under the 28&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C TR. These growth performances tallied with that observed under natural conditions. Under the coldest TR (18&#x02013;14&#x000b0;C), the <italic>C. canephora</italic> growth rate collapsed and photobleaching symptoms were seen on most of the seedlings. They showed real physiological disorders probably reflecting some extensive damage to the chloroplasts. These observations corresponded to what is commonly observed for cultivated <italic>C. canephora</italic> varieties (<xref rid="pcv117-B70" ref-type="bibr">Partelli et al. 2009</xref>). For its part, <italic>C. eugenioides</italic> grows naturally at rather high tropical elevations, which consequently display a rather cool climate (18&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C according to <xref rid="pcv117-B29" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al. 2006</xref>). In our study, <italic>C. eugenioides</italic> displayed very good adaptation to the coldest TRs, with an optimum occurring under the 23&#x02013;19&#x000b0;C TR. When the TR was very hot (33&#x02013;29&#x000b0;C), there was a very low growth rate associated with high mortality, reflecting poor adaptation of the species. Our study therefore confirmed that <italic>C. eugenioides</italic> is a species that is rather well adapted to cold high altitude climates. As regards the allopolyploid species <italic>C. arabica</italic>, its behavior was similar to that of the parental species best adapted to the TR considered. Under the hottest TR (33&#x02013;29&#x000b0;C), its growth rate was identical to that of <italic>C. canephora</italic>, and under the coldest TR (18&#x02013;14&#x000b0;C) identical to that of <italic>C. eugenioides</italic>. Unlike its parental species, <italic>C. arabica</italic> did not display any major variations at the extreme TR levels, but a stability along the thermal range. This stability reflected phenotypic homeostasis, while the variations seen in the parents reflected greater phenotypic plasticity. Our observations for <italic>C. arabica</italic> corresponded to what has been seen under growing conditions, as this species is currently grown at average temperatures between 18 and 26&#x000b0;C. It has already been found that <italic>C. canephora</italic> shows significant decreases in growth under the 18&#x02013;14&#x000b0;C TR when compared with <italic>C. arabica</italic> (<xref rid="pcv117-B73" ref-type="bibr">Ramalho et al. 2003</xref>). On the other hand, at temperatures &#x0003e;35&#x000b0;C, the coffee plants of both species seem to possess the same tolerance under growing conditions (<xref rid="pcv117-B27" ref-type="bibr">DaMatta et al. 2008</xref>). In fact, under intensive management conditions it is possible to grow Arabica coffee plantations in marginal regions with average temperature as high as 24&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="pcv117-B27" ref-type="bibr">DaMatta et al. 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The metabolic levels of allopolyploid <italic>Coffea arabica</italic> are remarkably similar to those of <italic>Coffea canephora</italic> under the hottest thermal regime (33&#x02013;29&#x000b0;C)</title><p>Under the highest TR (33&#x02013;29&#x000b0;C), the behavior of the allopolyploid was remarkably comparable with that of its <italic>C. canephora</italic> parent. This phenomenon was found for all the metabolite contents measured in this study. As was observed by DaMatta et al. (<xref rid="pcv117-B25" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, <xref rid="pcv117-B26" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), the temperature needed to obtain <italic>A</italic><sub>max</sub> (photosynthetic capacity, obtained under light- and CO<sub>2</sub>-saturating conditions and optimal temperature) was as high as 35&#x000b0;C for both Arabica and Robusta coffee.

Under the two coldest TRs (18&#x02013;14 and 23&#x02013;19&#x000b0;C), the behavior of <italic>C. arabica</italic> differed depending on the measurement taken. All the same, it was noted for the coldest TR (18&#x02013;14&#x000b0;C) that the behavior of <italic>C. arabica</italic> was often original compared with the two parental species, as for the sugars, or similar to that of <italic>C. eugenioides</italic>, as was the case for the Chl and linolenic acid contents. As was explained in <xref rid="pcv117-B26" ref-type="bibr">Damatta et al.

On the other hand, <xref rid="pcv117-B14" ref-type="bibr">Campos et al.

On the other hand, the latter displayed greater plasticity. The possession of two complete subgenomes from different parental species seems to promote homeostasis in allopolyploids compared with diploid species.

In our study, we applied the same partitioning rule as <xref rid="pcv117-B76" ref-type="bibr">Rapp et al. (2009)</xref>, adding on this additional condition: in order for a gene to be classed as &#x02018;additive&#x02019;, &#x02018;dominant&#x02019; or &#x02018;overdominant&#x02019;, it had to be so for all the TRs. Around 40% of genes were considered as &#x02018;homeostatic&#x02019;, because they displayed no significance (&#x02018;no change&#x02019; category) in any comparison between the diploids and the allopolyploid whatever the TR considered. This large proportion showed to what degree the three species shared similar expression levels under TRs that were nonetheless highly contrasting for the species studied. Only 4% of genes were differentially expressed between species and for which the allopolyploid was systematically positioned in a situation of dominance, overdominance or additivity. Among the overdominance genes, we noted for future in-depth study the presence of the Hasty 1 gene, a member of the importin-&#x003b2; family in Arabidopsis and known to regulate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of molecules as micro RNAs and, for this reason, involved in several different morphogenetic pathways (<xref rid="pcv117-B69" ref-type="bibr">Park et al. 2005</xref>). For the remaining 56% of expressed genes, &#x02018;plastic&#x02019; expression patterns were found, i.e. in strong interaction with the TR. These so-called &#x02018;plastic&#x02019; genes had variable relations of dominance, overdominance and additivity between TRs. This observation backed up our earlier results whereby we showed that some genes in an additive situation for one TR became, for example, &#x02018;<italic>C. canephora</italic>-like dominance&#x02019; for another TR and more globally that the transcriptome divergence between <italic>C. canephora</italic> and <italic>C. arabica</italic> was modulated by the TR (<xref rid="pcv117-B4" ref-type="bibr">Bardil et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>Until recently, we believed that there existed a close link between expression level dominance and homeolog expression bias in coffee as has been shown in cotton (<xref rid="pcv117-B90" ref-type="bibr">Yoo et al. 2013</xref>). Indeed, it was considered that &#x02018;transcriptomic shock&#x02019; (<xref rid="pcv117-B42" ref-type="bibr">Hegarty et al. 2006</xref>, <xref rid="pcv117-B12" ref-type="bibr">Buggs et al. 2011</xref>) generated by the merging of two different genomes resulted in massive novel patterns of homeolog activation and repression, through massive transactivation and repression due to the divergence in parental regulatory mechanisms that become reunited in allopolyploids (<xref rid="pcv117-B90" ref-type="bibr">Yoo et al. 2013</xref>). The results obtained by our team with <italic>C. arabica</italic> (<xref rid="pcv117-B21" ref-type="bibr">Combes et al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="pcv117-B22" ref-type="bibr">Combes et al. 2013</xref>) showed that the subgenome contributions to the transcriptome appeared close to balanced and marginally altered by the growing temperatures. We have concluded that <italic>C. arabica</italic>&#x02019;s ability to tolerate a broader range of growing temperatures did not result from massively differential use of homeologs. In the present study we showed a very limited number of &#x02018;non-expressed genes&#x02019;. The large proportion of &#x02018;plastic&#x02019; genes on the one hand and the low homeolog expression bias on the other hand suggests that differential gene expression is probably mainly dependent on a small number of regulators (transcription factors, epigenetic mechanisms, transposons and post-transcriptional regulation), which are themselves probably highly dependent on the ambient temperatures. Among the genes expressed only in the allopolyploid, we found, for example, the Cc00_g14760 gene, which is a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) that resembles AT1G51660. The MAPKs play important roles at the intersection between environmental stress responses and internal growth programs. They are involved in plant immunity, cell death regulation or development of stomata or epidermal spores (<xref rid="pcv117-B82" ref-type="bibr">Takemoto et al. 2005</xref>, <xref rid="pcv117-B48" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. 2012</xref>).

Here, we only studied the circadian clock at ZT6, which was no doubt not enough to confirm that the circadian clock matched the environment in the same way in the three species. For two major genes of the circadian cycle (LHY and GI), the allopolyploid displays significant differences from one or both parents only under the coldest and hottest TRs (18&#x02013;14 and 33&#x02013;29&#x000b0;C).</p><p>Among the genes linearly correlated with LHY expression, there was also a serine/arginine-rich splicing factor. These proteins are emerging as one of the master regulators of gene expression (<xref rid="pcv117-B55" ref-type="bibr">Long and Caceres 2009</xref>). Recent data suggest that alternative splicing may be involved in the regulation of clock temperature compensation (<xref rid="pcv117-B37" ref-type="bibr">Filichkin and Mockler 2012</xref>). Expression of the Cc02t38220.1 gene, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2s, was itself also highly correlated to that of the LHY gene (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003e; 0.97). Many intracellular proteins become covalently modified with ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins, and these modifications determine protein turnover, regulation and molecular function, providing a complex regulation of the proteome (<xref rid="pcv117-B87" ref-type="bibr">Wijk and Timmers 2010</xref>). The expression of LHY is also strongly regulated with that of histone deacetylase 19 (HDA 19). This enzyme catalyzes deacetylation at several loci in response to abiotic stress (<xref rid="pcv117-B8" ref-type="bibr">Bilichak and Kovalchuk 2013</xref>).</p><p>Among the genes correlated to GI, we noted several representants of the ZTL family. <xref rid="pcv117-B6" ref-type="bibr">Baudry et al.

Also worth noting were the strong correlations between GI and the CABs (CAB21, CAB36 and CAB13). CAB genes encode proteins which modify the plane of orientation of chlorophylls. Nine genes belonging to the PPR family were highly correlated with the GI/LHY ratio. PPR proteins (<xref rid="pcv117-B56" ref-type="bibr">Lurin et al. 2004</xref>) have a range of essential functions in post-transcriptional processes (including RNA editing, RNA splicing, RNA cleavage and translation) within mitochondria and chloroplasts.

In fact, an important result of our study concerned fatty acids, ROS and the RFOs. Long-term exposure to the range of TRs in our experiment promoted changes in the balance of the fatty acid composition of the three species considered. In that respect, the original behavior of the allopolyploid needs to be mentioned. Indeed, under the two hottest TRs (28&#x02013;24 and 33&#x02013;29&#x000b0;C), the linolenic acid content of the allopolyploid leaves was similar to that of <italic>C. canephora</italic>, whereas under the two coldest TRs (18&#x02013;14 and 23&#x02013;19&#x000b0;C), their composition was similar to that of <italic>C. eugenioides</italic>. Hence, we are seeing great plasticity of the allopolyploid depending on the thermal range. Increases in unsaturated fatty acids in cellular membranes, especially at the beginning of acclimation, have been reported in coffee plants (<xref rid="pcv117-B14" ref-type="bibr">Campos et al. 2003</xref>), and recently Scoti-Campos et al. (2013) showed that <italic>C. arabica</italic> displayed an earlier acclimation response than <italic>C. canephora</italic> at low temperatures. Under the highest TR (33&#x02013;29&#x000b0;C), it is likely that the membrane lipid composition of <italic>C. eugenioides</italic> was a highly unfavorable factor for good acclimation since the majority of the plants died. In addition, we found that stacchyose and raffinose contents were higher in the allopolyploid than in its two parents for the coldest TRs. RFOs act as stabilizers of cellular membranes but also as ROS scavengers (<xref rid="pcv117-B66" ref-type="bibr">Nishizawa et al. 2008</xref>). <xref rid="pcv117-B34" ref-type="bibr">Dos Santos et al. (2011)</xref> previously reported an accumulation of RFOs in coffee leaves in response to different types of stress (heat and water deficit). It is also known that exogenous supplies of ABA lead to an increase in stachyose (<xref rid="pcv117-B30" ref-type="bibr">De Block et al. 2005</xref>). Indeed, we found higher contents or ABA and its catabolites in the allopolyploid under the coldest TR that could explain the accumulation of RFOs.</p><p>The coldest TR (18&#x02013;14&#x000b0;C) was definitely stressful for <italic>C. canephora</italic>. The poor growth and substantial loss of Chl in that species would seem to be due to its inability to prevent and manage oxidative stress. In coffee, the best known action process is based on its capacity to oxidize phenolic compounds when tissue is damaged (<xref rid="pcv117-B60" ref-type="bibr">Melo et al. 2006</xref>). In tomato, PPO overexpression increased photo-oxidative damage during water stress (<xref rid="pcv117-B84" ref-type="bibr">Thipyapong et al. 2004</xref>). The high overexpression of PPOs observed in this study is an indicator of the degree of stress to which this species was subjected under the coldest TR. PPOs are powerful ROS producers and doubtless reflected a disorganization of membranes in <italic>C. canephora</italic> under the coldest TR. However, it was not possible to conclude whether the strong overexpression of these three genes in <italic>C</italic><italic>. canephora</italic> was a consequence of stress or an inducer of stress.</p><p>As we were unable to study the transcriptome of <italic>C. eugenioides</italic> under the hottest TR (33&#x02013;29&#x000b0;C), we can merely put forward hypotheses. It is likely that the very high mortality and the very low growth rates for <italic>C. eugenioides</italic> under this TR were due to some detrimental effects of heat on the photosynthetic apparatus associated with a poorly adapted membrane lipid composition and to the inability of this species to re-establish cellular redox homeostasis.</p><p>In <italic>C. </italic><italic>arabica</italic>, redox activity appeared more stable than that of the diploid parents. We put forward the hypothesis that the increase in AAO expression found in the allopolyploid under the coldest TRs reflected better redox homeostasis than in its two parents. AAO appears highly expressed in <italic>C. arabica</italic> and could be a first line of defense against the oxidative stress. AAO, which is a key regulator of extracellular redox status (<xref rid="pcv117-B67" ref-type="bibr">Noctor 2006</xref>), also has a role in the perception of the environment or stress responses (<xref rid="pcv117-B71" ref-type="bibr">Pignocchi et al. 2003</xref>). <xref rid="pcv117-B20" ref-type="bibr">Coate et al. (2013)</xref> showed that under chronic excess light the capacity for non-photochemical quenching was higher in a recently formed natural allopolyploid (<italic>Glycine dolichocarpa</italic>) than in its diploid parents (<italic>G. tomentella</italic> and <italic>G. syndetika</italic>). Worth noting is that expression of the WRKY33 gene was highly correlated to that of AAO (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003e; 0.91). <xref rid="pcv117-B54" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2011)</xref> showed that this transcription factor is involved in plant thermotolerance. Regarding the APX genes, it is known that the multiple isoforms throughout the chloroplast, mitochondrion, peroxisome and cytosol are differentially regulated in a tissue-dependent manner during oxidative stress responses (<xref rid="pcv117-B77" ref-type="bibr">Rossel et al. 2007</xref>), so it is not surprising that only APX2 was differentially expressed. The increase in APX2 under an intermediate TR (23&#x02013;19&#x000b0;C) may have corresponded to the increase in ABA observed since the APX2 promoter contains ABA-responsive elements (<xref rid="pcv117-B77" ref-type="bibr">Rossel et al. 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional homeostasis of the allopolyploid <italic>Coffea arabica</italic>: better capacity to sense temperatures</title><p>Here, we put forward the hypothesis that the primary temperature sensing (<xref rid="pcv117-B61" ref-type="bibr">Mittler et al. 2012</xref>) of the allopolyploid is more sensitive (i.e. more efficient) than that of the parental species. That greater sensitivity would seem to trigger quicker reprogramming of the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome, in a cascade, in order to adapt to contrasting TRs and thermal stress. Strong correlations between hormones, sugars, linolenic acid and transcription factors suggest that in turn variations of these metabolites play a crucial role in cell signaling cascades. On the other hand, in the diploid parental species, the signals could seem to occur later and trigger more massive, but less effective programming. This could explain the lower homeostasis of their transcriptome. As plasma membranes contain combinations of glycosphingolipids and protein receptors, some optimum modifications in membrane fluidity in the allopolyploid are apt to explain how these sensors might be affected more rapidly.</p><p>Several questions therefore arise for future research. The greater homeostasis in the allopolyploid might lie in its ability to organize changes in membrane fluidity. Testing this hypothesis will call for an experimental design making it possible to study expression kinetics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>To date, many allopolyploids have seemed remarkable because they introduced a very great and obvious break from their parents, pointing towards greater phenotypic plasticity as an important determinant in species invasiveness (<xref rid="pcv117-B28" ref-type="bibr">Davidson et al. 2011</xref>). However greater homeostasis along environmental gradients has also been suggested to explain the evolutive success of polyploids (<xref rid="pcv117-B11" ref-type="bibr">Bretagnolle and Thompson 2001</xref>).</p><p>Here, we conclude that better homeostasis of the allopolyploid <italic>C. arabica</italic> transcriptome affords greater phenotypic homeostasis when faced with environments that are unsuited to the parental species and leads to better adaptive ability in the allopolyploid species. Our results lead to a new vision of the potential of the <italic>C. arabica</italic> allopolyploid compared with its parental diploid species. In particular, they help to explain how a species from a tiny Sudano-Ethiopian ecological niche has been grown since recent times (around two centuries) throughout the intertropical belt in different climates, and all this from a weak genetic diversity.</p><p>In view of predicted global warming, understanding how the membrane lipid saturation and protection regulation system is modified in the allopolyploid and why that affords it an intrinsic adaptation advantage is a promising area to develop homeostatic varieties that are more capable of coping with adverse environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Plant material and cultivation in phytotron chambers</title><p>Fresh mature seeds of <italic>C. </italic><italic>arabica</italic> (L.) and <italic>C. </italic><italic>canephora</italic> (Pierre) were provided by the &#x02018;Nicafrance&#x02019; Experimental Station in La Cumplida (Matagalpa, Nicaragua). <italic>Coffea arabica</italic> was represented by the cultivar &#x02018;Caturra&#x02019;. <italic>Coffea canephora</italic> was represented by the cultivar &#x02018;Nemaya&#x02019;, derived from a cross between two wild Congolese genotypes (<xref rid="pcv117-B7" ref-type="bibr">Bertrand et al. 2000</xref>).

This dry weight was used as a reference to account later for the growth of seedlings subjected to different temperature conditions. For each species, 120 seedlings were shared out into 12 mini-glasshouses. With a view to uniformity, the three species studied were represented in each of the mini-glasshouses by 10 seedlings per species, i.e. 30 seedlings per mini-glasshouse. Four day/night temperature conditions (called TRs) were tested: 18&#x02013;14, 23&#x02013;19, 28&#x02013;24 and 33&#x02013;29&#x000b0;C.</p><p>For each TR, three mini-glasshouses were transferred per phytotron (CRYONEXT, model RTH 1200L).

After 11 weeks in phytotrons, five seedlings were sampled per species and per mini-greenhouse. The dry weights (103&#x000b0;C for 24 h) were determined to establish growth ratios (expressed as a pourcentage of dry weight) compared with the reference.

For RNA extraction, leaves of the terminal young pairs were collected at subjective midday, corresponding to ZT6, and then flash-frozen in nitrogen and stored at 80&#x000b0;C until RNA extraction. At the same time, for the chemical analyses, leaves of the terminal young pairs were sampled, flash-frozen in nitrogen and then freeze-dried.

RNAseq libraries were constructed with the TruSeq RNA sample preparation (Low throughput protocol) kit from Illumina. A 1 &#x000b5;g aliquot of total RNA was used for the construction of the libraries. The first step in the workflow involves purifying the poly(A)-containing mRNA molecules using poly(T) oligo-attached magnetic beads. Following purification, the mRNA is fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations under elevated temperature. The cleaved RNA fragments are copied into first-strand cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers. This was followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis. These cDNA fragments then go through an end repair process, the addition of a single &#x02018;A&#x02019; base and subsequent ligation of the adaptor. The products are then purified and enriched with 15 cycles of PCR. The final cDNA libraries were validated with a DNA 1000 Labchip on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and quantified with a KAPA qPCR kit. For each sequencing lane, four or six libraries were pooled in equal proportions, denatured with NaOH and diluted to 6.5 pM before clustering. Clustering and 100 nucleotide single read sequencing were performed according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p><p>Image analyses and basecalling were performed using the HiSeq Control Software and Real-Time Analysis component (Illumina). The quality of the data was assessed using fastqc from the Babraham Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>) and the Illumina software SAV (Sequence Analysis Viewer). Using the Illumina-supplied algorithm CASAVA (1.8.2 version), which is designed to be particularly efficient for 74 bp reads, 72 bp reads were generated from libraries derived from RNA samples. The 72 bp reads were aligned using BWA (Burrows&#x02013;Wheeler Aligner; <xref rid="pcv117-B53" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin 2009</xref>) against the <italic>C. canephora</italic> 25,574 protein-coding gene models used as the reference transcriptome (<xref rid="pcv117-B31" ref-type="bibr">Deneoud et al. 2014</xref>). A maximum of two mismatched nucleotides (including gaps) was allowed between the read and the reference. Unmapped and multiposition matched reads were excluded from analyses, whereas uniquely mapped reads were counted for each gene model using samtools for subsequent differential expression analysis by DESeq (<xref rid="pcv117-B3" ref-type="bibr">Anders and Huber 2010</xref>). By these criteria, 66&#x02013;69% of reads mapped uniquely to a genomic location (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcv117/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S12</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Differential expression analysis</title><p>The RPKM (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads) data are provided in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcv117/-/DC1">Supplementaty Table S12</ext-link>. However, to compare the expression levels between the species and between the growth TRs, we used the DESeq methodology (<xref rid="pcv117-B3" ref-type="bibr">Anders and Huber 2010</xref>) which is more accurate than RPKM data (<xref rid="pcv117-B33" ref-type="bibr">Dillies et al. 2013</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcv117/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S13</ext-link>). The DESeq package is particularly adapted to experiments with biological replicates. The method is based on the negative binomial distribution, with variance and mean linked by local regression. The count data were normalized on the total number of counts, taking the variance and the mean of the biological replicates into account, and subjected to further pair-wise differential expression transcriptome analysis. For each gene, we estimated the fold change from the first to the second condition (i.e. temperature growth conditions on the one hand and between species under particular growth conditions on the other hand).

This analysis procedure which can be used to class gene expression according to a conventional genetic model (dominance, overdominance and additivity) is usually used for a single environment. Here, we used it simultaneously for the three TRs for which we were able to compare <italic>C. arabica</italic> with its two parents (18&#x02013;14, 23&#x02013;19 and 28&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C). To carry out this analysis, we first eliminated genes with low expression by fixing a limit threshold. To fix that threshold, we considered the sum of the counts (S; i.e. normalized expression levels) for the three TRs (18&#x02013;14, 23&#x02013;19 and 28&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C). Only the genes for which S was &#x02265;250 counts for at least one of the three species were kept. Indeed, beyond that threshold, we considered that we were taking a risk of detecting a signal without any biological significance. Then, we classed the genes per category for each TR. The expression level was binned into 10 patterns depending on relative expression levels between <italic>C. arabica</italic> and its parental species. The patterns were the following: &#x02018;no change&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>C. eugenioides</italic>-like dominance&#x02019; (negative or positive), &#x02018;<italic>C. canephora</italic>-like dominance&#x02019; (negative or positive), &#x02018;overdominance&#x02019; (negative or positive), &#x02018;additivity&#x02019; (negative or positive) and &#x02018;not stable&#x02019;. For a gene to be binned in the &#x02018;no change&#x02019; category, no significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) had to exist between the TRs and between the species for each TR. For a gene to be classed as &#x02018;<italic>C. eugenioides</italic>-like dominant&#x02019; (i.e. &#x02018;dominant <italic>C. canephora</italic>-like&#x02019;, &#x02018;overdominant&#x02019;, &#x02018;additive&#x02019; etc.), no significant difference had ever to be observed between <italic>C. eugenioides</italic> and <italic>C. arabica</italic>, but, on the other hand, there always had to be a significant difference between <italic>C. arabica</italic> and <italic>C. canephora</italic> under all three TRs and, in addition, there had to be no significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) between TRs. This approach covered genes for which <italic>C. arabica</italic> was in an additive, dominance or overdominance situation. The other genes were binned in the &#x02018;not stable&#x02019; category. This represented the genes for which there could exist some significant differences between the TRs for at least one of the three species and/or the genes for which there existed significant differences between species for at least two TRs. This &#x02018;not stable&#x02019; pattern therefore included so-called &#x02018;plastic&#x02019; genes, while the genes of the other nine patterns were considered as &#x02018;homeostatic&#x02019;.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcv117/-/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at PCP online.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was fully supported by <funding-source>CIRAD</funding-source>.</p></sec><sec><title>Disclosures</title><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.</p></sec>
