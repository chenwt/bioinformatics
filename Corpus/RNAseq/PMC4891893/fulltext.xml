Genomics and transcriptomics, but also proteomics and metabolomics have importantly increased our systems-wide understanding of cell physiology, from transcriptional and translational regulation to morphogenesis, stress response and many other processes in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In many cases, particularly for production of metabolites with well-characterized biosynthetic pathways in well-known microbes, results of omics analyses have inspired novel metabolic engineering strategies which led to significant improvements of titres of industrially important metabolites such as <sc>l</sc>-lysine, <sc>l</sc>-threonine or xylitol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, integration of different types of omics data through systems biology approaches is a very promising tool in process development which will further accelerate the development of efficient bioprocesses for production of natural products as well as non-natural chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Soil-dwelling actinomycete bacteria are particularly prolific producers of diverse biologically active secondary metabolites, which have found widespread use in human and veterinary medicine, as well as in agriculture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These substances include antibiotics, antifungal, anti-cancer, immunosuppressive, insecticide, and other classes of bioactive substances of immense value for human health and the global economy. In natural environments these compounds are produced by bacterial cells in very small amounts as non-essential secondary metabolites. Decades of research have been devoted into improvement of diverse strains and fermentation bioprocesses used to produce these metabolites at industrial scale. Predominantly, strains were subjected to random mutagenesis treatments followed by intensive strain selection aiming at improved yields of target products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As a result, many industrially used strains now have drastically, up to 1000 fold, improved secondary metabolite yields. However, they are also full of uncharacterized mutations that disrupt their normal developmental cycle, make them more sensitive to environmental conditions, and hinder further yield optimization.</p><p>Omics methods are clearly opening new possibilities to, more rapidly than before, turn actinomycetes into sophisticated and efficient cell factories. Better understanding of their physiology will enable researchers to selectively remove the metabolic bottlenecks of secondary metabolite biosynthesis without introducing unnecessary or deleterious changes. A &#x0201c;reverse engineering&#x0201d; approach has been proposed, whereby factors important for production could be identified by examining the differences between natural strains and industrial high-producing strains obtained by random mutagenesis and selection. Impressive insight into actinomycete biology has already been achieved by omics techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For example, genome sequencing revealed an unimagined potential of actinomycete strains to synthesize a large number of different bioactive compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, mechanisms responsible for increasing the yields of valuable bioactive compounds are still poorly understood and omics approaches have shown relatively limited success in improving production of important natural products at industrial scale. This is likely due to several reasons: (1) actinomycetes have large genomes, up to 12&#x000a0;Mbp, which is reflected in complex networks of global and pathway-specific regulatory genes and morphological differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; (2) the interrelations between primary and secondary metabolic pathways during the production stage of the bioprocess are complex and poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; (3) laboratory media, in which transcriptomic and proteomic analyses are usually carried out, poorly reflect industrially relevant bioprocess conditions, whereas omics analyses in rich industrial media are hampered by difficulties in isolating high quality RNA and/or proteins; (4) most industrially used actinomycete strains have likely been &#x0201c;over-mutagenized&#x0201d; during the strain improvement process, resulting in a large number of observed genomic variants (SNPs), many of which represent neutral or even negative mutations, often resulting in morphologically and physiological unstable strains, which are difficult to manage reproducibly in industrial environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. All these factors make application of omics analyses and their interpretation even more complex for industrial actinomycetes than for most other microbes.</p><p><italic>Saccharopolyspora erythraea</italic> is a particularly interesting organism to study, as the producer of erythromycin, an industrially and clinically extremely valuable antibiotic, but also as a model representative of actinomycetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Since publication of the <italic>S. erythraea</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], several studies have investigated the changes in gene expression throughout the erythromycin production bioprocess, in both wild type and industrial strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Despite the progress made in these studies, much work remains to be done in assigning functional roles to mutations found in industrial <italic>S. erythraea</italic> strains, identifying key mechanisms influencing erythromycin yield and clarifying the connections between erythromycin biosynthesis and the rest of cellular metabolism. In order to enable rapid increase of erythromycin yield by metabolic engineering/synthetic biology approaches, much deeper understanding of these aspects is of great importance.</p><p>In an effort to address some of these questions, we have undertaken a comprehensive comparative study of the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic differences between the wild type <italic>S. erythraea</italic> NRRL2338 (WT) and an industrial high-producing (HP) strain of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> ABE1441, which had been subjected to mutagenesis and selection for many decades. Importantly, cultivation of both strains was carried out at bioreactor scale, using industrially relevant growth media and bioprocess parameters. Using various data analysis and integration approaches we identified several novel mechanisms that could contribute to higher erythromycin yield in the HP strain. We observed the overexpression of several genes related to branched-chain amino acid metabolism, potentially representing a novel methylmalonyl-CoA building block feeder pathway. Significant increase in final erythromycin yield was observed, when several of these genes were constitutively overexpressed in the WT strain. Our work shows that omics approaches can rapidly provide new strategies for the improvement of actinomycete based production strains, provided that the analyses are carried out with optimised methodology in industrially relevant conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Genome of the high-producing <italic>S. erythraea</italic> strain ABE1441</title><p>The order-of-magnitude increase in erythromycin yield, displayed in industrial cultivation conditions by the HP strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] compared to WT, as well as all differences in the metabolism between the two strains ultimately stem from genomic mutations. These mutations accumulated in the HP strain in numerous rounds of &#x0201c;classical strain&#x0201d; improvement by random mutagenesis and selection. Therefore, we initially sequenced the genome of the HP strain and compared it to the genome of the publicly available WT <italic>S. erythraea</italic> strain. Importantly, before comparison with the HP sequence, the originally deposited WT sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] was screened for potential sequencing errors by comparing it with recently published RNA-seq data of the same NRRL 2338 strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Using this approach 40 putative sequencing errors were identified in the original WT genome of approx. 8.2&#x000a0;Mbp (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Since these sequencing errors would falsely appear as &#x0201c;mutations&#x0201d; when comparing the HP strain to the published WT genome, they were excluded from our comparative genomic analysis. Next generation sequencing of the HP strain revealed 165 genuine mutations compared to WT, affecting 147 genes (i.e. present inside the ORFs or in putative promoter or terminator regions). Out of these, 139 were single nucleotide variations (SNVs), 23 multiple nucleotide variations (MNVs), two deletions (in terminator of SACE_5310 and in SACE_6447) and one insertion (in SACE_4589). Seven genes had two mutations while five and seven mutations were identified in two transposase genes SACE_3579 and SACE_4072, respectively. Mutations were found to be distributed evenly over the whole genome. Particularly noteworthy are mutations in three genes involved in the TCA cycle (SACE_1170, SACE_6584 and SACE_6636), three genes belonging to two-component regulatory systems (SACE_4067, SACE_6086, and SACE_6447) and seven genes involved in amino acid metabolism (SACE numbers 3033, 3126, 3584, 4093, 4116, 6565 and 7125). Locations and nature of all observed mutations are presented in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, columns H-M.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Adapted industrial-like bioprocess for erythromycin production</title><p>In order to obtain industrially relevant transcriptomic and proteomic data, three independent bioprocesses with WT and HP strains were carried out in 5&#x000a0;L bioreactors and samples were taken at specific time points, characterized by rates of biomass growth, erythromycin titre, and expression of erythromycin biosynthetic genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Briefly, the fermentation process consists of an initial phase without erythromycin production, lasting around 24&#x000a0;h (time point t1&#x02014;initial increase in expression of the erythromycin biosynthetic genes <italic>eryAI</italic> and <italic>eryK</italic>; see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The initial phase is followed by a period of rapid biomass formation and rapid consumption of glucose, when erythromycin production is most pronounced (time point t2&#x02014;start of rapid growth phase and detectable erythromycin production, transient decline of erythromycin biosynthetic gene expression). Once all the glucose in the medium is consumed and the cells enter the stationary growth phase (time point t3&#x02014;glucose depleted, a second increase in expression of <italic>eryA1</italic> and <italic>eryK</italic> genes), there is an additional increase in erythromycin titre. However, the biosynthesis of erythromycin stops shortly afterwards in the WT strain (time point t4&#x02013;stationary phase, end of erythromycin production in WT). In the HP strain, in contrast, erythromycin production is not only more intense during the rapid growth phase, but it also continues into the stationary phase, resulting in a more than ten-fold higher yield compared to the WT strain. Accordingly, prolonged expression of <italic>eryAI</italic> gene, encoding the erythromycin polyketide synthase, was also observed in the HP strain. Interestingly, the rate of glucose consumption is almost identical for both strains.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Key bioprocess parameters of cultivation of WT (<bold>a</bold>) and HP (<bold>b</bold>) strains in bioreactor scale. Erythromycin (<italic>ER</italic>) and glucose (<italic>Glc</italic>) concentrations, the packed mycelium volume (<italic>PMV</italic>), and relative expression of key erythromycin biosynthetic gene <italic>eryAI</italic> are plotted against total bioprocess time for a representative replicate of the bioprocess. The <italic>dashed lines</italic> denote the time points selected for transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. In the WT strain, erythromycin is produced primarily during the period of intense cell growth and rapid glucose consumption. In the HP strain, final erythromycin yield is much higher due to an increased rate of production during the rapid growth phase and a prolonged period of production in the late stages of the bioprocess.

Firstly, we identified differentially expressed genes at individual time points. Out of 7217 genes featured on the microarray, 55 were excluded from subsequent data analysis due to low signal in most samples and 1198 genes were found to be significantly differentially expressed (DE) between HP and WT in at least one time point. The number of DE genes increased over time (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Microarray data was validated by performing qPCR analyses, based on seven selected genes related to erythromycin biosynthesis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The high correlation between the results of the two methods (r&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.84) confirms that the microarray gene expression data is reliable.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Numbers of differentially expressed genes and differentially abundant proteins at the four bioprocess time points.

Due to extensive proteolysis in the HP strain samples differential protein abundance was not calculated at t3 and t4</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12934_2016_496_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>In the next step we performed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] to identify the functional gene groups and metabolic pathways (as defined by KEGG pathway or Gene Ontology) that were over- or under-expressed in the HP strain at selected time points during the fermentation (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). While some differences in gene expression between the strains can already be observed at t1, the switch to secondary metabolism at t2 is more pronounced in the HP strain, suggesting that in the HP secondary metabolism is turned on earlier than in the WT strain. This is seen as enrichment of upregulated genes in several secondary metabolic pathways and in pathways related to the metabolism of amino acids that can act as polyketide precursors, as well as by the enrichment of downregulated genes in primary metabolic pathways such as the TCA cycle and nucleotide and nitrogen metabolism. The HP strain then maintains the significantly higher expression of erythromycin biosynthetic genes as well as other polyketide-related pathways throughout the fermentation. Interestingly, the analysis shows that at t3, genes involved in DNA repair mechanisms during replication are expressed at lower level in HP compared to WT strain. Moreover, increased proteolysis, observed in proteomics, is also evident on the transcriptome level (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Overall, in comparison to WT, the HP strain shows increased expression of genes involved in secondary metabolism and decreased expression of several key primary metabolic pathways since the start of the exponential growth phase (t2). This becomes even more pronounced once the glucose in the medium is fully consumed (t3) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<table-wrap

In two clusters the gene expression was higher and in 4 lower in WT compared to HP throughout the fermentation process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Co-expression analysis</title><p>In the next step we also investigated the correlations between gene expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. For each gene in the genome we calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between the expression levels of that gene and all other genes across all experimental samples. The same analysis was also performed on subsets of data limited to the WT strain and the HP strain, respectively. Our analysis revealed that the <italic>ery</italic> cluster is highly correlated to a wide range of genes encoding diverse functions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). At least two distinct groups of genes are consistently correlated with the expression of the <italic>ery</italic> cluster in both WT and HP strains while also having a strong connection to at least one mutated gene (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). The first group contains a number of genes of the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism, as well as <italic>mutB</italic> (SACE_5639, a member of the <italic>mcm</italic> operon involved in converting between succinyl- and methylmalonyl-CoA). These genes are expected to be involved in the supply of precursors for erythromycin biosynthesis from the core carbon metabolism. The second group is mostly composed of genes related to the phosphate metabolism or to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The latter include a pair of apparent polyketide synthase (PKS) clusters, <italic>pks2</italic> (SACE_2593-635) and <italic>pks8</italic> (SACE_5532-45). Interestingly, even though their expression is much lower in HP than in WT, these PKS genes maintain a positive correlation with the <italic>ery</italic> cluster across the time points of WT as well as HP fermentation. This suggests they may be subject to dual regulation where one system strives to coordinate their expression to that of <italic>ery</italic>, while a separate mechanism strongly downregulates their expression in HP. Our analysis also identified other highly internally connected groups of genes corresponding to ribosomal proteins and several transposons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a), confirming that the expression correlation approach can successfully identify co-regulated genes.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Graph representations of networks of genes with correlated expression profiles.<italic> Nodes</italic> represent genes, identified by their SACE numbers, and <italic>edges</italic> are drawn between genes whose expression levels show a strong (positive or negative) correlation in different contexts. <bold>a</bold> Edges are drawn between genes whose expression levels show a strong correlation in the WT strain and maintain the same correlation in the HP strain.

Importantly, one of the <italic>pks6</italic> genes (SACE_4563, unknown function) is mutated in the HP strain, which may block the actual synthesis of the corresponding polyketide product.</p><p>Finally, we focused on genes that have both their expression levels as well as their coordination/correlations with other genes strongly perturbed in the HP strain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c).

In the first approach, cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, analysed by LC&#x02013;MS/MS, and quantified by spectral counting. 1000&#x02013;1400 proteins were identified per sample at each time point. In the second approach, 2-D gel electrophoresis analysis was carried out. Reliable data for protein profiles of the samples could only be obtained for the time points t1 and t2, whereas in time points t3 and t4 extensive proteolytic degradation of the samples from the HP strain was observed in spite of using different available protease inhibitors and increasing their concentrations. Therefore, proteomic data from time points t3 and t4 were not included in data analysis. A decrease in protein abundance and in the number of detected protein spots in the later phases of the bioprocess was also confirmed by 2-D PAGE (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>).</p><p>The observed differences in protein abundance between the WT and HP strains (LC&#x02013;MS/MS analysis) for time points t1 and t2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) agree well with the results of the transcriptome analysis, with the exception that fewer proteins displayed significant changes in abundance at t2 than at t1. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>, the erythromycin-producing PKS is strongly upregulated in the HP, as are some of the enzymes involved in the branched-chain amino acid synthesis pathway. On the other hand, enzymes of the TCA cycle, ribosomal proteins, and most other proteins with significant abundance changes are downregulated in the HP strain. Some of the most striking changes in abundance were observed with proteins belonging to biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites: the <italic>pks2</italic> and <italic>pks8</italic> systems are strongly downregulated in the HP strain while <italic>ery</italic>, <italic>pks6</italic> and a cluster of terpenoid-quinone metabolic enzymes (<italic>tpc4</italic>, SACE_4645-51) are upregulated.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Relative changes in protein abundance (LC-MS/MS) between HP and WT strains for two time points.

</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12934_2016_496_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p>As a complementary method for proteome analysis we used 2-D PAGE with subsequent identification of differentially abundant proteins between HP and WT samples by LC&#x02013;MS analysis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>). This method confirmed that the protein profiles of the WT and HP strains differ significantly at time point t2. Differential abundance was observed, for example, for proteins related to glycolysis, TCA cycle, erythromycin biosynthesis, nucleotide metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis. Notably, several proteins of the carbohydrate metabolism (e.g. succinyl-CoA synthetase &#x003b1; subunit, SACE_6668; dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase, SACE_1638; phosphogluconate dehydratase, SACE_1740; 6-phosphofructokinase, SACE_1704; ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase, SACE_0816) and nucleotide metabolism (inosine-5&#x02032;-monophosphate dehydrogenase, SACE_6708; phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxyheptonate aldolase, SACE_1708; phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide formyltransferase, SACE_6664) were observed in the WT strain, but not in the HP strain. Additionally, more than one spot on the gel was found to belong to some of these proteins (SACE_1638, SACE_6668). Three glycolytic enzymes (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, SACE_2158; 2-phosphoglycerate dehydratase, SACE_0838; phosphoglycerate mutase, SACE_6967) were detected only in the HP strain while glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (SACE_2143) was overexpressed in the HP strain. Additionally, the ketol-acid reductoisomerase IlvC (SACE_6157), related to valine biosynthesis, was downregulated in the HP strain.

There are only a few exceptions where comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses show opposite patterns of transcript/protein abundance in WT and HP strains (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>).</p><p>Further, we aimed to integrate diverse types of omics data to gain a more comprehensive picture of the <italic>S.</italic><italic>erythraea</italic> physiology. Since the core carbon metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis exhibit significant differential expression between WT and HP, we mapped our experimental data onto these metabolic pathways to visualize their connections with erythromycin biosynthesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In the HP strain, several genes of the TCA cycle are mutated and several others are significantly downregulated compared to the WT strain.

Together, these data suggest that mutations and changes in the regulation of primary metabolic pathways could result in an alternative route to supplying the erythromycin precursor methylmalonyl-CoA via the branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis/degradation pathway (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> inset). Note that several genes have multiple paralogs present in the genome (multiple gene nodes connected to the same protein node in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and some of these are also known to be part of secondary metabolic gene clusters.

Surprisingly, when mmsOp1 operon and <italic>ilvB1</italic> gene were constitutively expressed together, average erythromycin yield increase of 75&#x000a0;% was measured, which is comparable to the yield increase achieved by <italic>ilvB1</italic> overexpression alone, and slightly lower compared to the transformants overexpressing only the mmsOp1 gene.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Effect of overexpressed genes on erythromycin production, compared to the WT strain. <italic>Box plot</italic> diagram of erythromycin production by the WT strain and transformants, determined by the microbiological assay; <italic>WT</italic>: control 1, NRRL2338, <italic>A</italic>: control 2, WT&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;pSet152, <italic>B</italic>: WT&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>mmsOp1</italic> (pABE60), <italic>C</italic>: WT&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>mmsOp1</italic>-HA (pABE87), <italic>D</italic>: WT&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>ilvB1</italic> (pABE61), <italic>E</italic>: WT&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>ilvB1</italic>-HA (pABE62), <italic>F</italic>: WT&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>mmsOp1</italic>-HA&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>ilvB1</italic>-HA (pABE89), <italic>G</italic>: WT&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>ilvB1</italic>-HA&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>mmsOp1</italic>-HA (pABE88), <italic>H</italic>: WT&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>bkdOp</italic> (pABE56), <italic>I</italic>: WT&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;<italic>mmsOp2</italic> (pABE95). <italic>Boundaries of the boxes</italic> indicate the 1st and the 3rd quartile of the sample populations. <italic>Horizontal lines</italic> represent the median values and <italic>whiskers</italic> indicate the highest and lowest values of the results. <italic>Asterisks</italic> denote statistically significant (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) differences between transformants compared to control samples 1 and 2.

On the one hand we identified entire functional groups, e.g. metabolic pathways or biological processes (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) that are expressed at different levels in the two strains. On the other hand, we used co-expression analysis to identify several possible mechanisms that could connect the genomic mutations with altered expression levels. In our analyses we assumed that mutations act directly on the affected gene, rather than through potential polar effects on downstream genes, which allowed some interpretation in terms of differences in strain physiology (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In general, we observed that genes/proteins related to several key physiological processes are differentially expressed in the HP strain. For example, genes related to the translation machinery (e.g. ribosomes), biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and proteolysis are significantly upregulated in HP whereas on the other hand, several key central metabolic pathways, such as the TCA-cycle and fatty acid metabolism as well as DNA repair, nucleotide metabolism and oxidative stress response are significantly downregulated. While some of these physiological features are clearly related to increased erythromycin biosynthesis, rational explanations or even just putative roles of some of the other differences observed between WT and HP strains are still to be uncovered.</p><p>In addition to the observed increased expression of dedicated erythromycin biosynthetic genes, which clearly contributes to higher yield, the supply of the main biosynthetic precursor methylmalonyl-CoA could very well be a key factor. Some genes predicted to be involved in a methylmalonyl-CoA feeder pathway are overexpressed in the HP strain, while other pathways that could contribute to a higher supply of this precursor are downregulated. It was previously demonstrated that methylmalonyl-CoA pool can either be filled or drained by the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase-catalysed reaction converting the TCA cycle intermediate succinyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA. When <italic>S. erythraea</italic> is cultivated on carbohydrate based media this reaction proceeds in direction from methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, thereby consuming methylmalonyl-CoA into the TCA cycle rather than supplying precursors for erythromycin biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The observed downregulation of the TCA cycle in the HP strain may reduce this drain on the methylmalonyl-CoA pool and lead to higher erythromycin yield. In addition, our genomic and transcriptomic data show that in the HP strain the isocitrate lyase gene (SACE_1449) carries a mutation in the 5&#x02032;-UTR and is significantly downregulated at the gene expression level, suggesting a possible role of conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA as an anaplerotic step in the HP strain. Furthermore, novel findings from our transcriptomic and proteomic analyses suggest that, rather than through the TCA cycle glucose can be converted to methylmalonyl-CoA via a bypass involving genes related to branched-chain amino acid metabolism (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This hypothesis is also supported by the observed increased erythromycin yield in engineered strains overexpressing different genes/operons of the branched chain amino acid metabolism (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). While branched-chain amino acids have been previously suggested as a potential source of methylmalonyl-CoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] our results indicate that parts of biosynthesis and degradation pathways of branched-chain amino acids could operate together to provide metabolic flux to methylmalonyl-CoA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Biosynthesis and degradation of e.g. valine are believed to intersect at the point of 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate, so the metabolic flux to methylmalonyl-CoA could actually avoid valine as an intermediate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> inset).</p><p>In addition to the metabolic pathways involved in methylmalonyl-CoA supply, the results of our transcriptomic and proteomic studies also suggest a number of other possible mechanisms underlying increased erythromycin yield, most of which could not be validated experimentally in the scope of this study but represent a rich source of directions for future work. For example, the expression correlation analysis revealed a coordinated regulation of the <italic>ery</italic> cluster and several other PKS clusters (<italic>pks2</italic>, <italic>pks6</italic> and <italic>pks8</italic>) and a terpenoid biosynthesis cluster (<italic>tpc4</italic>). However, to achieve higher erythromycin titres, the HP strain has to avoid wasting resources on producing &#x0201c;undesired&#x0201d; secondary metabolites. For <italic>pks2</italic> and <italic>pks8</italic> this could be achieved by a separate mechanism of downregulation. The sigma factor SACE_5521, which appears to be connected to the expression of these two PKS clusters (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c), would be an interesting target for further experimental characterization. The other two clusters, <italic>pks6</italic> and <italic>tpc4</italic>, are overexpressed alongside <italic>ery</italic>, but appear to be affected by mutations in SACE_4563 and <italic>tauD</italic> (SACE_4651), respectively. This could actually be advantageous to erythromycin production, as <italic>pks6</italic> also encodes feeder pathway proteins such as acetolactate synthase (<italic>ilvB</italic>-SACE_4565), which, when overexpressed, help divert substrate supply (precursors) from the primary carbon metabolism into the pool of common PKS substrate metabolites. Notably, overexpression of <italic>pks6</italic> cluster was also observed in other high-producing <italic>S. erythraea</italic> strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This suggests that feeder enzymes of the SACE_4561-76 cluster continue supplying precursors, but its PKS is disabled by mutations and unable to consume the substrates, leaving more available for erythromycin biosynthesis. Thus, subverting rather than completely inactivating alternative PKS or NRPS clusters may represent one of the mechanisms for increasing the production of erythromycin or other secondary metabolites.</p><p>All experimental data generated in this study have been integrated into a spreadsheet (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), which represents a useful tool for the identification of new targets for metabolic engineering of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> in the future. Notably, as the same WT strain (NRRL2338) was used as a reference in our work and in the two previous studies on independently derived erythromycin high-producing strains Px [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and E3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the available data from these studies are also included in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> columns AN-BD. The comparative genome analysis of the strains Px [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], E3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and ABE1441 (this work) shows that 60 mutations are present in all three strains (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), disregarding the initially excluded WT sequencing errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Out of 147 genes affected by mutations in ABE1441, 27 genes are only mutated in this high producing strain and have WT sequence in the Px and E3 strains. Each of these 27 genes harbours one variation (24 SNVs, two MNVs and one deletion; see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2)</xref>. Interestingly, the uniquely mutated genes in ABE1441 include a significantly reduced expression levels of the isocitrate lyase (SACE_1449) gene, which further confirms a reduced role of the TCA cycle intermediates (e.g. succinyl-CoA) as sources for the supply of methylmalonyl-CoA extender unit in our HP strain. The high number of common mutations in the ABE1441, Px and E3 strains suggests there was a common ancestor in the strain improvement history, from which three separate development lines were subsequently initiated. In addition, several groups of genes, such as erythromycin biosynthetic genes and <italic>pks6</italic> (SACE_4561-76) were found to be upregulated in all three industrial strains while in contrast, the TCA cycle-related genes were downregulated.</p><p>It is important to stress that the high relevance of our results is based on a particular effort that we made to carry out omics analyses of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> cultures in fermentation conditions that most closely resemble conditions in the real industrial setting. Cultivation of WT and HP strains was carried out on the bioreactor scale where key process parameters such as pH and pO<sub>2</sub> were controlled. Our work demonstrates that if relevant (industrial) cultivation conditions are applied and different bioinformatics and statistics approaches are used for data analysis, meaningful hypotheses can be generated and rapidly validated. Erythromycin is produced in more than 8000&#x000a0;tons per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. To our knowledge, final yields of erythromycin at the industrial scale do not exceed 10&#x000a0;g/L, which is significantly less than the yields of most other mature high-volume active pharmaceutical ingredients. Considering relatively limited success in erythromycin yield improvement over decades, we believe that omics and metabolic engineering approaches based on the data presented in this work and in previously published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] will be of particular importance for future strain and process development efforts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the present study contributes a significant step forward in our understanding of how erythromycin biosynthesis is coordinated with the primary carbon metabolism and with the activities of other secondary metabolic pathways of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> such as <italic>pks2</italic>, <italic>pks6</italic>, and <italic>pks8</italic>. Based on the data from omics analyses and subsequent metabolic engineering experiments we identified valine biosynthesis/degradation pathway to be of importance in providing the precursors for erythromycin biosynthesis in the HP strain. It is particularly interesting to note that in this strain an increased expression of a &#x0201c;competing&#x0201d; PKS cluster, <italic>pks6</italic> might further contribute to the efficiency of substrate supply for erythromycin biosynthesis. Thus, the omics data reported here suggest several future strategies for erythromycin strain improvement by metabolic engineering. Beyond that, this study demonstrates that our integrated omics approach, based on the bioprocess-guided experimental design and targeted and non-targeted data analysis, in combination with valuable literature information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], generated tangible results which can be rapidly transferred to the industrial setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Genome sequencing and analysis</title><p>Since the reference WT <italic>S. erythraea</italic> genome was sequenced several years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], we first aimed to investigate whether this reference genome assembly contains sequencing errors.

This typically required very stringent criteria with p values for individual correlations &#x0003c;0.005.</p><p>Genomic variation, microarray, qPCR, 2-D PAGE and shotgun proteomics results generated in this study were additionally integrated with gene annotations from several sources and gene expression/variation results from three recently published transcriptomic studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Comprehensive presentation of all data from our genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic experiments as well as data from relevant previous studies is presented in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Overexpression of selected genes in <italic>S. erythraea</italic></title><p>To confirm that the observed differences between WT and HP strains indeed result in increased erythromycin yield, we overexpressed several genes, related to branched-chain amino acid metabolism in the WT strain. Selected genes/putative operons were amplified using <italic>S. erythraea</italic> genomic DNA as template. Sequences of primers used for amplification of target DNA segments are presented in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>. In all cases NdeI restriction site was introduced at the 5&#x02032;-end and XbaI site was inserted at the 3&#x02032;-end, after the stop codon. The PCR amplified fragments were cloned into the pSet152-derived plasmid into which the constitutive P<italic>ermE*</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] had been previously cloned, thus creating a series of pABE vectors (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">14</xref>). Correct assembly of the PCR products was confirmed by sequencing. In the cases of <italic>ilvB</italic> gene and mmsOp constructs additional variants with a HA-tag on the C-terminus of the proteins were prepared in order to enable confirmation of functional expression of overexpressed proteins by western blotting.</p><p>Simultaneous overexpression of <italic>ilvB1</italic> gene and <italic>mms</italic> operon genes was also carried out. For this purpose two pSet152 based vectors were constructed (pABE88 and pABE89) in which the <italic>ilvB1</italic> gene and <italic>mms</italic> operon were positioned in different orders. In pABE89 <italic>ilvB1</italic> gene was cloned upstream of the <italic>mms</italic> operon genes, whereas in pABE88 construct <italic>ilvB1</italic> was positioned downstream of the <italic>mms</italic> operon. In both cases, expression of the upstream gene was driven directly by the P<italic>ermE*</italic> promoter, while for expression of the downstream gene a RBS was introduced upstream of the gene&#x02019;s start codon. The obtained plasmid constructs were introduced into <italic>S. erythraea</italic> WT strain using standard conjugation procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The obtained independent colonies were cultivated in shake flasks and erythromycin yields were estimated by microbiological assay and HPLC analyses according to previously described procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>For testing the effect of different mutations on erythromycin production, compared to the WT strain, at least 20 independent colonies (transformants) were tested for each engineered strain in two consecutive independent experiments. Each independent colony (transformant) was tested in duplicates. Yields of erythromycin were calculated with SAS/STAT software using means and the univariante procedure to test the normality of distribution. Using the GLM model, data were calculated as least mean square and are presented as an average change observed from all experiments when comparing least mean square values to the wild-type control least mean square value of each experiment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec19"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12934_2016_496_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx" id="MOESM1"><caption><p>
