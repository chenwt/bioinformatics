The role of SENP3 in lipid metabolism, particularly NAFLD, is unclear. Our results showed that hepatic SENP3 was up-regulated in NAFLD patients and an animal model <italic>in vivo</italic> and after loading hepatocytes with free fatty acids (FFA) <italic>in vitro</italic>. Intracellular lipid accumulation was determined in SENP3 silenced or overexpressed hepatocytes with/without FFA <italic>in vitro</italic>. Confirming a role for SENP3, gene silencing was associated <italic>in vitro</italic> with amelioration of lipid accumulation and overexpression with enhancement of lipid accumulation. SENP3 related genes in NAFLD were determined <italic>in vitro</italic> using RNA-Seq. Eleven unique genes closely associated with lipid metabolism were generated using bioinformatics. Three selected genes (<italic>apoe, a2m</italic> and <italic>tnfrsf11b</italic>) were verified <italic>in vitro</italic>, showing <italic>apoe, a2m</italic> and <italic>tnfrsf11b</italic> were regulated by SENP3 with FFA stimulation. Intrahepatic and circulating APOE, A2M and TNFRSF11B were elevated in NAFLD compared with controls. These data demonstrate the important role of SENP3 in lipid metabolism during the development of NAFLD <italic>via</italic> downstream genes, which may be useful information in the development of NAFLD. The precise role of SENP3 in NAFLD will be investigated using liver-specific conditional knockout mice in future studies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), due to aberrant lipid metabolism, has become an increasingly prevalent health problem worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Anomalous lipid metabolism plays a crucial role in the progression of NAFLD, attacking hepatocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Excessive accumulation of triglyceride (TG) in hepatocytes, as a precursor for NAFLD, is due to increased uptake of free fatty acids (FFA) into the liver, up-regulated triglyceride synthesis, impaired lipid &#x003b2;-oxidation, or weakened VLDL secretion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Excessive TG is stored in hepatocytes as lipid droplets. Perturbed metabolic pathways (e.g. mTOR and AKT/PI3K signaling pathway) and abnormal expression of related molecules [e.g. Apo lipoproteins, free acid binding proteins (FABPs), liver X receptors] contribute to the formation of lipid droplets in the onset of steatosis in NAFLD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Hepatic steatosis increases the risk of irreversible liver disease, ultimately leading to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>Ubiquitin-like SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifiers), including SUMO1, SUMO2 and SUMO3, are involved in post-translational modification of target proteins. SUMOs regulate a broad spectrum of cellular processes, e.g. cell signaling, cycle, transcription, or carcinogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. SUMOylation is a dynamic process that can be reversed by a family of SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Six SENP members in mammals, identified with different subcellular locations and substrates, play important roles in the control of various cellular events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. SENPs, by acting in the protein regulatory event deSUMOylation, play important roles during the progression of many diseases. It has been reported that overexpressed SENP1 promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and function in myotubes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. SENP2 inhibits glycolysis, reprograms glucose metabolic strategy in cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and regulates fatty acid metabolism in skeletal muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, suggesting an important role of SENP2 in metabolic disorders. SENP5 is reported to maintain mitochondrial morphology and metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. As a crucial member of the SENPs, SENP3 is specific to de-conjugate SUMO2 or SUMO3, which share 96% sequence similarity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. SENP3 is rapidly increased following several cell stresses e.g. oxidative stress or hyperglycemic stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. SENP3 is up-regulated in the progression of many diseases, including cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and other injuries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Up-regulated SENP3 enhances cell apoptosis/death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and cancer metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. However, it is unknown whether SENP3 and SENP3-related molecules contribute to the progression of NAFLD <italic>via</italic> manipulation of lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Thus, the aim of the current study is to explore the role of SENP3 in the development of NAFLD.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>All the experiments protocols involving humans and animals were approved by the <italic>Human Ethics Committee of Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine</italic>.

DEGs were detected using the GFOLD algorithm adjusting among the SENP3 silenced, overexpressed and the mock-gene treated groups following FFA stimulation. There were 140 DEGs identified in the SENP3 overexpressed hepatocytes following FFA treatment, compared to the mock-gene treated group, and 426 DEGs in SENP3 silenced hepatocytes following FFA treatment, compared to the mock-gene treated group. After combining these DEGs from the groups with overexpression and silencing of SENP3, 532 unique DEGs were generated. To determine which of these DEGs were of clinical value in NAFLD patients, potential secreted proteins among these DEGs were selected by searching against the ExoCarta diagnosis and prognosis database to find those likely to be secreted into plasma or serum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. It was identified that 91 out of 532 DEGs were potential secreted proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). To enrich these DEGs functions, these 91 secreted genes were further submitted to the IPA pathway package against human species to accumulate the potential sub-network(s) or pathway(s) related to lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Using NAFLD functional selection, it was further recognized that 11 out of 91 unique secreted genes were related to liver steatosis and steatohepatitis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). A sub-network enriched for lipid metabolic disorder was constructed based on these 11 recognized genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). These secreted proteins might be potentially promising diagnostic biomarkers of NAFLD. The GFOLD value from the DEGs overexpression groups revealed the top 3 SENP3-related genes (<italic>apoe, a2m</italic> and <italic>tnfrsf11b</italic>), which were then utilized to confirm the clinical significance of SENP3 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>A<italic>poe, a2m</italic> and <italic>tnfrsf11b</italic> were regulated by SENP3 following FFA treatment in hepatocytes</title><p>Expression of <italic>apoe, a2m</italic> and <italic>tnfrsf11b</italic> was confirmed using qRT-PCR in hepatocytes.

Constitutive protein production of APOE was observed in livers from healthy liver transplant donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>, left) and NAFLD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>, right) patients. In NAFLD patients, APOE was mainly located in the cell membrane of hepatocytes and the adjacent extra-cellular space, particularly in regions containing many fat vacuoles.

Thus, the expression of all three proteins was increased in liver tissue samples from NAFLD patients.</p><p>Liver biopsy is an invasive procedure during clinical practice, thus an alternative diagnostic approach is desirable to measure circulating APOE, A2M and TNFRSF11B. Hence, we used ELISA to measure circulating levels of these proteins. The circulating level of APOE was 2.5 fold higher in NAFLD patients than from HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5G</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).

Lipid accumulation in FFA-stimulated hepatocytes was inhibited with SENP3 silencing, but was enhanced with SENP3 overexpression. SENP3 related genes in NAFLD were generated using RNA-Seq from the hepatocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. The top three genes (<italic>apoe, a2m</italic> and <italic>tnfrsf11b</italic>) were found to be regulated by SENP3 in hepatic steatosis <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, protein levels of APOE, A2M and TNFRSF11B were significantly up-regulated in the liver and plasma of NAFLD patients compared with the controls. Such data demonstrate a clear role for SENP3 in lipid metabolism during the development of NAFLD.</p><p>Mammals possess six SENP isoforms that are capable of reversing SUMO-1, -2 and -3 post-translational modifications. These isoforms play different roles in the control of various cellular events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. SENP2 regulates adipogenesis <italic>via</italic> de-SUMOylation of C/EBP&#x003b2;, which in turn promotes C/EBP&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b3;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, and controls glucose metabolism <italic>via</italic> p-AKT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Overexpression of SENP2 promotes fatty acid metabolism in skeletal muscle <italic>via</italic> fatty acid oxidation, ultimately alleviating obesity-linked metabolic disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. On the other hand, SENP2 silence attenuates adipogenesis in preadipocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. In addition, down-regulation of SENP2 increases SUMOylation of p53 and ERK5, leading to atherosclerotic plaque formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In the current study, hepatic production of SENP3 was significantly higher in NAFLD patients and HFD-fed rats than healthy liver transplant donors or ND-fed rats, as well as, in FFA-treated hepatocytes than non-treated cells.</p><p>A close correlation between hepatic TG and SENP3 in HFD fed rats suggests a possible role of SENP3 in lipid metabolism in NAFLD. However, the lack of a significant correlation between the severity of steatosis and hepatic SENP3 from NAFLD patients might be due to relatively small numbers of patients in this study and/or patient polymorphisms. There are both clinical and ethical challenges to performing liver biopsies in NAFLD patients. The large number of liver biopsies required for our future clarification of the correlation between the severity of steatosis and hepatic SENP3 are currently being collected.</p><p>The observation of the correlation between SENP3 and NAFLD in patients and the animal model <italic>in vivo</italic> was further clarified in hepatocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. It was confirmed that increased lipid accumulation in FFA-treated hepatocytes was attenuated or enhanced with SENP3 silencing or overexpression, respectively, arguing for the regulation of hepatic steatosis by SENP3. The corresponding mRNA levels of SENP3 were also confirmed. Thus, the data delineated that SENP3 activity contributes to the severity of steatosis, suggesting a potential novel therapeutic target for the management of hepatic steatosis. We observed that SENP3 is up-regulated in livers from NAFLD patients and HFD fed rats <italic>in vivo</italic>, and after loading hepatocytes with free fatty acids (FFA) <italic>in vitro</italic>. We also observed that SENP3 overexpression resulted in a significant up-regulation of cellular TG compared with control group following FFA exposure. Thus, we believe that SENP3 likely acts in both paracrine and autocrine fashions during steatosis. However, the precise underlying mechanism of SENP3 in steatosis will be determined in future experiments, using SENP3 liver-specific knockout mice.</p><p>Subsequently, the differential expression of 11 SENP3-related genes were identified in the NAFLD disease state, following functional selection from 91 secreted genes out of 532 DEGs. Three out of these 11 genes (<italic>apoe, a2m</italic> and <italic>tnfrsf11b</italic>) were subsequently selected to validate their significance in NAFLD. Expression of <italic>apoe, a2m</italic> and <italic>tnfrsf11b</italic> genes were elevated in steatotic hepatocytes and were regulated by SENP3 at the mRNA level. APOE, a ligand for lipoprotein receptors, regulates lipid metabolism <italic>via</italic> participating in lipid transportation and promoting lipid accumulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The critical role of APOE in metabolic syndrome has been well documented in APOE gene knock-out mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Interestingly, APOE, regulated by SENP3, was elevated in steatotic hepatocytes, as well as, in the liver and plasma from the NAFLD patients. There is a close correlation between elevated APOE and hyperlipidemia in metabolic syndrome patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. We speculate that the elevated APOE in NAFLD may be regulated by SENP3 indirectly. The up-regulation of APOE may be a response by the body to metabolize the elevated lipid levels in the liver of the NAFLD patients we examined. The APOE response in NAFLD may be functionally insufficient or inefficient, which is being currently investigated.</p><p>A2M can promote cell proliferation by increasing glucose uptake, lactate secretion and lipogenesis, as an insulin-like response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Abnormal up-regulation of A2M is associated with intracellular lipid accumulation in a new model of NAFLD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Such findings are consistent with the data obtained in our current study, i.e. the observation of significantly elevated circulating and intrahepatic A2M in NAFLD patients, as well as, in steatotic hepatocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our data imply that A2M, regulated by SENP3, plays an important role in the progression of NAFLD.</p><p>TNFRSF11B (Osteoprotegerin, OPG) is a secreted protein involved in bone turnover, due to its role as a decoy receptor for the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand in the osteoclasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. It has been reported that there is a linkage between OPG and NAFLD, particularly in osteoporosis patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, suggesting a possible role of OPG in the development of NAFLD. Our current study showed that OPG was substantially up-regulated at the mRNA level in steatotic hepatocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and at the protein level in NAFLD patients. Our data suggest that OPG contributes to lipid metabolism in NAFLD, which is in line previous findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.</p><p>In addition to <italic>apoe, a2m</italic> and <italic>tnfrsf11b</italic>, substantial alterations in the expression of several other genes were identified during our sub-network analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Relevant examples are as follows. ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (<italic>abcb1</italic>), which participates in drug metabolism, is a monitor for the efficacy and safety of treatment of NAFLD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. <italic>Caspase-9 (casp9</italic>), is a potential indicator for hepatocyte apoptosis during the development of NAFLD <italic>via</italic> the mitochondrial pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. FABP3 is a regulator of lipid metabolism and participates in the transport of lipids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, and has been used as a biomarker for metabolic syndrome related atherosclerosis in patients with glucose impairment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. <italic>Serpine 1</italic> (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), which correlates to body-mass index, plasma triglyceride and insulin levels, has a significant clinical value in metabolic disturbance related diseases, including atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, obesity and liver steatosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Our findings suggest that SENP3 plays an important role in homeostasis of lipid metabolism, and dysregulation of SENP3 contributes to consequent NAFLD <italic>via</italic> gene regulation e.g. <italic>apoe, a2m</italic> and <italic>tnfrsf11b</italic>.</p><p>There are limitations in the current study. Firstly, the direct linkage between SENP3 and NAFLD has not been fully established in a SENP3 knockout animal model, due to embryonic lethality. However, such a lethal consequence further supports the critical pathophysiological role of SENP3 in homeostasis. Secondly, a larger patient cohort, including population diversity, is desirable for the validation of the 11 selected secreted genes with potential diagnostic values in NAFLD. Thirdly, the precise underlying mechanism of SENP3 regulation during the development of NAFLD is currently being investigated.</p><p>The focus of the current study was to investigate whether SENP3 contributes to lipid metabolism in NAFLD, based on our unexpected preliminary observation that SENP3 is up-regulated in fatty liver. Subsequently, follow up <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments demonstrated a link between SENP3 and NAFLD. There are a number of targets of SENP3 e.g. MEF2D, EP300, RbBP5, NPM1, etc, involved in transcriptional activation, potentiating cell survival and redox regulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Three molecules (<italic>apoe, a2m</italic> and <italic>tnfrsf11b</italic>) chosen in the current study were based on the data from bioinformatics, which offered the highest probability of a linkage between SENP3 and these three molecules. We also observed differential regulation of <italic>apoe, a2m</italic> and <italic>tnfrsf11b</italic> following manipulation of SENP3. We acknowledge that the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Nevertheless, our current observations suggest that SENP3 regulation of lipid metabolism in fatty liver may possibly be via <italic>apoe, a2m</italic> and <italic>tnfrsf11b</italic>. In addition, it has been reported that SENP3 serves as a redox sensor to enhance HIF1A transcriptional activity by de-SUMOylating EP300&#x02009;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. We will use liver-specific conditional SENP3 knockout mice to investigate the precise role of SENP3 in future experiments.</p><p>In conclusion, we observed for the first time that SENP3 was up-regulated in NAFLD patients and an animal model <italic>in vivo</italic>, as well as steatotic hepatocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, SENP3-mediated steatosis occurs possibly <italic>via</italic> regulating downstream genes involved in abnormal lipid metabolism. Such data might shed light on the pathogenesis of steatosis, which may be used as a potential therapeutic target for prevention and/or treatment of NAFLD. The precise role of SENP3 in the development of NAFLD will continue to be studied.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Liu, Y. <italic>et al</italic>.
