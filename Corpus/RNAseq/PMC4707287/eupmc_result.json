    "With the identification of Lgr5 as a definitive marker for intestinal stem cells, we used the highly novel, recently described, Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-cre ER (T2) knock in mouse model. Mice were injected with azoxymethane (AOM, a colon carcinogen) or saline (control) and fed a chemo-protective diet containing n-3 fatty acids and fermentable fiber (n-3 PUFA+pectin) or a control diet (n-6 PUFA + cellulose). Single cells were isolated from colonic mucosa crypts and three discrete populations of cells were collected via fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS): Lgr5(high) (stem cells), Lgr5(low) (daughter cells) and Lgr5(negative) (differentiated cells). microRNA profiling and RNA sequencing were performed from the same sample and analyzed. These data refer to 'Comparative effects of diet and carcinogen on microRNA expression in the stem cell niche of the mouse colonic crypt' (Shah et al., 2016) [5]."
