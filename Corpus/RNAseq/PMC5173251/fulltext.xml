We identified DdNKAP, the <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> ortholog of mammalian NKAP, as interacting partner of the nuclear envelope protein SUN-1. DdNKAP harbors a number of basic RDR/RDRS repeats in its N-terminal domain and the SynMuv/DUF926 domain at its C-terminus. We describe a novel and direct interaction between DdNKAP and Prp19 (Pre mRNA processing factor 19) which might be relevant for the observed DdNKAP ubiquitination. Genome wide analysis using cross-linking immunoprecipitation-high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq) revealed DdNKAP association with intergenic regions, exons, introns and non-coding RNAs. Ectopic expression of DdNKAP and its domains affects several developmental aspects like stream formation, aggregation, and chemotaxis. We conclude that DdNKAP is a multifunctional protein, which might influence <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> development through its interaction with RNA and RNA binding proteins. Mutants overexpressing full length DdNKAP and the N-terminal domain alone (DdN-NKAP) showed opposite phenotypes in development and opposite expression profiles of several genes and rRNAs. The observed interaction between DdN-NKAP and the DdDUF926 domain indicates that the DdDUF926 domain acts as negative regulator of the N-terminus.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Deutche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></funding-source><award-id>CECAD C05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Noegel</surname><given-names>Angelika Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>State of North-Rhine Westphalia</institution></funding-source><award-id>IGSDHD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burgute</surname><given-names>Bhagyashri D.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Maria-Pesch-Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>March 2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burgute</surname><given-names>Bhagyashri D.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>B.D.B was supported by the International Graduate School in Development, Health and Disease (IGSDHD).

NKAP is an RS domain containing protein and was first identified as an activator of NF&#x003ba;B, making it a component of NF&#x003ba;B signaling [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. NKAP comprises a tripartite domain architecture, the N-terminal RS domain followed by a basic domain and the C-terminal DUF926 (domain of unknown function). The C-terminal DUF926 domain was later classified as SynMuv based on the vulvar development phenotype in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In mammals, the DUF926 domain was shown to have a controlling function for NKAP [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. NKAP associates with HDAC3 via its DUF926 domain and was shown as transcriptional regulator required for T cell development [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and in the maintenance and survival of hematopoietic stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A recent report identified NKAP as a member of ~100 non-core spliceosomal proteins present in lower abundance at the spliceosome [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We confirmed the role of NKAP in RNA splicing and processing through direct association with RNA and RNA binding proteins [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, MAS2 (Morphology of Ago1-52 suppressed), the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> ortholog of human NKAP, interacts with splicing and ribosome biogenesis proteins. MAS2 is an essential gene whose null alleles are embryonic lethal [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> NKAP ortholog CG6066 showed an interaction with three uncharacterized binding proteins which subsequently were linked to splicing components [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For mammalian NKAP, HDAC3, CBF1 interacting corepressor (CIR), RNA binding proteins, RNA helicases and splicing factors have been described as potential interaction partners [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, NKAP in addition to its role as transcriptional repressor appears to have a role in RNA splicing and RNA biogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p><italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> is a unicellular soil-living organism that upon starvation transitions into multicellularity, and thus is a model organism for studying chemotaxis, aggregation and development. The <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> genome contains ~12,500 genes which are packed into six chromosomes. In general, <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> pre-mRNAs contain few and short introns with an average size of 146 bp. Out of all protein-coding genes, 69% are spliced with an average of 1.9 introns per gene [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], indicating that pre-mRNA splicing is an essential process in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic>. Spliceosomal RNAs (snRNAs) and proteins (splicing factors) have an important role in pre-mRNA splicing. In a large sequence survey using dictybase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dictybase.org/index.html">http://dictybase.org/index.html</ext-link>) high sequence similarity was found between human and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> spliceosomal proteins including SR proteins [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The RS domains in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> SR proteins differ from those found in mammals as they are more enriched in the RDR/RDRS motif rather than in the typical RS/SR sequences found in mammalian SR proteins [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The major spliceosomal RNAs have been recognized in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic>. Moreover they have all sequence motifs required for splicing and conserved secondary structure [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Apart from the six chromosomes, the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> genome contains rDNA palindromes that are localized on extrachromosomal elements surrounding nucleoli [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although several precursor rRNA molecules are transcribed, mature rRNAs of the same type do not exhibit any diversity [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Several ncRNAs have been identified but the processing of ncRNAs and the characterization of RNA binding proteins remains elusive in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic>.</p><p>Here we characterize the first SR protein in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> namely DdNKAP, ortholog of mammalian NKAP. DdNKAP carries RDR/RDRS motifs at its N terminus followed by a SynMuv/DdDUF926. We show that it localizes to the nucleus in a punctate pattern and that the DdBasic domain is important for the punctate pattern of localization. DdNKAP interacts with RNA binding proteins such as Prp19 and ribosomal proteins. CLIP-seq revealed that it interacts with exons, introns and ncRNAs. We complemented these studies with RNAseq and developmental analysis and demonstrate that the SynMuv/DdDUF926 domain has an impact on DdNKAP function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Generation of GFP-DdNKAP fusion vectors and DdNKAP antibodies</title><p>The coding sequence of full-length DdNKAP and truncated proteins was amplified as a HindIII&#x02014;BamHI fragment and cloned into vector pDex79 [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and two independent transformations were done into AX2 cells.

Furthermore, we narrowed down the association site in DdNKAP using different DdNKAP polypeptides fused to GFP. GST-Prp19, GST-Prp19-like and GST-134-264 were used in the pull downs. The DdRS domain interacted only with full length Prp19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168617.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), the DdBasic domain interacted with full length Prp19, Prp19-like and the 134&#x02013;264 polypeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168617.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) and the DdDUF domain did not show any interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168617.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). In a GST-pulldown assay, the interaction could be direct or indirect as there is the possibility that this interaction is mediated through unknown cellular protein. However, the direct binding assay ensures the direct physical interaction between two proteins as both proteins are purified and tested further by immobilizing one on beads and employing the other to check the direct binding capacity. To address the direct interaction and to determine which protein domains of DdNKAP and Prp19 are necessary for the interaction, we used bacterially expressed GST tagged Prp19 domains as bait to pull down purified DdNKAP domains. For the DdRS domain we did not observe a direct interaction with Prp19 or its domains, although GST-Prp19 precipitated GFP-DdRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168617.g003">Fig 3C and 3F</xref>).

To check this possibility, we searched for ubiquitination sites in DdNKAP and found several high confidence ubiquitination sites in the DdRS and DdBasic domains of DdNKAP. Further, we performed immunoprecipitation by utilizing GFP-DdNKAP and GFP expressing AX2 cells. The immunoprecipitation was followed by immunoblotting with the P4D1 mAb recognizing ubiquitinated proteins and with GFP specific antibodies.

We hybridized six microarrays with labelled cDNAs derived from three independent RNA isolations and used the program Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] to identify differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168617.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). SAM reported 742 genes as significantly differentially regulated. However, more than 500 of these displayed only very low folds of change and therefore we further analyzed only those 170 genes which were in addition at least 1.5 fold differentially regulated. Out of these 170 genes, 100 were up- and 70 genes were down-regulated in the GFP-DdNKAP expressing cells compared to wild type AX2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168617.s009">S6 Table</xref>). The differentially regulated genes were functionally categorized based on the yeast classification scheme which was adapted for <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This classification showed that upregulation occurred in the stress response and cell rescue category (90% of the differentially regulated genes were upregulated, 10% down). In contrast, translation was down-regulated (100% of differentially regulated genes). A considerable proportion of genes (~32%) that were significantly differentially regulated in the GFP-DdNKAP expressing cells belonged to the classification categories &#x0201c;uncertain&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;unclassified protein&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168617.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). We probed the microarray data by qRT-PCR for three upregulated genes and three downregulated genes and found that these genes were differentially regulated in the GFP-DdNKAP mutant confirming the microarray data. Interestingly, no difference in expression of these genes was observed in the GFP-DdN-NKAP mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168617.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Moreover rRNA expression was upregulated in GFP-DdNKAP while it was down regulated in the GFP-DdN-NKAP mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168617.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) which indicates a regulatory role for the DdDUF926 domain. We further confirmed the microarray data by western blot analysis focusing on DGAP1 and cortexillin I.

To this end we sequenced three independent samples (biological replicates) for both AX2 and GFP-DdNKAP expressing cells.

The RNAseq differentially expressed genes were subjected to GO analysis using the PANTHER Classification System, version 11.0.

To further annotate and weigh these genes in functional classes, we additionally utilized the functional annotation clustering from DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8. From our upregulated genes we were able to find two interesting functional classes with relevance to our studies, stress response and ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168617.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>) whereas a functional class in the downregulated genes was ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168617.g006">Fig 6E</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0168617.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0168617.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>RNAseq analysis of DdNKAP overexpressors and AX2 cells using GO Molecular function and GO Biological process of differentially expressed genes.</title><p>Upregulated (A) and downregulated (B) genes were classified for Gene ontology molecular function and biological process using the PANTHER classification system.

AX2 cells began to stream within 8 h and formed large elaborately branched streams by 10 h and completed aggregation by approximately 12 h with a compact aggregation center. In contrast, GFP-DdNKAP cells did not initiate aggregation until 10 h but then streaming was normal with appreciable branching whereas GFP-DdN-NKAP cells showed premature stream formation already at 6 h.

Furthermore, they can sense exogenous signals like cAMP which is secreted during development and migrate in an oriented fashion towards the chemotactic agent. For the analysis of single cell motility and behaviour in response to a cAMP stimulus, aggregation competent cells were allowed to migrate towards a capillary filled with 0.1 mM cAMP and time-lapse image series were captured to generate migration paths and calculate various parameters like speed, persistence, directionality and direction change. Within seconds of exposure to cAMP, the cells were able to orient themselves towards the chemoattractant source; they moved towards the pipette and organized themselves into streams (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168617.s011">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168617.s012">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168617.s013">S3</xref> Movies). AX2 cells were polarized, formed streams and migrated at a speed of 10.23 +/- 2.72 &#x003bc;m/min. GFP-DdN-NKAP cells showed similar shape changes, however the speed was significantly increased with 18.54 +/- 1.85 &#x003bc;m/min. GFP-DdNKAP cells did not move towards the source of cAMP at the t6, t7 and t8 h time point but migrated with a speed of 9.94 +/- 2.92 &#x003bc;m/min at the t9 h time point confirming the developmental delay of this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168617.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). All other parameters, persistence, direction change and roundness did not significantly differ in the strains (Table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168617.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). From the data it appears that overexpression of GFP-DdNKAP has an inhibitory effect on development whereas removal of the DdDUF domain in GFP-DdN-NKAP releases the inhibitory effect. This suggested to us an interaction between both parts of the protein. We therefore used GST-DdDUF and GFP-DdN-NKAP pulldown assays in order to probe the DdN-NKAP and DdDUF interaction and found that GST-DdDUF efficiently precipitated GFP-DdN-NKAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168617.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0168617.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0168617.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>Motility analysis of GFP-DdNKAP mutants.</title><p>(A) Chemotactic motility. Growth-phase cells were harvested, washed and developed for 6 h (AX2, GFP-DdN-NKAP) or 9 h (GFP-DdNKAP) in shaking suspension under starvation conditions to render them aggregation competent before they were challenged with cAMP in a chemotaxis assay. Time-lapse images were captured and processed. In the table the data for speed, persistence, direction change and roundness are given. Cells were recorded, and after tracing of the cells, the centroid of the cells was determined by computer-assisted analysis (DIAS). This allows calculations of speed, roundness (ratio of the long and short axis of the cell), and direction change. Persistence is a measure of movement in the direction of the path; direction change represents the average change of angle between frames in the direction of movement.

They are critically involved in splicing, RNA export, translation and cell cycle control [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Since DdNKAP is a SR related protein and an ortholog of human NKAP which has been shown to be a none-core spliceosomal protein found in lower abundance at the spliceosome [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], we hypothesized that DdNKAP overexpression would affect the splicing process. However, we did not find appreciable alterations in constitutive splicing in the DdNKAP overexpressors. Instead, we observed a global disturbance of abundance patterns of many transcripts in microarray and RNAseq data. Our analysis of the cells further suggests that an overexpression of DdNKAP can affect processes driven by the action of differential levels of transcripts at certain developmental times such as during aggregation, chemotaxis and phototaxis. The RNAseq data could be related to developmental data available from mutant analysis as e.g. delayed aggregation was found in the srsA (Starvation responsive small gene A) overexpressors [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. For this gene we found higher transcript levels, whereas the grlE (metabotrobic Glutamate Receptor-Like) transcript levels were reduced which is in agreement with delayed aggregation of the knockout strain [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It has been proposed that non-core proteins can link the spliceosome to other machineries such as transcription factors and therefore have the potential to affect cellular processes [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>For efficient gene expression various machineries are functionally coupled <italic>in vivo</italic> from transcription to RNA processing to RNA export [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Prp19 functions in diverse processes including transcription, splicing, DNA repair, protein degradation and lipid droplet formation [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Similarly, mammalian NKAP is a multifunctional protein and has been previously described as transcriptional repressor and spliceosomal component [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MAS2 is a key player in the regulation of rRNA synthesis in plants [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Based on the well characterized role of Prp19 in splicing, the physical interaction of DdNKAP and Prp19 further helps to explain the participation of DdNKAP in RNA biogenesis. Prp19 exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and can directly interact with DdNKAP <italic>in vitro</italic>. Prp19 may therefore target DdNKAP for ubiquitination, a modification that can have a number of consequences such as an influence on protein stability, conformation, activity or localization [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Prp19 is essential for splicing but is not a constituent of any spliceosomal snRNPs [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Interestingly, our CLIP data revealed that DdNKAP interacts with U1 and U2 snRNAs. Therefore, the DdNKAP-Prp19 interaction could provide a bridge between the Prp19 complex and snRNPs. Although our report puts more emphasis on the role of DdNKAP in RNA binding, we cannot rule out the possibility that DdNKAP could play a potential role in transcriptional control. Prp19 functions in transcription elongation that is essential for TREX occupancy, a complex that couples transcription to mRNP export [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The significance of the DdNKAP-Prp19 interaction could then be in transcription control. However, we could not test this possibility as we were not successful in generating knockout and knockdown mutants. We assume that the loss of DdNKAP leads to a lethal phenotype. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, insertional disruption of the coding region of MAS2 caused embryonic lethality [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Lethal phenotypes have also been described for NKAP knockouts in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>, and mouse [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Beyond the DdNKAP-Prp19 interaction, our co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that DdNKAP interacts with ribosomal subunit proteins. Ribosomal proteins are often found in immunoprecipitations and have been proposed to bind nonspecifically to proteins. However, LCMS analysis showed a higher number of hits for ribosomal proteins which suggests a specific interaction. Interestingly, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> splicing and ribosome biogenesis proteins have been identified as interactors of MAS2 in yeast two-hybrid assays. Additionally, the suppressor <italic>mas2</italic> mutations modified the splicing and/or translational efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Some of our results in the GFP-DdNKAP mutant relate to modified translational efficiency. First, we observed down regulation of transcripts for ribosomal proteins. Second, we observed up regulation of transcripts for ubiquitin and stress response In <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic>, inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide leads to strong accumulation of ubiquitin transcripts [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In other words, the higher levels of ubiquitin transcripts could also result from an inhibition of translation in the GFP-DdNKAP cells. The modified translational efficiency in the DdNKAP mutant could be explained as follows. The unprocessed pre-mRNAs/pre-rRNAs accumulated due to aberrant splicing in the GFP-DdNKAP mutant. In general, stress response genes could also be activated due to the overexpression of the fusion protein. But we cannot deny the possibility of activation of stress response genes due to translation inhibition/modification. This is an interesting finding and should be addressed further. Through RNAseq analysis we found that the overexpression of DdNKAP had a minor effect on the splicing process. Furthermore, qRT-PCR revealed that rRNAs were upregulated in DdNKAP overexpressors which could be due to the accumulation of unprocessed pre-rRNAs and this possibility should be tested in the future. Similarly, an accumulation of unprocessed pre-rRNAs was observed in MAS2 mutant, suggesting MAS2&#x02019;s role in the regulation of the translation of aberrant or unspliced mRNAs, by regulating their nuclear export [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>We found that DdNKAP interacts and partially colocalize with the nuclear envelope SUN1 protein. Mammalian SUN1 mediates mRNA export through its association with mRNP complexes via a direct interaction with hnRNPs, nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1) and NUP153 [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. An impact of DdNKAP on mRNA export might therefore also be relevant for our findings. Additionally, in mammals, the DUF926 domain is present in two proteins, NKAP and NKAP-L. The nuclear speckle localizing NKAP acts as transcriptional repressor and is also a spliceosomal component whereas the uncharacterized protein NKAP-L localizes to the nucleolus (our unpublished data). A role for NKAP-L in rRNA transcription and/or rRNA biogenesis is also plausible. <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> contains a single DUF926 containing protein, DdNKAP, which might localize to nucleoli and may perform the functions of NKAP and NKAP-L i.e. have roles in transcription/mRNA biogenesis/rRNA biogenesis. Recent reports identified RbdB as an essential component of miRNA processing in <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>. Two putative domains were identified in RbdB, a double stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD) and a proline rich site. dsRBD domains in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> are functionally conserved and show functional redundancy as the dsRBDs of DrnB and RdbB can be functionally exchanged [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. RbdB localizes to nuclei with distinct foci at nucleoli and ablation of rbdb results in loss of miRNAs [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Based on the localization of DdNKAP in a punctate pattern in nuclei and its ability of interact with RNA, the likelihood of DdNKAP to bind and process miRNAs must be addressed further.</p><p>Finally, with regard to developmental phenotypes, mutants overexpressing full length DdNKAP and DdN-NKAP overexpressor showed opposite phenotypes in aggregation, streaming and chemotaxis. In agreement with these results, we found an opposite expression profile of several genes and rRNAs in GFP-DdNKAP and GFP-DdN-NKAP overexpressors. Similarly, differing localizations were observed upon ectopic expression of NKAP and the N-terminus of NKAP in mammalian cells [<xref rid="pone.0168617.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We also confirmed the interaction of the N-terminal domain and DdDUF926 domain biochemically. Based on these results we propose that the DdDUF926 domain of DdNKAP acts as a negative regulator of the N-terminal domain.</p><p>In conclusion, we present the first characterization of an SR protein in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic>, namely DdNKAP. DdNKAP is the single DUF926 domain containing protein present in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic>. The functional similarity between Arabidopsis MAS2, human NKAP and DdNKAP is very high. Taken together it seems that NKAPs are multifunctional proteins and function in the regulation of transcription, translation and RNA export.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0168617.s001"><label>S1 Supporting Information</label><caption><title>Supporting methods</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0168617.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0168617.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Cytosolic and nuclear fractionation.</title><p>(A) Cytosolic and nuclear fractionation of GFP-DdNKAP and GFP-DdNKAP expressing cells.
