The <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex, comprised of <italic>Saccharum</italic> genus and a few related genera, are important genetic resources for sugarcane breeding. A large amount of natural variation exists within the <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex. Though understanding their allelic variation has been challenging, it is critical to dissect allelic structure and to identify the alleles controlling important traits in sugarcane. To characterize natural variations in <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex, a target enrichment sequencing approach was used to assay 12 representative germplasm accessions. In total, 55,946 highly efficient probes were designed based on the sorghum genome and sugarcane unigene set targeting a total of 6 Mb of the sugarcane genome. A pipeline specifically tailored for polyploid sequence variants and genotype calling was established. BWA-mem and sorghum genome approved to be an acceptable aligner and reference for sugarcane target enrichment sequence analysis, respectively. Genetic variations including 1,166,066 non-redundant SNPs, 150,421 InDels, 919 gene copy number variations, and 1,257 gene presence/absence variations were detected. SNPs from three different callers (Samtools, Freebayes, and GATK) were compared and the validation rates were nearly 90%. Based on the SNP loci of each accession and their ploidy levels, 999,258 single dosage SNPs were identified and most loci were estimated as largely homozygotes. An average of 34,397 haplotype blocks for each accession was inferred. The highest divergence time among the <italic>Saccharum</italic> spp. was estimated as 1.2 million years ago (MYA). <italic>Saccharum</italic> spp. diverged from <italic>Erianthus</italic> and Sorghum approximately 5 and 6 MYA, respectively. The target enrichment sequencing approach provided an effective way to discover and catalog natural allelic variation in highly polyploid or heterozygous genomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Saccharum</italic> complex</kwd><kwd>sugarcane</kwd><kwd>target enrichment sequencing</kwd><kwd>polyploid</kwd><kwd>allelic variations</kwd><kwd>SNP(s)</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="81"/><page-count count="18"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Sugarcane (<italic>Saccharum</italic> spp.) is grown in over 100 countries, mainly in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world. Recently, sugarcane was considered as a sustainable feedstock for next generation cellulosic biofuel production (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Tew and Cobill, 2008</xref>). The genus <italic>Saccharum</italic> is considered to include six species, namely <italic>S. officinarum</italic>, <italic>S. spontaneum</italic>, <italic>S. sinense</italic>, <italic>S. robustum</italic>, <italic>S. barberi</italic>, and <italic>S. edule</italic> with tremendous diversity in morphology, genome structure, and composition (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">D&#x02019;Hont et al., 1998</xref>). <italic>Saccharum officinarum</italic> (2n = 8x = 80) is the primary sugar producing species, which has been domesticated from wild species <italic>S. robustum</italic> (2n = 6x&#x02013;8x = 60&#x02013;80) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Grivet et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>S. spontaneum</italic> is autopolypoid (2n = 4x&#x02013;16x = 32&#x02013;128) with excellent stress tolerance (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Roach, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">D&#x02019;Hont et al., 1998</xref>). <italic>S. barberi</italic> and <italic>S. sinense</italic> have been considered as interspecific hybrids between <italic>S. officinarum</italic> and <italic>S. spontaneum</italic> following by a series of mutations in India and China, respectively (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Grivet et al., 2006</xref>). Modern sugarcane cultivars are allopolyploids and interspecific hybrids mostly derived from crosses between domesticated <italic>S. officinarum</italic> and wild species <italic>S. spontaneum</italic>, followed by a series of backcrosses with <italic>S. officinarum.</italic> For example, the French sugarcane cultivar, R570, has a chromosome number of 115 (2n = 115) with 80% of the chromosomes from <italic>S. officinarum</italic> species, 10% from <italic>S. spontaneum</italic> and 10% recombination of these two species (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">D&#x02019;Hont et al., 1996</xref>). The <italic>Saccharum</italic> genus together with a few other related genera, such as <italic>Erianthus</italic>, <italic>Miscanthus</italic> are referred to as <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex. In some sugarcane breeding programs, beside the <italic>S. officinarum</italic> and <italic>S. spontaneum</italic>, other <italic>Saccharum</italic> spp. such as <italic>S. robustum</italic>, and a few <italic>Erianthus</italic> spp. (2n = 2x&#x02013;6x = 20&#x02013;60) in the <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex were used as breeding materials to broaden the genetic base and increase the stress tolerance of modern sugarcane cultivars (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Tsuruta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A large amount of natural phenotypic variations exist in the <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Nayak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Todd et al., 2014</xref>). Understanding genomic variation within <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex can provide insights into morphology, environmental adaption, polyploidization, sugar and fiber accumulation, stress tolerance, and other important traits. However, genetic and genomic studies of <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex have been daunting due to its high polyploidy, high heterozygosity, large amount of repetitive sequences, aneuploidy, and large genome size varying from 3.36&#x02013;12.64 GB (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Despite significant efforts by several international research groups, a reference genome for sugarcane is still unavailable. However, there are abundant expressed sequence tag (EST) databases generated for sugarcane (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Vettore et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Hotta et al., 2010</xref>), as well as cDNA databases (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">de Setta et al., 2014</xref>), which can be used for gene discovery and characterization. The genome of sorghum (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Paterson et al., 2009</xref>), the closest relative of sugarcane with a genome sequence available, has been extensively used as reference for sugarcane genomic studies due to its extensive collinearity with sugarcane in the genic regions (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Ming et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). However, applications of the sorghum genome and the ESTs are still limited for studies requiring polyploid allelic dosage, heterozygous genotypes, and particular sequence variation in the <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex. Genome-wide, reliable, and powerful genotyping tools for <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex are critical for a thorough evaluation of the genetic and genomic variation of <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex polyploidy and for identifying specific alleles underpinning phenotypic diversity and the traits of interests across the entire genome and the entire species.</p><p>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), presence-absence variation (PAV), copy number variation (CNV) and insertions and deletions (InDels) are abundant in plant genomes and many are functionally relevant (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Saxena et al., 2014</xref>). These variations have been utilized in many model species and crop plants for high throughput genotyping and used in the assessment of genetic diversity, population structure, linkage analysis, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mapping, association mapping, and genomic selection (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Varshney et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Saxena et al., 2014</xref>). However, genotyping in highly heterozygous polyploid species, such as sugarcane is much more challenging due to the existence of hom(oe)ologs for most of the loci, and even more complicated, by the interference of close paralogs. A typical gene in a sugarcane clone can have up to 12 different alleles per locus. Therefore, to genotype polyploid plants with less ambiguity, we require a system that can distinguish among different allele variations and precisely infer the allele copy number. Large-scale characterization of SNPs and other sequence variation in the genomes of <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex could provide insight into global pattern of intra-genotype and inter-genotype sequence variation and their potential impacts on gene functions. Further development of these sequence variation into powerful tools for genotyping polyploid <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex will help in sugarcane genetic studies, specifically in exploring and utilizing the genetic resources for crop improvement.</p><p>Target enrichment methods combined with next generation sequencing (NGS), in which genomic regions of interest are captured for subsequent sequencing, is an effective approach to investigate allelic variation across a large number of samples, specifically for species with complex genomes. The hybridization based enrichment relies on the probe sequence homology or similarity to fish out the target DNA fragments for enrichment. Typically, if the sequence similarity of the target region is more than 80% with the probe oligo sequences, the target regions will be captured, thus all possible allele variants, even paralogous allele variants will be included in the enriched samples, achieving high sensitivity in retrieving target fragments. Therefore, the hybridization based enrichment is suitable for polyploids and heterozygous <italic>Saccharum</italic> species to capture multiple alleles from a large number of diverse samples. It requires a careful downstream sequence analysis pipeline to exclude non-specific target sequences. Target enrichment combined with NGS has been effectively used for detecting SNPs in several other plant species with complex genomes, including maize (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2010</xref>), wheat (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Winfield et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Jordan et al., 2015</xref>), and pine (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Neves et al., 2013</xref>). In sugarcane, target regions of two clones, one <italic>S. officinarum</italic> and the other <italic>S.</italic> hybrid; spanning 5.8 Mb, enriched through solution-based hybridization have been sequenced (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bundock et al., 2012</xref>). However, the application of target enrichment approach across the whole scope of <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex accessions, the evaluation of different sequence analysis pipelines tailored to polyploid species with different ploidy level, calling for various variants and possible haplotypes, and divergence among the <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex were not fully addressed. Deep sequencing the target genomic regions of a diversity panel from <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex would generate a catalog of allelic variance and provide a solid foundation for the development of a platform for high throughput genotyping in <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex.</p><p>In this study, we applied a target enrichment sequencing approach to sequence genomic regions spanning a total of 6 Mb of 12 accessions, representing different species in <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex. Here, we describe the sequencing results, several types of sequence variants within and among 12 accessions, genotypes of each accession across 1,100,040 total SNP loci, haplotypes of all target regions, and level of divergence among the represented accessions. This study illustrates the value of target enrichment sequencing in calling allelic variations in polyploid species for accurate genotyping, offering an overview of the genomic variation, and molecular evolution among different accessions of <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex. The data generated in this study would be a useful public resource and catalog of diverse sequence variances among <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Material</title><p>A total of 12 diverse accessions representing different species were selected from a diversity panel of 300 accessions (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Nayak et al., 2014</xref>) grown at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Sugarcane Field Station at Canal Point, FL with three replicates in a split plot design. The diversity panel was a representative sub-collection of the World Collection of Sugarcane and Related Grass (WCSRG). The 12 selected accessions include two accessions of <italic>S. officinarum</italic> (P-MAG-84, NG96-024), two accessions of <italic>S. spontaneum</italic> (SES196, IND81-14), one accession of <italic>S. barberi</italic> (Pathri), one accession of <italic>S. robustum</italic> (NG57-054), one accession of <italic>S. sinense</italic> (TekchaOk), one accession of <italic>E. procerum</italic> (Kalimpon), one accession of <italic>E. rufipilus</italic> (US57-060), one accession of unknown species (US61-037), and two accessions of <italic>S</italic>. spp. hybrids (Q050, R570) (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S1</xref>, Supplementary Data).</p></sec><sec><title>Probe Design for Target Enrichment Sequencing</title><p>For target enrichment of the 12 accessions, we designed a set of 55,946 probes, which are 120-nucleotide long (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref>). Three different genomic resources were used for the probe design in a strategic way. First, a set of 6,035 probes were designed from 5,546 tentative sugarcane unigenes downloaded from the Gene Index repository Version 3<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>. To identify exon&#x02013;exon boundaries, we searched the corresponding genes in the Sorghum genome v3.1 (downloaded from Phytozome) using BLAST version 2.2.31 (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Paterson et al., 2009</xref>). The sugarcane unigenes were realigned to the full-length sorghum genes using GMAP v20141216 (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Wu and Watanabe, 2005</xref>). Based on the output, putative intronic regions in the unigene sequences were masked and avoided in the probe design. All possible probes in non-masked regions were designed. Subsequently, we selected probes with no hit to sugarcane chloroplast or mitochondria reference genome and with a single unique hit to the sorghum reference genome. The second set of probes comprised of 43,910 probes and consisted of well-distributed regions on the sorghum genome, which contained at least one sugarcane short read sequence (NCBI, accession SRX125303 and SRX142056, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bundock et al., 2012</xref>) aligned to it. Regions in the sorghum genome that did not have a valid alignment from the sugarcane reads were masked and not considered in the probe design. Regions of the genome that had high depth were also masked. The genome was divided into 15 kb windows, and similar to the first probe set, all possible probes were designed based on the sequences of the sugarcane short reads that aligned to the non-masked regions of the sorghum genome. Probes were only selected for synthesis if they were unique in the sorghum genome and had no match against chloroplast or mitochondria genomes. The third probe set comprised of 6,001 probes targeting 406 candidate genes involved in biomass, sugar metabolism, and disease resistance (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref>). The biomass related genes comprise of cell wall biogenesis gene, architecture genes, and transcription factors among others, that have been functionally characterized in other models species. Sequences of these genes were BLAST against sorghum transcripts from Phytozome database with <italic>E</italic> value &#x0003e;10e<sup>-6</sup> and alignment length &#x0003e;300 bases to retrieve the corresponding nucleotide sequences. Then the sorghum transcript targets were used for probe design. The probes were synthesized by Agilent<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn02">2</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Target Enrichment Sequencing</title><p>Genomic DNA samples of the 12 accessions were prepared from leaf tissues using the CTAB method according to <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2010)</xref> with minor modifications. DNA concentration was detected using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Life Technologies). For target enrichment DNA sequence approach, 1 &#x003bc;g of genomic DNA of each accession was fragmented to an average size of 400 bp. DNA libraries were constructed by end-repairing the sheared DNA, A-tailing and adapter ligation, bar-coding, and PCR amplification. The 12 barcoded libraries were equi-molarly pooled to a total of 750 ng for downstream target enrichment capturing. Target enrichment of the 12 accessions was performed following SureSelect Target Enrichment System (Agilent Technologies). The pooled samples were hybridized with biotinylated baits twice to target-specific capture library following manufacturer&#x02019;s guidelines. After the first and the second hybridization process, the selected libraries were re-amplified through 5 and 12 PCR cycles, respectively. The enriched products were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 to generate single-end 100-bp reads.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence Trimming and Mapping</title><p>The raw reads were de-multiplexed using Illumina pipeline. Adapter contamination and reads of low quality were identified and removed. Each library was sequenced to a depth providing an approximately 100-fold on targeted regions.

The reads with quality score &#x02265;20, length &#x02265;50, and free of barcode or primer sequences were kept for further analysis. For the reads alignment, we applied three different aligners, BWA version 0.6.1-r104<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn03">3</xref></sup>, Bowtie2 version 2.2.5<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn04">4</xref></sup> and MOSAIK version 2.1<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn05">5</xref></sup> (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). The reference genome used here for <italic>S. officinarum</italic> was assembled using SPAdes v3.6.2 (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bankevich et al., 2012</xref>) with default settings on reads generated for accession (NG96-024). For the sorghum reference, sorghum genome v3.1 was used. Both of these references were used for alignment using three different aligners with close and comparable settings. Bowtie 2 (v2.2.5) was used with the option -sensitive-local. MOSAIK was applied with the following parameters: mismatches (-mmp 5), hash size (-hs 15), -mfl 500. BWA-mem was run following default settings. Uniquely mapped reads for each accession were extracted by using &#x0201c;XS:I&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;ZA&#x0201d; tag indicating secondary alignment in BAM file for Bowtie2 and MOSAIK, respectively. For BWA-mem, uniquely mapped reads with mapping quality &#x0003e;0 were extracted from sequence alignment BAM files.</p><p>To evaluate the best reference of the reads from <italic>Saccharum</italic> species beside the sorghum genome v3.1, the assembly of all sequence reads (&#x0003e;200 bp), probe sequences, and a unigene set assembled from in-house RNA-seq data were also used as the reference for alignment and comparison. For the RNAseq unigene set assembling, Trinity v2.1.1<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn06">6</xref></sup> with default settings was used.

A bed file was generated containing target capture region by adding 100-bp up and downstream of each probe on the sorghum reference sequences.

The cumulative distribution describing the fraction of target region was plotted in R program using ggplot2 package (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Wickham, 2009</xref>). To assess the efficiency of each probe, we aligned the reads generated from each accession against each probe and created sorted BAM files.

Only the probes with &#x0003e;26 (10% of the average uniquely mapped reads/probe) and &#x0003c;974 uniquely mapped reads (99th percentile of the distribution of the uniquely mapped reads/probe) were considered as successful probes to reduce potential bias due to sequence difference between designed probe sequences and target regions. The correlation coefficients between thermodynamic parameters were estimated using R 3.0.2 (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">R Development Core Team, 2010</xref>). If parameters have correlation coefficient higher than 0.95 or lower than -0.95, then only one parameter from this correlation group was kept for a model construction. A linear model was constructed between the capture efficiency and representative thermodynamic parameters using a linear regression analysis on R 3.0.2 (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">R Development Core Team, 2010</xref>). Only the parameters significantly contributing [tested using Analysis of variance (ANOVA)] to the capture efficiency were kept in the model. Further, the importance of the parameters kept in the model was evaluated using Relaimpo package in R 3.0 (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Groemping, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence Variants and Haplotype Calling</title><p>Different reference sources and aligners were compared to establish the optimized pipeline for sequence analysis within <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex. For SNP calling, each accession alignment SAM file was converted into BAM file followed by binary compressing, sorting, and indexing using SAMtools (samtools view, sort, and index tools). SNPs and InDels were called with three different variant callers, namely, Samtools (v 0.1), UnifiedGenotyper implemented in Genome Analysis ToolKit (GATK) v3.30, and Freebayes v0.9.21 respectively (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Garrison and Marth, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Auwera et al., 2013</xref>). Samtools was used to call variants with the parameters -u -D -g -f, Freebayes was run with the parameters -C 2 -F 0.05 -0 -q 20 &#x02013;min-coverage 5 -p (ploidy level) and GATK was used with settings: -ploidy (ploidy level) -mbq 20 -mgl 20-stand_call_conf 30 -stand_emit_conf 10. To obtain high-confidence SNP, the GATK specific filters were applied to vcf from GATK. Other than that, a series of stringent filters were applied to the vcf files generated from different callers including; (1) mapping quality for SNPs &#x0003e;30, (2) base quality for SNP sites &#x0003e;20, (3) number of reads for alternate base for each accession &#x0003e; 2, (4) overall maximum depth for 12 accessions &#x0003c;3000, (5) overall minimum depth for 12 accessions quality &#x0003e;600, and (6) minimum value of the QUAL field &#x0003e;80. The filtered SNP variants were annotated with SnpEff (v3.6) program using the sorghum v3.1 reference genome to determine the effects of the SNPs on function of genes. To avoid assigning the SNP to more than one gene model, default settings were used except that the upstream/downstream distance was set at 0 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cingolani et al., 2012</xref>). The synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions were also identified using SnpEff. To increase the accuracy of InDel calling, only the concordant sites among three callers were considered as a potential InDel for the analysis (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Albers et al., 2011</xref>). Variants (SNPs and InDel) between sorghum reference and any of the 12 accessions were filtered out and only variants within each and between every two of the 12 accessions were used for further analysis. The UnifiedGenotyper was used to assign genotypes at each SNP sites based on the ploidy level. The heterozygotes at each locus including different dosage level such as single dose, double dose, triple dose etc., up to the ploidy level according to their genotypes were called by Unified Genotyper. The heterozygosity rate for each accession was estimated based on the heterozygous loci by dividing number of heterozygous sites/length of aligned region. HapCompass v0.7.7<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn07">7</xref></sup> was used for haplotype assembly with ploidy level assigned by -p (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aguiar and Istrail, 2012</xref>).

To evaluate the gene CNVs between every two accessions within <italic>Saccharum</italic> species and CNVs between the two <italic>Erianthus</italic> species (Kalimpon and US57-060), the number of uniquely mapped reads to sorghum gene model was recorded for each pair of accessions. The depth of coverage was normalized using the following formula: read depth of gene model = [10<sup>9</sup>&#x000d7; (no. of reads in gene)]/[(Total mapped reads) &#x000d7; (length of gene)] to eliminate the effect of read depth of each sample. For each gene, the log<sub>2</sub> ratio of read depth of query accession to subject accession was used to assess CNV. To reduce technical variation between two accessions, we used 99th percentile cut-off. Up-CNVs were identified as above 99th percentile cut-off in query accession, and Down-CNVs were identified as below 99th percentile cut-off in subject accession. The gene PAVs were identified between every two accessions which met the criteria including; (1) no reads aligned to query accession; and, (2) at least 10 reads aligned to subject accession at the same gene region with normalized read depth of no less than 0.1.</p><p>To annotate the genes with CNV or PAV, the GO terms for each gene were retrieved from sorghum genome<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn011">11</xref></sup>.

However, the efficiency of probes is highly uneven with 593 probes showing MSD above 10,000, 1,783 probes with MSD below 100, and 421 probes failing to capture any fragments.</p><p>To determine the features and probes with good capture efficiency, several probe sequence parameters were investigated including Tm, probe sequence minimum folding energy (PMFE), hybridization folding energy (PHFE), hairpin score, and dimer score (Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3A</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">F</xref>). The capture efficiency reflected by MSD was higher for probes designed from CDS region of sorghum genes than those from non-CDS region (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3G</xref>). The capture efficiency was slightly higher for probes derived from sugarcane sequences compared to those from sorghum sequences (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3H</xref>). The optimal MSD was observed for probes with GC content ranging from 30&#x02013;60%. The hairpin score shows a similar effect on MSD compared to that of dimer score (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3A</xref>).</p><p>The successful probes (50,820) for <italic>S. officianrum</italic> (NG96-024) were used to construct a model for explaining the probe efficiency. For the simplicity of this model, we tentatively assume that the probe sequences have equal copy numbers in the genomes. The GC content of probe sequence was highly correlated with Tm and PHFE. Therefore, only GC content was chosen from this correlation group in combination with other three parameters, hairpin, dimer scores and PMFE used for the model construction. The ANOVA results indicated that these four thermodynamic parameters significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) contributed to uniquely mapped reads of probes, from which a linear regression model was constructed as: Uniquely mapped reads = 5.08<sup>&#x02217;</sup>GC content + 13.3<sup>&#x02217;</sup>PMFE -2.11<sup>&#x02217;</sup>Dimer &#x02013; 10.67<sup>&#x02217;</sup>Hairpin + 164.46. Based on the established model, higher GC content and PMFE could lead to more uniquely mapped reads, while Dimer and Hairpin had negative effects on the uniquely mapped reads or capture efficiency. The importance of the four parameters, PMFE, GC, Hairpin, and Dimer, showed a decreasing order (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3I</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Alignment of Target Enrichment Sequences</title><p>To select the best aligner for efficiently calling sequence variants, three most popular aligners for NGS read alignment, Bowtie2, BWA-mem, and MOSAIK were compared by aligning the cleaned reads from a single library to its assembly and sorghum genome respectively. The portion of mapped reads using Bowtie2, BWA-mem, and MOSAIK with less than 5 mismatches were 92.8, 92.3, and 87.4%, respectively. Both Bowtie2 and MOSAIK have less uniquely mapped reads (64.1 and 77%) to contig assembly from NG96-024 than BWA-mem (88.6%) indicating that BWA-mem was more sensitive for the uniquely mapped reads alignment. A follow-up visual examination on randomly selected alignment regions further confirmed that BWA-mem could accurately and sensitively call the uniquely aligned reads. Therefore, BWA-mem was used for all the alignments in this study. To determine the best reference sequence for the alignment (since the sugarcane genome is not available currently) the clean reads of the 12 accessions were aligned to sorghum genome v3.1, probe sequences, assembled sugarcane transcript sequences, and assembly of the total reads (contig length &#x0003e;200 bp) respectively using BWA-mem. The alignment rate using sorghum genome as the reference was 83%, ranging from 80&#x02013;86% for each accession, the highest in the four reference sources (<bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>). Therefore, the sorghum genome was used as a reference for alignment of the reads from different species in <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Calling Sequence Variants</title><p>Single nucleotide polymorphisms and InDels were called based on unique alignments of cleaned reads to sorghum genome using BWA-mem. To create a set of high-confidence SNPs and InDels, three different callers, namely, SAMtools, GATK, and Freebayes were used. The chromosome number and ploidy level of each accession were estimated (Supplementary Data, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S1</xref>) to facilitate the variants calling specifically by using GATK and Freebayes, which can accommodate species with different ploidy level. In total, 797,831, 1,100,040, and 465,636 SNPs were called by using SAMtools, GATK, and Freebayes respectively (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref></bold>) with a total of 1,166,066 non-redundant SNPs and 411,585 commonly called SNPs by three callers. In terms of the types of SNP changes, transition (Ts) and transversion (Tv), the Ts/Tv mutation ratios of SNPs produced from SAMtools, GATK, and Freebayes were 1.64, 1.61 and 1.76, respectively. In order to validate the accuracy of SNP calling of these three callers, 13 SNP-containing regions were selected for validation by Sanger sequencing including 69, 31, and 57 SNPs called by Samtools, Freebayes, and GATK respectively. Among those SNPs, 22 were called by all three callers, 47 SNPs specifically called by Samtools, 35 by GATK, and 9 by Freebayes (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S4</xref>). Among the 13 primer pairs designed for the SNP-containing regions, 12 could amplify target sequences. Within these amplified sequences, 113 SNPs were validated which gave validation rates of 87% for Samtools-specifically called SNPs, 89.5% for GATK, 90.3% for Freebayes, and 86.4% for the concordantly called SNPs by all the three callers respectively (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S4</xref>). The SNPs not validated were mostly single dose markers. In total, 83,871, 106,996, and 46,159 InDels with size ranging from 1 to 20 bp were called by using SAMtools, GATK, and Freebayes respectively with a total of 150,421 non-redundant InDels and 19,104 concordantly called InDels by the three callers (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p><bold>Number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and InDels.</bold>

GATK with consideration of ploidy level called more SNPs than FreeBayes and had better accuracy in SNP calling than SAMtools. The average read depth for SNP called by GATK was 1,653. With the read depth increasing, the number of SNPs called decreased and reached to a flat line when the read depth was between 1,500 and 2,900, which might be a reliable depth range for SNP calling. Each of the 12 accessions possessed more than 95% of the SNPs called by GATK. In total, 1,091,239 (99.2%) SNPs were present in all 10 <italic>Saccharum</italic> accessions, suggesting that most SNPs were cross-species differences. The two <italic>Erianthus</italic> accessions, US57-054 and Kalimpon had 95.9 and 97.8% of the total called SNPs with 45,272 (4.1%) and 24,718 (2.2%) of missing SNPs due to lack of reads alignment (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref></bold>). Nevertheless, the ploidy level of these 12 accessions, varied from 6 to 12, and the frequency of multi-allelic SNP loci for each single accession was very low (less than 1%) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref></bold>).

Approximately 6% (1,079) of those InDels were located in exon regions, 56.4% (10,767) in intron regions, 20.7% (3,950) in UTR region, and the rest in exon&#x02013;intron junctions (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref></bold>). In consistence with SNP distribution, InDels density on chromosome 1 (24 kb/InDel) and 3 (25 kb/InDel) was four times higher than that on the chromosome 5 (97 kb/InDel) indicating the genome of certain chromosomes were more active in evolving than others. Furthermore, the abundance of different InDel length was investigated. As InDel size increased, the total number of InDels reduced (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S4</xref>). The InDels causing frame-shift mutations were approximately 48% (522), compared to a slightly lower number for InDels in-frame (557, 52%) (with a length of a multiple of 3 bp in the coding region), indicating a significant evolvement of frame shift InDels with perhaps deleterious effects on functional genes (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S4A</xref>). However, across all regions assayed, the InDels with a length of not a multiple of 3 were much (&#x0223c;80.9%) more abundant than the InDels with a length of a multiple of 3 (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S4B</xref>), confirming that the InDels in the CDS are indeed subject to purifying selection.</p><p>The functional effects of structural variations including CNVs and PAVs were also annotated according to sorghum gene models. Out of 34,213 gene models, 919 had CNVs among the 10 <italic>Saccharum</italic> species and between two <italic>Erianthus</italic> spp, including 98 CNVs accruing only between two <italic>Erianthus</italic> spp. The annotation showed that 397 genes had Gene Ontology (GO) annotation in sorghum genome and 521 genes did not have any GO annotation. Gene family enrichment analysis indicated that genes with CNVs were significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) enriched in 14 GO terms related to photosynthesis and nucleotide binding (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S5A</xref>). Interestingly, seven down-CNVs showed <italic>S. spontaneum</italic> species-specificity, which indicated that these seven genes, such as NRAMP metal ion transporter family protein (Sobic.001G125400), terpene synthase (Sobic.007G133900), and PR5-like receptor kinase (Sobic.003G097200), had a significantly low copy number in the two <italic>S. spontaneum</italic> accessions but much high copy number in other <italic>Saccharum</italic> spp. (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S6</xref>). Out of the total 1,257 genes showing PAVs between different accessions, 541genes were annotated in sorghum and 716 genes were of unknown function. The GO enrichment analysis showed that 13 GO terms related to oxidative stress and ion binding were significantly represented (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S5B</xref>). In addition, one disease resistance gene, Sobic.006G014632, was absent in <italic>E. rufipilus</italic> accession (US57-060), <italic>E. procerum</italic> accession (Kalimpon), unknown accession (US61-037), <italic>S.</italic> hybrid accessions (R570), <italic>S. robustum</italic> accession (NG57-054), <italic>S. officinarum</italic> accession (P-MAG-84) and <italic>S. officinarum</italic> accession (NG96-024), but present in <italic>S. sinense</italic> accession (TekchaOk), <italic>S. spontaneum</italic> accessions (SES196), <italic>S. spontaneum</italic> accessions (IND81-14) and <italic>S.</italic> hybrid accessions (Q050), which may be associated with different capabilities to handle biotic stress in wild and cultivated sugarcanes.</p></sec><sec><title>Genotype and Haplotype Calling</title><p>Genotype calling based on SNPs in polyploids is critical in determining the allele dosage and also is very challenging due to high ploidy level, limited number of nucleotides (four nucleotides only, A, C, T, G), and sometimes insufficient sequence depth or low quality. Since the ploidy levels included 6, 8, and 12 in the 12 accessions, the genotypes were called at different ploidy levels using bi-allelic SNPs for each of the 12 accessions (Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S7A</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">C</xref>). The largest number of genotypes was found as homozygote with reference allele, followed by homozygote with alternative allele regardless of which ploidy level was applied (Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S7</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">C</xref>). The overall heterozygosity rates of 12 accessions ranged from 0.28% in <italic>E. rufipilus</italic> accession (US57-060) to 0.96% in unknown spp. (US61-037). Among <italic>Saccharum</italic> spp., <italic>S. barberi</italic> (0.52%), <italic>S. sinense</italic> (0.6%) and hybrid R570 have relatively higher heterozygosity rate in target region than the others (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S6</xref>). The heterozygotes at each locus including single dose, double dose, triple dose etc. up to the ploidy level was less than 25% in total (except US61-037). The single dose markers (SDM) were calculated based on the ratio of reads calling of each allele and ploidy level for each of the 12 accessions. A total of 999,258 SDM were identified ranging from 46,587 (4.42% of bi-allelic alleles in <italic>E. rufipilus</italic> accession, US57-060) to 390,676 (35.85% of bi-allelic alleles in unknown accession, US61-037) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref></bold>).</p><p>To further extract haplotypes of each accession at every single locus, the overlapping reads containing SNPs called at an average depth of 50 was used to reconstruct the haplotypes. The longest haplotype blocks identified in the 12 accessions range from 1,358 bases to 2,453 bases with an average of 1,683 bases showing no big variance among accessions (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S6</xref>). The longest haplotype block of 2,453 bases was identified in hybrid accession (R570), which included 183 SNP sites on Chr10 (60,795,871-60,798,323) followed by haplotype block with length of 2,211 bases on Chr05 (64,826,268-64,828,478) in a hybrid accession (Q050). Both blocks were located in the genic region encoding glycosyltransferase gene.</p><p>By looking into the haplotype blocks within each of the 406 candidate gene regions, a total of 13,584 haplotype blocks were inferred ranging from 394 in <italic>S. officinarum</italic> accession (P-MAG-84) to 1,493 in unknown accession (US57-060). In general, the number of haplotype blocks and the SNP density of single candidate gene increased with increasing number of uniquely mapped reads (Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S7D,E</xref>). However, all the possible haplotypes could be resolved when the uniquely mapped read number reaching a certain level (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S7F</xref>). The haplotype block number also increased with the SNP density of each candidate gene (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S7G</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence Divergence</title><p>Phylogenetic analysis of the 12 accessions revealed that the two <italic>Erianthus</italic> accessions grouped into one cluster, and all the <italic>Saccharum</italic> spp. were also grouped into another cluster (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>). The unknown accession (US61-037) was closer with <italic>Saccharum</italic> species than with the two <italic>Erianthus</italic> species, most likely a hybrid clone derived from a cross between the <italic>Saccharum</italic> and <italic>Erianthus</italic>. To estimate divergence among the 12 accessions in <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex, the substitution rates of synonymous (Ks) for 25 homologs (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S5</xref>) among the 12 accessions were calculated between each pair of accessions. As expected, the Ks value was smaller between the two accessions within the same species (e.g., two <italic>S. officinarum</italic> accessions, two <italic>Erianthus accessions</italic> and two <italic>S. spontaneum</italic> accessions) compared to Ks value between two different species (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>). Based on the common synonymous substitution rate for grass lineage (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gaut et al., 1996</xref>), the divergence times between sorghum and the 12 accessions in <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex were relatively long, ranging from 5.7 million years ago (MYA) (with <italic>S. spontaneum</italic>) to 6.5 MYA (with <italic>Erianthus</italic> species). The divergence times between <italic>Erianthus</italic> and all <italic>Saccharum</italic> species were estimated as 4.6&#x02013;5 MYA. Within the <italic>Saccharum</italic> species, the divergence time between each different species was estimated to be 0.7 (between <italic>S. Sinense</italic> and <italic>S.

Sequencing by methylation filtration (MF) approach can be used to enrich the genic region sequences and it has been successfully utilized to assemble gene-enriched regions of a sugarcane cultivar (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Grativol et al., 2014</xref>). However, researchers have minimum control on specific target regions by using this approach especially in studies to genotype a diverse panel of germplasm in parallel. Missing data or various sequence depth at a given locus across the panel could be a problem, which is also a concern for genotyping by sequencing (GBS) approach. The probe-based enrichment approach can pinpoint specific regions to reduce the opportunity of missing data instead of conducting random sampling euchromatic regions. This probe-based enrichment approach can facilitate genotyping and cataloging the allelic variations across a large diversity panel. Multiple types of allele variants and haplotypes were captured within target region across 12 accessions. Technically, we successfully multiplexed 12 accessions for one hybridization capture reaction, which allows increasing the throughput and reducing the cost of the capture procedure. Previously, up to eight genotypes of pine trees were multiplexed for capture and sequencing (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Neves et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, the multiplexing level in polyploid sugarcane was further increased to 12 and proven to be a success.</p><p>For hybridization based enrichment strategy, the probe design is a fundamental step. To fully capture the allelic variants in the <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex, 55,946 120-mer probes were designed from sorghum genome and sugarcane unigene set, targeting collectively a total of 6 Mb region. The capture efficiency of probes designed from sugarcane sequences was slightly higher than those from sorghum sequences (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S2B</xref>). We observed more than 80% of the probes with MSD &#x0003e;30 in <italic>Saccharum</italic> spp. and only 67% probes with MSD &#x0003e; 30 in the two <italic>Erianthus</italic> species, which provided enough data per locus for variant calling and genotype inference. The capture efficiency bias between <italic>Saccharum</italic> species and <italic>Erianthus</italic> species was mostly due to their different sequence similarity to sorghum reference genome used for alignment. The <italic>Saccharum</italic> species was more closely related to sorghum than <italic>Erianthus</italic> species. The capture efficiency was significantly higher for probes designed from CDS regions than those from non-CDS regions (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3G</xref>), suggesting CDS regions are more conserved across different species or genotypes and are preferable in probe design to target corresponding regions across a diverse collection of samples. The probes with read depth of more than 10,000 could be targeting repetitive regions and generating non-uniquely mapped reads.</p><p>The sequence features of all the probes and their capture efficiency were further evaluated to determine credentials of good probes in target enrichment sequencing approach. In our study, the probes with a 30&#x02013;60% GC content had optimal coverage which was similar to the previous report on wheat (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Saintenac et al., 2011</xref>) but wider than the range of 30&#x02013;40% previously reported (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bundock et al., 2012</xref>), which may be due to the different cut-off criteria for evaluation or different stringency during hybridization. The hairpin score showed a weak influence on MSD compared to the dimer score, PHFE and PMFE, respectively (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Saintenac et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, a linear model was developed based on the probe sequence features to predict capture efficiency and subsequent variant calling, which could be recommended for use in probe design in experiments of target enrichment sequencing of other related species.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic Variant Calling Pipelines in Polyploid Species</title><p>Bioinformatics analysis on NGS data is critical for reliable genomic variants calling. We established a tailored pipeline for SNP calling for the polyploid <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex after comparison of different programs and options. A very well assembled reference genome is essential for NGS short reads alignment and other downstream variants calling and annotation. Since a direct reference genome is not yet available for <italic>Saccharum</italic> species, the choice of reference would be challenging. In our study, four references including the sorghum genome v3.1, the assembly of the sequence reads, probe sequences, and a unigene set assembled from in-house RNA-seq data were compared to identify the optimal reference for alignment. Based on the alignment rate, we found that sorghum genome was a preferred reference specifically considering its assembly into chromosomes and its thorough annotations (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Paterson et al., 2009</xref>). The sugarcane transcript assembly had relatively low alignment rate due to some reads containing extended intron region (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S1</xref>) thus causing significant mismatch and non-alignment. When the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly (&#x0003e;200 bp) from all reads was used as reference, the alignment rate was relatively low as well (<bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>), due to the removal of singletons or contigs less than 200 bp in length. When assembly with a lower length cut-off (60 bp) was used, the alignment reads increased to 98%. However, to facilitate the downstream variants distribution and annotation analysis, the sorghum genome was selected as the reference since the alignment rate (83%) was highly acceptable. The high level of nucleotide similarity (97%) between <italic>Saccharum</italic> and sorghum coding region demonstrated the premise that the sorghum genome can serve as a good reference.</p><p>Variant calling programs built upon different models and various aligners would differentially identify potential polymorphisms because many programs are optimized on a diploid model like human. The differences were demonstrated in several polyploids, such as <italic>Brassica napus</italic> and peanut (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Clevenger et al., 2015</xref>). Thus it is necessary to choose the programs that work effectively for the sequencing data of <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex. For read alignment, we evaluated three popular aligners; BWA-mem, Bowtie2 and MOSAIK. BWA-mem and Bowtie2 outperformed MOSAIK in terms of percentage of mapped reads. Additionally, BWA-mem has been shown to have slightly higher number of reads alignment than Bowtie 2. However, BWA identified more uniquely mapped reads to sorghum genome than Bowtie 2 and MOSAIK indicating that BWA was more sensitive for the uniquely mapped reads calling. By evaluating the three aligner settings, we noticed that BWA-mem uses different seed extension algorithm, which allowed 4% of mismatch, while other aligners only allow mismatch at low sequence quality sites, which were trimmed in this study. Considering (1) the sequence identity of 95% between the sorghum genome and sugarcane sequences in the genic region (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) and (2) only uniquely mapped reads to be used for SNP calling, which minimized the misplaced reads for SNP calling, we chose BWA-mem for reads alignment for further analysis. With the nearly 90% SNP validation rate (SNPs not validated were mostly single dose SNPs), we would recommend that BWA-mem aligner is suitable for alignment of sugarcane sequences at genic regions to sorghum genome for SNPs calling.</p><p>The choice of sequence variant caller might lead to variability in the variants called. SAMtools and GATK are widely used callers, and often used in combination for variant calling (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Brownstein et al., 2014</xref>). The comparison of these two variant callers demonstrated low concordance by using parallel analysis of same dataset from four human family exome sequencing (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">ORawe et al., 2013</xref>). For SNP calling, we compared three programs, SAMtools, Freebayes, and GATK. All three callers used Bayesian method that incorporated several factors including preprocessing alignment, modeling multi-allelic loci and genotype likelihood model. SAMtools was developed to call variants for haploid or diploid with a low likelihood to call heterozygote due to a prior setting (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2014</xref>). The GATK and Freebayes could handle different ploidy level, which could be used for the variant calling in polyploid species (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Garrison and Marth, 2012</xref>). However, Freebayes performed very conservatively in calling SNPs in this study (lowest number of variants called), which is inconsistent with the results reported previously on peanut (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Clevenger et al., 2015</xref>). Typically, GATK offered the best practice guidelines including base quality score recalibration and variant-calling score recalibration for SNPs calling; and local realignment for the InDels calling. However, as sugarcane was a non-model species, there was no training dataset publicly available for recalibration. To control the accuracy, stringent hard-filtering criteria were applied to the variants call-sets generated from GATK in this study. SNPs called by the three callers were randomly selected for validation using Sanger re-sequencing. The validation rates were approximately 90% from all three callers. Even the validation rate of the SNPs concordantly called by all three callers was not higher than that called by the individual callers. Therefore, to maximize the sequence variants calling, specifically for SNP calling, we suggest using the combination of all three callers. The follow up SNP validation on segregating population could be used to benchmark the different computational pipelines as well as to select the valid SNPs from the computationally called SNPs for future SNP genotyping of <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Allelic Variants in Polyploid <italic>Saccharum</italic> Species</title><p>Genetic mapping in sugarcane has been a big challenge owing to the huge number of chromosomes and uncertainty of chromosomal recombination, allele dosage, and their inheritance pattern in the complex polyploids. Normally, SDM were identified as valuable marker source for linkage analysis in polyploid species, such as sweet potato (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Kriegner et al., 2003</xref>), eucalyptus (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Yin et al., 2001</xref>), potato (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bonierbale et al., 1988</xref>), and apple (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Hemmat et al., 1994</xref>). Over the past decades, several linkage maps of sugarcane were constructed (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hoarau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Ming et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Aitken et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Raboin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Somers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Andru et al., 2011</xref>). However, all of them were far from saturation, due to huge number of chromosome (over hundreds) and not enough SDMs. It was noticed that the number of SDM decreased with increasing ploidy level (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et al., 2006</xref>). In our dataset, the highest number of SDM was identified in an unknown accession (US61-037), which is a hexaploid. The other hexaploids such as the two <italic>Erianthus</italic> species and a <italic>S. spontanum</italic> species however have had similar percentage of SDM as other accessions with higher ploidy levels (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S1</xref>; <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). We further identified 524 common SDMs between our dataset and another SNP dataset called for a mapping population with 173 individuals (unpublished data). Sixty of the 524 SNPs were confirmed as SDMs in the bi-parental F1 population. The rest of the 524 SDMs were mostly from <italic>Erianthus</italic> species or other different genetic background. The large number of SNPs identified in this study included SDM, which is a magnificent genetic resource to the sugarcane community. In addition, we have identified several other structural variances such as InDels, CNVs, and PAVs providing the first systematic study across the <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex. Identification of InDels proved to be more challenging than SNPs (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Albers et al., 2011</xref>). There was a huge variability in InDel identification by the three callers. To be conservative, concordant InDels identified by all three callers were subjected to further analysis in this study. We found that the total number of InDels with a length of not a multiple of 3 were less abundant in the coding regions as compared to genome-wide suggesting that the coding regions are under intensive purifying selection. Similar results were reported in sorghum genome as well (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We have identified a large number of gene CNVs and PAVs among <italic>Saccharum</italic> species and between two <italic>Erianthus</italic> species using stringent criteria. The genes involved in CNV/PAV usually belong to a gene family, where each member is functionally redundant and not associated with lethality or loss of fitness (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Swanson-Wagner et al., 2010</xref>). The gene CNV may result from genome haplotype-specific tandem duplication, non-allelic paralogous duplication, and recombination (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Innan and Kondrashov, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Swanson-Wagner et al., 2010</xref>). Tandem duplications were often observed in sugarcane genome (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) and other species such as maize, sorghum, <italic>Setaria italica</italic> (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Springer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">de Setta et al., 2014</xref>). Recombination-based mechanisms have been reported in maize genome (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Swanson-Wagner et al., 2010</xref>). However, gene PAVs might arise from fractionation process due to polyploidization (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Woodhouse et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we used comparative sequence read alignment depth to estimate the gene CNV and PAV. Many factors complicate PAV and CNV calling such as ploidy level, read number of each sample, alignment rate reflecting sequence homology level between samples, and sorghum whose sequences were used for probe design. To be conservative, very stringent criteria were applied to call the PAV and CNV, so the numbers of PAV/CNVs may still be underestimated. Some species-specific gene CNV/PAVs were identified, which may be associated with speciation and species-specific traits. The CNV/PAVs identified in this study after further validation will contribute to future gene evolutionary and gene/trait association studies in <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Genotype and Haplotype Calling</title><p>Sugarcane is a vegetatively propagated outcrossing species and thus is presumably very heterozygous. For a given SNP locus, it is likely to be specifically heterozygous given its high polypoidy level. In this study, the genotype at each locus or the allele dosage was called based on the ploidy level estimated for each accession and the sequence alignment depth. The results indicated that approximately 18% (NG96-024) to 29% (TekchaOk) SNP loci among <italic>Saccharum</italic> spp. were heterozygous while the rest were homozygous. The low portion of heterozygous loci could be due to the minimum locus size, single nucleotide instead of a long stretch of gene allele to harbor many nucleotide polymorphisms and/or due to the low outcrossing rate of the species. Sugarcane exhibited 10 cM-long linkage disequilibrium (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Jannoo et al., 1999</xref>). The outcrossing rate of some sugarcane cultivars can be as low as 1.5% (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Melloni et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Haplotype phasing has been a powerful approach for gene mapping.

In this study, haplotype was identified for the first time in polyploid sugarcane genome. The large number of bi-allelic SNP variants were parsed into haplotype blocks with the longest size of 2,453 bases. The length of the haplotype could be affected by the density of SNPs. We specifically characterized the haplotype patterns of 406 candidate genes, which provided great information in understanding the allelic variation of polyploid species. The accuracy of haplotype could be further validated by sequencing clones of large insert genomic DNA libraries.</p></sec><sec><title>Divergence of the <italic>Saccharum</italic> Complex</title><p>The divergence and speciation within the <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex has been an interesting topic for decades.

The Ks values for 19 pairs of sucrose synthase genes among three <italic>Saccharum</italic> species (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) are similar to our results. In this study, the divergence time of the <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex was estimated based on genome-wide targeted genes. The <italic>Saccharum</italic> species and sorghum was predicted to have diverged 5.7-6.1 MYA, quite similar to previous reports (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Al-Janabi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Jannoo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). The divergence between the <italic>Saccharum</italic> and <italic>Erianthus</italic> was first estimated as approximately 5 MYA in our study. These relative divergence times further support the phylogenetic relationship among the 12 accessions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, a hybridization-based target enrichment sequencing approach was used to investigate the allelic variation of 12 accessions representing variety of different species in <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex. A pipeline for variants calling within polyploid genome was established and demonstrated to be effective. A large number of genetic variations including SNPs, InDels, gene CNVs and gene PAVs were identified in <italic>Saccharum</italic> species and <italic>Erianthus</italic> species indicating the existence of a high level of genetic variations within the <italic>Saccharum</italic> complex. The hybridization-based target enrichment sequencing approach proved to be an efficient way to discover natural allelic variation in highly polyploid and heterozygous species, which would be costly with whole genome shotgun sequencing. The results can be applied to identify different gene alleles and allele variants recombination that is responsible for adaptation to different environmental conditions and other important traits of interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>JW conceived and designed the experiments.
