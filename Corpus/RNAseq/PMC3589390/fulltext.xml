Here, we report a next generation sequencing (NGS) approach profiling the expression of miRNAs in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMEs) at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours post-infection with <italic>Streptococcus uberis</italic>, a causative agent of bovine mastitis. Analysing over 450 million sequencing reads, we found that 20% of the approximately 1,300 currently known bovine miRNAs are expressed in unchallenged BMEs. We also identified the expression of more than 20 potentially novel bovine miRNAs. There is, however, a significant dynamic range in the expression of known miRNAs. The top 10 highly expressed miRNAs account for &#x0003e;80% of all aligned reads, with the remaining miRNAs showing much lower expression. Twenty-one miRNAs were identified as significantly differentially expressed post-infection with <italic>S. uberis</italic>. Several of these miRNAs have characterised roles in the immune systems of other species. This miRNA response to the Gram-positive <italic>S. uberis</italic> is markedly different, however, to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced miRNA expression. Of 145 miRNAs identified in the literature as being LPS responsive, only 9 were also differentially expressed in response to <italic>S. uberis</italic>. Computational analysis has also revealed that the predicted target genes of miRNAs, which are down-regulated in BMEs following <italic>S. uberis</italic> infection, are statistically enriched for roles in innate immunity. This suggests that miRNAs, which potentially act as central regulators of gene expression responses to a Gram-positive bacterial infection, may significantly regulate the sentinel capacity of mammary epithelial cells to mobilise the innate immune system.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project was supported by Teagasc (RMIS 6018).

Procedures were performed according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. Briefly, a 3&#x02032;-tagging sequence was added to the 3&#x02032;- end of the RNA followed by treatment with a degradase enzyme to reduce excess 3&#x02032; adaptor oligo. A tagging sequence was then added to the 5&#x02032;- end of the RNA. The RNA, now tagged at both ends (di-tagged), was purified using the Zymogen RNA Clean and Concentrator (Zymogen, Irvine, CA, USA). The di-tagged RNA was then reverse transcribed into cDNA, and the remaining RNA was removed using RNase. The PCR step used by the ScriptMiner&#x02122; kit, is a two stage process, firstly an analytical PCR step was carried out to optimise the number of cycles necessary for amplification. Once this was determined, the libraries were amplified and adaptors were added. Size fractionation of the miRNA libraries to separate them from adapter dimers was achieved by electrophoresis on an 8% TBE polyacrylamide gel (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (1.00 mm&#x000d7;10 well). The libraries were then purified from the gel and the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent Technologies, Colorado Springs, CO, USA) was used to quantify the molarity and size of finished miRNA-seq libraries. miRNA libraries were randomised across three lanes of a flowcell, with eight indexed samples on each lane. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 by the Norwegian Sequencing Centre with TruSeq v3 reagents. Fastq files were produced using the CASAVA pipeline v1.8.2.

Differential expression analysis of miRNAseq data has been shown to be sensitive to the normalisation approach implemented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Garmire1">[30]</xref>. To address this issue, we identified differentially expressed miRNAs in three alternatively normalised datasets; TMM-normalised, upper-quantile normalised and no normalisation. Only miRNAs which were identified as differentially expressed across all three datasets were considered further i.e. the differential expression of these miRNAs was robust to the normalisation procedure.

To do this, miRNAseq data from this study was analysed using the software package miRDeep2 v0.0.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Mackowiak1">[32]</xref>. The miRDeep2 algorithm mines high-throughput sequencing data for the presence of multiple sequenced RNAs corresponding to predicted miRNA hairpin structures in the genome. It then uses Bayesian statistics to score the fit of sequenced RNAs to the biological model of miRNA biogenesis. MiRDeep2 predicted a large number of potentially novel miRNAs from our miRNAseq data. We further parsed this data using a number of different parameters to identify those novel miRNAs that have the highest likelihood of being true positives. Specifically, we identified those predictions where both the mature and star stands were expressed with a minimum of 5 reads each; where miRDeep2 predicted that the miRNA had &#x0003e;90% probability of being a true positive; where the hairpin structure had a significant Randfold p-value and where the novel miRNA was independently predicted in two or more different miRNAseq samples.</p><p>Customised Perl scripts were also written in house to examine the miRDeep2 output for the presence of miRNA isomiRs. These scripts were used to identify isomiRs that were expressed at a level of at least 100 reads and to identify cases where the expression of the isomiR was higher than the expression of the miRBase consensus mature sequence. Furthermore, we identified whether isomiRs were modified at the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; ends (first and last 5 nucleotides). IsomiRs with &#x0003e;1 mismatch to the reference sequence were excluded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>miRNA Target Predictions</title><p>Target genes that are potentially regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted using the consensus of two computational approaches, miRanda v3.3a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Betel1">[33]</xref> and TargetScan v6.2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Lewis1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Grimson1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Friedman1">[36]</xref>. Given the high false positive rates for miRNA target prediction, we identified only those potential target genes that were predicted by both methods. More specifically, we first established a broad pool of potential targets by applying miRanda to bovine mature miRNA (miRBase v18) and cDNA sequences (UMD3.1, Ensembl v66) under default threshold settings. This resulted in the prediction of thousands of possible target genes per differentially expressed miRNA. To narrow down this pool of potential targets, we used TargetScan to independently identify conserved targets with a PCT-score above 0.9 and/or non-conserved targets with a context+ score above 90%. Target genes that were not corroborated by one of the two methods were discarded.

Samples were randomly multiplexed over 3 flowcell lanes for sequencing. Sequencing of small RNA libraries yielded more than 450 million raw sequence reads from mammary epithelial cells. Following a pipeline of adaptor removal, quality filtering and the removal of sequences that were too short, more than 213 million reads were retained for further analysis (78,604,161 and 134,850,887 for control and infected replicates, respectively).

expression of bovine miRNAs at multiple time-points in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMEs) infected <italic>in vitro</italic> with <italic>S. uberis</italic>, a causative agent of bovine mastitis. In comparison to previous NGS studies investigating the host miRNA response to infection, we have sequenced un-pooled miRNA libraries to a previously unprecedented sequencing depth from multiple replicates and controls across multiple time-points, allowing us to explore statistically significant temporal changes in miRNA expression in response to infection. Analysing over 450 million sequencing reads, we found that approximately 20% of known bovine miRNAs are expressed in BMEs. A similar diversity of miRNA expression has also been recently reported in other tissues, including bovine retinal microvascular endothelial cells (RMECs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-GuduricFuchs1">[20]</xref> and in testicular and ovarian tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Huang1">[18]</xref>. As has also been reported in other studies, there is a significant dynamic range in the expression of known miRNAs in BMEs. A few miRNAs are expressed at very high levels, with the majority being expressed at low levels. The top 10 most highly expressed miRNAs account for &#x0003e;80% of all aligned reads and are highly conserved across species. Whether or not the other more lowly expressed miRNAs play a significant biological role remains an open question.</p><p>We have also found that the expression of isomiRs was common for many of the BME expressed miRNAs. Most significantly, in 40% of cases, at least one isomiR was more highly expressed than the miRbase consensus sequence, indicating that studies such as ours can also be used to improve miRNA annotation. In particular, changes to the 5&#x02032; of the consensus sequence could lead to dramatically different target genes being computationally predicted. We identified a large number of 5&#x02032; isomiRs although they were mostly expressed at low levels.</p><p>In addition to profiling known miRNAs, we have also analysed the sequencing data to identify potentially novel bovine miRNAs. Twenty-one high-confidence, putatively novel, bovine miRNAs were identified independently across multiple different samples. The mature sequences of two of the novel miRNAs were 100% identical to known miRNAs in other species. Seven of the other predicted miRNAs exhibited significant homology to two bovine miRNA families, bta-mir-2284 and bta-mir-2285.</p><p>Few studies have previously investigated temporal changes in global miRNA expression using an NGS approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Cui1">[57]</xref>, although several have used microarray technology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Mukhopadhyay1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Reinsbach1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Li1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Wang1">[61]</xref>. Thus far, many immune-relevant miRNAs have been identified as part of the host response to LPS stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Qi1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-ONeill1">[48]</xref>. We completed a literature survey and identified more than 145 miRNAs across multiple different species and tissues that have been shown to be LPS responsive. In our study, the miRNA response to the Gram-positive <italic>S. uberis</italic> was markedly different to the reported LPS miRNA response. Over the 6 hour time-course, we identified 21 known bovine miRNAs as significantly differentially expressed in response to the <italic>S. uberis</italic> challenge. Only 9 of these miRNAs have also been reported to be differentially expressed in response to LPS. For those in common, an inverse pattern of expression was observed in 5 of the 9 cases suggesting that the miRNA response to Gram-positive bacteria may be markedly different to Gram-negative. Further global studies of the miRNA response to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in the same tissue at the same time-points will be required to confirm this.</p><p>It is notable that we found most miRNAs were differentially expressed at different time-points post-infection, suggesting that miRNAs exhibit rapid dynamics in their temporal expression. It is also notable that the majority of miRNAs that we report as being differentially expressed exhibit relatively subtle changes in gene expression in response to infection. This subtle change in expression is in line with existing literature and strengthens the hypothesis that miRNAs are fine-tuners of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-ONeill1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Bartel1">[62]</xref>. For example, miR-let-7d, miR-652 and miR-494 demonstrated similar levels of differential expression 6 hours post LTA stimulation in mouse tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Hsieh1">[50]</xref>.</p><p>Computational analysis revealed that the predicted target genes of <italic>S. uberis</italic> down-regulated miRNAs were statistically enriched for roles in innate immunity. This would suggest that these miRNAs may significantly regulate the sentinel capacity of mammary epithelial cells to mobilise the innate immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Swamy1">[63]</xref>. Pathway analysis of the predicted targets of up-regulated miRNAs has also identified the statistical over-representation of several pathways previously implicated in the host response to mastitis, such as the MAPK, JAK-STAT and other cytokine signaling pathways. Furthermore, several of the differentially expressed miRNAs have been shown to have roles in the immune systems of other species. For example, bta-let-7 miRNAs were up-regulated at both 4 and 6 hours post-infection with <italic>S. uberis</italic>. The let-7 family has been extensively described in the literature for having a role in immunity. The down-regulation of let-7 family members, for example, was shown to promote expression of IL-10 and IL-6 in HeLa cells infected with <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Schulte1">[64]</xref>. The observed up-regulation of let-7 miRNAs in our study may lead to the repression of anti-inflammatory cytokines to promote innate immunity.</p><p>We also report the down-regulation of two other miRNAs, bta-miR-29b-2 and bta-miR-130a, both of which have known roles in immunity and infection in other species. miR-29a/miR-29b down-regulation has been demonstrated to facilitate IFN-&#x003b3; up-regulation in NK cells and T<sub>H</sub>1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Ma1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Smith1">[66]</xref>. IFN- &#x003b3; is well known as an innate inflammatory mediator and its secretion promotes host resistance against viral and intracellular bacteria. Furthermore, IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA expression has been demonstrated in human mammary epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-KhalkhaliEllis1">[67]</xref>, suggesting that this may be a relevant target in our model. LPS induced TNF-&#x003b1; expression in neonatal and adult monocytes has been shown to be greatly suppressed by the induction of miR-130a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0057543-Huang2">[68]</xref>. Taken together, the evidence strongly suggests that the differentially expressed miRNAs identified in this study are likely central regulators of the innate immune response to <italic>S. uberis</italic> and thus represent potential therapeutic targets or novel biomarkers of infection and inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0057543.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Read coverage along chromosome 26 (25 nt windows).</bold> The higher the read density the darker the red colour.
