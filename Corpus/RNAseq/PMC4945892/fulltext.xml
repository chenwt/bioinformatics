Laboratory-based studies, because they poorly simulate true environmental heterogeneity, may misestimate or totally miss the influence of certain host genes on the microbiome. Here we report a large-scale field experiment to disentangle the effects of genotype, environment, age and year of harvest on bacterial communities associated with leaves and roots of <italic>Boechera stricta</italic> (Brassicaceae), a perennial wild mustard. Host genetic control of the microbiome is evident in leaves but not roots, and varies substantially among sites. Microbiome composition also shifts as plants age. Furthermore, a large proportion of leaf bacterial groups are shared with roots, suggesting inoculation from soil. Our results demonstrate how genotype-by-environment interactions contribute to the complexity of microbiome assembly in natural environments.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

As a result, laboratory-based studies may overestimate the influence of certain plant genes on the microbiome composition in natural environments, while simultaneously failing to identify important loci with context-dependent functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Even in complex natural environments, the same problem arises when microbiomes are studied only within one field site or 1 year<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In agroecosystems and wild habitats, biotic and abiotic influences that could overwhelm, amplify, or mask the effects of host genes often vary between locations and years, resulting in context-dependent expression of genetic variation for functional traits that could shape the microbiome. For instance, quantitative trait locus mapping of field-grown maize exposed to low and high levels of ultraviolet-B radiation revealed multiple loci that controlled bacterial epiphyte diversity only under high ultraviolet-B, in addition to several loci with environment-independent (constitutive) effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Such targeted experiments are useful for studying the genes underlying microbiome responses to specific environmental stimuli. However, genetic variation for plastic responses to the suite of environmental factors that differentiate natural environments and agroecosystems should also be assessed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p><p>Another understudied potential source of microbiome variation is host age, which can affect expression of plant functional traits that influence the microbiome (for example, defensive chemistry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Previous studies reported strong changes in phyllosphere (above ground) microbial communities over the course of a growing season<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. For annuals, these patterns describe the microbiome throughout the life of the plant; but for perennials each growing season represents only a fraction of the plant's lifetime. Longer-term studies of trees have reported phyllosphere changes between years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, but could not separate effects of plant age from interannual variation. A more targeted experimental design is needed to learn how plant-associated microbial communities are maintained in aging perennial plants in the face of temporal variation.</p><p>We conducted a multi-year, large-scale field experiment using the short-lived perennial mustard <italic>Boechera stricta</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> to disentangle the effects of genes, environment, and host age on plant-associated microbial communities. Because <italic>B. stricta</italic> is naturally inbreeding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, siblings produced by self-fertilization of wild accessions are nearly clonal, enabling replication of genotypes across multiple environments. The species has wide genetic diversity, and accessions from distinct populations are often highly divergent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Many <italic>B. stricta</italic> populations and habitats are largely undisturbed throughout the species' range in western North America, allowing study of the plants in environments where they, and their associated microbes, have been evolving for thousands of years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p><p>We focus on the following questions: first, how do bacterial communities change over the lifetimes of perennial plants? Second, how much do plant genotype and interactions of plant genotype with the local environment contribute to microbiome variation? Third, do above- and below-ground organs show similar patterns of genetic control over their resident bacterial communities? Here we show that root microbiomes change as plants age from 2 to 4 years old; the host genotype effect on the phyllosphere microbiome is environment-dependent; and despite strong overlap in community membership, leaf and root microbiomes are shaped by different sources of variation.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Leaves and roots harbour distinct microbiomes</title><p>We transplanted replicates of 48 <italic>B. stricta</italic> lineages (descended from accessions from five natural populations) into five common gardens in the native range in central Idaho, USA (Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Replicated, randomized experimental blocks within field sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and independent lines within genotypes allowed us to assess multiple scales of environmental and genetic variation, respectively, using nested random effects in our statistical models. Identical cohorts were planted in 2008 and 2009; representative subsets of the surviving plants were destructively harvested in 2011 and 2012 for root and leaf samples from hosts aged 2, 3 or 4 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). This temporally staggered experimental design allowed us to test the effect of plant age while controlling for variation between years. We used several methods for statistical support: linear mixed models (LMMs) to predict &#x003b1;-diversity (within-sample diversity) and independent components of &#x003b2;-diversity (between-sample diversity) while accounting for our hierarchical experimental design; and negative binomial models (NBMs) to test for enrichment/depletion of individual bacterial taxa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Our variance-partitioning model tests for effects of host age, host genotype and year on microbiome communities, while age-by-site, genotype-by-site and year-by-site interaction terms describe how the distinct bacterial communities at different common gardens respond differently to each of these factors.</p><p>Poor survival in two sites (&#x02018;Mil' and &#x02018;Par', probably due to drought and erosion, respectively) unbalanced the experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>); therefore, we only analysed the data from the remaining three sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We quantified bacterial communities in 21 bulk soil, 306 whole-leaf and 310 whole-root samples of <italic>B. stricta</italic> by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene (Methods). Previous analyses showed that these bulk soil communities differed among field sites but not between years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Each leaf sample comprised both epiphyte and endophyte DNA, and each water-washed root sample comprised both rhizoplane (root surface) and endophyte DNA. These 616 samples represented 440 individual plants across three common gardens (sites), 36 experimental blocks (12 nested within each site), five genotypes (each encompassing 8&#x02013;10 genetic lines, to represent additional variation within each genotype), 2 years of observation and three age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). The final data set included 27,763&#x000b1;15,790 observations per sample (mean&#x000b1;1 s.d.), comprising 3,718 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) after we removed contaminants and non-reproducible OTUs (see Methods)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and corrected counts for 16S rRNA gene copy number variation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Distributions of OTU counts were highly positive skewed, especially in leaves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), where one OTU (<italic>Sphingomonas sp.</italic>) accounted for 36&#x00025; of all observations. Both leaf and root communities consisted largely of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>), but were distinguished from each other and from bulk soil by their most common families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 2&#x02013;4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Habitat and year strongly influenced microbiomes</title><p>The three undisturbed <italic>B. stricta</italic> habitats that we used as field sites (Jackass Meadow, abbreviated &#x02018;Jam' in the figures; Mahogany Valley [Mah]; and Silver Creek [Sil]) were separated by 26&#x02013;92&#x02009;km, ranged in elevation from 1,812&#x02009;m (Silver Creek) to 2,676&#x02009;m (Jackass Meadow), and varied in moisture, temperature, plant diversity and soil nutrition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Previous work showed that soils from these sites harbour distinct bacterial communities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>; our experiment confirmed that bacterial communities inhabiting <italic>B. stricta</italic> leaves and roots also distinguish these habitats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>We found that &#x003b1;-diversity differed among sites, and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of weighted UniFrac distances<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> demonstrated that field site also was the primary source of &#x003b2;-diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">2</xref>). In both organs, the primary axis of variation distinguished the Jackass Meadow microbiota from the other sites, while the secondary axis of variation separated Mahogany Valley from Silver Creek, particularly in roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This pattern was clear in the ordination of unweighted UniFrac distances as well, suggesting that the large number of rare OTUs also contributed to differences among habitats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>We also modelled the three major PCoA axes separately using analysis of variance (ANOVA) of LMMs, because PCoA axes represent components of variation that vary independently of each other and may be shaped by different sets of explanatory factors. The top three axes of the weighted UniFrac PCoA represented 56&#x00025; of all variation in roots, and 63&#x00025; in leaves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Field site predicted all major axes of variation in both leaves and roots (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Bacterial communities were similar at the metre scale (among blocks within sites; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">2</xref>), except perhaps in the presence of rare root OTUs, as suggested by unweighted UniFrac analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p><p>We next investigated abundance patterns of individual OTUs, families, orders, classes and phyla. Unlike &#x003b1;-diversity and &#x003b2;-diversity metrics, which are continuous and approximately normal variables that can be modelled using LMMs, individual taxon abundances are discrete count data resembling a Poisson or negative binomial distribution. Therefore, we assessed taxon enrichment/depletion using NBMs of untransformed counts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. For these analyses, we considered only OTUs whose total abundances were at least 10&#x00025; of the mean OTU abundance, which accounted for &#x0003e;98&#x00025; of all observations. Although most OTUs were present at all sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>), they were not equally abundant at all sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Enrichments and depletions of taxa between pairs of sites were very common and relatively strong: the median statistically significant fold change for an OTU between two sites (averaged across all genotypes, age groups and years) was 5.9 in leaves and 3.0 in roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p>Bacterial microbiomes also varied between years. These temporal changes are not confounded with interannual differences in greenhouse conditions while seedlings were maturing, because individuals from both planting years were represented in each year of harvest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). &#x003b1;-Diversity increased between 2011 and 2012 in both organs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>), although in roots this pattern was significantly diminished at one site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Year of harvest also contributed to PCoA separation of both leaf and root communities, indicating temporal changes in relative abundance of OTUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>); however, this effect was minor compared with the differences between sites. Many taxa shifted in abundance between years in both organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Although fairly common, these temporal changes were weaker than changes attributable to other sources of variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Bacterial communities of bulk soil samples did not differ significantly between years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, suggesting that the observed change in root communities may be driven by plant responses to other temporally varying environmental factors such as precipitation or temperature.</p><p>Together, these results demonstrate that in nature, both leaf and root microbiomes vary profoundly among sites and between years. This pattern was consistent from individual OTUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) to community-level measures of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; diversities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">2</xref>). Dissimilarity of plant microbiomes among habitats is a very common observation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, although not universal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Such strong site effects likely reflect the influence of distinct soil pH and nutrient profiles on local bacterial communities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), or other environmental factors such as water availability, temperature and ultraviolet radiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. In addition to these likely biogeographic explanations, environmental heterogeneity could have affected leaf and root communities indirectly by causing plasticity of plant functional traits that underlie the microbiome. For instance, drought stress can alter cuticle thickness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, which in turn may affect microbial colonization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Similarly, in our experiment, environmental differences among sites altered root glucosinolate defensive chemistry, which may affect root-associated bacteria (although bacteria themselves are part of a plant's environment and may have contributed to this phenotypic plasticity; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Therefore, variation in microbiomes of plants growing in multiple wild soils brought into the laboratory may not fully represent the variation that would be observed among the same plants growing in those soils in their natural settings.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Bacterial communities changed as host plants aged</title><p>Our temporally staggered planting and harvesting design allowed us to test for effects of plant age after controlling for year-to-year changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Because we germinated these plants in the greenhouse and then transferred them into common gardens as juveniles, plant age was confounded with microbial succession after a major habitat shift. This mostly affected roots, which received an initial microbial inoculum from the potting soil before exposure to natural soil communities. In contrast, the juvenile leaves that formed in the greenhouse fell off during the winter immediately following the autumn transplant, and were replaced by new spring growth. Furthermore, over the lifetime of the plant, these rosette leaves either senesced during the summer (to be regrown from the live root the following spring) or persisted between years. Therefore, our age measurement represents the plant as a whole, but not necessarily the sampled leaves themselves. In contrast, root samples generally comprised whole perennial root systems, with fractions of tissue ranging in age from new growth, to the same age as the plant, or even dead. Thus, systematic changes in the age distribution of root sub-sections are one possible mechanism for an effect of plant age on the root system as a whole.</p><p>To help distinguish true effects of host age from signals of post-transplant succession, we also sampled bulk soils and endogenous <italic>B. stricta</italic> plants (of unknown age) from natural populations in the vicinity of all five sites, resulting in 30 soil, 30 leaf and 23 root samples that had never been exposed to the greenhouse. Only 29 OTUs (of 3,718 total), with a combined relative abundance of 0.11&#x00025; in all root samples, were present in our experimental plants but absent from these endogenous plants and wild soils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>). We removed these 29 &#x02018;unnatural' OTUs (which were otherwise unremarkable; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>) from the data set before analysis. However, because several distinct bacterial strains may be lumped into a single OTU<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, organisms persisting from the greenhouse might still be counted as &#x02018;natural' OTUs that also were observed in the endogenous plants. Indeed, 84.5&#x00025; of OTUs from endogenous plants and wild soils were also found in samples from the greenhouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). Limited resolution of intra-OTU variation is an inherent drawback of 16S rDNA profiling. Therefore, the transplants' similarity to endogenous plants, their dissimilarity to greenhouse controls and their strong microbiome divergence between field sites despite their origin in a common potting soil&#x02014;not the presence/absence of particular OTUs&#x02014;provide the best evidence that wild bacteria had largely replaced the initial greenhouse inoculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). The bulk of the evidence suggests that microbiomes of our experimental plants were much more wild than not, and that host age effects can be partially, but not entirely, explained by the attrition of potting-soil bacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 10&#x02013;11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). Thus, we infer that the initial potting-soil inoculum reached equilibrium with surrounding soil within 2 years of transplant, and the plants continued to fine-tune their root microbiota for another 1&#x02013;2 years.</p><p>Leaf communities remained largely stable as host plants aged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a&#x02013;c</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">2</xref>), although age-by-site interactions affected abundance of multiple taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). For instance, plant aging affected abundance of leaf-associated Actinobacteria, Armatimonadetes and Verrucomicrobia differently at various sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Root &#x003b1;-diversity declined monotonically with plant age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Age also shaped root &#x003b2;-diversity: root communities of older plants were more similar to those of endogenous plants, probably representing the replacement of potting-soil microbes by natural ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This replacement process, along with true effects of plant age, impacted most bacterial taxa&#x02014;including the phyla Acidobacteria, Armatimonadetes, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes, Planctomycetes and Proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the microbiome of this perennial plant changed in both richness and composition over the host's lifetime. Although all plants were exposed to a common soil community as seedlings, within 2 years they had largely replaced those bacteria with the local endogenous communities of their respective field sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Root-associated communities continued to develop for years following this initial differentiation, and abundance of many leaf-associated taxa changed with host age as well, indicating that microbiome changes accompany the aging process even in perennials that are neither juvenile nor senescent.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Host genotype shaped leaf but not root microbiomes</title><p>The five <italic>B. stricta</italic> genotypes used in this experiment originated from populations endemic to the three field sites analysed in this study, plus two other populations in the region corresponding to sites where high mortality prevented analysis of experimental transplants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

In contrast, plant genotype did not predict Shannon diversity, suggesting that rarer taxa (which are downweighted in Shannon diversity scores) may be more sensitive to host genotype than are common taxa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). These rarer leaf taxa included Acidobacteria, Armatimonadetes, Verrucomicrobia and Gemmatimonadetes, plus several classes, orders, families and OTUs within thirteen diverse phyla that were differentially abundant among plant genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figs 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). These changes in leaf OTU abundance caused by host genotype were not as strong as those caused by site: the median size of a statistically significant genotype effect was a 3.2-fold change, compared with 5.9-fold change between sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p>Although the leaf taxa identified by NBMs as differentially abundant between plant genotypes represented only a modest proportion of the community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), host genotype also affected the weighted UniFrac metric of &#x003b2;-diversity, which de-emphasizes rare taxa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Even if enrichment of a particular common taxon is too subtle to be detected by individual regression, coordinated responses of multiple common taxa in response to the same source of variation may affect weighted UniFrac distances between these samples. Thus, host genotype influenced both common and rare leaf taxa, based on the complementary approaches of weighted UniFrac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>), NBMs of individual counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), and unweighted UniFrac (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Nonetheless, the plant genotype effect averaged across sites was relatively weak. In addition, fine-scale plant genetic variation (lines within genotypes) did not predict any metric of &#x003b1;-diversity or &#x003b2;-diversity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>), indicating that genetic variation for the leaf microbiome primarily exists between genotypes from different populations of <italic>B. stricta</italic>, rather than between lines within populations. This corresponds with population genetic analyses in this species, where most genetic variation is found between populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p><p>In contrast, plant genotype had a much weaker influence on root-associated bacterial communities. Host genotype did not predict any summary metrics of root &#x003b1;-diversity or &#x003b2;-diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">2</xref>). Plant genotype affected abundance of root-associated bacterial taxa including 240 OTUs representing 10 different phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>); however, these were rare taxa that together contributed only a small portion of the community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Host genotype effects were less common in roots than leaves, and generally weaker; the median statistically significant OTU differential abundance between host genotypes was a 2.1-fold change, compared with 3.2-fold in leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figs 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3b</xref>).</p><p>In summary, averaged across all sites, plant genotypes differed in richness and composition of their leaf microbiota but genetic control of root communities was much weaker.

In both organs, host genetic control was weak compared to the variation contributed by differences among sites. Within-site heritability, however, was slightly higher than experiment-wide heritability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>), similar to the pattern seen in maize rhizosphere communities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The genetic and phenotypic differences between these <italic>B. stricta</italic> genotypes are not yet well characterized; however, they at least vary in glucosinolate content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>), offering one plausible mechanism for the observed plant genetic variation in microbiome composition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Further investigation of variation in host genotypes and phenotypes will be necessary to fully understand the functional basis of host microbiome control. Our results provide another<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> example of intraspecific plant genetic variation for associated microbiota, although other studies have found little genotype effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The strongest genetic effects on microbes were site-specific</title><p>The genotype-by-site interaction term in our statistical models allowed us to describe how the genetic variation among our inbred plant genotypes mapped to the microbiome &#x02018;phenotype' differently in each habitat<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. These site-specific host genetic effects shaped the bacterial communities much more strongly than constitutive plant genetic variation averaged across all sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). In leaves, host genotype-by-site interactions predicted the primary weighted UniFrac PCoA axis, indicating a strong, site-specific contribution of host genetic variation to &#x003b2;-diversity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Host genotype-by-site interactions predicted the abundance of Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria as well as multiple lower-level taxa including the Pseudomonadaceae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Although host genotype-by-site interactions predicted abundance of only a modest proportion of individual taxa, their effects were stronger than any other source of variation: the median change in leaf-associated OTU abundance due to a site-specific host genotype difference was 15.5-fold, compared with 3.2-fold for a host genotype effect averaged across sites, or the median 5.9-fold difference between pairs of sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Furthermore, PCoA revealed that host genotypes separated more widely when interacting with site than when averaged across sites (compare PCo1 magnitude in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figs 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5c</xref>). This strong host genotype-by-site interaction controlling weighted UniFrac distances between communities suggests that in addition to detectable effects on (mostly rare) individual taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), site-specific host genetic variation also drives coordinated shifts in groups of common bacteria that together contribute to major principal coordinates of &#x003b2;-diversity.</p><p>In roots, host genotype-by-site interactions (like the main genotype effect) had little influence over community-level metrics of &#x003b1;-diversity or &#x003b2;-diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). A minority of root-associated taxa, including Burkholderiaceae, were affected by site-specific host genetic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). As in leaves, these genotype-by-site interactions were also stronger than the site-independent genotype and site effects, with median changes in OTU abundance of 7.3-fold, 2.1-fold and 3.0-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggested that the influence of plant genetic variation on bacterial communities was amplified at Jackass Meadow compared with the other sites. LMMs of weighted UniFrac PCoA axes revealed that even after controlling for the site-independent plant genotype effect and other predictors, leaf communities showed elevated divergence among plant genotypes at Jackass Meadow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Furthermore, broad-sense heritability of individual OTUs across diverse bacterial phyla&#x02014;in both leaves and roots&#x02014;was greater at Jackass Meadow than at the other sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Finally, in both organs, more OTUs were sensitive to host genotype at Jackass Meadow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). This pattern could indicate that Jackass Meadow is a more homogeneous or less stressful environment than the other sites, thus decreasing the proportion of phenotypic variance attributable to environmental causes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. However, spatial variation in soil properties was not markedly less at Jackass Meadow than at the other sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>; although note that because these data are from a single year they are not informative regarding temporal environmental stability, and furthermore many unmeasured environmental characters also distinguish these complex habitats). Alternatively, stronger influence of genetic variation might be expected if Jackass Meadow were &#x02018;more' stressful than the other sites, because slightly deleterious genetic variation that is only expressed under unusual conditions may not have been previously available for purifying selection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. This explanation has somewhat better support, because environmental characteristics of Jackass Meadow diverge from the other sites along the major axis of variation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Furthermore, we observed rust infections of <italic>B. stricta</italic> exclusively at Jackass Meadow throughout the duration of this experiment (M.R.W. and T. M.-O., pers. obs.); genetic variation for fungal pathogen resistance could have pleiotropic effects on the bacterial microbiome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Finally, polymorphism in genes that control trait plasticity in response to specific environmental stimuli can cause context-dependent patterns of genetic variation that are difficult to predict<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Despite the generally weak signal of host genotype on root communities in our study, the pattern of increased genetic effects at Jackass Meadow was salient in both roots and leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>), raising the possibility that microbiomes in both organs may be influenced by host genetic variation with site-specific penetrance.</p><p>Overall, our results show that environmental variation can alter the effect of plant genotype on the associated microbiota&#x02014;host genetic variation underlying the microbiome is expressed differently in different sites. Host genotype-by-environment interactions have been shown to influence maize rhizosphere communities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>; our study confirms that they also affect plant microbiomes in unmanaged natural habitats. One explanation is that host genetic variants could affect only certain groups of microbes, which may be present in differing quantities among the ambient communities in plant habitats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Another possible explanation is that plant genotypes differ in the extent of phenotypic plasticity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, resulting in site-specific patterns of host genetic variation in plant traits that in turn affect plant-associated microbial communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). To fully understand the genetic basis of plant control of the microbiome, it will be necessary to conduct genome-wide association studies and mutant experiments not only using diverse microbial inocula, but also under various realistic conditions such as drought stress and nutrient limitation. This is important for efforts to understand the evolution of plant&#x02013;microbe interactions and to breed plants that form beneficial microbial associations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The complication of genotype&#x02013;environment interactions has long been recognized in both natural evolution and breeding programs for other agriculturally important traits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, and the microbiome appears to be no exception.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Leaf and root microbiomes share many bacterial OTUs</title><p>After removing extremely rare OTUs from the data set (see Methods), only seven OTUs were exclusively observed in leaves, and only 73 OTUs were exclusively observed in roots. These &#x02018;organ-specific' OTUs were rarer than average, representing only 0.0006&#x00025; and 0.3&#x00025; of the leaf and root communities, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). To more stringently assess the degree of overlap between aboveground and belowground communities, we focused on the set of plants for which we had data from matched leaves and roots (<italic>N</italic>=237 plants) and reanalysed the raw reads to form OTUs based on a 99&#x00025; sequence similarity threshold. On average, 74&#x00025; (&#x000b1;14&#x00025; s.d.) of all leaf-inhabiting OTUs (weighted by relative abundance) were also present in the root of the same plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). Furthermore, 93&#x00025; of the OTUs that were present in both organs were also present in bulk soil&#x02014;likely an underestimate due to our small number of bulk soil samples (<italic>N</italic>=30). This suggests that many <italic>B. stricta</italic> leaf epiphytes and endophytes may be derived from the soil. This sharing of OTUs between leaves and soil/roots may be a feature of low-growing plants (ours were usually 1&#x02013;5&#x02009;cm tall) which may be exposed to soil regularly through wind, rain splashes and crawling insects. This explanation is consistent with substantial inferred aboveground-belowground microbial overlap in grapes and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, and minimal overlap reported for tropical trees<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Leaves at Jackass Meadow harboured a higher proportion of phyla that were much more common in root samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>)&#x02014;this may have been caused by drier, dustier, windier conditions at that high-elevation site resulting in soil deposition on leaves.</p><p>The set of shared OTUs represented a much smaller proportion of the more diverse root community. On average, 30.4&#x00025; (&#x000b1;14&#x00025; s.d.) of root OTUs were also observed in leaves of the same plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). Although 50.3&#x00025; of shared OTUs were rarer in leaves than roots on average, many persisted aboveground at high or medium relative abundance, suggesting that bacterial taxa from across the relative abundance spectrum in roots are also capable of colonizing leaves and flourishing in the phyllosphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>). Shared OTU relative abundances in the two organs were positively, but weakly, correlated (analysis of covariance, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;3e&#x02212;16, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x0003c;0.004; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>). Together, these data suggest that leaves and roots harbour different but overlapping subsets of bacterial taxa, but relative abundances in the root are not good predictors of relative abundances of those shared taxa in the leaf. This is consistent with recent reports that bacteria isolated from roots of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> can colonize leaves (and vice versa), although strains are generally better adapted to one organ or the other<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Nevertheless, because any OTU may represent multiple functionally distinct bacterial strains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, our study may overestimate the effective overlap of leaf and root microbiomes in <italic>B. stricta</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study demonstrates that several sources of variation interact in complex ways to form and maintain the plant microbiome in a short-lived perennial in its native habitat.

The distinct microbial communities in different habitats can exhibit distinct responses to host genotype, host age and year-to-year variation. Our study illustrates the importance of replicating microbiome experiments across sites and timepoints, in order to reveal genotype-by-environment interactions that are potentially even more profound than environment-independent effects of host genetic variation. This approach, although laborious and challenging, may improve our ability to find genes controlling microbiome variation, and simultaneously increase our confidence that those genes are actually important in realistic environments. Such genotype&#x02013;environment interactions observed between natural habitats or agroecosystems represent the cumulative influence of a potentially huge number of environmental factors.

At the Jackass Meadow (Jam), Mahogany Valley (Mah), and Silver Creek (Sil) sites, one individual per genotype was haphazardly selected from each experimental block in each year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In some cases, plants were too small to provide sufficient tissue from both organs, and so two different plants of the same genotype in the same block were sampled&#x02014;thus, the final data set contained only 237 individuals with both leaf and root microbiome data, despite having 322 leaf and 320 root samples in total. For the same reason, samples are not perfectly distributed among blocks but blocks were sampled as evenly as possible. Leaves were collected with flame-sterilized forceps directly into autoclaved Eppendorf tubes and frozen immediately on dry ice. Roots were collected with flame-sterilized forceps into autoclaved conical 15&#x02009;ml Falcon tubes on wet ice and brought back to base camp in Salmon, ID, USA, where they were rinsed and cleaned of all visible soil using distilled water and flame-sterilized utensils, and finally packed into clean autoclaved Eppendorf tubes and frozen on dry ice. We removed rhizosphere soil from roots but did not separate the epiphytic and endophytic components of either leaf or root samples; thus, DNA was extracted from microbes both on and inside leaves and roots.

PCR amplifications (performed in triplicate for each sample) consisted of a 3&#x02009;min denaturation at 94&#x02009;&#x000b0;C; 30 cycles of 45&#x02009;s at 94&#x000b0;C, 60&#x02009;s at 50&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 90&#x02009;s at 72&#x02009;&#x000b0;C; and 10&#x02009;min at 72&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Samples were cleaned using AmPureXP magnetic beads (Agencourt, Beverly, MA, USA), pooled in equimolar concentrations and sequenced at 96-plex at the Joint Genome Institute (Walnut Creek, CA, USA) using 2 &#x000d7; 250&#x02009;bp MiSeq v2 sequencing (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), resulting in 75,270&#x000b1;39,601 high-quality reads per sample (mean&#x000b1;1 s.d.). After trimming primer sequences, the amplicon sequences were processed using FLASH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref> and UPARSE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref> software. Sequences were grouped into OTUs based on 97&#x00025; or greater identity, and assigned taxonomy by comparison to the Greengenes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref> database (May 2013 version) using the QIIME implementation of the RDP classifier<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. OTU representative sequences were aligned and filtered using QIIME 1.7.0, and a rooted phylogenetic tree was generated using the midpoint method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. OTUs with no kingdom-level classification or matching chloroplast, mitochondrial or Viridiplantae sequences were then removed from the data set. At this point, we omitted low-coverage samples (&#x0003c;800 usable reads) from the data set, resulting in 322 leaf and 320 root samples proceeding to downstream analysis. This data set included 16 leaf and 10 root samples from endogenous control plants, which were used for UniFrac calculations and PCoA (below) but then excluded from analyses of experimental factors. As a final filter, OTUs were classified as &#x02018;non-reproducible' and removed from the data set unless they were observed at least 25 times in at least five samples<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. A total of 3,718 reproducible, measurable OTUs comprised the final data set. Finally, the raw counts of each OTU were divided by estimated 16S gene copy number<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> and then rounded up to integer values before all downstream analysis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We analysed all the data and made all figures in R version 3.2.3 using the Phyloseq and ggplot2 packages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>.

We analysed the leaf and root data separately except when directly comparing the two organs within a single plant (see below). We controlled for technical noise (variation attributable to sequencing depth or batch effects) by including MiSeq run as a random effect and total number of observations as a covariate in statistical models.

To assess overlap between leaf and root communities we restricted analysis to the subset of plants for which we had both leaf and root data (<italic>N</italic>=237). Because these analyses only compared within-plant leaf and root communities and therefore did not require a balanced experimental design, we included endogenous and experimental plants from all five field sites, including those where low survival prohibited other statistical analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). For each of these plants, we determined the &#x02018;shared set' of OTUs that were observed in both the leaf and the corresponding root. We recorded the relative abundance of each of these OTUs separately in the leaf and root, generating a large table in which each OTU was represented once for each plant in which it was found (that is, up to 237 times) by paired leaf and root relative abundances. We applied a LMM to these paired data to test for a correlation between relative abundance in the two organs: ln(relative abundance in the leaf)=ln(relative abundance in the root)&#x0002b;OTU_ID&#x0002b;Plant_ID, where OTU_ID and Plant_ID were categorical random variables that allowed the intercept to vary for each OTU and each plant.</p><p>We then asked what proportion of the leaf microbiome was shared with the root microbiome, and vice versa. For each plant, we summed the relative abundances of the OTUs in that plant's &#x02018;shared set' for each leaf sample; then, we did the same for each plant's corresponding root sample. To summarize the experiment-wide overlap between leaf and root OTUs, we pooled the shared OTUs of all 237 plants and calculated the relative abundance of each in leaves and roots.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Microbiome data normalization</title><p>For downstream applications that assume homoscedasticity or can be influenced by unequal variances (PCoA and LMMs) we normalized OTU counts using the variance-stabilizing transformation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.

Lines were nested in Genotypes, and Blocks nested in Sites. The &#x02018;Total observations' covariate is the total number of usable (non-host) reads from each sample (after adjustment for copy number variation). We assessed statistical significance of fixed predictors using Type III ANOVA with Satterthwaite's approximation of denominator degrees of freedom in the package lmerTest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>, and of random effects using likelihood ratio tests. We used this model to predict community descriptors that were continuous and approximately normally distributed: both &#x003b1;-diversity metrics (Shannon entropy and Chao1 estimated richness, calculated using the Phyloseq package<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>) and &#x003b2;-diversity metrics (top three PCoA axes of weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance matrices, as described above).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Prediction of abundance of individual bacterial taxa</title><p>We also modelled abundance of individual OTUs, families, orders, classes and phyla. We excluded the rarest OTUs from these analyses, only analysing OTUs contributing at least 10&#x00025; of the mean OTU abundance; that is, we kept only leaf OTUs that were observed at least 169 times (10&#x00025; of 1,693, the mean leaf OTU count) and root OTUs that were observed at least 310 times (10&#x00025; of 3,109, the mean root OTU count). This process reduced the leaf data set to 1,016 OTUs and the root data set to 2,666 OTUs, but retained &#x0003e;98&#x00025; of all observations in both organs. For analyses of higher-level taxa, we condensed the &#x02018;unfiltered' set of OTUs (that is, before thresholding to remove &#x02018;non-reproducible' OTUs) into matrices of family, order, class and phylum counts using the tax_glom() function in the Phyloseq package<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>.

The NBMs included the fixed effects Site&#x0002b;Genotype&#x0002b;Age&#x0002b;Year. We asked whether each of these main effects predicted the abundance of each taxon by performing a likelihood ratio test comparing the deviance of this full model to the deviance of the reduced model, with one term excluded; for example, to test for any change in abundance attributed to Site, we compared the full model above to a reduced NBM with only the fixed effects Genotype&#x0002b;Age&#x0002b;Year. To ask whether the interaction of main effects with Site predicted taxon abundance, we used likelihood ratio tests to compare the deviance of a model including the interaction term to the deviance of the base model described above, with all main effects but no interaction. For example, to test for genotype-by-site interactions we compared the NBM with fixed effects Genotype&#x0002b;Site&#x0002b;Age&#x0002b;Year&#x0002b;Genotype &#x000d7; Site to the NBM with fixed effects Genotype&#x0002b;Site&#x0002b;Age&#x0002b;Year. <italic>P</italic> values resulting from these likelihood ratio tests were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg false discovery rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>.</p><p>To obtain estimates of effect sizes, for each taxon we estimated log<sub>2</sub> fold change between pairs of experimental groups (for example, between two field sites or two genotypes) and assessed statistical significance of each contrast using a Wald test at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 after correction for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg false discovery rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref> (for example, for the Site term, we tested differential abundance between a pair of field sites for all 1,016 leaf OTUs).
