Work in mice showed that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-2 (S1PR2), a G&#x003b1;12 and G&#x003b1;13 coupled receptor, promotes growth regulation and local confinement of GC B cells<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Recent GCB-DLBCL deep sequencing studies have revealed mutations in a large number of genes in this cancer, including in <italic>GNA13</italic> (encoding G&#x003b1;13) and <italic>S1PR2</italic><sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Here we show using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays that GCB-DLBCL associated mutations occurring in S1PR2 frequently disrupt the receptor's Akt and migration inhibitory functions. G&#x003b1;13-deficient mouse GC B cells and human GCB-DLBCL cells were unable to suppress pAkt and migration in response to S1P, and G&#x003b1;13-deficient mice developed GC B cell-derived lymphoma. GC B cells, unlike most lymphocytes, are tightly confined in lymphoid organs and do not recirculate. Remarkably, deficiency in G&#x003b1;13, but not S1PR2, led to GC B cell dissemination into lymph and blood. GCB-DLBCL cell lines frequently carried mutations in the G&#x003b1;13 effector <italic>ARHGEF1</italic>, and Arhgef1-deficiency also led to GC B cell dissemination. The incomplete phenocopy of G&#x003b1;13- and S1PR2-deficiency led us to discover that P2RY8, an orphan receptor that is mutated in GCB-DLBCL and another GC B cell-derived malignancy, Burkitt lymphoma (BL), also represses GC B cell growth and promotes confinement via G&#x003b1;13. These findings identify a G&#x003b1;13-dependent pathway that exerts dual actions in suppressing growth and blocking dissemination of GC B cells that is frequently disrupted in GC B cell-derived lymphoma.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">We sequenced the <italic>S1PR2</italic> coding region in 117 GCB-DLBCL, 31 BL and 68 activated B cell-like (ABC)-DLBCL samples. Twelve <italic>S1PR2</italic> coding mutations were identified in the GCB-DLBCL samples versus one in each of the BL and ABC-DLBCL cohorts (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>). The majority of GCB-DLBCL mutations were in conserved transmembrane (TM) residues (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) and all were predicted to be structurally damaging. Cell line transduction experiments showed that 5 of 8 tested mutations disrupted S1PR2 protein expression (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a-c</xref>).</p><p id="P3">These same mutations disrupted S1P-mediated inhibition of CXCL12-induced pAkt and migration (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c, d</xref>). One additional mutant, R147C, which was expressed at levels similar to wild-type (WT) (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>), showed a strongly reduced ability to support S1P-mediated inhibition of pAkt and migration (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c, d</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1d, e</xref>). These observations suggested that tumors harboring single mutant <italic>S1PR2</italic> alleles (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>) are often likely to be functionally heterozygous for <italic>S1PR2</italic>. Using a mixed BM chimera system in mice<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, <italic>S1pr2</italic> heterozygous B cells showed marked expansion in the GC relative to the follicular compartment in mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) and Peyer's patches (PPs) of unimmunized mice (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a, b</xref>). Over-expression of WT S1PR2 repressed the outgrowth of <italic>S1pr2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> GC B cells and this was also seen for mutant R329C, whereas the R147C mutation caused the receptor to lose GC growth suppressive activity (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 f</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3c, d</xref>). Based on molecular simulation analysis (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Text</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3e-g</xref>) we propose that the R147C S1PR2 mutant cannot attain the active conformation necessary for G-protein recruitment and signaling.</p><p id="P4">G&#x003b1;12 and G&#x003b1;13 often function redundantly in transmitting GPCR signals<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.

Mixed BM chimera analysis revealed that G&#x003b1;13-deficiency was sufficient to confer a GC B cell growth advantage in mLNs and to a lesser extent in PPs (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>). G&#x003b1;13-deficient mLN GC B cells showed increased pAkt relative to WT when incubated ex vivo with CXCL12 and S1P (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>). Deficiency in the G&#x003b1;13 effector, Arhgef1 (p115 RhoGEF or Lsc), led to a similar defect in the ability of S1P to repress chemokine induced pAkt (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>).</p><p id="P5">To determine whether loss of G&#x003b1;13 in B cells could promote lymphomagenesis, we allowed a cohort of <italic>Gna13</italic>-deficient mice to age. At one year, 10 of 18 <italic>Gna13-</italic>deficient mice showed a greater than 10-fold expansion of GC B cells compared to littermate controls (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j, k</xref>) and at least five of the outgrowths appeared clonal (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). Three of the <italic>Gna13-</italic>deficient animals showed massive mesenteric lymphadenopathy (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1l</xref> and not shown), with evidence in one case (#307) of spleen and PP involvement (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1l</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4c-e</xref>). Immunophenotyping of the G&#x003b1;13-deficient tumors confirmed they were of GC origin (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4f</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To test the conservation of the G&#x003b1;13-signaling pathway in human GC B cells, we performed gene rescue experiments in GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Sequencing of <italic>S1PR2</italic>, <italic>GNA13</italic> and <italic>ARHGEF1</italic> in a panel of GCB-DLBCL cell lines identified several with deleterious mutations in these genes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). The mutations in <italic>GNA13</italic> matched those previously described and were associated with reduced protein levels<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. <italic>ARHGEF1</italic> mutations have not previously been reported, likely because the large size (&#x0223c;24 kb) of this 27 exon gene and its multiple splice variants and low transcript abundance make sequence analysis difficult. Remarkably, 10 of 20 cell lines with analyzable <italic>ARHGEF1</italic> sequence showed mutations in this gene, several of which resulted in premature stop codons (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). Using retroviral transduction to restore gene expression, we established that loss of S1PR2, G&#x003b1;13 and ARHGEF1 were each sufficient to disrupt S1P-mediated suppression of pAKT and, in the case of cell lines that were migratory, to disrupt S1P-mediated inhibition of migration (See <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Text</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The mechanisms by which malignant GC B cells can exit the GC niche and lymphoid organ to spread amongst multiple LNs or to systemic sites such as BM have not been defined. Consistent with a lack of migration inhibition by S1P (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), mice lacking G&#x003b1;13 in B cells showed marked disruption of GC architecture in mLNs (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). In a mixed transfer system, G&#x003b1;13-deficient GC B cells were excluded from the interior of otherwise wild-type GCs (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref>). Remarkably, G&#x003b1;13-deficient GC B cells were readily detected in lymph and to a lesser extent in blood while WT GC B cells were absent from circulation (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). In mixed BM chimeras, G&#x003b1;13-deficient GC B cells were again detectable in the lymph, indicating that G&#x003b1;13 was needed intrinsically in GC B cells to inhibit egress (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Analysis of Arhgef1-deficient mice and chimeras revealed a similar disruption of mLN GC architecture (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6c</xref>) and GC B cell appearance in lymph and blood (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e, f</xref>). In contrast, S1PR2-deficient GC B cells were not significantly higher in lymph relative to littermate controls (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>). Analysis of mice expressing constitutively active myr-Akt or over-expressing BCL2 in B cells established that increased GC B cell survival was not sufficient to lead to dissemination (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Text</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P8"><italic>GNA13</italic> mutations and <italic>BCL2</italic> rearrangements and potentially activating mutations frequently occur together in GCB-DLBCL<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. GC B cells in mice with combined G&#x003b1;13-deficiency and BCL2 overexpression showed enhanced ex vivo survival (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>), increased numbers (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), wider dispersal throughout the follicle and interfollicular regions in mLNs (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7f</xref>) and 2-fold increased frequencies in lymph and blood (compare <xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), compared to cells in G&#x003b1;13-deficient mice</p><p id="P9">To examine requirements for GC B cell persistence after arriving at a distant site we bypassed the egress step and intravenously transferred mLN cells to congenically distinct recipients. Transferred WT GC B cells were essentially undetectable in recipient spleen and BM after six hours (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d, e</xref>) and G&#x003b1;13-deficiency alone was insufficient to cause a significant increase in their number (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Bcl2-overexpression alone caused an elevation in GC B cell frequency in recipient spleens but not BM (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Loss of G&#x003b1;13 combined with Bcl2-overexpression led to greater accumulation of transferred GC B cells in spleen and now led to an increase in their frequency in BM (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). This combinatorial effect likely reflects an ability of G&#x003b1;13-deficiency and BCL2-overexpression to cooperate in promoting survival of GC B cells outside the GC niche (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). To determine whether GC B cells could seed distant LNs after entry into lymphatics, we transferred mLN cells intraperitoneally. Small numbers of G&#x003b1;13-deficient, but not WT, GC B cells were detectable in the draining parathymic LNs after six hours (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). In this case, recovery of G&#x003b1;13-deficient GC B cells was not enhanced by the BCL2 transgene. BM involvement occurs in a fraction of GCB-DLBCL patients and is a predictor of worse disease<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. In some year old G&#x003b1;13-deficient mice showing mLN tumors, GC B cells could be detected in the BM (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g, h</xref>). Moreover, in aged <italic>BCL2</italic>-tg <italic>Gna13</italic> KO but not <italic>BCL2</italic>-tg <italic>Gna13</italic> WT mice, GC B cells were frequently found in the BM (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The more frequent mutations <italic>of GNA13</italic> than of <italic>S1PR2</italic> in both GCB-DLBCL and BL despite the similar size of their open reading frames, together with our finding of <italic>Gna13-</italic>deficient but not <italic>S1pr2</italic>-deficient mouse GC B cells in circulation (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c and g</xref>) led us to hypothesize that additional G&#x003b1;13 coupled GPCRs may be involved in GC B cell regulation. In this regard, <italic>P2YR8</italic>, a gene situated in the pseudoautosomal region of the X chromosome, was a target of mutations in published whole exome sequencing data of GCB-DLBCL and BL<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and was frequently mutated in our GCB-DLBCL and BL samples, with several of each lymphoma type carrying biallelic mutations (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). P2RY8 is an orphan receptor and has orthologs in many vertebrates, but unexpectedly it lacks an ortholog in mouse (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Like <italic>S1PR2</italic>, <italic>P2RY8</italic> was abundant in human GC B cells (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Five out of six tested mutations prevented surface P2RY8 expression (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8a, b</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Despite the lack of a mouse <italic>P2RY8</italic> ortholog, we considered the possibility that if the ligand were a small molecule it may be conserved and we therefore asked whether P2RY8 overexpression influenced GC B cell growth. Remarkably, human P2RY8 led to a suppressive effect on GC B cell growth in mouse PPs and mLNs, similar to the effect of S1PR2 overexpression (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8c</xref>).
