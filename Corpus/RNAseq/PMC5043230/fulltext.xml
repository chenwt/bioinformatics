In adulthood 45,X monosomy is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, although strikingly heterogeneous with some individuals left untouched while others suffer from cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease and infertility. The present study investigates the leukocyte DNAmethylation profile by using the 450K-Illumina Infinium assay and the leukocyte RNA-expression profile in 45,X monosomy compared with karyotypically normal female and male controls. We present results illustrating that genome wide X-chromosome RNA-expression profile, autosomal DNA-methylation profile, and the X-chromosome methylation profile clearly distinguish Turner syndrome from controls. Our results reveal genome wide hypomethylation with most differentially methylated positions showing a medium level of methylation. Contrary to previous studies, applying a single loci specific analysis at well-defined DNA loci, our results indicate that the hypomethylation extend to repetitive elements. We describe novel candidate genes that could be involved in comorbidity in TS and explain congenital urinary malformations (<italic>PRKX</italic>), premature ovarian failure (<italic>KDM6A</italic>), and aortic aneurysm formation (<italic>ZFYVE9</italic> and <italic>TIMP1</italic>).</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>45,X monosomy (Turner syndrome) is the only chromosome haploinsufficiency compatible with life. Nonetheless, it has detrimental effects on morbidity and mortality most strikingly affecting the 45,X fetus with less than 1% surviving pregnancy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Cardiovascular mortality is increased in Turner syndrome (TS) and includes increased risk of aortic dissection and coronary artery disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Moreover, autoantibodies are present in more than half of women with TS, and close to one-fifth harbor autoantibodies against more than one organ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. On the other hand, the burden of comorbidity is surprisingly diverse and is not readily explained by the prevailing theory of a &#x0201c;simple&#x0201d; gene dosage imbalance following loss of sex-chromosome material<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Identifying causal genes of Turner syndrome comorbidity is complicated since Turner syndrome is non-heritable, making familiar-genetic analysis non-applicable, and no good animal model is available.</p><p>Both functional disomy of constitutively mono-allelic expressed genes in TS individuals with mosaic ring X-chromosomes (chrX)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, as well as functional monosomy of constitutively bi-allelic expressed genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> have been linked to TS and morbidity, but results are equivocal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Another hypothesis suggests that loss of sex-chromosome material perturbs autosomal gene transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> warranting a genome wide view on gene expression in TS. Altered autosomal gene expression as well as chrX gene expression has been shown comparing females with an iso-chromosome (46,X,iX(q)) with females with TS (45,X monosomy) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, in addition to comparisons of TS with 46,XX on amniotic fluid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, human fibroblast cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, as well as induced pluripotent human cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Widening the scope, epigenetic alterations due to the lack of sex chromosomal material is of particular interest since epigenetics may alter gene expression. Low resolution DNA-methylation studies bring evidence of an altered methylome in 45,X fibroblast cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> as well as in peripheral blood mononuclear cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Collectively, these studies suggest an altered global gene expression partly due to changes in the methylation profile in TS, but the literature leave a lack of studies comparing a well-characterized cohort of women with 45,X monosomy with 46,XX and 46,XY controls.</p><p>To this end, we performed leukocyte methylation profiling (450K-Illumina Infinium assay) and whole transcriptome RNA-seq in a cohort of individuals with 45,X monosomy and compared it to age-matched female and male controls. We provide evidence of global changes of the TS methylation landscape, accompanied by subtle gene expression differences with special emphasis on genes escaping X-inactivation (escape genes) and the pseudo-autosomal region.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Widespread methylation differences and global changes in gene expression distinguish Turner syndrome from karyotypically normal males and females</title><p>Evidence suggests that sex chromosomes regulate gene expression throughout the genome with an influence on 3% of autosomal genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. We speculated that this regulation was traceable in the TS methylome and in the transcriptome of the chrX. We used the 450K-Illumina Infinium assay to study DNA-methylation in 33 women with TS and in an equal sized cohort of age-matched female and male controls, in addition to RNA-seq expression profiling in 12 TS, 13 46,XX females, and 12 46,XY males. Supporting our hypothesis, multi-dimensional scaling plots (MDSplot) and hierarchical cluster analysis, based on both methylation data and expression data, revealed a distinct TS cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Figs 1 and 2</xref>). We compared methylation on the one active chrX of TS with the one active chrX of 46,XY males, revealing 200 differentially methylated positions (DMPs), 43 with a delta-Beta&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.1. Extending the model to the autosomes and comparing all three karyotypes, we observed a varying number of DMPs between the groups. The most pronounced differences were in the TS vs. 46,XX comparison, with predominantly proximal promoter hypomethylation. Intermediate differences were found in the 46,XX vs. 46, XY comparison. The most comparable profiles were in the TS vs 46,XY comparison. In summary, the three comparisons revealed 635, 787, and 760 DMPs (absolute delta-M-value&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). Applying a cut-off of delta-Beta&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.1, 469 (TS vs. 46,XX), 78 (46,XX vs. 46,XY), and 293 (TS vs. 46,XY) reached significance.</p><p>We subsequently explored the distribution of methylation values in the TS cohort. Methylation values corresponding to significantly hypomethylated DMPs and hypermethylated DMPs showed nearly overlapping curves and both were approximately normally distributed, with median values at 0.37 and 0.62, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Hence, most affected DMPs show a medium level of methylation. CpG island (CGI) status of hypermethylated and hypomethylated DMPs were significantly different compared to all CpGs on the array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Hypomethylated DMPs were enriched with respect to Islands and their shores, while hypermethylated DMPs were enriched with respect to open-sea and shelfs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). In addition, the hypergeometric test revealed DMP enrichment of chromosome 1, 11, 17 and 22 and of the proximal promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p>After having described profound hypomethylation at the level of single CpGs, we proceeded to explore the differences in methylation between the three karyotypes at a regional level. By using adjacent site clustering, we identified 15 chrX differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 400 autosomal DMRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 3</xref>). To assess if these differences in methylation, or a lack of transcription factor expression due to the reduced chrX dosage, have an impact on chrX or autosomal gene expression we analyzed gene expression differences between the groups. Intergroup comparisons were done on the chrX with TS vs. 46,XX revealing 20 (2 up-regulated and 18 down-regulated), TS vs 46,XY: 113 (52 up-regulated and 61 down-regulated), and 46,XX with 46,XY 85 (48 up-regulated and 37 down-regulated) differentially expressed genes (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; absolute log fold change&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.3, corresponding to a fold change above&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1.2, a cut-off used previously in a TS study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). These differences extended to the autosomes with 33 (TS vs. 46,XX: 12 up-regulated and 21 down-regulated), 3,172 (TS vs. 46,XY: 1,836 up-regulated and 1,336 down-regulated) &#x00026; 2,088 (46,XX vs. 46,XY: 1,382 up-regulated and 706 down-regulated) differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>) with 26 genes differentially expressed in both TS contrasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The relationship between DNAm and expression is complex and amongst others depends on whether the CGI is located at a promoter or is a so-called orphan CGI, that is within or between characterized transcription units<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. We explored the correlation between DNAm and gene expression at DMPs within orphan CGIs (corresponding to 53 genes) and at proximal promoters (34 genes). At five autosomal genes, but no Xchr genes, we found a moderate to strong correlation between the methylation status at orphan CGIs and gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we observe that genome-wide hypomethylation as well as differential gene expression not only affect the chrX but also the autosomes. We have demonstrated how methylation differences and differences in chrX expression clearly distinguish 45,X monosomy from controls.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Methylation at repetitive elements</title><p>Previous studies have explored the DNAm level at repetitive elements, such as long interspersed elements (LINEs), indicating a correlation between the methylation level and the genome size, with hypermethylation of LINEs in smaller genomes (45,X) and hypomethylation in larger genomes (47,XXY)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In parallel, recent extensions of the 450K-Illumina Infinium assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> allowed us to assess the methylation level at autosomal repeats comparing TS with 46,XX controls. We clustered probes on the same chromosome and separated by less than 500 base pairs defining in total 1404 regions in addition to the 19,468 Illumina probes hybridizing to repetitive elements. 29 DMPs (27 hypomethylated and 2 hypermethylated) and 8 hypomethylated regions reached a FWER&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and a delta-Beta value above 0.1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 5</xref>). Secondly, we assessed the number of DMPs in repetitive elements compared with the number of DMPs in the remaining part of the genome and no enrichment was found with respect to repetitive elements.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sex chromosomal escape genes and pseudo-autosomal genes are prone to differential expression in Turner syndrome</title><p>Mono-allelic expression of normally bi-allelic expressed sex chromosomal genes may in part explain the TS phenotype. Such candidate genes are X-Y gene pairs, genes of the pseudo-autosomal regions, as well as escape genes. We hypothesized that loss of sex-chromosome material in TS will change the transcription and translation of chrX genes depending on whether the genes are subject to X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). In addition, we speculated that dosage compensation of TS relative to controls might occur at multicopy or ampliconic X-linked genes, in contrast to single-copy genes, as a result of buffering or feedback mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Consequently, we expected none or few differentially expressed multicopy/ampliconic genes.</p><p>We annotated 51 escape genes according to Bellott <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and found <italic>LANCL3</italic>, <italic>RPS4X</italic> and <italic>JPX</italic> differentially expressed in both TS contrasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). <italic>RPS4X</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 6</xref>) has been associated with TS previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, and <italic>JPX</italic> reported to escape XCI and activate <italic>XIST</italic> on the inactive X. Of genes being classified as inactivated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, <italic>ALAS2</italic> and <italic>GPR34</italic> were common to both the TS contrasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 7</xref>) with <italic>ALAS2</italic> expression being increased two-fold in TS. It must be kept in mind that for several X chromosomal genes a Y homolog exist (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table 4</xref>) possibly explaining an apparent sex-biased expression. We found differential expression of five of these genes: <italic>EIF1AX, ZFX, KDM6A</italic>, and <italic>KDM5C</italic>. Considering their Y homologs, we investigated the expression of the respective X-Y pairs. This revealed an increased expression level of <italic>EIF1AX, ZFX, KDM6A</italic> and <italic>KDM5C</italic> among males (46,XY), with no change in the expression level in TS, and 46,XX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 8</xref>). Interestingly four of the escape genes (<italic>KDM6A, STS, UBA1</italic>, and <italic>USP9X</italic>) were as well differentially methylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Pseudo-autosomal genes are, like escape genes, bi-allelic expressed. Hence, loss of sex chromosomal material corresponding to these regions may explain phenotypic features of TS, as exemplified by SHOX haploinsufficiency involved in TS low stature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Still, due to multi-mapping issues, these genes are often lost during mapping of short read sequence data. We therefore separately mapped reads only to the pseudo-autosomal region. This resulted in expression estimates of 26 genes, of which three (<italic>VAMP7, SPRY3, IL3RA</italic>), five (<italic>P2RY8, PLCXD1, WASH6P, CSF2RA</italic>, <italic>CD99</italic>), and two (<italic>CD99, IL9R</italic>) genes were differentially expressed in the TS vs. 46,XX, TS vs. 46,XY, and 46,XX vs 46,XY, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Figs 10 and 11</xref>). Three of these genes code for proteins involved in immune responses (<italic>CD99</italic>: T-cell adhesion, <italic>IL3RA</italic>: Receptor for Interleukin-3, <italic>CSF2RA</italic>: Colony stimulating factor 2 receptor) and thus may play a role in the predisposition for autoimmune disease in TS and, contribute concurrently to embryonic lethality. Also, <italic>CSF2RA</italic> was previously suggested as a candidate gene explaining the early lethality of TS embryos<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p><p>To illustrate if differentially expressed genes were multi-copy, ampliconic, or single copy genes, we adapted the annotation by <italic>Bellott el al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and <italic>Mueller et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. As illustrated in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>) all differentially expressed genes were single copy genes or genes normally bi-allelic expressed, and thus no gene, thought to be a multicopy gene or an ampliconic gene, were differentially expressed.</p><p>In summary, analysis of the sex chromosomes reveals differential expression of escape genes and pseudo-autosomal genes, but also genes normally subjected to XCI. In addition, the results support our hypothesis that buffering mechanisms exist for multicopy/ampliconic genes. Lastly, we find three candidate genes for the autoimmune predilection and one for the high in utero lethality.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Increased differential methylation and differential expression of genes associated with co-morbidities in Turner syndrome</title><p>A high prevalence of autoimmune disease and cardiovascular comorbidity characterize TS, however without obvious candidate genes. To this end, we annotated DMPs to genes and performed gene set enrichment analysis. Running the gene-centric modular analysis, the genetic association database revealed enrichment for terms related to the metabolic syndrome, type-2 diabetes, and sensorineural hearing loss as well as liver disease and others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table 5</xref>). This finding goes well in hand with these comorbidities being highly prevalent in TS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. For example, TS patients have a 4-fold overrepresentation of type 2 diabetes, and around 50% suffer from sensorineural hearing loss. In addition, we ran DAVID on the 33 differentially expressed autosomal genes from the TS vs. 46,XX comparison. We found that the genes segregated and were connected through Gene Ontology terms with the potential to affect cell functioning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table 6</xref>). Still, the analyses of DMPs are restricted by the annotation of Illumina probes to single genes. We thus expanded the analysis from the single gene/DMP approach and used GREAT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> to relate DMRs to possible candidate genes. The 15 chrX DMRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 3</xref>) related to seventeen genes involved in mental retardation, histone acetylation, and histone deacetylation.

In addition, it is possible that differentially expressed splice factors could contribute to the TS phenotype. To this end, we evaluated differential exon usage with DEXSeq and report results from the TS vs 46,XX comparison. Surprisingly, only one chrX gene (<italic>VSIG4</italic>, FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and absolute log fold change&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.3) showed differential exon-usage.

This paucity of differential methylation within the pseudo-autosomal region may be explained by the sparse coverage of the pseudo-autosomal region by the 450K Illumina array and the fact that many probes are filtered out due to cross-hybridization. In addition to escape genes, ten pseudo-autosomal genes were differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Figs 10 and 11</xref>) with three coding for proteins involved in immune responses possibly playing a role in the autoimmune co-morbidity in TS.</p><p>X-chromosomal genes, differentially expressed in all three comparisons (<italic>CD40LG</italic> and <italic>KDM5C</italic>), were also of interest.

Correspondingly, loss of sex-chromosome material could carry an impact on autosomal gene expression resulting in a divergence in gene expression in TS. We found 33 out of 10,174 autosomal genes to be differentially expressed when comparing TS with 46,XX indicating that loss of sex-chromosome material alters autosomal gene expression. Exploring the individual genes, several of them were related to morbidity in TS e.g. aortic aneurysm (<italic>ZFYVE9</italic>), obesity (<italic>CNR1</italic>), melanocytic nevi (<italic>DOCK7</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, and the insulin-like-growth factor system (<italic>IGFBP3</italic>), which is known to be perturbed in TS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>.

This is interesting in light of the high prevalence of congenital cardiovascular and renal abnormalities in TS. Yet, this widespread hypomethylation did not seem to activate cryptic transcription start sites with the exon-usage being comparable with the exception of a few interesting genes e.g. <italic>VSIG4</italic> and <italic>BUB1B.</italic> The latter is of interest as it is a cause of aneuploidies.

Further studies focusing on this gene in other sex-chromosome aneuploidies are required to shed light on the issue.</p><p>The epigenetic differences presented here are more extensive than expected from studies on comorbidities such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. Hence, it is unlikely that the higher incidence of co-morbidity in TS drives the observed epigenetic differences. In addition, the recruited female controls were healthy controls when originally matched with our TS cohort for our prospective study on aortic dilatation. When recruiting the same cohort for the present study (on average 6 years later) some controls have developed comorbidities such as hypertension and reflux esophagitis. This is a confounder but if anything adds to the variability in the epigenetic data, making it more difficult to prove a difference between cases and controls and these comorbidities does not explain the widespread epigenetic differences in our study. Using animal models would be attractive, but in the case of TS, no optimal models exist. For example, the so called TS mouse model is fertile, and striking differences exist between human and mouse regarding the identity and number of escape genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Lastly, our methylation-based and expression-based pathway analysis were complementary rather than overlapping. This finding probably attributes to the fact that expression data was only available on a subgroup. Furthermore, the DNAm is also a mark of cell differentiation and to a wide extent a static pattern marking the differentiation of the tissue studied<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Ultimately, evidence suggests DNAm as an epigenetic memory with e.g. hypomethylation at enhancers active during embryonic development but dormant in adult tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, thus not necessarily illustrated by the prevailing RNA expression data.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Distribution of DNA-methylation</title><p>Overall chromosome 1, 11, 17 and 22 and the proximal promoter were enriched for DMPs.
