To uncover the unique and shared antimicrobial networks induced by the innate and adaptive immune systems, gene expression profiles generated by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) from human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) activated with TLR2/1 ligand (TLR2/1L) or IFN-&#x003b3; were analyzed. Weighed gene correlation network analysis identified modules of genes strongly correlated with TLR2/1L or IFN-&#x003b3; that were linked by the &#x0201c;defense response&#x0201d; gene ontology term. The common TLR2/1L and IFN-&#x003b3; inducible human macrophage host defense network contained 16 antimicrobial response genes, including S100A12, which was one of the most highly induced genes by TLR2/1L. There is limited information on the role of S100A12 in infectious disease, leading us to test the hypothesis that S100A12 contributes to host defense against mycobacterial infection in humans. We show that S100A12 is sufficient to directly kill <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic>. We also demonstrate that S100A12 is required for TLR2/1L and IFN-&#x003b3; induced antimicrobial activity against <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> in infected macrophages. At the site of disease in leprosy, we found that S100A12 was more strongly expressed in skin lesions from tuberculoid leprosy (T-lep), the self-limiting form of the disease, compared to lepromatous leprosy (L-lep), the progressive form of the disease. These data suggest that S100A12 is part of an innate and adaptive inducible antimicrobial network that contributes to host defense against mycobacteria in infected macrophages.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Macrophage antimicrobial activity induced by innate and adaptive immune stimuli is crucial for controlling infection against intracellular pathogens.

However, activation of these infected macrophages via the innate and adaptive immune system triggers antimicrobial responses that overcome microbial escape strategies. A major pathway for macrophage activation via the innate immune system is through the recognition of bacterial lipoproteins by Toll-like receptor 2/1 heterodimers (TLR2/1) [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which triggers an antimicrobial response [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The adaptive immune response can also induce antimicrobial activity in macrophages, for example via activation by IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. TLR2/1L and IFN-&#x003b3; trigger distinct signaling pathways in human macrophages, but converge on a common host defense pathway, involving the vitamin D-dependent induction of antimicrobial peptides [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A variety of effector mechanisms are induced in activated macrophages to combat mycobacterial infection as part of the cell-autonomous defense [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], yet the matrix of antimicrobial mediators has not been fully explored. The identification of the host defense network by which the innate and adaptive immune systems induce antimicrobial activity in human macrophages is important for understanding mechanisms of resistance versus susceptibility to intracellular bacteria.</p><p>Leprosy, a disease caused by the intracellular bacterium <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic>, provides an outstanding model to study innate and adaptive host defense mechanisms in humans because the clinical manifestations correlate with the immune response. At one end of a spectrum, tuberculoid leprosy (T-lep) is characterized by restricted bacterial growth, few skin lesions, and low bacilli numbers. In contrast, at the other end of the spectrum, lepromatous leprosy (L-lep) is characterized by systemically disseminated infection, several skin lesions, and high bacilli numbers. Reversal reactions (RR) on the other hand represent a shift from the lepromatous parts of the spectrum, usually in patients with multibacillary borderline lepromatous leprosy, towards the tuberculoid part of the spectrum and are associated with reduction of bacilli numbers in skin lesions. Here, we hypothesized that activation of macrophages via innate and adaptive immune signals induce antimicrobial activity via common and distinct pathways. Thus, we investigated the functional gene programs in TLR2/1L and IFN-&#x003b3; activated macrophages, representing two major triggers of macrophage antimicrobial pathways, to identify mechanisms of host defense response against intracellular mycobacteria in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Transcriptome analysis of the TLR2/1L and IFN-&#x003b3; inducible gene network</title><p>To identify gene networks inducible by both innate and adaptive stimuli, human MDMs from five healthy donors were stimulated with a TLR2/1L (19-kD triacylated lipopeptide derived from mycobacteria), or recombinant human IFN-&#x003b3;.

Hierarchical clustering revealed that the media, TLR2/1L and IFN-&#x003b3; gene expression profiles each clustered separately for the 6 and 24 hour data but were clustered together at 2 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005705.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

WGCNA is an unsupervised method that uses expression correlations to group genes into modules, similar to traditional clustering analysis, but raises each correlation to a power, thus lending more weight to stronger, more reliable correlations. All samples were analyzed together. WGCNA analysis identified 28 modules of co-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005705.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, y-axis). To determine which modules were associated with each stimulus and timepoint, we performed module eigengene correlation to the experimental conditions and generated a representative heatmap of correlation values along with their significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005705.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Since our aim was to identify TLR2/1L and IFN-&#x003b3; host defense networks, we focused on modules with a positive correlation to these stimuli. At 6 hours, there were several modules that positively correlated with TLR2/1L (&#x02018;bisque4&#x02019;, &#x02018;tristle1&#x02019;, &#x02018;tan4&#x02019;, &#x02018;blueviolet&#x02019;) and one that correlated with both TLR2/1L and IFN-&#x003b3; (&#x02018;lightpink4&#x02019;). One module correlated with TLR2/1L at both 6 and 24 hours (&#x02018;lightpink4&#x02019;), whereas two correlated with IFN-&#x003b3; at both time points (&#x02018;coral3&#x02019;, &#x02018;salmon2&#x02019;). At 24 hours, we identified two TLR2/1L specific modules (&#x02018;magenta3&#x02019;, &#x02018;coral1&#x02019;) and two IFN-&#x003b3; specific modules (&#x02018;blue4&#x02019;, &#x02018;lavenderblush3&#x02019;). At 2 hours, one module (&#x02018;black&#x02019;) positively correlated with all conditions and likely represents a general response to the culture conditions. There were no modules at 2 hours that correlated only with TLR2/1L or IFN-&#x003b3; and not media, consistent with the finding that all the 2 hour gene expression profile data grouped together by hierarchical clustering.</p><p>A total of twelve modules were found to be significantly correlated with TLR2/1L, IFN-&#x003b3;, or both and not with media control. Functional annotation analysis of each TLR2/1L and IFN-&#x003b3; linked module was performed using Cytoscape in combination with ClueGO plug-in (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005705.s001">S1 Table</xref>), which led us to focus on eight modules with gene ontology (GO) terms relevant to the immune response to mycobacteria. Three modules of interest, &#x02018;blueviolet&#x02019; and &#x02018;lightpink4&#x02019; and &#x02018;tan4&#x02019;, significantly correlated to TLR2/1L stimulation (correlation = 0.70, 0.75, and 0.84; <italic>P</italic> = 7 x 10<sup>&#x02212;08</sup>, 3 x 10<sup>&#x02212;09</sup>, and 3 x 10<sup>&#x02212;13</sup> respectively). Four modules, &#x02018;blue4&#x02019;, &#x02018;coral3&#x02019;, &#x02018;lavenderblush3&#x02019; and &#x02018;salmon2&#x02019;, were significantly correlated with IFN-&#x003b3; stimulation (correlation = 0.66, 0.72, 0.44, and 0.71; <italic>P</italic> = 9 x 10<sup>&#x02212;07</sup>, 2 x 10<sup>&#x02212;08</sup>, and 6 x 10<sup>&#x02212;08</sup> respectively).

The calgranulins S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 also display a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in cell-free culture. In addition, there were several antimicrobial genes that were significantly induced by TLR2/1L and not by IFN-&#x003b3; and vice versa.

The most significantly induced genes related to &#x0201c;defense response&#x0201d; were S100A12 and GBP1.

S100A12 has been reported to have direct and indirect extracellular antimicrobial activity against filarial parasites, fungi, gram-negative bacteria, and gram-positive bacteria [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Protein levels of S100A12 have been previously reported in patients with leprosy [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], however, the role of S100A12 in macrophage antimicrobial activity against intracellular pathogens, including mycobacteria, has not been investigated. Nevertheless, little is known about the role of S100A12 in infectious disease, since the gene is present in humans but not mice [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Studies of inflammatory disease suggest that S100A12, like many antimicrobial proteins, has pro-inflammatory activity [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Here, we hypothesized that S100A12 via its antimicrobial activity contributes to host defense against infection by mycobacteria in humans.</p><p>To validate the RNAseq data, the mRNA levels of S100A12 were measured by qPCR in TLR2/1L and IFN-&#x003b3; activated MDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005705.g003">Fig 3</xref>), in comparison to GBP1. IL15 served as a control, since we have previously found it to be induced by both TLR2/1L and IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similar to the RNAseq data, S100A12 was more highly expressed following TLR2/1L (FC = 68 at 24 hrs; <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) treatment of MDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005705.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), although it was also induced by IFN-&#x003b3; (FC = 7 at 24 hrs; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0002); whereas GBP1 was more highly induced by IFN-&#x003b3; treatment (FC = 292 at 24 hrs; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0005) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005705.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), although also induced by TLR2/1L (FC = 3.5 at 2 hrs, <italic>P</italic> = 2.8 x 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>). As expected, IL-15 mRNA induction was similar for both stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005705.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). In addition, a dose titration of TLR2/1L and IFN-&#x003b3; was performed to ensure that an optimal dose was used for macrophage activation in the induction of S100A12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005705.s004">S2 Fig</xref>). In contrast to the Th1 cytokine, IFN-&#x003b3;, we also wanted to assess whether a Th2 cytokine, such as IL-4, induces S100A12. MDMs stimulated with IL-4 induced relatively lower levels of S100A12 mRNA (FC = 1.5), as compared to TLR2/1 or IFN-&#x003b3; treatment in the same donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005705.s005">S3 Fig</xref>). Based on our data, cytokine profiles for TLR2/1L versus IFN-&#x003b3; stimulated macrophages reveal that TLR2/1L induces pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL1B (FC = 84), TNF (FC = 21), and IL6 (FC = 1168), which are known to also induce S100A12 expression [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], whereas IFN-&#x003b3; did not. Therefore, the differential ability of TLR2/1L to induce these pro-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to the greater induction of S100A12.</p><fig id="ppat.1005705.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1005705.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>RNAseq gene expression is validated by qPCR.</title><p>MDMs were stimulated with TLR2/1L (black bars) or IFN-&#x003b3; (gray bars) for 2, 6, and 24 hours and <bold>(A)</bold> S100A12, <bold>(B)</bold> GBP1, and <bold>(C)</bold> IL15 expression is assessed by RNAseq (left) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) (right).

By defining TLR2/1L (innate) and IFN-&#x003b3; (adaptive) inducible gene networks in human macrophages, we identified a common set of genes with known antimicrobial function. The mRNA and protein encoded by one such gene, S100A12, was induced in macrophages by both TLR2/1L and IFN-&#x003b3;. Given that S100A12 is present in humans and not mice [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], little is known about its role in human infectious disease, leading us to hypothesize that S100A12 contributes to host defense against mycobacterial infection. By studying the human disease leprosy as a model, we determined that S100A12 was more highly expressed in skin lesions from leprosy patients with the self-limited T-lep vs. the progressive L-lep form, indicating that expression of S100A12 at the site of infection correlates with the ability to contain the infection. Finally, S100A12 was sufficient to kill <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic>, as well as <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, and was required for TLR2/1L and IFN-&#x003b3; induced antimicrobial activity in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic>-infected macrophages. Together, these data demonstrate that the innate and adaptive immune response induce S100A12 in macrophages as a common antimicrobial mechanism to combat mycobacterial infection.</p><p>Previously, S100A12 was shown to have direct antifilarial activity against the nematode <italic>Brugia malayi</italic> in axenic culture [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and indirect antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], <italic>Candida spp</italic>, and gram-positive bacterium <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. But to our knowledge, there is little information on the role of S100A12 mediating an antimicrobial activity against a microbial pathogen in human macrophages. Our data indicate S100A12 exhibits antibacterial activity against mycobacteria in axenic culture and also contributes to the innate and adaptive inducible antimicrobial response in human macrophages.</p><p>Similar to other antimicrobial proteins, S100A12 has also been shown to modulate host immune responses. Through the activation of RAGE and TLR4, S100A12 activates MAP kinase and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As a result, S100A12 can induce cytokine secretion and increase expression of adhesion molecules in activated cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Other immunomodulatory activities of S100A12 include the induction of cell migration and chemotaxis of monocytes [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In our analysis, S100A12 was linked to gene ontology terms &#x0201c;chemotaxis&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;inflammatory response&#x0201d;, in addition to &#x0201c;defense response&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;killing of cells of other organisms&#x0201d;. High levels of S100A12 protein have been associated with several inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As a result, many studies suggest levels of S100A12 can be representative of disease state and can serve as a clinical biomarker for inflammation. Although, S100A12 can be detected systemically as well as in inflammatory compartments and tissues, the specific role and function of S100A12 in these disease states is not well defined. The expression of S100A12 in patients with RR, able to restrict the infection but with concomitant nerve damage, suggests that like many antimicrobial peptides, the antimicrobial and inflammatory functions of these molecules are linked [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>In addition to S100A12, we identified 15 additional antimicrobial genes that were induced by both stimuli, including calgranulins S100A8 and S100A9, chemokine CXCL6, and guanylate binding proteins (GBPs). S100A12 is a member of the S100 calgranulins, a subgroup of myeloid-related proteins, which also includes S100A8 and S100A9. Calgranulins are proteins involved in intracellular and extracellular activities during inflammation and infection, serving as antimicrobial proteins as well as damage-associated molecular pattern molecules [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. S100A8/A9 antimicrobial heterocomplex has been reported to inhibit the growth of several pathogens, but stimulate the growth of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> in liquid media [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It is possible that the effects of S100A8/A9 may differ in infected cells; therefore further studies in human macrophages are needed. In addition, GBPs play a role in IFN-&#x003b3; inducible anti-mycobacterial activity in murine macrophages [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], however the role of GBPs in TLR2/1L or IFN-&#x003b3; inducible anti-myocbacterial activity in infected human macropahges still needs to be confirmed. Our data also indicated a divergent set of antimicrobial genes that were significantly induced by either TLR2/1L or IFN-&#x003b3; but not both. Only IFN-&#x003b3; induced DEFB1, CXCL10, and IL32. IL-32 is part of the IFN-&#x003b3; inducible vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial pathway, leading to the induction of CAMP and DEFB4 and the killing of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, IL-32 is not induced by TLR2/1L, therefore represents an IFN-&#x003b3; mediated antimicrobial pathway. On the other hand, TLR2/1L induced additional antimicrobial S100 genes, such as S100A7 and S100A7A, suggesting they could be involved in a TLR2/1L divergent host defense against mycobacteria. S100A7 and S100A7A are constitutively expressed in the skin and can be present at high levels during disease or inflammation, such as, for example, psoriasis [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Together, these genes complement the multiple effector mechanisms contributing to antimicrobial activity in infected macrophages. However, the role of these proteins encoded by S100 genes as well as other antimicrobial genes identified here remains to be determined in host defense responses against mycobacteria. Nevertheless, these data indicate that the innate and adaptive immune systems converge on a matrix of antimicrobial proteins as part of a common &#x0201c;host defense&#x0201d; pathway.</p><p>TLR2/1L and IFN-&#x003b3; have been previously shown to converge on a common antimicrobial pathway with the vitamin D-dependent induction of the antimicrobial genes CAMP and DEFB4. LL-37 and &#x003b2;-defensin 2, the peptides encoded by CAMP and DEFB4, were both sufficient to kill mycobacteria, and individually were required for TLR2/1 mediated-antimicrobial activity [<xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005705.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although CAMP was inducible by 1,25D3, we determined that 1,25D3 was not sufficient to induce S100A12 mRNA in MDMs. The fact that S100A12 does not have a positive vitamin D receptor element in its promoter, suggests that vitamin D is not required for the induction of S100A12. Therefore, both vitamin D dependent and independent antimicrobial pathways contribute to host defense against mycobacteria in humans.</p><p>In summary, our data demonstrate the role of S100A12 in the antimicrobial activity against mycobacteria and the existence of a convergent and divergent host defense gene network. The induction of TLR2/1L and IFN-&#x003b3; common antimicrobial network, which includes S100A12, provides evidence for the existence of multiple antimicrobial effector mechanisms in activated macrophages that act to eliminate pathogens. In addition to defense response, TLR2/1 and IFN-&#x003b3; trigger a network of other immunomodulatory functions such as T cell activation and antigen presentation. Understanding the antimicrobial effector mechanisms is important for developing host directed therapies or modulating the host immune response in order to enhance the immune system to effectively combat intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Antibodies and cytokines</title><p>Human recombinant S100A12 protein (R&#x00026;D systems) was used for antimicrobial assays in axenic cultures.
