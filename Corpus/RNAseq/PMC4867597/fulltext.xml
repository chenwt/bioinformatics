Recent genomic studies have reported recurrent DDX3X mutations in numerous tumors including medulloblastoma (MB), but the physiological impact of these mutations is poorly understood. Here we show that a consistent feature of MB-associated mutations is SG hyper-assembly and concomitant translation impairment. We used CLIP-seq to obtain a comprehensive assessment of DDX3X binding targets and ribosome profiling for high-resolution assessment of global translation. Surprisingly, mutant DDX3X expression caused broad inhibition of translation that impacted DDX3X targeted and non-targeted mRNAs alike. Assessment of translation efficiency with single-cell resolution revealed that SG hyper-assembly correlated precisely with impaired global translation. SG hyper-assembly and translation impairment driven by mutant DDX3X were rescued by a genetic approach that limited SG assembly and by deletion of the N-terminal low complexity domain within DDX3X. Thus, in addition to a primary defect at the level of translation initiation caused by DDX3X mutation, SG assembly itself contributes to global translation inhibition. This work provides mechanistic insights into the consequences of cancer-related DDX3X mutations, suggesting that globally reduced translation may provide a context-dependent survival advantage that must be considered as a possible contributor to tumorigenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>DEAD-box RNA helicases are members of the SF2 superfamily of helicases, which is the largest helicase family containing 37 members in humans, 26 in yeast, and 9 in bacteria (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rnahelicase.org/eukdead.htm">http://www.rnahelicase.org/eukdead.htm</ext-link>). DEAD-box helicases use ATP to remodel RNA-RNA, RNA-DNA or RNA-protein complexes and are known to participate in all facets of the RNA metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Among these proteins, the DDX3X helicase has recently been the focus of intensive study as several recent genomic studies have identified recurrent mutations or chromosome translocations within the DDX3X gene in numerous human tumor types, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, chronic lymphoblastic leukemia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, natural killer/T-cell lymphomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, lung carcinomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, carcinomas of the breast corpus and uterine endometrium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and medulloblastomas (MB)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In MB, DDX3X is mutated in 50% and 11% of pediatric WNT- and SHH-subtypes, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>; and in 54% of adult SHH-subtype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> (matching the frequency of <italic>PTCH1</italic>, the most commonly mutated gene in adult MB). The roles of RNA helicases in the etiology of cancer are largely unknown, and contradictory roles have been ascribed to DDX3X as both an oncogene and tumor suppressor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. However, various recent studies have reported a positive correlation between high DDX3X levels and poor prognosis in human tumors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, suggesting that overexpression of DDX3X may have oncogenic implications in the etiology of this disease.</p><p>According to previous studies, DDX3X and its yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologs (Ded1p and Belle, respectively) play multifunctional roles in cells, being implicated in transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, splicing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, nuclear export<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, and mRNA translation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Both DDX3X and its orthologs in other species are prominent components of cytosolic RNA granules, including stress granules (SGs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. SGs are membrane-less cytosolic bodies composed of mRNAs and proteins that assemble when translation initiation is limiting, and are thought to represent a pool of mRNPs stalled in the process of translation initiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Importantly, DDX3X is not only present in SGs but contributes to SG assembly and regulates molecular dynamics within SGs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. A growing number of recent studies have revealed that low complexity sequence domains (LCDs) in RNA-binding proteins, including DEAD-box helicases, mediate RNA-protein assemblies such as SGs through the biophysical process of liquid-liquid phase separation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. The central helicase core of DDX3X is flanked by large N-terminal and smaller C-terminal LCDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). It was recently shown that the N-terminal LCD of LAF-1, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of DDX3X, mediates the assembly of germ granules, a structure similar to mammalian SGs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, which provides insight into how DDX3X may contribute to SG assembly in mammalian cells.</p><p>All reported DDX3X mutations in MB are nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants that lie in its central helicase core, suggesting that these mutations may have deleterious consequences to the normal function of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In agreement with this line of thought, it was recently reported that two MB-associated DDX3X mutations showed a decreased RNA unwinding activity <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. In a second study, analysis of two additional MB-associated DDX3X mutants, G302V and G325E, revealed that these mutants are defective in RNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, and that introducing these mutations in yeasts result in defective mRNA translation of one previously known mRNA target<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. However, the breadth of this putative translation defect, and its relevance to human cells expressing MB-associated mutant DDX3X are unknown.</p><p>Here, we have used complementary approaches to elucidate how MB-associated mutations interfere with the normal function of DDX3X. We demonstrate that these mutations drive the hyper-assembly of SGs in human cells, leading to impairment in mRNA translation. Additionally, using CLIP-seq, we developed a comprehensive profile of the RNA targets of endogenous DDX3X in human cells. We discovered that DDX3X is enriched in 5&#x02032;-UTRs proximal to the AUG start site of a specific pool of target mRNAs, and supports their translation. MB-associated mutations do not significantly impact the ability of DDX3X to bind bona fide targets, but translation of these targets is impaired. Surprisingly, based on ribosome profiling, mutant DDX3X expression causes a broad inhibition of translation that impacts DDX3X targeted and non-targeted mRNAs alike. Importantly, this defect can be partially reversed by eliminating the N-terminal low complexity domain of DDX3X or by limiting SG assembly with a genetic approach, suggesting that SG formation mediated by MB-associated mutations contributes to the global translation defect. Thus, our study reveals novel insights into the normal function of DDX3X, uncovers the consequences of MB-associated mutations, and points to a potential strategy for therapeutic intervention for the DDX3X-mediated MB.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>High levels and punctated distribution of DDX3X in pediatric medulloblastomas and other tumors</title><p>To investigate the expression level of DDX3X in pediatric MB, we performed immunofluorescence against DDX3X in a panel of these tumors with or without DDX3X mutations. Whereas DDX3X expression was relatively low in normal cerebellar or cortical tissue, DDX3X expression showed frequent up-regulation regardless of its mutational status in MB tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1a</xref>), consistent with prior reports in other tumor types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. All 3&#x02009;MB samples carrying DDX3X mutations showed a significant increase in DDX3X expression relative to normal brain. Interestingly, we observed a cytoplasmic punctated distribution of DDX3X in these tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1a</xref>). We also used a publically available database (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org/">http://www.proteinatlas.org/</ext-link>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> to investigate the expression levels and cellular distribution of DDX3X in other tumor types and observed a similar high levels and punctate distribution in a wide range of human cancers including glioma, melanoma and breast carcinoma tumors compared to normal tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1b</xref>). Thus, these data suggest that high DDX3X expression in a punctate distribution is frequent in human tumors.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>MB-associated DDX3X mutations drive the hyper-assembly of stress granules</title><p>The punctated distribution of DDX3X in human tumors prompted us to investigate the subcellular localization of MB-associated DDX3X mutants in cell lines. Epitope-tagged wild-type DDX3X was expressed diffusely in the cytoplasm with rare accumulation in cytoplasmic puncta in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). This subcellular expression pattern was consistent with the distribution of endogenous DDX3X in HeLa cells as well as in lower rhombic lip progenitor (LRLP) cells, which are the cells of origin of WNT-subtype MB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2a</xref>). In contrast, despite comparable or lower levels of expression, MB-associated DDX3X mutants were found to assemble in discrete cytoplasmic puncta with significantly greater frequency than wild-type DDX3X (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining for the SG marker eIF4G confirmed that DDX3X mutants accumulated in SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Quantitative analyses showed that MB-associated mutations in DDX3X drove SG assembly to a significantly greater extent than wild-type in the absence of stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). To eliminate the potential contribution of transient transfection, which may result in DDX3X expression to a greater extent than endogenous levels, we generated <italic>Tet-On</italic>-inducible HEK293T cells expressing wild-type or the MB-associated mutant DDX3X G325E (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2c</xref>). When exogenous DDX3X expression was induced comparable to endogenous levels, wild-type DDX3X remained diffuse in the cytoplasm, whereas mutant DDX3X accumulated in SGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures 2d,e</xref>) under normal culture conditions, confirming significant mutation-dependent augmentation of SG assembly. Both, wild-type or the MB-associated mutant DDX3X were almost completely relocalized to SGs under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2d,e</xref>). Finally, to investigate the impact of mutations on DDX3X stability, we examined protein half-life using our <italic>Tet-on</italic>-inducible HEK293T cells. We observed that MB-associated mutant DDX3X G325E shows comparable or modestly reduced stability relative to wild-type DDX3X, consistent with comparable or modestly reduced steady state levels of mutant DDX3X (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2f</xref>). Thus, SG assembly mediated by MB-associated mutations in DDX3X is not a consequence of a greater stability of the protein.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>MB-associated DDX3X mutations bind RNA and impair mRNA translation</title><p>The presence of MB-associated mutant DDX3X in SG implies that these mutants retain the ability to bind RNA. However, it has been proposed that these mutations would interfere with normal nucleic acid binding capabilities based on structural modeling predictions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Thus, we next sought to examine the impact of MB-associated DDX3X mutations on RNA binding in intact cells. We performed immunoprecipitation (IP) of wild-type or mutant DDX3X that had been ultraviolet (UV) cross-linked to its native RNA targets. We included two additional mutants in our analysis: a point mutation within the DEAD motif of DDX3X (DDX3X<sup>DQAD</sup>), which is expected to impair the helicase/ATPase activities of the protein and to prevent release of ATP hydrolysis products<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, and a deletion mutant within motif IVa (DDX3X<sup>&#x02206;IVa</sup>), which is expected to impair nucleic acid binding capabilities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. As expected, DDX3X<sup>DQAD</sup> showed enhanced RNA-binding capacity relative to wild-type DDX3X, whereas DDX3X<sup>&#x02206;IVa</sup> displayed impaired ability to bind RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3a&#x02013;c</xref>). Consistent with a role in driving SG hyper-assembly, which implies retained RNA-binding ability, we found that MB-associated DDX3X mutants effectively precipitated target RNAs in amounts similar or only modestly reduced relative to wild-type DDX3X (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3a&#x02013;c</xref>).</p><p>Since SG assembly typically correlates with translational impairment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, we next sought to determine whether the SG induction by MB-associated DDX3X mutations was associated with altered translation. First, we assessed the impact of DDX3X on translation by <sup>35</sup>S-Met/Cys metabolic labeling. Over-expression of wild-type DDX3X resulted in modest impairment of translation consistent, and this observation was concordant with the low rate of SG assembly initiated by over-expression of wild-type DDX3X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2a</xref>). By contrast, over-expression of DDX3X mutants, G325E and M370R, at equivalent levels resulted in significantly greater translation impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), correlating with the high frequency of SG assembly driven by these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). Second, we monitored mRNA translation in cells expressing wild-type or mutant DDX3X by pulse-labeling with puromycin for 30&#x02009;minutes. Puromycin immunostaining permits visualization of newly synthesized proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> and the relationship to SG assembly in individual cells. This analysis showed a striking correlation between assembly of SGs and profound impairment of translation, which was significantly more frequent when DDX3X mutants where expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Thus, we consistently observe impairment in mRNA translation associated with MB-associated mutations in DDX3X by two independent assays.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>DDX3X binds predominantly to mature mRNAs</title><p>The translation defect mediated by MB-associated mutations in DDX3X was anticipated based on the finding that (i) mutant DDX3X binds RNA and induces SG hyper-assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>), and (ii) these mutants are defective in RNA-stimulated ATPase-activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. What was surprising, however, was the apparently broad inhibition of translation as revealed by two distinct metabolic labeling approaches given the presumed limited role of DDX3X in facilitating translation of a discrete subset of mRNA targets harboring long and highly structured 5&#x02032;-UTRs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. This paradox motivated a comprehensive investigation of DDX3X RNA targets by CLIP-seq<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>.</p><p>First, we examined the specificity and efficiency of 5 different anti-DDX3X antibodies for IP followed by mass spectrometry (MS) of the recovered protein to confirm the specificity of the interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4a,b</xref>). The best of these antibodies was used for IP of endogenous DDX3X that had been cross-linked to its native RNA targets by UV irradiation. Recovery of endogenous DDX3X was monitored by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), whereas recovery of cross-linked target RNA was monitored by autoradiography after RNase treatment and end-labeling with &#x003b3;<sup>32</sup>P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Recovered RNA was amplified and sequenced as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. DDX3X CLIP-seq was performed in duplicates and a control experiment using IgG antibody that does not recognize DDX3X was included to monitor background signal. From each DDX3X CLIP experiment, we obtained 2.4&#x02013;2.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> mapped reads in the DDX3X CLIP-seq data set compared to &#x0003c;18,000 in control, showing high signal to noise ratio in the CLIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4c</xref>). Peak calling was performed to identify DDX3X target RNAs (the complete list of DDX3X target RNAs is included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Two biological replicates showed high reproducibility (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.934, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4d</xref>), therefore these data were pooled for subsequent analyses.</p><p>Assessment of DDX3X peak density across defined genomic regions revealed that DDX3X binding was enriched in coding regions as well as the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-UTRs, and exhibited very low binding to intronic and intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The very high enrichment in exonic compared to intronic regions suggests that DDX3X primarily binds to mature mRNAs. Metagene analysis of DDX3X occupancy showed that within mRNA species, DDX3X binding spanned the entire transcript with a prominent enrichment in the 5&#x02032;-UTR proximal to the AUG start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4e</xref>). This binding pattern of DDX3X at 5&#x02032;-UTR suggests a role for DDX3X in assisting the ribosome during late events of translation initiation, whereas binding to coding regions suggests that this helicase may also participate in subsequent elongation steps.</p><p>Standard motif-finding algorithms failed to identify a favored binding motif within the mRNA targets, suggesting that either DDX3X recognizes RNA structural features rather than a primary nucleotide sequences or that the association of DDX3X with protein partners may also account for the positional preferences of this helicase towards its target mRNAs. While DDX3X binds to abroad range of mRNA targets, gene ontology analyses using DAVID illustrated that DDX3X targets were significantly enriched in genes encoding proteins involved in RNA metabolism, particularly the process of translation, although other cellular processes such as viral reproduction, chromosome organization, and cellular trafficking were also represented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>DDX3X regulates the translation of its mRNA targets</title><p>With the identity of DDX3X target mRNAs in hand for the first time, we next sought to elucidate the role of DDX3X in the metabolism of these mRNAs. Our assessment began with RNAseq-based expression profiling in HEK293T cells with or without RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous DDX3X. Depletion of endogenous DDX3X had no significant impact on the expression level or splicing of DDX3X mRNA targets (red) and non-targets (grey) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), a result we confirmed by quantitative PCR analysis for 33 individual RNA targets of DDX3X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>).

With rare exception, target binding by DDX3X mutants did not differ significantly from target binding by wild-type DDX3X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). We also evaluated the consequence of mutant DDX3X on the stability of its target RNAs by performing RNA-seq and comparison of exon-level expression in HEK293T cells transfected with wild-type or mutant DDX3X. Similar to our observations with depletion of endogenous DDX3X, over-expression of neither wild-type nor mutant DDX3X had a significant impact on the expression levels of mRNA targets of DDX3X (black) or non-targets (grey) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). This result was confirmed by quantitative PCR analysis of 34 individual RNA targets of DDX3X revealed only rare changes in expression level in association with mutant DDX3X, with modest down-regulation of one mRNA (PTMA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Thus, mutant DDX3X retains the ability to interact with target mRNAs and this does not significantly alter the expression levels of these targets. In stark contrast, over-expression of mutant but not wild-type DDX3X resulted in consistently and significantly reduced steady state levels of proteins produced by DDX3X target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d,e</xref>). These results indicate that DDX3X mutations do not significantly impair RNA binding or stability, but impair translation of its target mRNAs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ribosome profiling illustrates that MB-associated mutations in DDX3X impair translation initiation of both targeted- and non-targeted mRNAs</title><p>To deeply investigate the translation defect caused by DDX3X mutations we employed ribosome profiling in cells expressing wild-type or mutant DDX3X. Combined with knowledge of DDX3X targeted mRNAs as revealed by CLIPseq, ribosome profiling permits assessment of DDX3X mutation on the translation of individual targeted and non-targeted mRNAs.

Whereas these results strongly suggest a mutation-dependent defect in translation initiation, a failure of translation elongation could also contribute to the global impairment in protein synthesis we observed.

The perfect correlation between SG formation and global translation impairment at the level of single cell resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) suggested that SG assembly itself could be the basis of translation impairment that extends beyond DDX3X targets, by sequestering non-target mRNAs and/or essential translation factors in SGs. To test this hypothesis we took advantage of recent insights into the contribution of low complexity domains (LCDs) to the assembly of SGs and related non-membrane bound organelles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.

Thus, we engineered EGFP-tagged wild-type and mutant DDX3X lacking either N- or C-terminal LCDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Immunofluorescence of HeLa cells transfected with these DDX3X constructs revealed that whereas the full-length proteins are efficiently recruited to SGs in response to oxidative stress, deletion of N-terminal LCD (&#x00394;LCD1) significantly limited the recruitment of these proteins to SG under these conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6a,b</xref>).

To further analyze the requirement of LCD1 in driving SG assembly of DDX3X, we performed live imaging in HeLa cells treated with sodium arsenite for a period of 25&#x02009;min. This analysis confirmed that deletion of LCD1 limited the recruitment of both wild-type and G325E-DDX3X to SGs in response to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Quantitative analyses confirmed that deleting LCD1 of DDX3X significantly prevented SG hyper-assembly mediated by both wild-type DDX3X and the MB-associated mutant G325E under normal and stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c,d</xref>). Importantly, deletion of LCD1 also reversed the translation defect that accompanied DDX3X-depended SG formation as monitored by puromycin incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c,e</xref>).

To investigate this possibility, we treated HeLa cells with the small molecule inhibitor of the integrated stress response, ISRIB, which potently inhibits stress granule assembly downstream of eIF2alpha phosphorylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Whereas ISRIB significantly inhibited SG assembly induced by arsenite treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7a,b</xref>), it did not prevent the formation of SG initiated by MB-associated DDX3X mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S7a,c</xref>).

We undertook a comprehensive, unbiased evaluation of DDX3X function and the consequences of DDX3X missense mutations in cancer by analyzing a spectrum of these mutations occurring in MB tumors using cell biological, biochemical, genomic, and proteomic approaches. We found that cancer-related DDX3X mutations were associated with hyper-assembly of SGs that was accompanied by a striking impairment in mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>). We performed a comprehensive assessment of the RNA targets bound by endogenous DDX3X, which revealed that DDX3X bound a specific pool of mature mRNAs with a particular enrichment toward 5&#x02032;-UTRs and supported their translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). We also determined that cancer-associated variants did not substantially impact the ability of DDX3X to bind mRNA targets, although translation of target mRNAs was significantly impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). The significant reduction in global protein synthesis associated with expression of mutant DDX3X seemed greater than could be accounted for by the specific pool of DDX3X target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, we examined global translation directly by ribosome profiling, a technique which provides a snapshot of ribosome occupancy across the breadth of the translatome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. This analysis indicated that expression of a MB-associated DDX3X mutant resulted in a global decrease of ribosome occupancy at coding sequences of mRNAs, with a concomitant accumulation of ribosomes at 5&#x02032;-UTRs, consistent with a defect in translation initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Remarkably, this analysis revealed that translation impairment was not limited to DDX3X targets, but also extended to mRNAs not bound by DDX3X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>), indicating that MB-associated mutations in DDX3X cause a global impairment in translation. This broad impairment of translation in cells expressing mutant DDX3X as shown by ribosome profiling correlates with mutation-dependent hyper-assembly of SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Indeed, a puromycin incorporation assay that permits cell-by-cell assessment of translation showed strong correlation between mutant DDX3X-dependent SG assembly and profoundly impaired translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>We propose that cancer-associated missense mutations in DDX3X results in a global impairment of protein synthesis by (i) directly binding and blocking translation initiation of target mRNAs that leads to the nucleation of SGs and the sequestration of these targets into SGs, and (ii) indirectly promoting the recruitment of non-target mRNAs and essential translation factors to SGs. This model predicts that global translation impairment caused by expression of mutant DDX3X could be limited or potentially reversed by inhibiting SG assembly. We investigated this possibility first by deleting the N- and C-terminal LCD sequences within DDX3X that contribute to the concentration-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation that underlies SG assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Second, we inhibited SG formation by genetic depletion of G3BP1/2 factors that are essential for SG assembly. Indeed, deletion of N-terminal low complexity domain of DDX3X or genetic depletion of G3BP1/2, significantly reversed DDX3X-mediated SG hyper-assembly and restored translation as assessed by monitoring puromycin incorporation in nascent proteins and assessment of global protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figs 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">8</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that the SG hyper-assembly mediated by MB-associated mutations in DDX3X contributes to global translation inhibition independent of a primary effect at the level of translation initiation. Importantly, the fact that cancer-associated mutant DDX3 forms drive hyper-assembly of SGs even under non-stress conditions strongly suggest that the mutant forms of the protein may possess gain of function alterations that somehow bestow stress granule nucleator activity. Together, these results suggest that drugs that limit SG assembly and/or promote stress granule disassembly might reverse translation defects caused by cancer-associated DDX3X mutations and potentially contribute treatment strategies for tumors that harbor DDX3X mutations.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mechanistic insights into DDX3X role in mRNA translation</title><p>CLIP-seq showed that DDX3X preferentially binds 5&#x02032;-UTR proximal to the AUG start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>); and coincidentally, ribosome profiling revealed that expression of a MB-associated mutant DDX3X led to a significant accumulation of ribosomes within 5&#x02032;-UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Thus, we speculate that DDX3X may play an important role during late events of translation initiation, perhaps by resolving secondary structures at regions proximal to AUG start sites on mRNA targets or by positioning competent monosomes at AUG start sites and priming translation elongation. However, additional experimental data must be obtained to support these conclusions. Another interestingly finding from our CLIP-seq data was that DDX3X not only bound 5&#x02032;-UTR regions on mRNAs, but unexpectedly, there was substantial binding within coding sequences and 3&#x02032;-UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). These observations suggest the possibility that DDX3X participates in additional steps of the mRNA metabolism, including translation elongation or mRNA decay. Nevertheless, we did not detect significant changes in translation elongation upon expression of MB-associated mutations in DDX3X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>).

While it is possible that DDX3X missense mutations contribute to tumorigenesis through inhibited expression of a specific tumor suppressor, an alternative possibility is that altered translation due to DDX3X mutations contributes to tumor development as an adaptive mechanism to metabolic stress. This notion is consistent with a growing body of evidence indicating that deregulation of translation is a common mechanism by which diverse oncogenic pathways promote cellular transformation and tumor development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Deregulation of translation is presumed to confer growth or survival advantages to tumor cells, in many cases by augmenting protein synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. However, in certain circumstances inhibition of translation can confer survival advantages to tumor cells, and is particularly important for metabolic adaptation during nutrient or oxygen deprivation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. An excellent example of translation-related metabolic adaptation is the recent report that eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K), which is activated by AMP-kinase (AMPK), confers survival of MB tumor cells under acute nutrient depletion by blocking translation elongation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. We propose that DDX3X mutations act similarly, inhibiting global translation to support metabolic adaptation of MB cells; and it achieves this by promoting hyper-assembly of SGs during metabolic adaptation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that mutation-dependent SG formation plays a role in the regulation of specific signaling pathways, either by inhibiting specific mRNAs or sequestering key molecules in SGs, thus contributing to tumorigenesis. Either case, drugs that disassemble SGs may disarm cancer cells in MB patients.
