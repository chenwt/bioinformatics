For well-established model organisms (e.g., flies, worms, sea urchins) this technique has been optimised to an extent where it can be automated for high-throughput analyses. While the overall concept of <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation is simple (hybridise a single-stranded, labelled nucleic acid probe complementary to a target of interest, and then detect the label immunologically using colorimetric or fluorescent methods), there are many parameters in the technique that can significantly affect the final result. Furthermore, due to variation in the biochemical and biophysical properties of different cells and tissues, an <italic>in situ</italic> technique optimised for one species is often not suitable for another, and often varies depending on the ontogenetic stage within a species.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using a variety of pre-hybridisation treatments we have identified a set of treatments that greatly increases both whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (WMISH) signal intensity and consistency while maintaining morphological integrity for early larval stages of <italic>Lymnaea stagnalis</italic>.

The most commonly employed technique for the study of spatial gene expression in a given tissue or developmental stage is <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (ISH), often applied to whole embryos or larvae as whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (WMISH). WMISH provides information about the timing and localisation of a gene&#x02019;s expression in a developing embryo or larva, and can be used to characterise and identify cell types, tissues or organs within the whole organism and to make inferences about their function and evolutionary history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Unfortunately, the technique can be challenging, especially when applied to an organism for which there is little knowledge regarding the multifarious conditions that optimise the balance between WMISH signal intensity and the preservation of morphological integrity, two often conflicting requirements. WMISH experiments on embryos can be further challenged by changes in the biochemical and biophysical properties of the developing tissues during ontogenesis. Thus, the procedure often needs to be adapted for distinct developmental stages within a species.</p><p>From an evo-devo perspective, the pulmonate freshwater gastropod <italic>Lymnaea stagnalis</italic> (Linnaeus, 1758) is a representative of a significantly understudied group of animals, the Spiralia/Lophotrochozoa. Primarily due to its availability and ease of culture, <italic>L. stagnalis</italic> was once a much used model for studying molluscan development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and is currently employed as a model for studies focused on various biological processes including the establishment of chirality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the evolution of shell formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and ecologically regulated development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, <italic>L. stagnalis</italic> possesses certain traits that represent technical challenges to WMISH. First, <italic>L. stagnalis</italic> embryos develop individually within egg capsules filled with a fluid that serves a nutritive function and is uptaken by pinocytosis during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This viscous intra-capsular fluid, which consists of a complex mixture of ions, polysaccharides, proteoglycans and other polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], can be seen to stick to the embryo following decapsulation, and likely interferes with any WMISH procedure. Second, from 52&#x000a0;hours post first cleavage onwards the first insoluble material associated with shell formation is secreted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This material non-specifically binds some nucleic acid probes and generates a characteristic background signal. This phenomena is not restricted to <italic>L. stagnalis</italic> but can be observed in larvae of other gastropods (our unpublished data), bivalves, scaphopods and polyplacophoran molluscs (pers. comm. Tim Wollesen). Finally, <italic>L. stagnalis</italic> embryos and larvae undergo significant morphometric and biophysical changes in the characteristics of their tissues during the first days of development (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Previously described WMISH protocols for larvae of <italic>L. stagnalis</italic> produced WMISH signals with low signal to noise ratios, making some previously reported gene expression patterns difficult to interpret [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Overview of the early larval development of</bold>

We first evaluated the effect of the mucolytic agent N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) in order to assess the possibly negative influence of the intra-capsular fluid on WMISH in <italic>L.&#x02009;stagnalis</italic>. A treatment with NAC has been shown to improve WMISH signal intensity in the platyhelminth flatworm <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea,</italic> presumably by degrading the mucosal layer surrounding the animal and thereby increasing accessibility of the probe to the tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. WMISH signal quality was also improved in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> through the use of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) and the detergents sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and NP-40, a treatment referred to by Pearson <italic>et al</italic>. as &#x02018;reduction&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. An alternative permeabilising treatment solely utilising SDS is commonly employed in WMISH protocols for a variety of animals such as the platyhelminth <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] or the arthropod <italic>Parhyale hawaiensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Here we assess the impact of different combinations of these and other standard WMISH treatments (storage, enzymatic permeabilisation by Proteinase K (Pro-K), acetylation) on the strength and consistency of the WMISH signal across early developmental stages of <italic>L. stagnalis</italic>. We also systematically evaluated the effects of the Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) -conjugated anti-DIG antibody concentration, the composition of the colour detection solution and different probe preparation approaches. We have performed these experiments with a selection of three genes, which can be reasonably assumed to have different levels of expression: <italic>beta tubulin,</italic> and the transcription factors <italic>engrailed</italic> and <italic>COE</italic> (<italic>collier/olfactory-1/early B cell factor</italic>). We also demonstrate the presence of a tissue-specific background stain, which can be abolished by treatment with triethanolamine (TEA) and acetic anhydride (AA). The optimised WMISH method we present here will allow for future molecular studies to be performed on a wide range of developmental processes within <italic>L.&#x02009;stagnalis</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A detailed list of all solutions used can be found at the end of this section.

Under this regime adult snails lay egg masses year round. Egg masses of diverse ages were collected and grouped into three developmental time windows: from one to two days post first cleavage (dpfc), from approximately two to three dpfc and from three to five dpfc. Individual egg capsules were freed from the surrounding jelly by rolling them over moist filter paper. Embryos were released from their egg capsules by manual dissection using forceps and mounted needles. In order to minimise experimental error, embryos for each experiment were pooled and processed up to a point when experiment-specific treatments were applied.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>NAC treatment</title><p>Freshly dissected embryos were immediately incubated in NAC solution. The duration and concentration of this treatment were age-dependent. Embryos ranging from two to three dpfc were treated for five minutes with 2.5% NAC, and samples between three and six dpfc were treated with 5% NAC twice for five minutes each.

Embryos were then treated with an age-dependent concentration of Pro-K (Carl Roth, #7528) for ten minutes at room temperature. The regimes ultimately employed are the culmination of a more exhaustive series of trials using a greater range of Pro-K concentrations (0 to 50 &#x003bc;g/ml Pro-K). Embryos between one and two dpfc were incubated in concentrations of Pro-K ranging from 1&#x02013;15 &#x003bc;g/ml, embryos between two and three dpfc in concentrations of Pro-K ranging from 5&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;g/ml and older embryos (between three and five dpfc) were treated at concentrations between 5 &#x003bc;g/ml and 40 &#x003bc;g/ml.

Antisense riboprobes were synthesised using Promega reagents in a 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l-reaction containing 1X reverse transcription buffer, 10&#x000a0;mM Dithiothreitol, 1X Digoxigenin RNA labeling Mix (Roche, #11277073910), 0.25 - 0.5 volume PCR template and 20 Units of the appropriate RNA polymerase (SP6 or T7; Promega, #P108 or #P207). Probe synthesis reactions were carried out at 37&#x000b0;C for two to four hours. For <italic>beta tubulin</italic>, a 702&#x000a0;bp long internal fragment was used for riboprobe synthesis.

Therefore, we focused on a few key steps of sample preparation we believed to cause background, weak WMISH signals and non-specific staining.

However, treatment with NAC resulted in a significant reduction of signal intensity for all ages and genes that we investigated (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C, G, K, O and S). However, when NAC treatment was combined with a reduction step this effect was reversed for some combinations of riboprobe and developmental stage (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H, P and T). The combined NAC and reduction treatment gave the best signal to noise ratio for <italic>beta tubulin</italic> in three to six dpfc larvae (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H), and for <italic>COE</italic> in two to three dpfc old larvae (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>T).

<bold>Overview of WMISH signals generated after pre-hybridisation treatment with NAC and/or reduction.</bold>
<italic>L. stagnalis</italic> larvae of different ages were subjected to a WMISH protocol similar to that described by Jackson <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] <bold>(A, E, I, M and Q)</bold>.

Using this set of pre-hybridisation treatments, the optimal sample preparation regime for WMISH varies with respect to the target gene and the developmental stage. For <italic>engrailed</italic> and <italic>beta tubulin</italic> in younger larvae, the samples that underwent a reduction treatment display the best signal to noise ratio <bold>(B, J and N)</bold>.

The signal diminishing effect of NAC is in contrast to the situation in the planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic>. Here, a NAC treatment is used to remove the planarian&#x02019;s surrounding mucous layer and generally increases the WMISH staining intensity, at least when combined with a permeabilisation step using SDS or DTT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In <italic>L.&#x02009;stagnalis</italic>, NAC may be removing the intra-capsular fluid, however it appears that in our hands NAC is most likely reducing WMISH signal strength by significantly inhibiting the activity of Pro-K; larvae that were incubated in Pro-K and 1% NAC at the same time did not show any signs of compromised morphology, while larvae in control reactions with Pro-K but with less (0.1%) or without NAC were digested (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Treatment with DTT and detergents (reduction)</title><p>A treatment using a solution containing DTT and the detergents SDS and NP-40 following fixation greatly increased WMISH signal intensity for all investigated genes and developmental stages (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The best WMISH signal for <italic>beta tubulin</italic> in four to six dpfc old larvae was achieved using a combination of NAC and reduction (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H). This suggests that the reduction treatment might represent a highly effective permeabilisation approach. However, this was at the cost of all material becoming highly fragile until dehydrated in ethanol. Reduced samples were also more likely to reveal unspecific background staining (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F, N and R).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>SDS treatment</title><p>Between one and five dpfc old embryos and larvae of <italic>L. stagnalis</italic> were treated with different amounts of the anionic detergent SDS prior to hybridisation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). A permeabilising treatment with 0.1% SDS did not produce strong WMISH signals for all studied genes and larval ages (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, D, G, J, M, P and S) whereas treatments with higher concentrations of SDS generated strong WMISH signals. For two of the genes we studied here, <italic>beta tubulin</italic> and <italic>engrailed</italic>, treating larvae between three to five dpfc with 0.5% or 1% SDS produced equally good results. In contrast, the staining was more intense after treatment with 0.5% SDS than with 1% SDS for <italic>COE</italic> (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>Q vs. R and T vs. U) as well as for <italic>beta tubulin</italic> in two dpfc old larvae (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B vs. C), which may suggest a loss of the target transcripts due to excess permeabilisation of these younger stages. Additionally, embryos between one and two dpfc tend to adhere to plastic surfaces in 1% SDS. While in other animal systems SDS is commonly used at a concentration of 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], in <italic>L. stagnalis</italic> strong WMISH signals were most consistently achieved with 0.5% SDS across different genes and ontogenetic stages.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>

In terms of ease of handling, non-specific background and consistency of WMISH signal among the different genes, the SDS treatment is our recommended sample preparation strategy. A reduction treatment might increase the signal intensity in WMISH experiments against genes expressed in older larvae (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H), but should then be performed in parallel to the SDS treatment to control for a possible loss of spatial resolution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Enzymatic permeabilisation with Pro-K</title><p>The optimal Pro-K concentration for tissue permeabilisation and mRNA target unmasking depends on the incubation temperature, incubation time and the ontogenetic stage of the material. In general, under-treatment yields weak WMISH signals while over-treatment increases background staining and leads to a compromised tissue morphology. We tested a wide range of Pro-K concentrations in combination with different pre-hybridisation treatments and found that treatment with Pro-K at concentrations of 0&#x02013;2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml drastically reduced signal intensity while treatment at concentrations of 40&#x02013;50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml compromised tissue integrity (data not shown). Therefore, we finally used concentrations of 1&#x02013;15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml for one to two dpfc old larvae, 5&#x02013;20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml for two to three dpfc old larvae and 5&#x02013;40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml for larvae between three and five dpfc in combination with different SDS concentrations (data not shown). For embryos between one and two dpfc we found the highest concentration of Pro-K of 15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml gave the strongest signals (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B and Q). For two and three dpfc larvae, 15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml or 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml Pro-K were suitable (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E, F, K, L and T). In larvae between three and five dpfc the best signal to noise ratio was achieved with 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml for <italic>beta tubulin</italic> (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>H and I) and 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml for <italic>engrailed</italic> (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>N and O). <italic>COE</italic> is apparently not expressed in larvae between three and five dpfc.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Removal of non-specific background with triethanolamine&#x02009;+&#x02009;acetic anhydride (TEAAA)</title><p>In preliminary experiments using a wide variety of riboprobes to different genes we obtained a strong, well-defined WMISH signal located at the periphery of the shell field and in the radular sac (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, black arrows). To determine whether these staining patterns represented genuine probe/target hybridisation events, or non-specific binding of the probe, we treated fixed larval material with RNAse A prior to hybridisation. As a control, all expected <italic>beta tubulin</italic> staining was abolished following this RNAse treatment, confirming the degradation of all target mRNA (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E). In RNAse treated embryos hybridised with probes that generated the spurious shell field and radula patterns this signal was still present (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>F-H), indicating these WMISH patterns represent high affinity binding of the riboprobe to molecules other than RNA. In order to address this background staining, we assessed the effect of a triethanolamine&#x02009;+&#x02009;acetic anhydride (TEAAA) treatment. Treatment of biological substrates with TEAAA is a common practice for many WMISH protocols, and decreases non-specific binding of labelled probes through the acetylation of polar and charged groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. For <italic>L. stagnalis</italic>, treatment with TEAAA following Pro-K digestion successfully abolished the non-specific WMISH signal in the larval shell and in the radular sac (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>J-L). Due to its strength, consistency and spatial definition, this tissue-specific background stain is particularly likely to be misinterpreted as genuine WMISH signal. A good example of this is <italic>engrailed</italic>, which is genuinely expressed in the shell field periphery (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>J-O) and also produces the shell field background stain (data not shown). Our riboprobe against <italic>engrailed</italic> (synthesised multiple times) covers the same region as the probe used in a recent study that possibly produced the same background staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

Hydrolysing the riboprobe into smaller fragments is thought to facilitate better tissue penetration and to improve hybridisation kinetics (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]). We specifically tested whether a hydrolysed riboprobe generates an improved <italic>engrailed</italic> signal and found that instead both the signal specificity (as revealed by the lack of the shell field lining expression pattern, Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>S) and overall intensity were reduced compared to non-hydrolysed control reactions (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>P vs. S). Reduced signal sensitivity derived from hydrolysed riboprobes has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], highlighting the necessity to test the optimal probe preparation strategy for each gene individually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>To summarise these treatments, neither more antibody nor the use of PVA or hydrolysed riboprobes generated WMISH signals with higher sensitivity and/or signal to noise ratios.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Fluorescent WMISH signal detection</title><p>The optimised protocol that we have identified also allows for the visualisation of fluorescent signals using a confocal microscope. This method of detection provides a much higher spatial resolution than colorimetric methods. Using probes against all three of the genes employed in this study we were able to develop fluorescent signals using Fast Red (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>

Using a variety of pre-hybridisation treatments we have identified a set of conditions that allow for high WMISH signal intensity and consistency in colorimetric as well as fluorescent WMISH. These include a treatment with 0.5% SDS, treatment of one to two dpfc larvae with 15 &#x003bc;g/ml Pro-K, two to three dpfc larvae with 15&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;g/ml Pro-K and three to five dpfc larvae with 20&#x02013;30 &#x003bc;g/ml, followed by treatment with TEAAA. We also demonstrate that non-specific shell field and radula staining can easily be abolished with this TEAAA treatment. In our experience, every riboprobe/developmental stage combination benefits from an individualised protocol, which needs to be empirically determined. Nonetheless we believe that this WMISH protocol should serve as a baseline method from which consistent and clearly visible patterns of gene expression can be obtained. This method should serve to raise the profile of <italic>L. stagnalis</italic> as a tractable experimental molluscan model, a niche that is currently underpopulated.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec26"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12861_2015_68_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
