We analyzed next-generation sequencing data of somatic copy number alterations and somatic mutations in 303 metastatic melanomas. We were able to confirm preeminent drivers of melanoma as well as identify new melanoma genes. The TCGA SKCM study confirmed a dominance of somatic BRAF mutations in 50% of patients. The mutational burden of melanoma patients is an order of magnitude higher than of other TCGA cohorts. A multi-step filter enriched somatic mutations while accounting for recurrence, conservation, and basal rate. Thus, this filter can serve as a paradigm for analysis of genome-wide next-generation sequencing data of large cohorts with a high mutational burden. Analysis of TCGA melanoma data using such a multi-step filter discovered novel and statistically significant potential melanoma driver genes. In the context of the Pan-Cancer study we report a detailed analysis of the mutational landscape of BRAF and other drivers across cancer tissues. Integrated analysis of somatic mutations, somatic copy number alterations, low pass copy numbers, and gene expression of the melanogenesis pathway shows coordination of proliferative events by Gs-protein and cyclin signaling at a systems level.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The Cancer Genome Atlas project aims at the comprehensive elucidation of genomic changes contributing to malignancies. The application of next-generation sequencing through whole-genome, whole-exome, and whole-transcriptome approaches revolutionized the resolution of cancer genome alterations, including nucleotide substitutions, small insertions and deletions, copy number alterations, chromosomal rearrangements, splice variants, regulation of gene expression, and viral or microbial interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. For melanoma patients, next-generation sequencing has already brought tangible advances. Identification of activating point-mutations in BRAF kinase (B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase, Gene ID: 673) has now established a personalized medicine option with kinase inhibitors of mutated BRAF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.

In addition, melanoma subtypes with non-mutated or non-amplified BRAF, NRAS (neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog, Gene ID: 4893), KIT (v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, Gene ID: 3815), or MAP2Ks (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, Gene IDs: 5604-5609) lack molecular targets and present a need to deepen our knowledge of the molecular signature of melanoma.</p><p>Here, we describe the genomic landscape of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) based on genome-wide sequencing data from 303 TCGA malignant melanoma patients. We account for the high UV-induced basal mutation rate in skin cancers and identify genes with significantly perturbed signatures. By employing a multi-step filter we suggest a modular protocol to efficiently enrich genomic drivers in melanoma. Moreover, we characterize several novel variants of known oncogenes like BRAF and relate molecular features of new potential drivers of melanoma to recurring features observed in other cancer tissues. The comprehensive analysis provides a foundation for future functional and clinical assessment of susceptibility variants in melanoma.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Patient cohort</title><p>The TCGA SKCM cohort is focused on metastatic cases (11.6% regional skin cutaneous or subcutaneous metastatic tissue, 56.4% regional metastatic lymph node, 25.1% distant or unspecified metastatic tissue) because melanoma is most often discovered after it has metastasized.

The high level of genomic instability is evidenced by significantly increased frequencies of SCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). We detected concurrent arm-level alteration of both arms of chromosomes 6, 20, 9, 10, 11 indicative of aneuploidy. In addition to aneuploidy or focal SCNA events, significant enrichment of inactivating TP53 may contribute to other classes of structural variations, like breakage or fusions. While SCNAs alone cannot infer on history or heterogeneity of the tumor, future analysis on clonality status may provide additional weight to identified drivers.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>New cancer drivers</title><p>TMEM216 stands out among the newly discovered genes in melanoma as a low-frequency, highly statistically significant, recurrent splice site mutation.

The importance of the splice site mutation is further enhanced by the nature of the non-UV induced nucleotide change, strong mutual exclusivity with known oncogenes, and recurrence in non-melanoma cancer tissues.

Today, whole-genome and -exome sequencing allows deep insight into molecular carcinogenesis of melanoma.

Our detailed and targeted sampling of the mutational landscape of BRAF in TCGA melanoma as well as in all other tissues of TCGA by next-generation sequencing brought three main insights forward: a) BRAF is significantly increased at a copy-number level and constitutively activated by somatic mutations; b) The whole-exome data showed unprecedented diverse mutational events within BRAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>) aside from p.V600E preserving mutual exclusivity to activating NRAS mutations; c) Other cancers have similar or even stronger BRAF signatures than melanoma.</p><p>These observations manifest BRAF as a <italic>bona fide</italic> pan-cancer driver and have consequences for BRAF as an anti-cancer target and diagnostic marker. Lessons already learned from molecular studies of the BRAF pathway are relevant to almost all cancer tissues, which showed somatic missense mutations. The diverse mutational landscape challenges medicinal chemistry efforts to develop new compounds recognizing the different molecular conformations of mutated activator and ATP binding loop aside from established p.V600E binders. A single SNP test for c.1799T&#x0003e;A is not sufficient to capture the majority of mutational events of BRAF in its RBD or in the ATP binding site of its PK domain. Datasets like TCGA lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) show mutational incidents of BRAF in more than 5% of the patients but not a single substitution of c.1799T&#x0003e;A. On a positive note, the diagnostic value of c.1799T&#x0003e;A for BRAF diagnostics is widened to many other cancers besides SKCM that homogeneously show single p.V600E substitutions like THCA, COAD, GBM, KIRP, READ, and LGG.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The systems biology analysis of melanoma showed an unprecedented richness and depth of statistically significant and novel melanoma genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).

If driver mutations are observed in other cancer tissues as well, lessons learned on regulation of signaling cascades and drug resistance of cancer targets might be directly translatable. Thyroid cancer showed an enrichment of the somatic melanoma driver mutation BRAF(p.V600E) that surpassed profiles of BRAF of any other tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>), while preserving mutually exclusive setting to RAS mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary table 6</xref>). For patients with activated BRAF pathways in their thyroid tissues, knowledge on molecular medicine of the BRAF cascade in melanoma becomes highly valuable. The systems biology integration of genomic alterations in melanoma provides a glimpse into how a spectrum of genomic aberrations contributes to melanoma genesis and progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>).

GISTIC 2.0.21 distinguishes arm-level events from focal events at a broad length cutoff of 0.7. Events whose length was greater or less than 50% of the chromosome arm on which they resided were called arm-level or focal events, respectively, and these groups of events were analyzed separately. The data was concordant to segmented level 3 data publically available at the TCGA data portal. Since GISTIC 2.0.21 uses ratios of segmented tumor copy number data relative to normal samples as input, segmented level 3 data aligned to HG19 served as input for analysis runs. For significant loci and genes a cutoff q-value of 0.01 was applied, and concordance determined by overlaying whole-genome sequencing and SNP data.
