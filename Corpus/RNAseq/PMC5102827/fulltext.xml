To characterize the role of activated NOTCH3 in cancer, we generated an antibody that detects the neo-epitope created upon gamma-secretase cleavage of NOTCH3 to release its intracellular domain (ICD3), and sequenced the negative regulatory region (NRR) and PEST domain coding regions of NOTCH3 in a panel of cell lines. We also characterize NOTCH3 tumor-associated mutations that result in activation of signaling and report new inhibitory antibodies. We determined the structural basis for receptor inhibition by obtaining the first co-crystal structure of a NOTCH3 antibody with the NRR protein and defined two distinct epitopes for NRR antibodies. The antibodies exhibit potent anti-leukemic activity in cell lines and tumor xenografts harboring NOTCH3 activating mutations. Screening of primary T-ALL samples reveals that two of 40 tumors examined show active NOTCH3 signaling. We also identified evidence of NOTCH3 activation in 12 of 24 patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models, two of which exhibit activation of NOTCH3 without activation of NOTCH1. Our studies provide additional insights into NOTCH3 activation and offer a path forward for identification of cancers that are likely to respond to therapy with NOTCH3 selective inhibitory antibodies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Notch signaling</kwd><kwd>NOTCH3</kwd><kwd>T-ALL</kwd><kwd>inhibitory antibody</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Notch signaling regulates a diverse set of biological functions in developing embryos and adult tissues (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In mammals, there are four Notch receptors (Notch1-4), which are all single-pass transmembrane proteins. The Notch extracellular domain (ECD) consists of a series of EGF-like repeats followed by a negative regulatory region (NRR) composed of 3 LIN12/Notch repeats (LNRs) and a heterodimerization domain (HD). The Notch intracellular domain (ICD) contains RAM and ankyrin repeat domains that participate in protein:protein interactions and a C-terminal PEST (proline, glutamate, serine, threonine) degron that regulates protein stability (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Notch signaling is stimulated when a Notch receptor interacts with a ligand on a neighboring cell. In mammals there are four canonical activating Notch ligands: two Delta-like ligands (DLL1 and DLL4) and two Jagged ligands (JAG1 and JAG2). Ligand binding leads to cleavage of Notch by a protease of the ADAM family at a site called S2 within the NRR domain. This ligand-dependent cleavage step generates the substrate for subsequent cleavage of the Notch receptor by the &#x003b3;-secretase complex. Following &#x003b3;-secretase cleavage, the intracellular domain of Notch (ICD) translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with the DNA-binding factor RBPJ and co-activators of the mastermind-like (MAML) family to form a transcriptional activation complex. Increased expression of target genes, such as members of the HES/HEY family of transcriptional repressors, appears to mediate most Notch functions.</p><p id="P4">Notch receptors have been implicated as oncogenic drivers in a number of different human cancers. Activating mutations involving two different regions of NOTCH1 are present in &#x0003e;50% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). One class of mutations cluster in the hydrophobic core of the HD domain, or occur (albeit infrequently) in the LNR domain (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). These NRR mutations typically act by destabilizing or completely unfolding the HD domain, relaxing the interface that protects the S2 site (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The second class of mutations consists of frameshifts or stop codons that result in loss of the PEST domain at the C-terminus of the protein. ICD levels are tightly regulated and phosphorylation of the PEST domain and subsequent ubiquitination are postulated to target the ICD for degradation by E3-ubiquitin ligases such as FBXW7. This negative regulatory axis is abrogated by deletion of the PEST domain, resulting in increased ICD stability and half-life. Similar PEST mutations also occur in NOTCH1 in a minority of chronic lymphocytic leukemias and mantle cell lymphomas, as well as in NOTCH2 in a subset of splenic marginal zone lymphomas (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In solid tumors, the roles of various Notch receptors in tumor initiation and progression are more complex (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Rearrangements of NOTCH1 or NOTCH2 identified recurrently in estrogen receptor (ER) negative breast cancer delete most of the coding sequence for the extracellular domain including the NRR, leading to expression of constitutively active Notch polypeptides (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Activating NOTCH1 mutations involving the NRR and PEST domains that are structurally similar to those found in T-ALL occur in roughly 10% of adenoid cystic carcinomas (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). NOTCH3 has been reported to be amplified in &#x0223c; 10-25% of ovarian adenocarcinomas (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In large-scale cancer genome efforts, NOTCH3 mutations have also been reported in around 1% of head and neck squamous carcinomas, ovarian cancers and lung adenocarcinoma. However, in many studies high GC content has resulted in poor sequencing depth of NOTCH3 exons 25 and 33, where activating mutations are most likely to be found based on prior studies of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 in hematologic cancers. Thus, although the Notch pathway is an attractive target for novel therapies, the full extent of activation of Notch receptors in human cancer remains to be determined. In addition, NOTCH3 is an attractive target as it displays more restricted tissue expression than other NOTCH receptors and NOTCH3 specific therapies might be predicted to have less toxicity. For instance, gastrointestinal toxicity, observed clinically upon gamma secretase treatment (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), has been attributed to inhibition of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 based on studies in mouse models (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) In addition, NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 receptor knockout mice are embryonic lethal (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) where as NOTCH3 knockout mice are viable and fertile (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), with phenotypes limited to structural defects in arterial vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Characterization of cellular models and tumors with NOTCH1 activating mutations has been aided by antibody reagents that specifically detect the neo-epitope that is created by gamma-secretase cleavage. To characterize the role of NOTCH3 in human cancers we took a two-step approach that involved comprehensive sequencing of the NRR and PEST domains of NOTCH3 in a panel of cell lines, and generation of an antibody that specifically detects the neo-epitope at the N-terminus of activated NOTCH3 (ICD3) that is created by gamma-secretase cleavage. Here, we describe several mutations in the NRR and PEST domains that result in NOTCH3 activation (&#x0201c;activating mutations&#x0201d;), including an NRR mutation in the human T-ALL cell line, TALL-1 that leads to ligand-independent receptor activation. We also describe two new inhibitory antibodies that suppress ligand-dependent and -independent NOTCH3 signaling by binding to the NOTCH3 NRR and exhibit anti-leukemic activity in cell lines and tumor xenografts. By screening 40 primary T-ALL tumors and 24 orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with an ICD3-specific antibody, we also identified two primary tumors and 12 PDX models with evidence of ongoing NOTCH3 activation. These findings offer a path forward for identification of cancers that are likely to respond to therapy with NOTCH3 selective inhibitory antibodies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Identification and characterization of the NOTCH3 S1580L NRR mutation</title><p id="P7">Multiple T-ALL cell lines with activating NOTCH1 mutations have been characterized (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and several of these cell lines depend on Notch signaling for proliferation and are sensitive to gamma secretase inhibitors (GSIs). Characterization of a panel of T-ALL cell lines to a well-characterized GSI (DAPT), confirmed that the cell line TALL-1 showed a dose dependent decrease in proliferation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), similar to the T-ALL cell line HPB-ALL, which is GSI-sensitive and has activating NOTCH1 mutations in both the NRR and PEST domains (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Although TALL-1 has no known alterations in NOTCH1, it harbors a homozygous mutation in exon 26 (c4739t) of NOTCH3. This mutation produces a S1580L point substitution in the NRR domain that leads to increased ligand-independent NOTCH3 activation . TALL-1 also displays an mRNA signature of Notch pathway activity (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>). When a panel of T-ALL cell line lysates was examined with an anti-NOTCH3 antibody, blots of TALL-1 cell lysates showed antibody-reactive bands with molecular weights between 97 and 64kDa (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). TALL-1 cells lacked detectable ICD1, unlike other T-ALL lines with well characterized NOTCH1 activating mutations such as HPB-ALL, RPMI8402, DND41 and Jurkat (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Moreover, when introduced into a chimeric NOTCH3 construct containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of NOTCH3 and an intracellular domain consisting of the Gal4 DNA binding domain and the VP16 transactivation domain, the S1580L point substitution mutation results in an approximately 10-fold increase in activation of a Gal4-reporter gene relative to the wild-type NOTCH3-Gal4 fusion control (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), consistent with studies of the basal activity of the S1580L mutation recently reported elsewhere (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Wild-type and mutated receptors in this assay were present in approximately equal amounts as determined by flow cytometry (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), excluding the possibility that the increased signal in various assays for activity results from increased protein abundance on the cell surface. Prior work has shown that TALL-1 cells, lack activating mutations in NOTCH1 (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and are resistant to inhibitory antibodies specific for the NRR of NOTCH1 (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). These data confirm that the S1580L mutation activates NOTCH3 signaling independent of ligand stimulation and is responsible for Notch pathway dependence in the TALL-1 cell line.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Development of an ICD3 neo-epitope antibody for monitoring NOTCH3 signaling</title><p id="P8">To detect the activated form of NOTCH3, we generated a custom antibody specific for the neo-epitope in human NOTCH3 ICD (ICD3) that is created by gamma-secretase cleavage between amino acids G1661 and V1662. To characterize this antibody we screened a panel of T-ALL lines by Western blotting. An antibody-reactive band sensitive to the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT was only detected in TALL-1 cells, indicating that the antibody recognizes ICD3 and does not cross-react with ICD1 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). The strong ICD3 signal in TALL-1 cells also provides further evidence that the S1580L mutation leads to an increase in NOTCH3 activation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Identification and characterization of cell lines with NOTCH3 NRR and PEST mutations</title><p id="P9">To determine the frequency of NOTCH3 mutations in other cell lines, we analyzed next generation sequencing (NGS) data of 947 cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line encyclopedia (CCLE) (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>)<bold>.</bold> Although NOTCH3 was one of the genes sequenced, examination of the data revealed that sequencing depth of NOTCH3 exons 25 and 33 was insufficient in most cases to permit the identification of mutations (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Therefore, Sanger Sequencing (Genewiz), RainDance analysis (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and RNAseq (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) were performed to determine whether any of these cell lines had NOTCH3 mutations. Mutations were found in both the NRR and PEST regions (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Tables 2, 3</xref>) in various cell lines, which were further characterized by Western blot analysis with the ICD3 antibody. This revealed high levels of ICD3 in the endometrial cancer cell line Ishikawa, which has an N1597K mutation in the NOTCH3 NRR domain (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Elevated ICD3 was also detected in three cell lines with PEST domain mutations, MDA-MB468 breast carcinoma cells and A549 and NCI-H2347 lung carcinoma cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). MDA-MB468 cell extracts contained two forms of ICD3, a prominent truncated form consistent with the presence of a frameshift mutation involving codon 2034 and a second polypeptide of the expected sized of full-length ICD3. The higher levels of the smaller polypeptide with the PEST deletion in MDA-MB468 cells suggests that it has a longer half-life than wild-type ICD3, as previously shown for forms of ICD1 containing PEST deletions (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Characterization of Inhibitory anti-NOTCH3 Antibodies in Cell Lines with Mutated or Amplified NOTCH3</title><p id="P10">To determine if cell lines with NOTCH3 abnormalities depend on NOTCH3 signaling for growth, we used phage display to isolate antibodies against the NRR and ligand binding domains (LBD) of NOTCH3, and then tested these antibodies for their ability to inhibit NOTCH3 signaling (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). We focused our studies on three antibodies against the NRR domain and one antibody against the LBD domain. The binding of NOTCH3 antibodies to recombinant proteins and to cells expressing NOTCH3 was analyzed using several complementary methods, including flow cytometry and surface plasmon resonance, which shows very slow off rates for antibody-NRR complexes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 2, 3</xref>). We examined the effect of each antibody on NOTCH3 signaling in TALL-1 cells by assessing their effects on Notch target gene expression (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). NOTCH3 antibodies against the NRR domain (MOR20350, MOR20358, MOR20337, and the previously characterized anti-NOTCH3 NRR antibody A4 (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) inhibited expression of the Notch target genes DTX1, HES1, NOTCH3 and PTCR&#x003b1;, whereas the anti-LBD antibody (MOR20364) did not. The inhibition achieved with the MOR20350 and MOR20358 anti-NOTCH3 antibodies was comparable to that produced by GSI treatment. In contrast, RPMI-8402, a T-ALL line with activating NOTCH1 mutations and readily detectable ICD1 that lacks ICD3, did not downregulate Notch target genes in response to anti-NOTCH3 NRR antibodies, but did so in response to GSI (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. 4</xref>). Consistent with these findings, ICD3 levels were reduced in TALL-1 cells upon treatment with anti-NRR antibodies, whereas the anti-LBD antibody (MOR12229) had no effect on ICD3 levels. Treatment of the NOTCH3 PEST mutated cell line MDA-MB468 with NOTCH3 NRR antibodies (MOR20337, MOR20350 and MOR20358) decreased ICD3 levels, but treatment with the LBD antibody 20802 did not. In other cells lines with NOTCH3 mutations including A549, TE-11 and Ishikawa (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. 5</xref>) treatment with the anti-NRR antibody MOR20350 substantially decreased ICD3 levels. In HCC1143 cells, which have an amplification of NOTCH3 (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), treatment with each NOTCH3 antibody decreased ICD3 levels (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. 5</xref>), with MOR20350 having the greatest effect. These data suggest that there are at least two mechansims by which NOTCH3 signaling may be activated in cellular models, amplification/overexpression and NRR/PEST mutation.</p><p id="P11">We next examined whether cell lines with active NOTCH3 signaling are dependent on signaling for growth. Treatment of TALL-1 cells with MOR20350, MOR20358, MOR20337 antibodies or the A4 antibody (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) significantly inhibited TALL-1 proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), whereas treatment with NOTCH3 LBD antibodies did not. When NOTCH3 antibodies were tested against a panel of other T-ALL cell lines that are NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 wild-type (SUPT11) or NOTCH1 mutated (HPB-ALL, DND41, P12-Ichikawa, SUPT1, and RPMI-8402), no effects on proliferation were seen (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. 4</xref> and data not shown). Treatment of MDA-MB468 cells with anti-NOTCH3 NRR antibodies produced a trend toward growth inhibition, but the results were not statistically significant (not shown).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>NOTCH3 NRR antibodies bind to distinct non-overlapping epitopes</title><p id="P12">In an effort to further understand how MOR20350 and MOR20358 inhibit NOTCH3 signaling, we determined the structures of Fab-NOTCH3 NRR complexes using X-ray crystallography.

The structure of the NOTCH3 NRR/MOR20350 Fab complex (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) was used to identify the binding epitope, which consists of several discontinuous (<italic>i.e.</italic> noncontiguous) sequences from the NRR (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 4 and Supplemental Fig. 6</xref>) Notably, the &#x003b2;4-&#x003b1;3 loop in the NOTCH3 HD domain is structurally unique from that of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, and a majority of this segment is part of the MOR20350 epitope. Furthermore, this loop is mostly unstructured (no electron density due to flexibility) in the NOTCH3/MOR20358 NRR complex, but is structured in the MOR20350 complex due to direct binding to the Fab. The MOR20350 Fab also contacts the LNR region (mainly around LNR-B) of the NOTCH3 NRR (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). These contacts suggest that binding of MOR20350 clamps the LNR and HD domains together, stabilizing the autoinhibitory conformation of the NOTCH3 NRR and blocking NOTCH3 activation.</p><p id="P13">As with the NOTCH3 NRR/MOR20350 complex, the interaction surface on the NOTCH3 NRR of the MOR20358 Fab is also discontinuous (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 5, Supplemental Fig. 6</xref>). The structure of the LNR-B/C linker plus the first half of LNR-C of NOTCH3 is unique from those of NOTCH1 and NOTCH2, and most of this segment contacts MOR20358. The MOR20358 Fab also simultaneously binds LNR-C and the HD domain (mainly around the &#x003b1;3-&#x003b2;5 loop), suggesting that it also stabilizes the autoinhibitory conformation of the NOTCH3 NRR.</p><p id="P14">To determine whether the epitopes of MOR20350 and MOR20358 overlap, the crystal structures of the NOTCH3 NRR/MOR20350 and NOTCH3 NRR/MOR20358 complexes were superimposed on the structure of the NOTCH3 NRR (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). The superposition clearly shows that MOR20350 and MOR20358 bind distinct non-overlapping epitopes within the NOTCH3 NRR. The binding site for the anti-NOTCH3 A4 antibody (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) constitutes a third epitope (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. 6</xref>), indicating that there are at least three distinct binding modes by which anti-NRR antibodies can allosterically inhibit NOTCH3.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>NOTCH3 antibodies display <italic>in vivo</italic> activity against TALL-1 cells</title><p id="P15">Having established that NOTCH3 antibodies inhibit signaling in cell lines with NOTCH3 mutations <italic>in vitro</italic>, we asked whether these antibodies also have anti-tumor effects <italic>in vivo</italic> using representative cell lines with a NOTCH3 PEST (MDA-MB468) or NRR (TALL-1) mutation, respectively. Tumors from mice engrafted with TALL-1 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) or MDA-MB468 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. 8</xref>) cells were treated with NOTCH3 antibodies and evaluated for effects on the expression of Notch target genes and ICD3 levels. Treatment of TALL-1 xenografts with NRR antibodies, but not with LBD antibodies, sharply decreased the expression levels of DTX1 relative to levels in xenografts from animals treated with an IgG control antibody (MOR3207) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). In addition, treatment with NRR antibodies substantially lowered ICD3 levels relative to control IgG (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Interestingly, the level of total NOTCH3 was also decreased in TALL-1 tumors treated with NRR antibodies, consistent with autoregulation of NOTCH3 expression by ICD3 itself. Staining of xenografts with ICD3 specific antibody revealed that although there was decreased ICD3 staining following NOTCH3 antibody treatment, some cells within the tumor showed persistent ICD3 expression (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. 8</xref>). ICD3 staining was weaker and more heterogeneous in the MDA-MB468 tumors than the TALL-1 tumors (Compare <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. 8</xref>). These studies showed that NOTCH3 NRR antibodies are capable of inhibiting NOTCH3 signaling <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P16">To further evaluate the anti-tumor effects of NOTCH3 antibodies in the TALL-1 xenograft model, the cell line was luciferized in order to monitor xenograft growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. The MOR20358 and MOR20350 antibodies showed the most anti-tumor activity in this study as compared to animals treated with the control antibody MOR3207 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). By day 43, no luminescent cells were detected in the cohort treated with MOR20350 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Despite inhibition of NOTCH3 signaling by NRR antibodies in the MDA-MB468 xenograft model there was no effect on tumor growth (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. 8</xref>). Therefore, only a subset of cell line models with NOTCH3 mutations retain dependence on NOTCH3 signaling for growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. In an effort to understand the epidemiology of activated NOTCH3 signaling in primary T-ALL samples, 40 patient samples were stained with the ICD3 antibody. Two tumors were identified with high homogenous levels of ICD3 staining, consistent with activation of signaling (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). In an effort to determine if NOTCH3 is mutated in these specimens, we isolated DNA from them but were unable to obtain high quality NOTCH3 sequencing data, likely due to the inherent difficulties of sequencing this gene and the confounding effects of treatment of bone marrow biopsies with highly acidic decalcification solutions as part of their processing. Because of the difficulties of working with archival marrow samples, we further explored the extent of NOTCH3 activation in cell pellets prepared from 24 orthotopic T-ALL PDX models. Remarkably, Western blotting for ICD3 and ICD1 demonstrated activation of NOTCH3 in 12 of 24 models, two of which had activation only of NOTCH3 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that activation of NOTCH3 signaling in T-ALL is more prevalent than thought previously. There was a correlation between high levels of total NOTCH3 and presence of ICD3 which was not observed when we compare levels of total NOTCH1 and presence of ICD1.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S9"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Studies to examine alternations in Notch signaling in human cancer have identified a spectrum of mutations as well as other genetic alterations including chromosomal translocations in a diverse set of tumor types. However, despite these advances many of these alternations have not been fully characterized. In this study we determined the extent of NOTCH3 NRR and PEST mutations in a panel of cancer cell lines and analyzed for the presence of activated NOTCH3 signaling. Through structural studies NOTCH3 inhibitory antibodies were shown to bind to conformation epitopes on the NRR and lock this domain in the autoinhibited form. The antibodies block NOTCH3 signaling in cell lines and in tumor xenografts, and the TALL-1 cell line dramatically inhibit cellular proliferation and tumor growth.</p><p id="P18">Activating mutations in the NRR and PEST domains of NOTCH1 have been extensively characterized in T-ALL and shown to be oncogenic drivers in this leukemia (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Previous mouse models relying on overexpression of ICD3 demonstrated that activation of NOTCH3 signaling can drive T-ALL development (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Here, we examined a proof of concept mutation in the NOTCH3 NRR domain (S1580L) in a T-ALL cell line, TALL-1, that lacks NOTCH1 activating mutations. The S1580L mutation leads to ligand-independent increases in NOTCH3 signaling and drives a Notch-dependent gene signature that is similar to that seen in T-ALL lines with NOTCH1 mutations (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. 1 and Fig. 1D</xref>). In the NOTCH3 NRR, the side-chain oxygen of S1580 (in HD-C) forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen of P1521 (in HD-N). S1580L mutation eliminates this hydrogen bond and likely weakens the interaction between HD-N and HD-C (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Considering the close proximity of S1580 to the S2 site (&#x0223c;10 &#x000c5;), this substitution likely makes the S2 site more accessible to ADAM metalloproteases. TALL-1 cells indeed contain markedly elevated levels of ICD3 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and are dependent on NOTCH3 signaling for growth and survival <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. This dependence is strikingly revealed by the <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, as treatment of mice with the inhibitory antibody MOR20350 resulted in no detectable TALL-1 luminescent cells at the end of the study (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Among the NOTCH3 inhibitory antibodies tested, MOR20350 most consistently inhibited NOTCH3 signaling in the broadest spectrum of models with NOTCH3 point substitutions or amplifications. This is likely not explained by differences in antibody binding, as the three NRR antibodies have similar affinities to recombinant NOTCH3 protein and show similar binding to surface NOTCH3 in flow cytometric studies (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). MOR20350, as compared to MOR20358, has a larger binding interface on the surface of the NOTCH3 NRR and this interface is more evenly distributed between the LNRs and the HD (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). In addition, the binding interface lies close to LNR-A, which harbors a conserved leucine residue (L1419) that is responsible for packing of the &#x003b1;3 helix against the S2 site on &#x003b2;5, thereby precluding access of ADAM metalloproteases. The likely mode of action of our antibodies is consistent with other studies showing that inhibitory Notch antibodies binding the NRR domain and recognize epitopes that span the LNR and HD domains (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) <italic>via</italic> the NOTCH3 NRR (A4) (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Comparison of the structures of MOR20350 and MOR20358, antibodies bound to the NOTCH3 NRR domain as well as previously published binding epitope information for A4 (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) show that each binds a distinct epitope, (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. 6</xref>). Therefore, there are multiple regions on the surface of the NRR where antibodies can bind and stabilize LNR-HD interaction.</p><p id="P20">Identification of Notch signaling alterations in human tumors has emerged from cancer genome sequencing data as well as development of reagents to detect Notch pathway activation. Recently, NOTCH1, NOTCH2 and NOTCH3 mutations were identified in an analysis of the breast cancer TCGA dataset, with enrichment of mutations in the triple negative sub-type (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The authors noted five tumors with NOTCH3 PEST domain mutations but were unable to characterize NOTCH3 signaling activation due to lack of samples or primary tumor xenograft models. In an examination of NOTCH3 mutations from cancer genome sequencing studies, we also identified multiple diverse tumors with NRR or PEST mutations (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 7</xref>) A reliable antibody reagent to detect the active NOTCH1 ICD1 has been identified and protocols developed for IHC stains that enable screening of archival tumor samples for NOTCH1 activation (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In this study we report the development of a similar reagent to detect the active form of NOTCH3, ICD3. This reagent was used to screen 40 T-ALL bone marrow samples, two of which had detectable ICD3 staining, but attempts to sequence tumor DNA samples from de-calcified and fixed bone marrow samples, which are known to pose challenges, were unsuccessful. However, 12/24 orthotopic T-ALL PDX samples showed readily detectable NOTCH3 activation, two of which showed activation only of NOTCH3. DNA sequencing of these models did not reveal any NOTCH3 mutations,suggesting that NOTCH3 activation either is mutation- and ligand-independent or mutation-independent and ligand dependent. The former possibility is in line with our data that total NOTCH3 protein is high in models with detectable ICD3 and with studies showing that among mammalian Notch receptors, NOTCH3 has the highest propensity for spontaneous activation, possibly because it's NRR is less tightly locked in the ADAM metalloprotease resistant state (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In addition, models with NOTCH3 amplification/overexpression such as HCC1143 also show evidence of activated NOTCH3 signaling (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. 5</xref>). Alternatively, NOTCH3 activation could be ligand dependent in these models, which is consistent with expression of the Notch ligands such as JAG1 and DLL4 in the bone microenvironment (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). A complete understanding of the extent to which NOTCH3 signaling activation populates the T-ALL landscape as well as other cancers will require screening of a large collection of samples and follow-up detailed mechanistic studies. Pre-screening of these samples with the ICD3 antibody should identify the subset of tumor samples with the highest likelihood of harboring NOTCH3 mutations. Ultimately a combination of genome sequencing as well as reagents that can detect NOTCH3 activation will enable identification of patients who may be effectively treated with NOTCH3 antibodies, such as those reported here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S10"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell Lines and PDX Models</title><p id="P21">Cell lines and PDX models were routinely authenticated by SNP fingerprinting and tested for mycoplasma.
