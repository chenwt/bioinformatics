id="P3">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a frequently lethal disease with heterogeneous outcomes and drug responses. To resolve inconsistencies among the reported gene expression&#x02013;based CRC classifications and facilitate clinical translation, we formed an international consortium dedicated to large-scale data sharing and analytics across expert groups. We show marked interconnectivity between six independent classification systems coalescing into four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) with distinguishing features: CMS1 (MSI Immune, 14%), hypermutated, microsatellite unstable, strong immune activation; CMS2 (Canonical, 37%), epithelial, chromosomally unstable, marked WNT and MYC signaling activation; CMS3 (Metabolic, 13%), epithelial, evident metabolic dysregulation; and CMS4 (Mesenchymal, 23%), prominent transforming growth factor &#x003b2; activation, stromal invasion, and angiogenesis. Samples with mixed features (13%) possibly represent a transition phenotype or intra-tumoral heterogeneity. We consider the CMS groups the most robust classification system currently available for CRC &#x02013; with clear biological interpretability &#x02013; and the basis for future clinical stratification and subtype&#x02013;based targeted interventions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Gene expression-based subtyping is widely accepted as a relevant source of disease stratification<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Despite the widespread use, its translational and clinical utility is hampered by discrepant results, likely related to differences in data processing and algorithms applied to diverse patient cohorts, sample preparation methods, and gene expression platforms. In the absence of a clear methodological gold standard to perform such analyses, a more general framework that integrates and compares multiple strategies is needed to define common disease patterns in a principled, unbiased manner. Here, we describe such a framework and its application to elucidate the intrinsic subtypes of colorectal cancer (CRC).</p><p id="P5">Inspection of the published gene expression-based CRC classifications<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> revealed only superficial similarities. For example, all groups identified one tumor subtype enriched for microsatellite instability (MSI) and one subtype characterized by high expression of mesenchymal genes, but failed to achieve full consistency among the other subtypes. We envisioned that a comprehensive cross-comparison of subtype assignments obtained by the various approaches on a common set of samples could resolve inconsistencies in both the number and interpretation of CRC subtypes. The CRC Subtyping Consortium (CRCSC) was formed to assess the presence or absence of core subtype patterns among existing gene expression-based CRC subtyping algorithms. Recognizing that transcriptomics represents the level of high-throughput molecular data that is most intimately linked to cellular/tumor phenotype and clinical behavior, we also wanted to characterize the key biological features of the core subtypes, integrate and confront all other available data sources (mutation, copy number, methylation, microRNA, proteomics), and assess whether the subtype assignment correlated with patient outcome. Furthermore, our aim was to establish an important paradigm for collaborative, community-based cancer subtyping that will facilitate the translation of molecular subtypes into the clinic, not only for CRC but other malignancies as well.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Comparison of published molecular subtyping platforms</title><p id="P6">We evaluated the results of six CRC subtyping algorithms<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, each developed independently utilizing different gene expression data sets and analytical approaches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> summarizes the workflow of our analysis. Eighteen CRC data sets (<italic>n</italic> = 4,151 patients), both public (GSE42284, GSE33113, GSE39582, GSE35896, GSE13067, GSE13294, GSE14333, GSE17536, GSE20916, GSE2109, GSE2109, TCGA) and proprietary<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), consisting of multiple gene expression platforms (Affymetrix, Agilent, and RNA-sequencing), sample types (fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded [FFPE]), and study designs (retrospective and prospective series, and one clinical trial<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>) were uniformly pre-processed and normalized from raw formats to reduce technical variation. The six expert groups applied their subtyping classification algorithm to each of the data sets separately to ensure correct method utilization and interpretation of results. The output of this workflow was six different subtype labels per sample.</p><p id="P7">We developed a network-based approach to study the association among the six CRC classification systems, each consisting of three to six subtypes and collectively numbering 27 unique subtype labels. In this association network, nodes corresponded to the union of all group subtypes (<italic>n</italic> = 27), and weighted edges encoded the Jaccard similarity coefficients between nodes. We then applied a Markov Cluster (MCL) algorithm<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> to this network to detect the presence of robust network substructures that would indicate recurring subtype patterns. During network clustering using MCL, network granularity is controlled by inflation factor <italic>f</italic>, which is associated with the number of clusters<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. For varying inflation factors, we compared the corresponding clustering performances using <italic>weighted silhouette width</italic> (<bold>Online Methods</bold>). Using the optimal inflation factor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), we identified four robust consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) with significant interconnectivity (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001, hypergeometric test) among the six independent classification systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). The network-based approach revealed a set of core consensus samples, i.e., tumors representative of each CMS (3,104 of 3,962 samples [78%]) with a high concordance in subtype labels among the groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05, hypergeometric test). The remaining unlabeled (non-consensus) samples, which did not have a consistent pattern of subtype label association, represented a substantial proportion of primary tumors (<italic>n</italic> = 858 [22%]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Importantly, these samples were distributed across all data sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). In addition, visualization of the global patient network revealed that non-consensus samples remained scattered between the four large primary modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Consensus molecular subtype classification</title><p id="P8">Using the CMS labels of the core consensus samples as a &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019;, we developed a novel classification framework for predicting CMS subtypes using aggregated gene expression data from all cohorts (<bold>Online Methods</bold>). CMS labeled samples were split into two equal partitions for training and validation, and a Random Forest classifier was generated from 500 balanced bootstraps of the training data. When applied to the validation data, the classifier demonstrated robust performance across gene expression platforms (Affymetrix, Agilent, and RNA-sequencing) and sample collections (FFPE, fresh-frozen) with a &#x0003e;90% balanced accuracy across all subtypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">Supplementary Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). This corroborates both the portability of the classifier as well as the evident subtype-specific signals across datasets.</p><p id="P9">The CMS classifier allowed characterization of the originally unlabeled samples from network analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 858). Using a conservative posterior probability threshold with high specificity (<bold>Online Methods</bold>), we were able to assign 40% of these samples (<italic>n</italic> = 339) to a single subtype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) and the remaining unclassified samples (<italic>n</italic> = 519 [13% of the overall population]) had heterogeneous patterns of CMS mixtures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). We confirmed that &#x02018;mixed&#x02019; samples were not outliers and did not represent a fifth independent subtype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), although the quality of gene expression data could have affected a small subset of samples (<bold>Online Methods</bold>). The final distribution of the CMS groups is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, including &#x02018;mixed&#x02019; or indeterminate samples.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Biological characterization of the consensus molecular subtypes</title><p id="P10">We studied additional molecular data that was available for a subset of the samples in our cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) to delineate the biological characteristics of each CMS group. With respect to genomic aberrations, CMS1 samples were hypermutated and had low prevalence of somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a&#x02013;c and e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">Supplementary Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">6</xref>). CMS1 encompassed the majority of MSI tumors and had overexpression of proteins involved in DNA damage repair in reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis, consistent with defective DNA mismatch repair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). As expected, analysis of methylation profiles in TCGA showed that CMS1 tumors display a widespread hypermethylation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Conversely, CMS2-4 displayed higher chromosomal instability (CIN) as measured by SCNA counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). We detected more frequent copy number gains in oncogenes and losses in tumor suppressor genes in CMS2 than in the other subtypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Notably, CMS3 samples had a distinctive global genomic and epigenomic profile as compared with other CIN tumors: (i) consistently fewer SCNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,c and e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">Supplementary Table 5</xref>), an association not explained by differences in tumor purity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">Supplementary Table 5</xref>); (ii) nearly 30% were hypermutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">Supplementary Table 5</xref>), which overlapped with MSI status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>); and (iii) higher prevalence of CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) low cluster in TCGA samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">Supplementary Table 5</xref>), with intermediate levels of gene hypermethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Next, we sought to identify mutations that specifically associate with the CMS groups. Although we found clear enrichment of certain mutations within subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">Supplementary Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD17">8</xref>), e.g. <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations frequently occurring in CMS1 &#x02013; in line with the known association of this event with MSI tumors<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> &#x02013; and <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations overrepresented in CMS3, none of the subtypes is defined by an individual event, nor is any genetic aberration limited to a subtype. Similarly, we detected no unique and recurrent SCNA that strongly associated with a subtype, albeit amplifications of the transcription factor <italic>HNF4A</italic> were enriched in CMS2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">Supplementary Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">6</xref>). Since single genomic aberrations do not clearly delineate the CMS groups, we performed an integrative analysis of mutations and copy number events using TCGA data to find signal transduction cascades that might underlie the biology of the various subtypes. Apart from the nearly universal genetic activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in CMS1 and CMS3, no specific associations were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). This supports the notion that tumors harboring commonly assumed driver events in CRC still vary significantly in their biology and highlights the very poor genotype-phenotype correlations in this disease.</p><p id="P12">We then focused on the gene expression data and performed gene set enrichment analysis using previously described signatures of pathway activity and well-characterized cellular processes. These analyses provided substantial insight into the biological understanding of the CMS groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). CMS1 is characterized by increased expression of genes associated with a diffuse immune infiltrate, mainly composed of T<sub>H</sub>1 and cytotoxic T cells, along with strong activation of immune evasion pathways, an emerging feature of MSI CRC<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 9</xref>).

Thanks to collaborative bioinformatics work on the largest collection of CRC cohorts with molecular annotation to date, and building upon previous efforts by the independent researchers, the consortium resulted in a consensus molecular classification system that allows the categorization of most tumors into one of four robust subtypes. Marked differences in the intrinsic biological underpinnings of each subtype support the new taxonomy of this disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) that will facilitate future research in this field and should be adopted by the community for CRC stratification: CMS1 (MSI Immune), CMS2 (Canonical), CMS3 (Metabolic), and CMS4 (Mesenchymal). From a biological perspective, we were able to refine the number and interpretation of the &#x02018;non-MSI&#x02019; subtypes, which represent nearly 85% of the primary CRC samples. We also describe strong molecular associations where previous work was fragmented and inconsistent, particularly in samples lacking a mesenchymal phenotype. From a clinical perspective, in CRC as for many cancer types, it remains unclear what features will provide the most relevant subclassification tool. Gene expression subtypes have been extensively investigated in breast cancer, gene mutations and fusions in lung cancer, chromosomal alterations in hematological malignancies and histological features in sarcomas, but whether combinations of these features is needed for accurate prediction of prognosis or drug responses is still unknown. In CRC, few biomarkers have been translated to patient care, including <italic>RAS</italic>, <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations, MSI and CIMP status. It is important to emphasize that even though the CMS groups are enriched for some genomic and epigenomic markers, their associations described here are weak and do not allow categorization of gene expression subtypes, reinforcing the notion that transcriptional signatures allow refinement of disease subclassification beyond what can be achieved by currently validated biomarkers<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. For example, <italic>RAS</italic> wild type tumors are considered a homogenous entity for therapeutic decisions in the advanced setting, despite being found across distinct CMS groups with profound biological differences, which are expected to translate into heterogeneous drug responses.</p><sec id="S8"><title>Future steps and resources</title><p id="P18">Qualitative and clinically relevant disease subtyping takes time and multiple resources. Our effort of CRC subclassification is a stepwise process aiming to involve a large number of relevant researchers from the CRC research community at first, and then subsequently cooperative groups, pharmaceutical companies and regulatory agencies. We postulate that the identification of molecularly homogeneous subsets of CRC tumors &#x02013; and the characterization of potential driver events in these samples &#x02013; will advance effective drug development strategies. Recently, MSI status was found to predict benefit of immune checkpoint blockade in advanced CRC, corroborating the value of integrating knowledge on the underlying biology with drug development strategies<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.

This can be due to the drugs themselves, with promiscuous mechanisms of action that may not track well with single pathway descriptors, or our inability to properly define pathway engagement or cross-talk using static omics data. Reanalysis of relevant clinical trials using semi-supervised approaches based on pre-defined patient subgroups and allowing for further discovery based on observed outcomes may be the best alternative for the research community. Our current work, providing the consensual best description of CRC heterogeneity available today, aims at providing exactly that tool for systematic interrogation in different clinical settings. It will also accelerate the application of gene classifications to cell lines, organoids and patient-derived xenograft models with drug sensitivity data.</p><p id="P20">To enable retrospective and prospective stratified explorations, we are releasing a set of CMS classifiers to be used by the community as research tools (R package available for download, see <bold>Online Methods</bold>), either in the context of population studies (original Random Forest classifier described above, which requires data normalization) or for use in a single sample setting (alternative Pearson-based predictor, optimized to be less dependent on pre-processing of gene expression data). Importantly, samples that do not fall within the four CMS groups should be considered separately as indeterminate subtypes, yet of unknown biological and clinical behavior.</p><p id="P21">To conclude, we believe that the framework presented here provides a common foundation of CRC subtyping, to be further refined in the future as other sources of &#x02018;omics&#x02019; data are integrated and clinical outcomes under specific drug interventions become available.

Overall design</title><p id="P22">The design and workflow of this project is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. There were six participating groups, each who had previously developed and published a methodology for classifying CRC samples using gene expression data (described below). An additional group was designated as an &#x0201c;evaluation group&#x0201d; (Sage Bionetworks) to run an unbiased comparative analysis. All public and proprietary data sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) were uploaded into a common data repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.synapse.org">www.synapse.org</ext-link>)<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. This project focused on the secondary analysis of existing de-identified genomic and clinical data. No readily identifiable information was included in these data sets and all patients had previously given informed consent for use of the data in future CRC research at time of specimen collection. Gene expression data was accessible to all groups, and non-expression data (i.e. clinical, molecular annotations) were accessible only to the evaluation group. Each data set was processed and normalized once, using a single protocol per platform (see section on &#x0201c;Gene expression processing and normalization&#x0201d;). While this decision precluded an analysis of the impact of gene expression normalization on subtyping, it significantly reduced the number of cross-group comparisons, and allowed this study to focus on biological interpretations of the different subtypes rather than on bioinformatic procedures. Each group then applied their subtyping classifier to the data sets in the common repository. Of note, the distribution of subtypes labels from each group as reported in corresponding subtyping publications was maintained in the collection of data sets form the consortium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>).

For each sample we then computed a vector of meta-gene scores by taking the median of the expression values for the genes in each module. On the resulting meta-gene expression matrix we applied hierarchical clustering using a consensus distance, followed by dendrogram pruning, which identified five distinct subtypes. A subset of the samples, which were reliably assigned to a subtype (so called core samples), was used to define a classifier. To build the classifier, we first converted the expression values for each gene to z-scores by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation across the core samples. Then, we computed meta-gene scores by taking the median of the expression values for each sample across the genes in each of the previously defined modules. The resulting meta-gene expression matrix was used as the input to train a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier for the five subtypes. To subtype the samples of an independent data set, we first computed z-scores for each gene across all samples, followed by meta-gene score computation as described above. After this preparation, the independent data set was submitted to the pre-trained LDA. For each sample, this returns the probability of belonging to each of the subtypes. In cases where a non-probabilistic partition of the samples into groups is sought, each sample is assigned to the subtype with the highest probability.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>2.2.

The resulting matrix was row-mean-centered. Our series was then split into a training set (<italic>n</italic> = 433) and a validation set (<italic>n</italic> = 123). CRC subtypes were derived from the training set, by applying consensus hierarchical clustering (consensus cluster plus procedure) to the expression profiles reduced to the most variant probe sets (<italic>n</italic> = 1,459). The consensus was calculated across 1,000 resampling iterations of the hierarchical clustering (linkage: Ward; inter-individual distance: 1 - Pearson correlation coefficient), each iteration being based on a random selection of 90% of the samples and 90% of the probe sets. To predict subtypes in independent data sets, we developed a centroid-based predictor using the most discriminative genes (57 genes). A tumor was assigned to the subtype of the closest centroid using diagonal LDA distance for Affymetrix data set and (1-Pearson correlation) for non-Affymetrix data sets.

Based on consensus clustering (1000 iterations, 0.98 subsampling ratio) and GAP statistics, we identified three robust clusters. Eighty-five samples with positive silhouette width were considered as the most representative samples and retained for following analysis. In order to allow cross-platform classification, we mapped probe sets to unique genes: for each gene we kept its corresponding probe set with highest overall expression. Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM)<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> and AUC (area under ROC curve) scores were employed to identify the most discriminative genes.

Finally, a PAM classifier of 146 unique genes was built with the optimal threshold for centroid shrinkage selected based on a trade-off between classification performance (error rate &#x0003c;2%) and the size of gene signature. To use the CCS classifier, expression profiles obtained after normalization were median centered across cancer samples. For microarray data generated based on platforms other than Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0, probe sets were mapped to gene symbols. Signature genes without annotation were substituted by genes with highest correlation as calculated from our core data set. Median centered expression profiles of signature genes were subjected to CCS classifier for subtype prediction, which returns the posterior probability that a cancer sample belongs to each subtype.

Briefly, iNMF proceeds in the following steps. First, we applied non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to 100 randomly selected groups of probe sets. Second, we hierarchically clustered samples based on how often they co-clustered in the 100 NMF runs and selected core clusters consisting of frequently co-clustering samples. Third, probe sets that were differentially expressed between the core clusters were selected as subtype signatures and all samples were assigned to subtypes by hierarchical clustering. Iteratively applying this procedure resulted in identification of five CRC subtypes. Independent data sets are subtyped by hierarchically clustering the samples using the expression signatures. In order to derive a probability value for a subtype assignment, we performed the hierarchical clustering on 10000 randomly selected bootstraps.

Moreover, not all genes are measured on all platforms, and those that are may be represented by different probes, which can give rise to inconsistent or even contradictory measurements and thus further highlights the need for careful data preprocessing before the merge.

We trained and validated our models using the aggregated data set (see &#x0201c;5.

The final classifier is then an ensemble of each of these decision trees. The RF algorithm has been well studied in the context of gene expression classifiers as it performs well with highly correlated, high-dimensional data, and is less prone to overfitting due to the averaging effect across many models<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Although the CMS subtypes do not occur with equal proportions, we trained our classifier using a <italic>balanced</italic> model approach, i.e. our model does not make <italic>a priori</italic> based assumptions about the frequency of each subtype. Therefore, for each iteration of the RF bootstrap, we randomly sample from each subtype in equal proportions.

To evaluate classifier performance across data sets (i.e. training in one set of data sets, and validating in an independent set of data sets), we performed two independent experiments. The first experiment utilized the GSE39582 (Affymetrix, fresh-frozen, <italic>n</italic> = 466), the TCGA (RNAseq, <italic>n</italic> = 459), and GSE17536 (Affymetrix, <italic>n</italic> = 147) data sets for model validation.

In general, performance metrics were robust with the exception of CMS3. Notably, sensitivity/specificity for CMS3 was 0.70/.98.

Next, we selected the most variable genes across samples using a standard deviation cut-off of one and fitted the factor analysis model to this dataset using Bayesian framework.

MicroRNA data analysis</title><p id="P89">For miRNA characterization of the four CMS groups, we used two independent data sets obtained from TCGA. Data set 1 includes Illumina GA sequencing data for 255 primary colorectal tumors, whereas data set 2 consists of Illumina HiSeq sequencing data for 241 primary colorectal tumors. For both data sets, we obtained Level 3 RPM (reads per million miRNA mapped) data from the TCGA data portal. The RPM data were log2-transformed after adding 1 pseudocount for the following analyses.</p><p id="P90">It has been confirmed previously that data set 1 has no serious batch effect<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. For data set 2, we examined potential non-biological batch effects with respect to tissue source site (TSS) and batch variables. For hierarchical clustering, the Ward&#x02019;s linkage algorithm was performed with dissimilarity scores calculated from 1-Pearson correlation coefficients. Overall, the hierarchical clustering results show that samples are well mixed among various tissue source sites and batches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>).</p><p id="P91">For differential expression analysis, we first filtered out samples that do not have a CMS assigned due to lack of mRNA expression data availability. The filtering step resulted in 197 samples for data set 1 and 200 samples for data set 2. For each data set, we performed differential expression analyses based on two sample <italic>t</italic>-tests, comparing each CMS with the other CMS groups. A high Pearson correlation coefficient was observed in the log2 fold change between data set 1 and 2 for each CMS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>), suggesting a high concordance between the two independent data sets. In both data sets 110 miRNAs are differentially expressed (Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg-corrected <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c; 0.05 and |log2 fold change| &#x0003e; 0.5) between at least one CMS and the others.</p><p id="P92">Differentially expressed miRNAs between CMSs were illustrated in a heatmap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8c</xref>). CMS2 can be characterized by the up-regulated mir-17-92 cluster, which is known to be bound and regulated by MYC<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. The upregulation of the mir-17-92 cluster is consistent with the fact that MYC signaling is promoted in CMS2. Out of the total six miRNAs down-regulated in CMS3, hsa-mir-143 and four miRNAs belonging to the let-7 family are known to bind and regulate the expression of RAS<sup><xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup>. The five miRNAs can be used for characterizing CMS3, which is featured with more activated RAS and MAPK signaling. CMS4 is enriched for downregulated miRNAs (e.g., hsa-mir-148a, the miR-192 and miR-200 families) that are known for tumor suppression. The miR-200 and miR-192 families regulate epithelial mesencgymal transition (EMT) pathway by targeting ZEB1 and/or ZEB2<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup>, whereas hsa-mir-148a is predicted by TargetScan<sup><xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> to regulate MMP13 and TGFB2, which are important for matrix remodeling and TGF&#x003b2; pathways. Taken together, the downregulation of miRNAs associated with suppression of the EMT, MR and TGF&#x003b2; associated signatures could explain why CMS4 is more aggressive and metastatic than the other CMSs.</p></sec><sec id="S38"><title>7.9.

By definition a SSP makes possible to predict a unique sample, and its output considering any given sample has to remain constant whether it is predicted alone or within a series of samples. A typical requirement of SSP is that they cannot be based on (intra-series) row-centered data, because row-centering is impacted by the composition of the series. Here the proposed SSP is multi-platform (RNA seq / single color microarray / two colors microarray) and as such doesn&#x02019;t include any normalization procedure (such procedures are platform dependent), meaning that the user has to provide normalized data, with a normalization procedure respecting the Single Sample &#x02018;spirit&#x02019; (such as single sample frozen RMA for Affymetrix microarrays, for example). Of note, the SSP reported here can be used on row-centered data with satisfactory results in most situations, however in such a case it cannot be any more seen as a Single Sample Predictor.</p><p id="P105">The SSP is implemented in the <italic>CMSclassifier</italic> R package. It is based on a similarity-to-centroid approach, with Pearson coefficient as similarity measure. It uses centroids of the CMS calculated for 693 discriminant genes (Entrez Ids), which were selected using the GSE39582 series based on AUC and fold change criterion. The CMS centroids were obtained for five series (TCGA COAD &#x02018;RNASeq V2 GA&#x02019;, TCGA COAD &#x02018;RNASeq V2 HiSeq&#x02019;, TCGA COAD &#x02018;Agilent&#x02019;, GSE39582, EMTAB990), yielding 20 centroids C<sub>i,j</sub> (i: CMS 1..4; j: series 1..5). To classify a given CRC sample, the SSP first calculates the similarity S<sub>i,j</sub> of the CRC sample expression profile (for the 693 discriminant genes) to the 20 centroids. The minimal similarity S<sub>i</sub> to each CMS in the 5 series is then reported (S<sub>i</sub> = Min<sub>j=1&#x02025;5</sub> S<sub>i,j</sub>). Then the nearest CMS i* is reported (S<sub>i*</sub>= Max<sub>i=1&#x02025;4</sub> S<sub>i</sub>). The similarity difference D between the two nearest CMS is also reported (D = Si* &#x02212; Si&#x02019;, with i&#x02019; being the second nearest CMS). Then if both S<sub>i*</sub> is above 0.15 and D is above 0.06 the sample is classified in CMS i*, otherwise its label is said undetermined.</p><p id="P106">The performance metrics of Random Forest and SSP classifiers using the consensus network class as &#x0201c;gold-standard&#x0201d; (<italic>n</italic> = 3,104 samples) is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Table 16</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS722223-supplement-1.docx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e2149" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD10"><label>2</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS722223-supplement-2.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e2153" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD11"><label>3</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS722223-supplement-3.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e2157" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD12"><label>4</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS722223-supplement-4.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e2161" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD13"><label>5</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS722223-supplement-5.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e2165" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD14"><label>6</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS722223-supplement-6.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e2169" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD15"><label>7</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS722223-supplement-7.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e2173" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD16"><label>8</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS722223-supplement-8.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e2177" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD17"><label>9</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS722223-supplement-9.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e2181" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>10</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS722223-supplement-10.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e2185" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>11</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS722223-supplement-11.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e2190" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>12</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS722223-supplement-12.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e2194" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>13</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS722223-supplement-13.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e2198" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>14</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS722223-supplement-14.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e2202" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>15</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS722223-supplement-15.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e2206" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>16</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS722223-supplement-16.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e2210" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD9"><label>17</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS722223-supplement-17.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e2214" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN3"><p id="P107"><bold>Accession codes</bold>
