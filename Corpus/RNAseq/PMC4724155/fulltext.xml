In RA, which mainly affects peripheral joints, chronic inflammation is characterized by synovial hyperplasia, pannus formation, cartilage destruction, and bone erosion, leading to destruction of joint architecture and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In axial SpA, chronic inflammation predominantly affects the sacroiliac joints and vertebral bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This is accompanied by local bone erosion and more prominent new bone formation, leading to joint ankylosis and syndesmophyte development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, new bone formation may develop at sites of peripheral enthesial inflammation in SpA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which is a particularly prominent finding in psoriatic arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Matrix-degrading enzymes, osteoclasts, and invasion of chronically activated synoviocytes are implicated in bone destruction in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], but little is known about the mechanisms involved in inflammation-driven new bone formation, occurring mostly in SpA rather than in RA. Histological analysis of facet joints from patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), the progressed form of axial SpA, showed erosive damage of the subchondral bone from the bone marrow side. This damage is driven by osteoclasts located at the leading edge of a subchondral fibroblast-rich granulation tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which invades the subchondral bone. New bone formation has been linked to this subchondral pannus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], suggesting that bone destruction and new bone formation could be linked. In contrast, in mouse models of SpA, specifically in the DBA/1 model, where grouped caging of male DBA/1 mice leads to development of ankylosing enthesitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], destruction and bone formation do not seem to be linked, because inhibition of osteoclast function does not prevent new bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The delayed-type hypersensitivity arthritis (DTHA) model is a new inflammatory arthritis model in C57BL/6 mice. It combines collagen type II antibody (anti-CII) administration with local DTH induction in the footpad, which leads to severe arthritis and periarticular inflammation, including enthesial sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Arthritis development is dependent on CD4<sup>+</sup> cells and proinflammatory cytokines and is characterized by bone and cartilage destruction, pannus formation, and osteophyte development at sites of periarticular inflammation. Prophylactic tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) blockade not only reduces inflammation and bone erosion but also prevents new bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], indicating that both bone destruction and bone formation are triggered by inflammation in this model.</p><p>In this study, we determined the relationship between bone destruction and new bone formation in the DTHA model. We investigated the spatiotemporal occurrence of bone destruction and new bone formation by histological analysis, by performing an expression analysis of genes involved in tissue destruction and bone formation, and by analysis of the effect of preventive receptor activator of nuclear factor &#x003ba;B ligand (RANKL) blockade. Cartilage destruction and bone erosion peaked early after arthritis induction, while periarticular bone formation occurred later in the disease course. Bone erosion was accompanied by osteoclastogenesis and high levels of local bone resorptive activity, followed by induction of genes related to endochondral and direct bone formation. Anti-RANKL treatment had a modest effect on inflammation and prevented bone resorption but did not affect bone formation, indicating that bone formation and destruction are not linked in the DTHA model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p>Female 8&#x02013;10-week-old C57BL/6&#x000a0;J mice were purchased from Taconic (Ry, Denmark).

For detection of cartilage destruction, Safranin O staining was performed. Collagen type X (COLX)-positive hypertrophic chondrocytes and osteocalcin-positive osteoblasts were detected by immunohistochemical staining. Osteoclasts were histochemically stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP; Kamiya Biomedical, Seattle, WA, USA). For osteocalcin staining, heat-induced epitope retrieval at 100&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;minutes in citrate buffer (pH&#x000a0;6.0) and subsequent enzymatic retrieval with proteinase K (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 7&#x000a0;minutes was used. For COLX detection, a double enzymatic retrieval with protease (Sigma-Aldrich) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 2&#x000a0;mg/ml) at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 15&#x000a0;minutes and hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich) in TBS (2&#x000a0;mg/ml) at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 150&#x000a0;minutes was used. After blocking of nonspecific binding by goat serum (10&#x000a0;%; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) for 15&#x000a0;minutes, sections were incubated with anti-osteocalcin (polyclonal rabbit, dilution 1:500; Enzo Life Sciences AG, Lausen, Switzerland) and anti-COLX (clone X53, dilution 1:25; Quartett Immunodiagnostics, Berlin, Germany) overnight at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. After blocking of endogenous biotin with an Invitrogen avidin&#x02013;biotin-blocking kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Paisley, UK) the slides were incubated for 1&#x000a0;h with species-specific biotinylated immunoglobulin (Dianova) and for 1&#x000a0;h with alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). ALP was visualized using Chromogen Red (Dako REAL Detection System Kit; Dako) before counterstaining with Mayer&#x02019;s hematoxylin.

Cat B 750 FAST is a cathepsin B activatable fluorescence agent. It is optically silent upon injection but cleaves upon contact with cathepsin B, thereby emitting a fluorescent signal. Mice were scanned approximately 20&#x000a0;h after probe injection. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and gently placed in a dorsal position in the fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) cassette. Their paws were placed on FMT scanner blocks and kept in place with surgical tape.

We show that cartilage damage and bone destruction precede bone formation. Cartilage and bone damage coincide with increased local cathepsin B proteolytic activity, increased systemic MMP3 levels, and development of invasive pannus tissue periarticularly and at sites of the subchondral bone marrow. New bone development was observed at apophyseal sites mediated primarily by endochondral ossification and at diaphyseal bone sites mediated by direct bone formation. This was accompanied by upregulation of genes involved in endochondral bone formation, such as <italic>MMP2</italic>, <italic>MMP9</italic>, and <italic>MMP13</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and by induction of osteoblast-specific genes, such as osteocalcin and ALP, in the paw tissue.</p><p>In accordance with findings in other arthritis models, we found that osteoclasts are crucially involved in joint destruction in DTHA. Osteoclast development from osteoclast precursors, monocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs) is induced by ligation of RANK by RANKL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. RANKL was upregulated early after arthritis induction, and RANKL protein levels peaked on day 4 after arthritis induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Activated osteoclasts were seen on day 5 after arthritis induction and peaked on day 10. They were located primarily at the apophyseal attachment regions of the periarticular pannus tissue close to vascular channels penetrating the bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and at the edges of the granulation tissue within the subchondral bone marrow. Treatment with anti-RANKL abrogated bone destruction in DTHA and prevented development of the subchondral granulation tissue. This suggests that osteoclast activity promotes generation of this subchondral tissue, most likely by promoting invasion of periarticular pannus tissue or inflammatory mediators into the bone marrow through the vascular channels. This seems to be a critical step in joint destruction, as the granulation tissue strongly contributes to the joint destruction process, which can be prevented by anti-RANKL treatment. Similarly to our study, anti-RANKL treatment resulted in reduced bone destruction in the collagen antibody&#x02013;induced arthritis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and RANKL<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed reduced bone erosion in the K/BxN serum transfer arthritis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to anti-TNF&#x003b1; treatment, which abrogated both cartilage and bone damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], anti-RANKL treatment prevented only bone destruction and not cartilage damage. This suggests that cartilage damage is mediated independently of osteoclasts, most likely by proteolytic enzymes such as metalloproteinases induced by proinflammatory cytokines. However, anti-RANKL treatment also had a modest anti-inflammatory effect: It lowered systemic levels of SAP and MMP3 after immunization and mBSA challenge and resulted in slightly reduced paw swelling at later points. Although RANK&#x02013;RANKL interaction may affect T effector cell generation by promoting the survival and inflammatory cytokine production of DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the fact that early paw swelling was unaffected in anti-RANKL-treated mice suggests that anti-RANKL treatment may constrain inflammation to local tissue and prevent systemic spreading rather than abrogating T-cell priming.</p><p>Inhibition of bone destruction by anti-RANKL treatment had no preventive effect on new bone formation, although bone erosion and bone formation occurred sequentially in DTHA. Similarly, blocking RANKL signaling in two different rat models of arthritis could not prevent periarticular bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and in the DBA/1 SpA model inhibition of osteoclast activity by zoledronate did not abrogate induction of ankylosis either [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>BMP2, which is a growth factor that stimulates chondrocyte differentiation as well as osteoblast differentiation, has been implicated in the process of bone formation and ankylosis in the DBA/1 enthesitis model. Thus, inhibition of BMP signaling by overexpression of noggin, which is an endogenous BMP antagonist, inhibited the onset and the progression of enthesitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In our study, BMP2 and BMP7 were downregulated within the arthritic paw, which is similar to findings in the collagen-induced arthritis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. While BMPs were downregulated, we found upregulation of TGF-&#x003b2;1 after acute inflammation in DTHA had subsided. TGF-&#x003b2; has effects similar to those of BMPs on bone and chondrocyte precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], suggesting that new bone formation may be driven by TGF-&#x003b2;1 in DTHA. Moreover, expression of DKK-1, a Wnt pathway inhibitor that promotes osteoblast differentiation, was not dysregulated during early arthritis but was increased at day 8, when bone formation had begun, which may indicate the presence of feedback control of the aberrant bone formation.</p><p>Thus, extraarticular new bone formation in the DTHA model is not dependent on the preceding osteoclastic damage and seems differently regulated than in the DBA/1 model of SpA. Elucidation of this mechanism is desirable, as it may provide additional clues about the development of enthesiophytes and the regulation of inflammation-driven new bone formation. The shift from inflammation to resolution of inflammation as well as the presence of extensive extraarticular tissue damage may promote new bone formation in the DTHA model. Apart from that, we provide evidence for the impact of the subchondral granulation tissue on bone destruction and the crucial role of osteoclasts for development of the subchondral bone marrow changes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Bone destruction and bone formation occur sequentially in the DTHA model.
