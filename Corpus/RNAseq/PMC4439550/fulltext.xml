Several biochemical pathways have been implicated in aminoglycoside antibiotic ototoxicity; however, little is known about how hair cells respond to aminoglycoside antibiotics at the transcriptome level. Here we have investigated the genome-wide response to the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin. Using organotypic cultures of the perinatal organ of Corti, we performed RNA sequencing using cDNA libraries obtained from FACS-purified hair cells. Within 3 h of gentamicin treatment, the messenger RNA level of more than three thousand genes in hair cells changed significantly. Bioinformatic analysis of these changes highlighted several known signal transduction pathways, including the JNK pathway and the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, in addition to genes involved in the stress response, apoptosis, cell cycle control, and DNA damage repair. In contrast, only 698 genes, mainly involved in cell cycle and metabolite biosynthetic processes, were significantly affected in the non-hair cell population. The gene expression profiles of hair cells in response to gentamicin share a considerable similarity with those previously observed in gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity. Our findings suggest that previously observed early responses to gentamicin in hair cells in specific signaling pathways are reflected in changes in gene expression. Additionally, the observed changes in gene expression of cell cycle regulatory genes indicate a disruption of the postmitotic state, which may suggest an alternate pathway regulating gentamicin-induced apoptotic hair cell death. This work provides a more comprehensive view of aminoglycoside antibiotic ototoxicity, and thus contributes to identifying potential pathways or therapeutic targets to alleviate this important side effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sensory hair cells</kwd><kwd>aminoglycoside antibiotics</kwd><kwd>gentamicin</kwd><kwd>ototoxicity</kwd><kwd>RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>differential gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="5"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="39"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="9470"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ototoxicity is a well-known side effect limiting the use of aminoglycoside antibiotics, with reported incidence of hearing loss between 2% and 25% of treated patients (Huth et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Several biochemical mechanisms of aminoglycoside ototoxicity have been investigated, including production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Forge and Schacht, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), disruption of intracellular calcium storage (Matsui et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), and inhibition of cytoplasmic protein synthesis (Francis et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Through biochemical assays, some pathways have also been identified as signaling pathways mediating aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death, such as the pro-apoptotic JNK pathway (Ylikoski et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) and the protective NF-&#x003ba;B pathway (Jiang et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Based on observations made in organ cultures, a timeline of critical signaling events has been established. ROS production is induced shortly after aminoglycoside administration; the JNK pathway responds to drug treatment within 3 h; the intracellular calcium level is increased dramatically at around 4 h; cytochrome C is released into cytoplasm at around 12 h and apoptosis execution steps occur at around 18 h (Matsui et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><p>The methods utilizing low-throughput biochemical assays have been instrumental in dissecting some of the sequelae of antibiotic treatment of hair cells. However, cells are complex systems that integrate input from multiple mechanisms and respond by adjusting multiple pathways simultaneously. High-throughput methods may help us gain a better understanding of the ototoxicity associated with aminoglycosides by providing a complex view of the response; among them, DNA microarray and antibody array experiments have been performed to profile the changes in the cochlea after ototoxic drug treatment at the transcriptional level and the protein level, respectively (Nagy et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Jamesdaniel et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). However, whole cochlea samples were used in those studies, which consisted largely of many different non-hair cell populations in addition to hair cells, and the heterogeneity of the samples limited the interpretation of the results due to a low signal to noise ratio.</p><p>Here we have utilized RNA sequencing to investigate the early gene expression changes in hair cells induced by the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin. Compared to microarray analysis, RNA sequencing is more accurate for analyzing expression levels, more informative for pathway analysis, and more powerful in exploiting unannotated genes (Wang et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). We made use of the Atoh1-GFP transgenic mice, whose fluorescent reporter under the control of the Atoh1 enhancer faithfully identifies hair cells (Lumpkin et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), to purify GFP+ hair cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) after a 3 h gentamicin treatment for a direct analysis of gene expression changes by RNA sequencing. We chose the 3 h time point because it was previously shown that signaling pathways have initiated a response to the drug, but the cell death process did not appear to be initiated (Matsui et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). We present analyses of the gene changes associated with several major pathways known to be dysregulated in response to aminoglycoside antibiotics.</p><p>Genome wide, 3709 genes, including those involved in a variety of pathways and cellular processes, were found to change significantly in hair cells after gentamicin treatment. Genes involved in the JNK pathway and the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway were differentially expressed in gentamicin-treated hair cells, which is consistent with previous findings that these pathways are important for aminoglycoside ototoxicity (Ylikoski et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Jiang et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Surprisingly, we did not observe a strong stress response at the transcriptional level at this early time point. Comparison of gentamicin-induced gene expression changes in hair cells and data from other cell lines and tissues, revealed a similarity between aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death and neuronal cell death, as well as a resemblance between aminoglycoside ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Additionally, genes involved in the cell cycle and DNA damage repair were also strongly affected by gentamicin at the transcriptional level, indicating a gentamicin-induced disruption of the postmitotic state, which may underlie an alternate pathway leading to hair cell death. In contrast, significantly fewer genes (698 genes) with altered expression after gentamicin treatment were present in the non-hair cell population at this time. Interestingly, expression of genes involved in cell cycle and metabolite biosynthesis pathways were significantly affected in this population. Analyses of our RNA sequencing data indicate that prior to severe oxidative stress, multiple events, including previously implicated activation of the JNK and the NF-&#x003ba;B pathways, and newly hypothesized disruption of the postmitotic state, occur in hair cells in response to aminoglycoside antibiotic treatment. Our work provides a comprehensive view of aminoglycoside ototoxicity, and our transcriptome data could be used to analyze other potential signaling pathways or biological processes mediating aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death which are not covered here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Organotypic culture, drug treatment, and FACS sorting</title><p>Atoh1-GFP transgenic mice on CD-1 background (Lumpkin et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; available in the Jackson Laboratory but in different genomic background: B6.129S-Atoh1<sup>tm4.1Hzo</sup>/J) were used for this study.

The PCA analysis of our RNA sequencing data shows that 71.88% variance in the dataset was captured within the three most significant principal components (PCs): 49.91% in PC1 (X axis), 13.53% in PC2 (Y axis), and 8.44% in PC3 (Z axis) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). These PCs correspond to different cell types and different treatment conditions.</p><p>In the PCA map, each biological replicate of different experimental groups is represented by one dot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). PCA analysis indicates that the variance among the replicates of FACS-purified hair cells is low. Three untreated hair cell replicates cluster tightly in the PCA map (red dots), as do three gentamicin-treated hair cell replicates (blue dots) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). This tight clustering indicates low statistical variance between replicates, and likely stems from the low cellular heterogeneity among FACS-purified replicates. In contrast, both treated (green dots) and untreated (yellow dots) samples from the non-hair cell replicates, which include all other cells in our dissected epithelial preparations, are scattered in the PCA map (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), indicating the higher statistical variance among replicates of the non-hair cell samples. Hair cell samples and the non-hair cell samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, red vs. yellow) lie at the two ends of the most significant variance axis (PC1, X axis), suggesting that the hair cell gene expression profile is significantly different from the non-hair cell population. Along the second variance axis (PC2, Y axis), gentamicin-treated hair cell samples are separated from untreated hair cell samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, blue vs. red), indicating the significant gene expression shift in hair cells caused by gentamicin treatment at the 3 h time point. In contrast, the non-hair cell samples are not separated by gentamicin treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, green vs. yellow), suggesting that the gentamicin-induced gene expression shift in the non-hair cell population was not as consistent as the one in hair cells. Together, the PCA results suggest that gentamicin treatment induced significant and consistent gene expression changes in hair cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Signaling pathways and biological processes affected by gentamicin in hair cells</title><p>Gene expression in hair cells was affected significantly by gentamicin treatment at 3 h, as shown by the large number of deregulated genes and by the PCA results. To investigate the underlying biological pathways affected in hair cells upon gentamicin treatment, IPA software (Qiagen) was used to analyze affected signaling pathways after gentamicin treatment, and to compare our hair cell datasets with datasets derived from other cell lines and tissues. Pathways affected by gentamicin treatment at 3 h are listed in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>. Below we verify and discuss several of these pathways that have been reported to be important in aminoglycoside induced hair cell death, as well as proposing that elements of the cell cycle may provide an additional pathway, signaling apoptosis in hair cells.</p><sec><title>Expression of JNK pathway-related genes was significantly affected by gentamicin</title><p>The JNK pathway has been strongly implicated in aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death. After aminoglycoside treatment, phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun was observed in hair cells (Ylikoski et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), indicating activation of the JNK pathway. Furthermore, inhibition of the JNK pathway by pharmaceutical inhibitors has been shown to protect hair cells from aminoglycoside ototoxicity (Ylikoski et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), suggesting that JNK activation may be involved in mediating aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death.</p><p>Consistent with these findings, we observed changes in the expression of genes involved in JNK signaling pathways upon gentamicin treatment. We verified the expression changes of three genes in this pathway by Q-PCR, namely <italic>Atf2, Mapk8</italic> (<italic>Jnk1</italic>), and <italic>Jun</italic> (<italic>c-Jun</italic>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). IPA pathway analysis revealed that the expression of JNK pathway-related genes was significantly affected in gentamicin-treated hair cells (<italic>p</italic> = 0.000001). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> (color coded, see legend), <italic>Mapk8</italic> (<italic>Jnk1</italic>) itself, in addition to several upstream and downstream factors including <italic>Jun, Atf2, Nfatc1</italic>, and <italic>Elk1</italic>, were changed at the transcriptional level in gentamicin-treated hair cells. Interestingly, the induction of <italic>Jun</italic> expression is regulated by phosphorylation of Jun itself, in an autoregulatory loop, by JNK (Angel et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>); thus the increased mRNA expression of <italic>Jun</italic> indicates the likely activation of the JNK pathway. Transcriptional changes in other targets of Jun regulation are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref>. The pattern of changed expression of JNK pathway-related genes is consistent with the timeline of critical signaling events for aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death, indicating that the JNK pathway is one of the early response pathways that are activated in hair cells after aminoglycoside treatment (Matsui et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Genes involved in the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway were expressed differentially after gentamicin treatment</title><p>Activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway has been implicated as protective against aminoglycoside ototoxicity in several biochemical assays (Jiang et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Aminoglycoside treatment has been shown to increase DNA binding activity of NF-&#x003ba;B, indicating activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway by aminoglycoside antibiotics (Jiang et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Additionally, reagents promoting NF-&#x003ba;B translocation into nuclei reportedly protect hair cells from aminoglycoside ototoxicity (Jiang et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>Our RNA sequencing data show that the expression of genes involved in the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway was altered in hair cells after gentamicin treatment.

Fold changes based on RNA sequencing were smaller but remained highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). In IPA pathway analysis, the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway was identified as a significantly affected pathway in gentamicin-treated hair cells (<italic>p</italic> = 0.00004). Expression changes of genes involved in the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>. Among these genes, <italic>Nfkb1</italic> and <italic>Nfkbib</italic> have been identified as target genes of NF-&#x003ba;B (Ten et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Schreiber et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), and their increased expression strongly suggests the activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway in gentamicin-treated hair cells. Transcriptional changes in other NF-&#x003ba;B targets are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref>. Our expression data indicate that the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, like the JNK pathway, is an early response pathway that is activated in hair cells by aminoglycosides.</p></sec><sec><title>No significant stress response was observed at the transcriptional level for NRF2 target genes at the 3 h time point</title><p>The prevailing hypothesis of aminoglycoside ototoxicity holds that aminoglycoside-induced ROS production causes oxidative stress, which triggers apoptosis in hair cells. Cellular ROS levels are reported to increase within minutes of aminoglycoside administration <italic>in vitro</italic> (Hirose et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), and antioxidant reagents are shown to protect hair cells from aminoglyocside ototoxicity (Schacht, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). In addition, the oxidative stress response mediated by the transcription factor NRF2 (Nfe2l2) has been implicated in aminoglycoside ototoxicity (Hoshino et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Therefore, a response to oxidative stress at the transcriptional level was expected. Surprisingly, although some genes upstream of the Nrf2-dependent oxidative stress pathway were upregulated in response to gentamicin at 3 h, the transcriptional key regulator Nrf2 (Nfe2l2), was not affected, nor were its well-studied transcriptional targets (Ma, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref>). We interpret this to mean that at this early time point, the Nrf2 oxidative stress pathway has not been fully activated. One explanation for this might be that at the 3 h time point, aminoglycoside-induced ROS production had not increased to a level sufficient to overwhelm the highly-developed antioxidant system in hair cells, and this hypothesis is supported by the observation that after the initial disruption, a new balanced redox state indicated by stable NAD(P)H fluorescence is reached within 15 min post-gentamicin treatment (Schafer and Buettner, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Tiede et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Alternatively, the catastrophic oxidative stress may be caused by temporally downstream events such as mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p>Another group of genes, which drew our attention because of a lack of early response, were those encoding heat shock proteins. Expression of these genes was not induced by gentamicin at 3 h, including the HspA group (<italic>Hspa1a, Hspa1b, Hspa5</italic>, and others), the HspB group (<italic>Hspb1, Hspb2</italic>, and others), the HspC group (<italic>Hsp90aa1, Hsp90ab1</italic>, and <italic>Hsp90b1</italic>), and other members in the HspD, HspE, and HspG groups (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). Among Dnaj family members, which are involved in oxidative stress response, only <italic>Dnaja2, Dnajb4</italic>, and some <italic>Dnajc</italic> genes were expressed at slightly higher levels (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). The absence of strong induction of heat shock protein genes suggests that hair cells had not launched a broad stress response at 3 h, and indicates that transcriptional changes in signaling pathways, such as the JNK and the NF-&#x003ba;B pathways, at this time point were not simply caused by dysregulation of general transcription under stress conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Genes involved in the initiation and execution of apoptosis were not significantly affected at the early time point</title><p>Aminoglycoside antibiotics are thought to induce hair cell death through an intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (Forge and Li, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Apoptosis is an active process that requires gene transcription and protein synthesis (Matsui et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). In contrast to genes involved in upstream pathways, such as the JNK and the NF-&#x003ba;B pathways, which regulate apoptosis and survival, genes involved in apoptosis initiation and execution were not significantly affected in gentamicin-treated hair cells at 3 h post treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Although we observed up-regulation of <italic>Casp3</italic> expression and down-regulation of <italic>Casp2</italic> and <italic>Casp9</italic> expression, the majority of intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway-related genes remained unchanged, including pro- and anti-apoptosis Bcl2 family members (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). The lack of significant induction of apoptosis factors at this relatively early time point is consistent with the critical events timeline of aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death (Matsui et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). We verified the expression changes of <italic>Bnip1, Casp3</italic> and <italic>Ccar1</italic> by Q-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).</p><p>We analyzed the cell-type specific response by comparing gentamicin-induced expression changes in hair cells, with gene expression changes during cell death in fibroblasts, neurons, and kidneys (based on published literature as curated in the IPA data base). Like hair cells, neurons are terminally-differentiated, non-dividing cells, but pathways regulating neuronal cell apoptosis are well characterized. We also emphasized the kidney because nephrotoxicity is another well-known sequela to aminoglycoside antibiotics treatment. These comparisons in IPA revealed that gentamicin-induced gene expression changes in hair cells are significantly different from the dataset derived from fibroblasts (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0000927 and activation z-score &#x02212;1.81) (activation z-score is a quantitative measure of how similar the hair cell dataset is to the &#x0201c;comparing dataset&#x0201d;: larger positive number indicates there are more genes with expression changes in the same direction in both datasets, while larger negative number means there are more genes with changes in opposite direction between datasets; see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> caption), but similar to datasets of neuronal cell death (<italic>p</italic> = 0.000280 and activation z-score 0.312), and cell death of kidney cells (<italic>p</italic> = 0.00576 and activation z-score 0.664). The observed similarity between aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death and neuronal cell death is not surprising, as hair cells and neurons are related types of terminally differentiated, excitable cells.

These data suggest that the postmitotic state of hair cells was disrupted following gentamicin treatment. Loss of control of the postmitotic state and re-entry into the cell cycle preceding neuronal cell apoptosis has been observed (Arendt, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), and inhibition of cell cycle re-entry by blocking CDK activity has been shown to protect neurons from apoptosis induced by certain drugs or stress (Kruman, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Golsteyn, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).

treatment. It is plausible that the induction of DNA repair genes by DNA damage is caused by elevated ROS levels after gentamicin treatment, but our experimental observations do not support this explanation. First, the absence of significant induction of oxidative stress response genes suggests that the ROS production had not reached a level sufficient to induce the change in known response genes. Second, we failed to detect DNA damage by immunostaining against phosphorylated Chk, or by comet assay (Tao and Segil, unpublished data). Third, we did not observe induction of DNA damage repair genes at the transcriptional level after treating the cochlea with the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin (Ng, Rainey and Segil, unpublished data). Based on these observations, we postulate that up-regulated expression of DNA damage repair genes is not triggered by gentamicin-induced DNA damage and ROS production, but rather is more likely to reflect a change in cell cycle status following gentamicin treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Gene expression changes induced by gentamicin in the non-hair cell population</title><p>Hair cells are specifically marked by GFP in Atoh1-GFP transgenic mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), thus the GFP negative population consists of supporting cells (Deiters' cells, pillar cells and Hensen cells), cells in the greater epithelial ridge, cells in the lesser epithelial ridge, and other cells constituting surrounding tissues (inner phalangeal cells were excluded by FACS, based on their low-level misexpression of GFP, Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,C</xref>). The number of genes whose expression was affected by gentamicin in non-hair cell samples is much smaller than that in hair cells. The PCA results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) also show that the non-hair cell population does not respond to gentamicin uniformly, probably as a result of high heterogeneity. Expression of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, lipid synthesis, nucleotide metabolism, and other biosynthesis processes, was significantly induced after gentamicin treatment in this population (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). In addition, expression of genes involved in DNA replication and cell cycle was significantly affected (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). The gentamicin-induced gene expression pattern of the non-hair cell population suggests gentamicin-stimulated biosynthesis, and induced cell proliferation in this population.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of non-hair cell dataset with known expression changes in biosynthesis and proliferation datasets</bold>.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Comparing dataset</bold></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold><italic>p</italic>-value</bold></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Activation z-score</bold></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold># Genes</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Synthesis of sterol</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.76E-11</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.723</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Synthesis of cholesterol</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.04E-10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.937</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Metabolism of cholesterol</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.01E-10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.937</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Steroid metabolism</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.38E-05</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.937</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Steroidogenesis</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.79E-05</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.929</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Synthesis of terpenoid</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.74E-05</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.075</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Metabolism of terpenoid</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.42E-05</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.937</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Metabolism of membrane lipid derivative</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.59E-05</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.66</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conversion of acyl-coenzyme A</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.34E-05</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.964</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Proliferation of cells</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.80E-03</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.161</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">136</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>Selected entries are shown</italic>.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>In the presence of Texas-Red conjugated gentamicin (GTTR) in culture medium, hair cells had much higher GTTR fluorescence than other cell types (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), suggesting that gentamicin preferentially accumulates in hair cells. However, hair cells and supporting cells form a mosaic linked by tight epithelial junctions and other cell-cell contacts (Gulley and Resse, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>). Communication between hair cells and supporting cells is continuous as a result of cell-cell contact, and changes in one cell type that result from the gentamicin treatment likely effect physiological change in the other. One such cell-cell signaling pathway significantly affected by gentamicin treatment in non-hair cells is the Notch signaling pathway. <italic>Dll1</italic> and <italic>Jag2</italic> are highly expressed as Notch ligands in hair cells, and <italic>Hes1, Hes5, Hey1</italic>, and <italic>Hey2</italic> are expressed in supporting cells as Notch target genes (Zine and de Ribaupierre, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Doetzlhofer et al., <xref rid="B5b" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>); after gentamicin treatment, expression of <italic>Dll1</italic> and <italic>Jag2</italic> were down-regulated in hair cells, and <italic>Hes1, Hes5, Hey1</italic>, and <italic>Hey2</italic> were also expressed at a lower level in the non-hair cell population (<italic>p</italic> = n.s. for <italic>Hes</italic> and <italic>Hey</italic> genes) (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>), indicating disrupted cell-cell signaling between hair cells and supporting cells. This observation supports the idea that the expression profile changes that we observe in the non-hair cell population may be brought about by changes in response to gentamicin in hair cells. However, we could not exclude the possibility that non-supporting cells in the GFP-negative population might be responding to gentamicin treatment directly at the transcriptional level.</p></sec><sec><title>Similarity between aminoglycoside ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity</title><p>Nephrotoxicity is another side effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics, and several publications catalog the changes in response to aminoglycoside antibiotics (Oh et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Ozaki et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).

underlying biological processes and pathways that were affected by gentamicin in kidney and in hair cells, based on the transcriptional changes. We observed similar changes in the expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, RNA processing, and translation in gentamicin-treated kidney and hair cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). In addition, up-regulation of expression at the <italic>Jun</italic> gene, and induction of DNA repair gene <italic>Lig4</italic> were observed in both hair cells and kidney. The similarity in transcriptional response to gentamicin between hair cells and kidney cells suggests that there may be some common mechanisms responsible for aminoglycoside ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, such as translation inhibition.</p><p>Despite the aforementioned similarity, the expression of stress response genes differed greatly in gentamicin-treated kidney and hair cells. Expression of oxidative stress response genes and <italic>Hsp</italic> chaperone genes was collectively increased in gentamicin-treated kidney while expression of these genes was not induced in hair cells. The discrepancy might be based on the different time points of sample collection (3 h post-gentamicin treatment for hair cell sample vs. 7 days after treatment for kidney). It was difficult to directly compare the expression of proliferation genes in kidneys with that in hair cells, because the kidney is an organ consisting of heterogeneous cell populations, with both dividing cells and quiescent cells, whereas hair cells are postmitotic.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The causes of hypersensitivity of hair cells to aminoglycoside antibiotics remain unclear, and the prevailing hypothesis of aminoglycoside ototoxicity holds that aminoglycosides induce high levels of ROS leading to apoptotic stimulation. Our purpose in this project was to characterize the hair cell response to aminoglycoside antibiotics at an early time following administration, before the changes associated with apoptosis were apparent. To this end, we analyzed the response of hair cells after 3 h of treatment with gentamicin. As indicated in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the JNK pathway and the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway are early responders, with many active components of the pathways showing significant increases. In addition, early changes in cell cycle-related genes, and DNA damage repair genes, signaled the potential disruption of the postmitotic state. In contrast, genes of the apoptosis and stress response pathways remain relatively unchanged at this time point. The transcription profile of hair cells at the early time point suggests that prior to the detection of an ROS response at the transcriptional level, other changes occur that may lead to the stimulation of apoptotic pathways, such as the aforementioned JNK pathway, NF-&#x003ba;B pathway and postmitotic state disruption.</p><p>Aminoglycoside-induced ROS production (Hirose et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), the protective effect of antioxidants (Schacht, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), and the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response (Hoshino et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), have all been implicated in aminoglycoside ototoxicity. However, we did not observe a significant induction of the transcriptional targets of NRF2 at 3 h in our <italic>in vitro</italic> system. In addition, expression of heat shock chaperons and other stress response genes were not significantly upregulated. These results suggest that, although ROS changes in hair cells are rapid, at 3 h after gentamicin treatment they have not reached a level sufficient to trigger a broad stress response at the transcriptional level. The catastrophic oxidative stress that triggers apoptosis might be caused by continuous ROS build up, or by subsequent events such as mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p>Expression of genes involved in initiation and execution of apoptosis were not significantly induced at this early time point, which is consistent with the established timeline of hair cell apoptosis (Matsui et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), and in line with the absence of a strong stress response at the transcriptional level. Together, the data suggest that, at this relatively early time point, hair cells are not yet committed to apoptosis. However, we observed expression changes for genes in upstream signaling pathways regulating apoptosis and cell survival. Not surprisingly, comparison of the observed gentamicin-induced changes in hair cells, with those from cell death studies in other cell lines or tissues, revealed a significant similarity in response to stress.</p><p>The disruption of the postmitotic state of hair cells is indicated by expression changes of cell cycle-related genes, suggesting that postmitotic state disruption in dying hair cells is another potential mechanism regulating apoptosis in hair cells, similar to what has been reported in postmitiotic neurons. Cell cycle re-entry has been observed in neurons before neuronal cell death, especially in neurodegenerative diseases (Arendt, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). In the central nervous system, mature neurons with mutated genes involved in maintaining the postmitotic state (inactivation of <italic>p19<sup>Ink4d</sup></italic> and <italic>p27<sup>Kip1</sup></italic>) lose control of the postmitotic state, re-enter the cell cycle, and eventually undergo apoptosis (Zindy et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Activation of the cell cycle machinery is considered one of the mechanisms controlling programmed cell death in postmitotic neurons, either through direct regulation of apoptosis pathways, or through checkpoint activation (Kruman, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Golsteyn, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In the cochlea, aberrant cell cycle re-entry leads to hair cell apoptosis (Chen et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Laine et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Inhibition of CDK activity by pharmaceutical inhibitors or genetic mutations of CDK genes protect hair cells from aminoglycoside ototoxicity (Tao and Segil, unpublished data), suggesting that cell cycle machinery regulates hair cell death. This mechanism is also supported by our expression data. Genes involved in cell cycle progression, G2 phase, and G2/M were significantly affected at the transcriptional level (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), indicating a disruption of the quiescent state of hair cells by gentamicin treatment.</p><p>Further evidence supporting the loss of cell cycle control mechanisms includes our observation that hair cells up-regulate the expression of DNA repair genes after gentamicin treatment. Although induction of DNA repair genes by gentamicin-induced DNA damage is a plausible explanation, the lack of strong oxidative stress response at the transcriptional level, failure of DNA damage detection in hair cells after gentamicin treatment (Tao and Segil, unpublished data), and unchanged DNA repair gene expression at the transcriptional level in hair cells after DNA damaging agent treatment (Ng, Rainey and Segil, unpublished data) together suggest that gentamicin-induced DNA repair gene expression is not responding to DNA damage, but may be responding to a form of &#x0201c;replicative stress&#x0201d; induced by the disruption of the postmitotic state, similar to that observed in neurons exiting the postmitotic state (Andrusiak et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). During final differentiation and withdrawal from cell cycle, many postmitotic cells, such as neurons, which need never replicate their genomes again and thus can resort to repairing only essential genes, down-regulate global genomic DNA repair and rely entirely on transcription-coupled repair to maintain actively transcribed genes (Nouspikel and Hanawalt, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Based on the observation that hair cell homeostasis requires transcription-coupled repair for long-term survival (Nagtegaal et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), we postulate that DNA repair capacity is regulated during hair cell differentiation and cell cycle withdrawal. Thus, up-regulation of the expression of DNA repair genes may indicate disruption of the quiescent state and cell cycle control.</p><p>Taken together, our RNA sequencing data suggests that at 3 h, an early time point after gentamicin treatment, activation of the JNK and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathways and the disruption of the quiescent state, indicated by significant transcription changes, precede broad stress response and apoptosis initiation, and that these early responses may regulate aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank USC Epigenome Center for library construction and sequencing services, Jane Johnson for Atoh1-GFP transgenic mice, Yibu Chen and Meng Li in USC NML Bioinformatics Service Program for their help with PartekFlow and IPA applications, Juan F.
