Accordingly, mosquito (Diptera, Culicidae) eggshells show a remarkable diversity in physical properties and structure permitting adaptations to a wide variety of environments.

Protein crosslinking reactions may form higher-order covalent complexes and prevent solubilization of some eggshell proteins, or prevent them from entering the polyacrylamide gel. A second, &#x02018;shotgun&#x02019;, approach not based on SDS-PAGE was used to mitigate the possible under-representation of proteins in these samples. Tryptic digestion of the whole eggshell preparations followed by mass spectrometry discovered 127 distinct proteins (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). All but three of the proteins identified from the excised gel slices were present in the new list of proteins identified from the second experimental approach. Therefore, a total of 130 proteins were identified from the combined mass spectrometric analyses of eggshell preparations. Differences in the two proteomes may arise from various factors including (a) different eggshell preparations, (b) large (&#x02265; 500&#x000a0;kDa) and small (&#x02264; 5&#x000a0;kDa) proteins not resolved during electrophoresis, (c) proteins between gel slices that were not excised after SDS-PAGE, and (d) differences in thresholds parameters for database search results.</p></sec><sec><title>Temporal patterns of transcript accumulation &#x02013; transcriptome and quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>An insoluble fraction was recovered from the eggshell preparation even after treatment with trypsin. Therefore, we undertook a complementary, non-protein based approach to evaluate the complexity of the eggshells. The transcriptome of ovaries at the latter stages of eggshell formation (60-72 hPBM) was compared with the published transcriptome of recently-laid <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Transcripts enriched in the late ovaries and either absent or present at negligible levels in embryos most likely correspond to genes that are expressed in the follicle cells. These are candidates for encoding components of the outermost eggshell layers. Transcripts enriched in the ovaries and maintained at high levels in embryos could be maternally-derived transcripts that serve functions in early embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>A total of 536 transcripts were found to be at least 10-fold more represented in ovaries than in embryos (p values&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5E<sup>&#x02212;05</sup>) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).

Quantitative RT-PCR, microarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and RNA-Seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] derived data were concordant for the majority (&#x0003e;90%), and evidenced genes with distinct expression patterns.</p><p>Not all proteins identified in the eggshell proteome described above were encoded by these transcripts and this is consistent with differential expression profiles of the eggshell components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). For example, vitelline membrane proteins (VPMs) encoding genes are expressed during early oogenesis and were not represented among the abundant transcripts during the late stages of egg formation. Also, a number of the transcripts present in ovaries and absent, or detected at low levels in embryos, encode predicted intracellular components that although displaying differential expression profiles are not likely components of the eggshell.</p></sec><sec><title>Spatial patterns of transcript accumulation - hybridizations <italic>in situ</italic></title><p>Hybridizations <italic>in situ</italic> were performed to further validate expression of four selected genes in vitellogenic ovaries (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Insect OBPs are reported to be expressed in insect antennae and are proposed to bind small hydrophobic odorant molecules and carry and present them to the olfactory receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Structurally-related proteins also have been identified in non-sensory organs of insects, supporting the conclusion that OBPs and OBP-like proteins could have roles unrelated to olfaction. For example, D7-related (D7r) proteins similar in structure to OBPs are abundant components in the saliva of hematophagous insects. The <italic>An. gambiae</italic> D7r proteins have been shown to bind the biogenic amines serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine with high affinity thereby reducing the concentrations of these effectors at the feeding site and resulting in an anti-hemostatic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].

AAEL011483 encodes a protein that belongs to the &#x0201c;PlusC&#x0201d; OBP family, however its expression pattern indicates that it is not expressed in the ovaries (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).

This pattern supports their function as components of the most external layers of the chorion deposited during the last stages of oogenesis.

Therefore, the management of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations is of prime importance to public health and welfare. In general, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> population densities are low during cold and dry seasons and increase immediately after rainfall. This pattern is due to the hatching of a large number of estivated, drought-resistant larvae that hatch in response to water accumulation in natural and artificial breeding sites. Mosquito survival until the next favorable climatic period is then a key factor for the persistence of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Thus, targeting <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> eggs to make them less resistant, or intolerant to desiccation would be beneficial.</p><p>Our data fill a gap in knowledge regarding the proteins and sequential processes involved in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> eggshell formation. Proteins involved in the hardening and tanning processes of the mosquito eggshell may represent targets for the development of enzyme-specific inhibitors that added to the egg-laying sites and/or fed to females via blood or nectar could result in abnormal egg formation or a defective chorion. For example, phoroglucinol, a natural phenolic peroxidase inhibitor, affects eggshell formation when fed to adult female insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. This substance or derivatives are potential candidates for controlling vector populations in integrated insect control programs. High-throughput searches for molecules with inhibitory activity on enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] also can be applied to insect control. The discovery or development of highly specific, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> eggshell enzyme inhibitors would be advantageous and desirable to minimize unwanted environmental effects of insect control strategies on non-target organisms. Design of insecticides that target cuticle and chorion formation, such as lufenuron used to control fleas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], are possible with an understanding of the biochemical and physiological processes involved in eggshell formation in mosquitoes.</p><p>The data documented here also support control strategies involving transgenic insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Transgenic mosquitoes with a drought-intolerant embryo phenotype could be engineered, easily raised under controlled humidity laboratory conditions, and upon release would display little or no fitness cost during rainy seasons. However, their eggs would not survive through dry seasons. The population suppression proposed here together with other efforts that result in local or regional vector elimination are anticipated to delay the onset of increased mosquito populations that follows the onset of a rainy season, result in reduced pathogen transmission and provide a consequent reduction in human morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mosquitoes</title><p>The <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> Liverpool strain was maintained at 26&#x000b0;C&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x000b0;C with 77% humidity and 12&#x000a0;h&#x000a0;day/night, 30&#x000a0;min dusk/dawn lighting cycle.
