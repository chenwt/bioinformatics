Throughout history rust epidemics have caused significant losses in cereal production and today they are considered a major threat to global food security due to the recent evolution and spread of the highly-virulent Ug99 strain of the wheat stem rust pathogen (<italic>Puccinia graminis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic>) and persistent worldwide losses due to wheat stripe rust disease (caused by <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, many other cultivated plants, including soybean, coffee, poplar and pine, suffer rust diseases that drastically reduce productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and the recent incursion of myrtle rust (caused by <italic>Puccinia psidii</italic>) into Australia threatens native ecosystems and forestry production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Consequently, there is great interest in understanding how these fungal pathogens infect their hosts and how plants can be better protected from rust disease.</p><p>The infection of flax (<italic>Linum usitatissimum</italic>) by the flax rust fungus (<italic>Melampsora lini</italic>) has been an important model system for understanding rust biology since the pioneering studies of Harold Flor in the late 1930&#x02019;s and early 1940&#x02019;s. Flor determined that the success or failure of pathogen attack is dictated by a &#x02018;gene-for-gene&#x02019; interaction between resistance genes in the plant and avirulence genes in the pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. When a pathogen expressing an avirulence gene infects a plant expressing a corresponding resistance gene, the plant is able to recognise the presence of the pathogen and trigger a multifaceted defence response, which includes localised cell death at the point of attempted infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Most disease resistance genes encode cytoplasmic receptor proteins with a nucleotide binding (NB) site and leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], whereas avirulence genes encode small, secreted proteins that are thought to be part of a diverse array of secreted effectors with virulence functions that assist in the establishment and maintenance of pathogen infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Five avirulence genes (<italic>AvrL567</italic>, <italic>AvrM</italic>, <italic>AvrP, AvrP123</italic> and <italic>AvrP4</italic>) have been identified at four different loci in <italic>M. lini</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. They encode secreted proteins produced in a specialised fungal structure called the haustorium, which is a major site for signal exchange and nutrient acquisition in rust pathogens and other biotrophic fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Genome sequencing of plant pathogenic fungi has become an important approach to identify effector genes that might be important during infection. For species with relatively small genomes (~40 Mb or less) and a low percentage of repetitive DNA, high quality reference genome assemblies have been produced with large scaffolds that often represent complete chromosomes from telomere to telomere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. By contrast, species with larger genomes or a high percentage of repetitive DNA have proved more difficult to assemble (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]). Rust fungi have repetitive genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] that are amongst the largest known for plant pathogens, with genome sizes estimated by flow cytometry that range from 77 Mb in <italic>Puccinia triticina</italic> to 2.5 Gb in <italic>Uromyces bidentis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In addition, they produce dikaryotic spores that are highly heterozygous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], which makes genome assembly particularly challenging. The wheat stem rust (89 Mb) and poplar rust (Melampsora larici-populina; 101 Mb) pathogen genome assemblies were produced by Sanger sequencing, yet these still contain 392 and 462 scaffolds, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Rust fungal genome assemblies produced using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are considerably more fragmented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. For example, the M. lini genome assembly was produced by Illumina sequencing and contains 21,130 scaffolds, which together span 189 Mb of the predicted ~220 Mb genome. The longest scaffold in the assembly is only 239.7 kb and 50 % of the assembly comprises scaffolds of 31.5 kb or less [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>One strategy to improve the utility of fragmented genome assemblies is to anchor the scaffolds onto a genetic linkage map. In recent years, NGS technologies have been developed that allow simultaneous identification and scoring of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, the two most commonly-used methods being the genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) technique described by Elshire et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]). GBS and RADseq are reduced representation sequencing technologies that rely on restriction digest of genomic DNA to reduce sequence complexity, allowing the high depth of coverage required for accurate SNP identification to be achieved economically. Using these technologies to sequence mapping families it is possible to produce high-density genetic maps that contain thousands of sequence-characterised markers, which can be used for quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, map-based cloning, anchoring genome assemblies and genome-wide analysis of recombination rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In fungi, QTLs linked to temperature ensitivity and melanisation have been identified in Zymoseptoria tritici using RADseq markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and a GBS-based linkage map was used to anchor the Pyrenophora teres f. sp. teres genome assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, these powerful technologies have yet to be applied widely in fungal genetics research.</p><p>We used RADseq to identify and map genetic markers in an F<sub>2</sub> family derived by self-fertilisation of M. lini strain CH5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The resulting high-density genetic map comprises 27 linkage groups that contain 13,412 RADseq markers and nine of the ten avirulence genes known to segregate in this mapping family. In addition the map includes the I-1 avirulence inhibitor locus, which prevents pathogen detection by flax plants containing the L1, L7, L8, L10 and M1 resistance genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The RADseq marker sequences were used to anchor 68.9 % of the CH5 M. lini genome assembly onto the genetic map. The genetic map and anchored assembly were then used to examine recombination frequency and distribution across the M. lini genome, show that loss of avirulence in some CH5-derived mutants is associated with large-scale chromosomal duplications and deletions and identify two new avirulence genes (AvrM14 and AvrL2) by map-based cloning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>CH5 genetic map</title><p>We used RADseq to identify SNP-based markers for construction of a M. lini genetic map. Genomic DNAs extracted from strains C and H, their F1 offspring (CH5) and 77 F<sub>2</sub> progeny obtained by self-fertilisation of CH5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] were digested with PstI or NsiI and used to generate individually barcoded RADseq libraries that were sequenced using 100 bp paired-end Illumina sequencing. After filtering to remove poor quality reads and PCR duplicates, on average 2.1 million PstI and 4.4 million NsiI read pairs per F<sub>2</sub> individual were retained for further analysis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The sequence data were used to identify 13,617 genetic markers that were heterozygous in CH5, scored in at least 74 of the 77 F<sub>2</sub> individuals and segregated in a pattern not significantly different from the 1:2:1 ratio expected of a single-copy, codominant marker (chi-squared test, <italic>p</italic> &#x02265; 0.01). After filtering to remove potential genotyping errors and low-quality markers (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> for a description of methods), a genetic map was constructed at a logarithm of odds (LOD) score of seven that contained 13,412 genetic markers (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) in 27 linkage groups (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The map spanned a total of 5860 cM and contained 2756 recombination bins.

Of the 739 scaffolds that contained one or more recombinant marker pairs, 687 showed colinearity in physical and genetic marker order allowing unambiguous assignment of scaffold orientation relative to the genetic map (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). For another 52 scaffolds, disagreement between physical and genetic marker order may have resulted from single genotyping errors as described above. However, 190 scaffolds showed substantial differences between genetic and physical maps, including 176 that contained markers in more than one linkage group and 15 with widely separated markers from the same linkage group (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Additional files <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). None of these scaffolds contained markers positioned in the correct order to indicate a physical connection between the linkage groups. Therefore, it is likely that these are chimeric scaffolds resulting from errors in sequence assembly.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Scaffold anchoring summary</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Anchoring information</th><th>Number of scaffolds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Orientation given by a single recombinant marker pair</td><td>490</td></tr><tr><td>Orientation given by multiple recombinant marker pairs</td><td>197</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic order of markers does not match physical order</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>Scaffold chimeric between linkage groups</td><td>175</td></tr><tr><td>Scaffold chimeric within linkage group</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Scaffold chimeric between and within linkage groups</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>No recombinant marker pairs on scaffold</td><td>1938</td></tr><tr><td>&#x0003c;2 markers on scaffold</td><td>1812</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>4679</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recombination frequency in the M. lini genome</title><p>A total of 8823 recombination events were detected in the 77 members of our F<sub>2</sub> mapping family. Of these, 8617 (97.7 %) were single recombination events and only 103 locations were detected at which two recombination events had occurred between flanking markers (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> for a description of methods). This suggests that the region of the genome covered by the genetic map is close to marker saturation given the amount of recombination information available in our F<sub>2</sub> family. The number of recombination breakpoints detected per F<sub>2</sub> individual ranged from 68 to 166 with a mean of 114.6 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Amongst linkage groups, there was a strong positive correlation between physical length and the number of markers (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.99) and between physical length and the number of recombination events (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.98; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). However, within linkage groups recombination events were not evenly distributed. Although 50 % of markers were located in bins containing nine markers or less, some bins contained up to 111 markers (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>) suggesting that there may be recombination coldspots in the genome. To estimate the physical distance between recombination events across the genome, the cumulative scaffold length per recombination bin was calculated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Whilst 91.3 % of bins were associated with a cumulative scaffold length of 100 kb or less, there were 59 bins (2.1 %) associated with a physical distance of 200 kb or more (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Comparing regions of the genome with differing recombination rates, we found an increase in repetitive DNA content from ~20 to ~26 % as recombination rate decreased, along with a slight decrease in gene and effector gene content (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). There were no differences in GC content between regions with different recombination rates (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>).

Genomic DNAs from these individuals were used for RADseq analysis and the 8871 NsiI markers used in genetic map construction were scored for each line. With the exception of missing data and a small number of potential genotyping errors, all NsiI markers were heterozygous in MS32 and MS38, including those located on LG16 that co-segregated with AvrL2 in the F<sub>2</sub> family. Therefore, loss of AvrL2 in these mutants must have involved a small-scale mutation event that did not affect the adjacent markers. By contrast, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was observed for large numbers of markers in MS45, MS48 and MS51 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) suggesting that loss of avirulence in these mutants was caused by large-scale chromosomal rearrangements.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Loss of heterozygosity in CH5 mutants.

These markers were located on 41 different scaffolds with a cumulative length of 1.12 Mb. To determine the cause of LOH, total read depth and percentage of reads from the strain H allele were examined for all NsiI markers scored in MS45, MS48 and CH5. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">b</xref>, total read depth was uniform across all markers in CH5, but in MS45 the region suffering LOH was characterised by a mean read depth of 25.6 compared to 51.0 for the rest of the genome, consistent with deletion of part of the strain H-derived chromosome that carried AvrM1 and AvrM4. However, this analysis detected a further change in the genome of MS45 that appeared unrelated to loss of AvrM1 and AvrM4; a region of 64 consecutive NsiI markers located between 0 and 10.93 cM in LG10 had higher read depth than the rest of the genome (average of 71.9 reads per marker). These markers were located on 34 scaffolds with a cumulative length of 622 kb. In this region the mean percentage of reads from the strain H allele was 65.4 % compared to 50.0 % for the rest of the genome, consistent with a duplication of this region of the strain H chromosome. Very similar results were obtained for MS48 in both abnormal regions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>). As MS45 and MS48 were isolated in the same mutant screen, it is likely that they are clonal individuals.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Read depth and percentage of H allele reads in CH5 mutants. <bold>a</bold> Read depth and percentage of H allele reads per marker across the CH5 genetic map.

However, in this case avirulence gene loss was not caused by chromosomal deletion alone, as the mean read depth in these two regions was not significantly different to that seen for the rest of the MS51 genome (two-tailed T-test, <italic>p</italic> &#x02265; 0.001; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, c</xref>).

A similar chromosome duplication and deletion event could also explain LOH without loss of read depth as observed for LG27 and suggested that LG5 and LG27 might be adjacent regions of the same chromosome. Indeed, when re-analysed at LOD6, markers from these two linkage groups formed a single group separated by a gap of 20.72 cM.

We identified five genetic markers located at 1.95 cM in LG19 that co-segregated with AvrM4 in this family (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Four markers were located on scaffold 27 (sc27) in the CH5 genome assembly, which also contained three adjacent markers at 3.9 cM, and the fifth marker was the only marker located on sc3166 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). These scaffolds were examined for the presence of genes encoding small-secreted proteins, which are generally considered candidates for effectors. However, none of the gene models annotated on the assembly by Nemri et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] fitted these expectations.

One of the nucleotide polymorphisms created a BspEI restriction site polymorphism and this was used as the basis of a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker.

Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) showed that both alleles of the avirulence gene candidate were expressed in CH5-infected flax leaves 4 days post-infection and confirmed the presence of a 77 bp intron in the coding region (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>).</p><p>To test for recognition of the candidate avirulence gene by the corresponding M1 and M4 resistance genes, cDNA sequences of the two alleles were used to generate T-DNA constructs for expression in planta.

Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient expression of the strain H-derived allele without the predicted signal peptide induced strong necrosis in flax plants containing the M4 resistance gene, slightly weaker necrosis in flax plants containing the M1 resistance gene and no symptoms in flax plants lacking these resistance genes, including near-isogenic lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>).

By contrast, no necrosis or chlorosis was observed on any of the plants infiltrated with the strain C-derived virulence allele, which we have named AvrM14-B (GenBank: KU743881).

This was analogous to the situation seen for the MS32 and MS38 mutants, suggesting that all three individuals might have lost AvrL2 avirulence specificity by a similar process. To identify additional markers that might help to locate AvrL2, we re-analysed the RADseq data using different genotyping calling and filtering parameters that would allow inclusion of multi-copy sequences (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In addition, as approximately 15 % of the RADseq reads did not align to the CH5 genome assembly (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), the data were also analysed by de novo assembly. This led to the identification of 1672 additional markers from reference-aligned reads and 6398 markers from de novo assembly, five of which co-segregated with AvrL2 in the 76 F<sub>2</sub> progeny and were represented by only the strain C allele in CH5F2-105, MS32 and MS38.

However, AvrL2-A, AvrL2-C and AvrL2-D were expressed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>), so we developed sequence characterised amplified region (SCAR) markers specific to each gene and mapped them in the CH5 F<sub>2</sub> family (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). AvrL2-C and -D segregated as alleles and co-segregated with markers in the recombination bin spanning the AvrL2 locus, but like the other linked markers in this bin they were heterozygous in CH5F2-105, MS32 and MS38. However, AvrL2-A not only co-segregated with the AvrL2 avirulence phenotype in the F<sub>2</sub> family, but was also absent from CH5F2-105, MS32 and MS38, indicating that it was included in the small deletion event that gave rise to these virulent lines. The full length cDNA sequence of AvrL2-A was confirmed by mapping of RNAseq reads from infected flax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] onto the genomic sequence and corresponded to a single clone sequenced from a haustorial-specific cDNA library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To test for avirulence function, AvrL2-A expression constructs were generated using cDNA sequences that contained or lacked the region encoding the predicted signal peptide. Initially the signal peptide was predicted using SignalP v4.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], which suggested a signal peptide cleavage site between amino acids 36 and 37 (D-score 0.57). When expressed in flax leaves by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient transformation, no symptoms were observed for either construct when expressed in plants that lacked the L2 resistance gene (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>). However, when expressed in L2 flax plants, the AvrL2-A full-length construct induced strong necrosis of infiltrated leaves and the construct lacking the predicted signal peptide-encoding region (dSP36) induced chlorosis and weak necrosis. The weak response to the dSP36 construct was unexpected given that avirulence protein recognition is thought to occur inside the plant cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, at 36 amino acids the signal peptide predicted by SignalP v4.1 is unusually long. Therefore, we tested three other constructs that lacked the region encoding the N-terminal 20 (dSP20), 26 (dSP26) or 32 (dSP32) amino acids, the latter corresponding to a signal peptide predicted by PrediSi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. When co-expressed with L2 in Nicotiana tabacum, the AvrL2-A full-length, dSP20, dSP26 and dSP32 constructs all elicited a strong necrotic response, whereas no response was observed upon co-expression of AvrL2-A dSP36 and L2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). We therefore conclude that AvrL2 avirulence specificity is conferred by the AvrL2-A gene.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Identification of AvrL2. <bold>a</bold> RT-PCR analysis of AvrL2 family gene expression.

As 97.7 % of the 8823 recombination events detected were single recombination events, it is likely that the region of the genome covered by the map is close to marker saturation given the amount of recombination information available in the CH5 F<sub>2</sub> family. Despite the high marker density, the map contains 27 linkage groups whereas the M. lini haploid genome contains 18 chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In part, this may be due to the fact we selected markers for map construction that are codominant, predicted single-copy sequences with no strong segregation distortion. Therefore, linkage groups might be broken in regions where markers could not be developed (due to lack of sequence diversity or excessive diversity between the parental strains) or in regions composed entirely of repetitive DNA, provided that sufficient recombination occurred in the region to produce a genetic gap that exceeded the 20 cM threshold used in map construction. Gaps exceeding 20 cM are also expected in regions of strong segregation distortion such as fungal mating type loci, two of which are expected to be heterozygous in every member of the CH5 F<sub>2</sub> family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Nevertheless, despite M. lini having a repetitive genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], at least nine chromosomes are represented by a single linkage group and the high marker density, low level of missing data (0.78 %; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">16</xref>) and low estimated marker misplacement rate (1.52 %) makes this genetic map a valuable tool for genomics research.</p><p>Genetic maps have been used to anchor a number of fungal genome assemblies, including Fusarium graminearum and Pyrenophora teres f. sp. teres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. F. graminearum has a high quality genome assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], 99.8 % of which could be anchored using a genetic map of just 235 markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. By contrast, we were only able to anchor 68.9 % of the M. lini genome assembly onto the genetic map and provide unambiguous orientation to 687 scaffolds. This is due to the fact that the number of genetic markers required to anchor a genome assembly is inversely proportional to the size of sequence scaffolds. Although the RADseq markers are an average of 16.4 kb apart (generating a dense genetic map), 50 % of the assembly is comprised of scaffolds of 31.5 kb or less (a highly fragmented genome assembly), which limits improvement of the anchored assembly.</p><p>During the anchoring process we identified 190 scaffolds that contained markers from different linkage groups, or different parts of the same linkage group. The strict alignment parameters used make it unlikely that this is due to incorrect marker placement on the reference genome and none of these markers showed aberrant segregation or high read depth that would indicate they were derived from multi-copy sequences. Instead, the most likely explanation is that the scaffold sequences are chimeric, a common error in assemblies of complex genomes resulting from the inability of sequence assemblers to resolve repetitive DNA stretches from short read sequence data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Scaffolding errors are very difficult to detect by analysis of the assembly alone, prompting some authors to suggest that genetic maps are an essential component of any genome sequencing project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p>Recombination is an essential part of the meiotic cell division process and at least one recombination event (or crossover) is required per chromosome pair to ensure proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division. However, as aberrant segregation can lead to severe genetic disorders (such as Down syndrome in humans), in most species recombination is tightly controlled to produce a low number of widely spaced recombination events on each chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana and many mammalian species, only 1&#x02013;2 crossover events occur per chromosome pair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. By contrast, we saw an average of 114.6 recombination breakpoints per F<sub>2</sub> individual and for the largest linkage group (LG1) up to 22 breakpoints were detected in some F<sub>2</sub> individuals. Based on the former observation, we infer an average of 6.4 recombination events per chromosome pair during meiosis in M. lini, which is in excess of the number of recombination events thought to be required for correct chromosome disjunction alone. High recombination rates may be typical for fungi as an average of 90.5 recombination events per meiosis have been detected across the 16 chromosome pairs of a diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] and many fungi have relatively large genetic maps given the physical size of their genome. For example, a genetic map of 3006 cM has been constructed for the 90 Mb genome of the pine fusiform rust fungus, Cronartium quercuum f. sp. fusiforme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. This is the only other rust fungus for which a comprehensive genetic map currently exists and the size of the map suggests a comparable rate of recombination to that seen here in M. lini. Understanding what controls recombination is an active area of research in many species (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]), but we know very little about what controls this process in filamentous fungi. The high rate of fungal recombination is of great benefit in experimental studies as it means that high-resolution mapping can be conducted using relatively small population sizes. In a biological sense, the rapid shuffling of alleles and potential for intragenic recombination (including at avirulence loci) might produce new genetic combinations that are better adapted to changing environmental conditions.</p><p>Despite an overall high rate of recombination in the M. lini genome, some regions were devoid of recombination and 59 coldspots were identified in which a recombination bin was associated with a physical region of 200 kb or more (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). In many species strong suppression of recombination is observed at centromeres, which are sites of sister chromatid adhesion during cell division and play a major role in ensuring that chromosomes segregate correctly during mitosis and meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Therefore, some of the coldspots observed in the M. lini genome might correspond to centromeric regions. However, as some linkage groups contained more than one coldspot (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), other explanations are possible. Low recombination rates have been associated with non-centromeric heterochromatin and other repeat-rich regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] and we observed an increase in mean repetitive DNA content as recombination rate decreased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Alternatively, lack of recombination could be caused by chromosomal inversions, translocations or regions of low sequence homology that are specific to the parental combination used to construct the CH5 F<sub>2</sub> mapping family.</p><p>We used genetic markers to examine five mutants that arose spontaneously during asexual propagation of strain CH5 (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]) and, in three cases, found that conversion to virulence was associated with large-scale chromosomal alterations. In MS45 and MS48, over 1 Mb of sequence that contained the AvrM14 gene was deleted from the strain H chromosome corresponding to the end of LG19 (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and a small duplication of the strain H chromosome corresponding to the end of LG10 was also observed in these mutants. The relationship between these two events is currently unknown, but perhaps deletion of LG19 can only be sustained if there is an associated duplication of a function located on LG10. Alternatively, the tip of the LG10 chromosome could have replaced the region deleted from the LG19 chromosome during a translocation event.</p><p>MS51 sustained the most substantial and complex chromosomal rearrangements of the mutants examined. In this mutant, loss of AvrN was associated with deletion of over 4 Mb from the strain C chromosome corresponding to LG27 and half of LG5 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The deletion in LG5 began in a large recombination coldspot at 164.69 cM that might represent a centromere, suggesting that the deletion may involve loss of a complete chromosome arm. In addition we observed duplication of the entire strain H chromosome corresponding to LG5/LG27 and duplication of strain C sequences corresponding to the central region of LG2 and the end of LG14 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Again, the relationship between these changes is unclear. However, the fact that deletion of LG5/27 from the strain C-derived nucleus was accompanied by duplication of LG5/27 from the strain H-derived nucleus suggests that there may be physical association or communication between the two haploid nuclei, which have traditionally been considered separate entities in this dikaryotic life stage. Chromosome length polymorphisms and dispensable chromosomes have been observed in many fungal species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] and loss of heterozygosity has been associated with changes in pathogenicity in the oomycete pathogen, Phytophthora capsici [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], but to our knowledge this is the first demonstration of gross chromosomal changes affecting virulence in a rust fungus. Large-scale chromosomal changes may impose a fitness cost in the field. However, it will be interesting to determine whether such changes contribute to genome evolution in natural populations of rust fungi, particularly for heteroecious species that require two host species to complete their life cycle in regions where reproduction is necessarily asexual due to absence of the sexual stage host.</p><p>A major aim of our research was to identify genes controlling avirulence in M. lini and to this end we identified co-segregating markers for six avirulence genes and the I-1 inhibitor gene, none of which had been cloned. In addition, we successfully identified the AvrM14 and AvrL2 genes by map-based cloning. Notably, although recognised by allelic host resistance genes that encode highly homologous proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>], AvrL2 is unrelated to AvrL567 and similarly AvrM14 is unrelated to AvrM. AvrM14 is a dual specificity avirulence protein that is recognised by both the flax M1 and M4 resistance proteins. Significantly, AvrM14 has homology to proteins of the nudix hydrolase superfamily and is the first rust avirulence protein for which a prediction of biochemical function can be made from the protein sequence alone. Nudix hydrolases are commonly found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and are responsible for hydrolysing a wide range of organic pyrophosphates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Several nudix hydrolases have been implicated in plant-pathogen interactions. The Phytophthora sojae Avr3b avirulence protein has proven nudix hydrolase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] and effectors from Colletotrichum truncatum (CtNUDIX; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]) and Ralstonia solanacearum (Hpx26; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]) are predicted nudix hydrolase proteins. An Arabidopsis thaliana nudix hydrolase has also been identified that negatively regulates plant defence signalling (NUDT7; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]). Therefore, secreted pathogen nudix hydrolases might play an important role in manipulating defence activation and cell death responses by the plant, thereby facilitating infection.</p><p>AvrL2 is located in the region of the M. lini genome with the lowest recombination rate, which may be a centromere or other heterochromatic or repeat rich region. A number of avirulence genes have been identified in repetitive regions with unique characteristics, such as Leptosphaeria maculans effectors in AT-rich isochores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and Phytophthora infestans effectors in gene-sparse genomic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. The region surrounding AvrL2 shares neither of these characteristics (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">17</xref>). However, we found at least two independent mutants in which conversion to virulence was associated with deletion of the AvrL2-A gene and another individual that contained duplication of the AvrL2 locus and surrounding region. This suggests that the AvrL2 locus is prone to rearrangement, reminiscent of L. maculans AvrLm1 and several Magnaporthe oryzae avirulence genes that are located in unstable genomic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. By contrast, virulence alleles at the AvrL567, AvrM, AvrP123 and AvrP4 loci all result from sequence diversification leading to the production of avirulence protein variants that are not recognised by flax plants containing the corresponding resistance genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Of these cloned avirulence genes, only AvrL2 is located in a recombination coldspot, therefore the genomic context that influences recombination rate may also shape evolution at different M. lini avirulence loci.</p><p>The AvrL2 family proteins have no homology to proteins of known function and this is a common feature of pathogen avirulence proteins. However, they do contain several small predicted intrinsically disordered regions, which are known to provide structural flexibility in many proteins involved in cell signalling pathways by allowing them to adopt different conformations in response to post-translational modification and nucleic acid or protein binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. The predicted 114 amino acid, mature AvrL2-A protein contains three small intrinsically disordered regions that together comprise 36 % of the protein sequence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). Disordered regions have been identified in a number of pathogen effectors. Structural studies have shown that the oomycete Avr3a and Avh5 effectors contain N-terminal disordered regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>] and the bean rust RTP1p effector contains a predicted N-terminal disordered domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Moreover, intrinsically disordered regions are enriched in predicted bacterial effectors, leading Marin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>] to propose these may be commonly occurring regions in pathogen effectors that provide the protein flexibility required to enter plant cells, mimic host functions or evade detection by the plant immune system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The generation of a high-density genetic map has greatly improved the utility of the fragmented M. lini genome assembly and we have used these genetic resources together to identify two new avirulence genes by map-based cloning. We have also identified RADseq markers that co-segregate with six other avirulence genes and the I-1 inhibitor, which will greatly facilitate future identification of these important genes. The genetic map and anchored assembly have been used to examine recombination rate and frequency across the M. lini genome and the ability to use marker read depth and allele frequency information to calculate DNA copy number has provided novel insights into chromosome rearrangements that occur during asexual reproduction. Taken together, our data suggest that variability in the M. lini genome can be achieved through a high overall recombination rate, consistent with reports of high genetic diversity in natural, sexually reproducing M. lini populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>], and an ability of the asexual stage to withstand small- and large-scale chromosomal duplications and deletions, which can both impact upon the virulence phenotype. Several mapping families have been produced for other rust fungi, including the wheat stem rust, poplar rust and pine fusiform rust fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>].

Products were amplified from genomic DNA or cDNA by PCR using primers that flanked introns (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM18" ref-type="media">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>In planta transient expression assays</title><p>PCR products were amplified from cDNA using primers that would amplify the full coding region, or just the region encoding the predicted mature protein (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM18" ref-type="media">18</xref>). In the latter case an artificial ATG codon was inserted in-frame immediately upstream of the avirulence gene sequence to initiate translation. All products were amplified using Phusion&#x000ae; High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), dA-tailed and cloned into pGEM&#x000ae;-T Easy (Promega) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. For all AvrM14 constructs, AvrL2-A full-length and AvrL2-A dSP36 the cloned sequences were verified by Sanger sequencing before insertion of the coding region as an EcoRI fragment between the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and Agrobacterium tumefaciens nopaline synthase terminator sequences in the pTN35S plant expression vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For AvrL2-A dSP20, dSP26, dSP32 and another version of the full-length AvrL2-A gene, sequences were PCR amplified as described above and cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen), then transferred into pEarleyGate-102 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>] using LR clonase (Invitrogen). This inserted the sequence between the CaMV 35S promoter and A. tumefaciens octopine synthase terminator of pEarleyGate-102, utilising the natural AvrL2-A stop codon to prevent translation of C-terminal protein tags that are also present in this vector. The L2 expression construct has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Expression vectors were transformed into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pMP90) and cultures were prepared at an optical density (600 nm) of 1.0 in a buffer containing 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulphonic acid pH 5.6 and 200 &#x003bc;M acetosyringone for plant infiltration. For co-infiltration experiments, cultures at an optical density (600 nm) of 1.0 were mixed in equal ratio. Cultures were syringe-infiltrated into 3&#x02013;4 week old flax plants or approximately 8 week old Nicotiana tabacum plants. Infiltrated flax plants were kept in the glasshouse (23 &#x000b0;C by day/13 &#x000b0;C by night, ambient light and relative humidity) for 8&#x02013;10 days to allow symptoms to develop. At least six leaves on at least three flax plants were infiltrated per experiment and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Infiltrated tobacco plants were kept in a 25 &#x000b0;C growth room with a 16 h day length for 5 days and at least three leaves on either one or two plants were infiltrated per experiment and the experiment was repeated twice.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12864_2016_3011_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>RADseq and genetic marker summary.
