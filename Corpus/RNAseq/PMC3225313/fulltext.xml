Thus, improvement in current knowledge of molecular changes associated with pancreatic cancer is urgently needed to explore novel venues of diagnostics and treatment of this dismal disease. While there is mounting evidence that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) transcribed from intronic and intergenic regions of the human genome may play different roles in the regulation of gene expression in normal and cancer cells, their expression pattern and biological relevance in pancreatic cancer is currently unknown. In the present work we investigated the relative abundance of a collection of lncRNAs in patients' pancreatic tissue samples aiming at identifying gene expression profiles correlated to pancreatic cancer and metastasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Custom 3,355-element spotted cDNA microarray interrogating protein-coding genes and putative lncRNA were used to obtain expression profiles from 38 clinical samples of tumor and non-tumor pancreatic tissues.

PDAC is a devastating disease with very poor prognosis for which the only curative treatment is resection surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, only 15-20% of patients have resectable pancreatic tumor, and from these only 20% presents a 5-year survival, which results in an average 5-year survival rate of 3-5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. PDAC aggressiveness is mainly associated to the lack of early diagnosis tools and the limited response to available treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Large-scale gene expression studies of tumor samples have been extensively employed to delineate the molecular pathways and cellular processes involved in tumorigenesis and progression of PDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and to search for novel biomarkers for diagnosis and molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In spite of the wealth of information generated in recent years on the most frequent molecular alterations found in PDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], there are still important open question in pancreatic cancer biology such as the profound resistance of primary and metastatic PDAC to chemo- and radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Regarding the identification of molecular markers for pancreatic cancer diagnostic/prognostic, while some promising candidate genes have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], none have been proven effective to significantly improve early detection and to reduce mortality/morbidity of the disease. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular basis of pancreatic cancer is required for the identification of more effective diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.</p><p>Over the last decade, advances in genome-wide analyses of the eukaryotic transcriptome have revealed that the majority of the human genome is transcribed, producing large numbers of long (&#x0003e; 200 nt) noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) mapping to intronic and intergenic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These include subsets of polyadenylated and non-adenylated transcripts that accumulate differently in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. While only a small fraction of lncRNAs have been characterized in detail, it is clear that these transcripts may act through diverse molecular mechanisms and play regulatory and structural roles in important biological processes, such as in genomic imprinting, chromosome inactivation, cell differentiation and development, cell proliferation, protein nuclear import, organization of nuclear domains and apoptosis (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] for a review).</p><p>Altered expression of lncRNAs has been documented in different types of human cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] prompting an increasing interest in their use as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis as well as potential therapeutic targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Increased expression of the lncRNA <italic>MALAT-1 </italic>has been observed in several types of tumors, including metastatic non-small cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Recently, augmented levels of <italic>HOTAIR </italic>in primary breast tumors were shown to correlate with breast cancer invasiveness and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Measurement of lncRNA <italic>PCA3 </italic>in patient urine samples has been shown to allow more sensitive and specific diagnosis of prostate cancer than the widely used marker prostate-specific antigen (PSA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The lncRNA <italic>HULC </italic>is highly expressed in hepatocarcinoma patients and detected in the blood by conventional PCR methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>There are several reports of aberrant expression of microRNAs in PDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and there is potential in their use as biomarkers for disease diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the expression of lncRNAs in pancreatic cancer. In an interesting study performed by Ting et al. it was observed the aberrant overexpression of satellite repeat RNAs (HSATII) ranging from 100 to 5000 nt in patients with PDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Interestingly, detection of HSATII by RNA in situ hybridization was able to correctly diagnose PDAC in tumor biopsies, including cases in which the histopathology was non-diagnostic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Our group has previously shown that most (at least 74%) annotated protein-coding gene <italic>loci </italic>generate intragenic lncRNAs that map to intronic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Possible relevance of intronic lncRNAs to neoplastic processes was proposed following the observation that subsets of these transcripts are present in gene expression signatures correlated to the degree of malignancy in prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] or to tissue histology in head and neck tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and renal cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition, a number of intronic lncRNAs were found to be regulated by androgen stimulation of cultured prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], indicating that these transcripts are expressed in a regulated manner and thus, corroborating the idea that intronic lncRNAs are biologically relevant.</p><p>In this study, we used a custom cDNA microarray platform with probes for lncRNAs expressed from intronic and intergenic regions of the human genome, as well as for a selected set of cancer-related protein-coding genes to generate expression profiles from a collection of tumor and non-tumor pancreatic tissue samples. Expression of intronic/intergenic lncRNAs subsets was detected across all samples tested. Enrichment of promoter-associated chromatin marks indicate that these transcripts originate from independent transcriptional units. Over-representation of conserved DNA elements and stable secondary structure predictions suggest that at least a fraction of these transcripts are under evolutionary selection and thus potentially functional.</p><p>Importantly, we identified expression signatures comprising long noncoding RNAs that are significantly correlated with primary and metastatic ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This suggests that lncRNAs are modulated during tumorigenesis and tumor progression and therefore may participate in molecular processes relevant to malignant transformation and metastasis in pancreatic cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Long noncoding RNAs from intronic and intergenic regions are expressed in neoplastic and non-tumor pancreatic tissues</title><p>In this work, a custom spotted cDNA microarray with approximately 4,000 elements was used to investigate the expression patterns of a collection of protein-coding transcripts and putative noncoding RNAs in clinical samples of primary and metastatic tumor, chronic pancreatitis and histologically normal pancreatic tissue. This array platform has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and contains probes that interrogate 2,371 RefSeq mRNAs from genes associated with cancer in the literature, as well as 984 transcripts mapping to intronic or intergenic regions of the genome and to known lncRNAs. Fluorescent cRNA targets generated from 38 pancreatic tissue samples (15 primary adenocarcinoma, 9 histologically normal adjacent tissue, 6 metastatic samples and 8 chronic pancreatitis) were individually hybridized to microarrays in replicate. After data filtering (see Methods for details), 1,607 transcripts were detected as expressed in at least one histological type, being 1,267 protein-coding mRNAs and 340 putative noncoding RNAs, including transcripts with no overlap to RefSeq exons, i.e, mapping to intronic and intergenic regions. Only candidate lncRNAs sequences that showed genomic alignments with at least 90% identity and coverage were further analyzed, resulting in 335 transcripts (22 known lncRNAs, 240 putative lncRNAs mapped to intronic regions and 73 to intergenic regions).</p><p>Expression of comparable fractions of protein-coding mRNAs and putative long noncoding transcripts mapping to intronic and intergenic regions was detected in all histological tissue types (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The fraction of intronic lncRNAs detected as expressed in the microarray (240/722 = 0.33) is comparable to that of known RefSeq lncRNAs (22/74 = 0.30) and intergenic lncRNAs (73/188 = 0.39), and lower than the fraction of expressed protein-coding mRNAs (1267/2371 = 0.53). The smaller fraction of lncRNAs detected in pancreatic tissues (0.30-0.39) compared to protein-coding mRNAs (0.53) reflects the observation from other studies that noncoding RNAs are generally less abundant and more tissue-specific than protein coding mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In fact, we observed that the lncRNAs detected in pancreatic tissue samples by array hybridization were on average less abundant than protein-coding transcripts (average intensities 24.9 and 31.6, respectively).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Gene expression detected in the microarrays according to probe type and pancreatic tissue histology</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th align="center" colspan="4">Detected as expressed in</th><th/></tr><tr><th/><th/><th colspan="4"><hr/></th><th/></tr><tr><th align="center">Type</th><th align="center"># probes in the array</th><th align="center">NT<break/>(n = 9)</th><th align="center">T<break/>(n = 15)</th><th align="center">M<break/>(n = 6)</th><th align="center">CP<break/>(n = 8)</th><th align="center"># expressed probes *</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">protein-coding mRNA</td><td align="center">2371</td><td align="center">1106</td><td align="center">1167</td><td align="center">1198</td><td align="center">1230</td><td align="center">1267</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Known lncRNA (RefSeq)</td><td align="center">74</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">19</td><td align="center">22</td><td align="center">18</td><td align="center">22</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Intronic lncRNA</td><td align="center">722</td><td align="center">206</td><td align="center">202</td><td align="center">238</td><td align="center">235</td><td align="center">240</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Intergenic lncRNA</td><td align="center">188</td><td align="center">68</td><td align="center">68</td><td align="center">74</td><td align="center">77</td><td align="center">78</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Total</td><td align="center">3355</td><td align="center">1400</td><td align="center">1456</td><td align="center">1532</td><td align="center">1560</td><td align="center">1607</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*To be considered as expressed, a probe signal should be detected above the median array intensity value in at least 75% of samples from at least one histological type.</p><p>NT, non-tumor pancreatic tissue; T, primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma; M, metastases from primary pancreatic tumors; CP; chronic pancreatitis.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Of the 240 gene loci harboring intronic lncRNAs that were detected in pancreatic tissues, only 62 had array probes interrogating exons of mRNAs from the same <italic>loci</italic>. From these, 31 (50%) were detected only in intronic regions, pointing to a subset of lncRNAs that conceivably are generated by independent intronic transcription rather than pre-mRNA splicing. Thirty one <italic>loci </italic>were detected by both exonic and intronic probes (50%). For each of these <italic>loci</italic>, Pearson correlation between the expression of the lncRNA and mRNA across all pancreatic tissue samples was calculated. Correlations were generally low (-0.5 &#x0003c; r &#x0003c; 0.5 for 27 out 31 <italic>loci</italic>), with 11 <italic>loci </italic>displaying a negative correlation between expression of the intronic lncRNA and the mRNA, and 20 showing a positive correlation.</p><p>To obtain further information regarding the correlation between the 240 intronic lncRNAs expressed in pancreatic tissues and the adjacent exons from the same <italic>loci </italic>we analyzed their expression in a set of nine RNAseq libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. For each <italic>locus </italic>in each library, the number of tags was normalized by RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads). Pearson correlations between each intronic lncRNA and the adjacent upstream/downstream exons were calculated if all elements (intronic lncRNA, upstream and downstream exons) were detected in at least 4 out 9 RNAseq libraries. Seventy five loci (75/240, 31%) satisfied these criteria and were further analyzed. As expected, we found a high correlation between the expression of exons flanking intronic lncRNAs (66/75 with r &#x0003e; 0.5). We found that about a third of exon/intron pairs showed positive correlation of expression (24/75, r &#x0003e; 0.5). The expression of more than half of exon/intron pairs were poorly correlated (46/75, -0.5 &#x0003c; r &#x0003c; 0.5), and a small fraction was negatively correlated (5/75, r &#x0003c; -0.5). The overall low correlation observed between the expression of intronic lncRNAs and adjacent exons suggest that for the most part intronic lncRNAs are processed and accumulate in the cell at rates distinct from mRNAs produced in the same <italic>loci</italic>, arguing against them being simply remainings of splicing lariats.</p><p>To gain further insight into the expression pattern of the 335 putative lncRNAs, we investigated their expression in other tissue types using publicly available RNAseq datasets generated from nine different tissue histologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. By cross-referencing the genome mapping coordinates of the pancreatic-expressed lncRNAs with coordinates of the RNAseq reads we found that approximately 80% of the former (267/335) are detected in at least one other human tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Intronic and intergenic lncRNAs detected in pancreatic tissues comprise both tissue-specific and broadly expressed transcripts</bold>. Genomic coordinates of 335 intronic/intergenic transcripts detected as expressed in pancreatic tissues were cross-referenced with genomic coordinates of transcripts detected in RNAseq libraries from nine different tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. LncRNAs were grouped and colored by the number of tissue libraries where their expression was detected (Y axis). RNAseq libraries are ordered in the &#x000d7; axis according to the number of pancreatic lncRNAs detected in each library.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-4598-10-141-1"/></fig><p>Coding potential of the 335 sequences mapping to intronic and intergenic regions was investigated using the Coding Potential Calculator (CPC) software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This analysis showed that most sequences (322/335, 96%) have little or no protein coding potential. Thus, we suggest that most of the intronic and intergenic transcripts detected in pancreatic tissues are indeed noncoding RNAs.</p><p>To document the length of the intronic transcripts expressed in pancreatic samples we compared the set of intronic RNA sequences (n = 240) with sequences resulting from the assembly of ESTs and mRNAs deposited in GenBank that map to intronic regions of the genome, previously generated in our group and which is available as a UCSC Genome Browser custom annotation track [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We found that 190 out 240 intronic transcripts (79%) are represented by an assembled sequence contig. The mean length of the intronic contigs is 779 bp, whereas the individual ESTs have a mean length of 428 bp, suggesting that the ESTs spotted on the microarray are partial sequences of longer noncoding RNA transcripts.</p><p>We also investigated the proximity of 73 intergenic lncRNAs to UTRs of annotated genes to evaluate if these transcripts could represent untranslated regions of incomplete mRNAs. We found that 14 intergenic transcripts (14/73, i.e. 19%) map within 1 kb from a known 3'or 5' UTR and could potentially extend the 3' or 5' untranslated region of a known protein-coding mRNA. The remaining 59 transcripts map at least 1 kb away from a known mRNA and possibly constitute yet unannotated intergenic noncoding RNAs.</p><p>To investigate if the intronic and intergenic RNAs detected in pancreatic tissue could be precursors of small regulatory ncRNAs, we compared the set of 335 lncRNAs expressed in pancreas to microRNA and snRNA sequence databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. No significant similarity to known small RNA was found, except for one sequence that mapped to the <italic>SNOR89 locus</italic>. Considering that the average length of micro RNA precursors (&#x0003e; 1,000 nt) is greater than the average EST length (468 nt) we extended the genomic coordinates of probe sequences by 1 kb at both ends and repeated the sequence comparison with known small RNA datasets. Using this approach, we found four putative extended EST sequences that show high similarity to seven additional small RNAs: <italic>hsa-mir-1259, hsa-mir-326, hsa-mir-4269, hsa-mir-675, SNORD12, SNORD12B </italic>and <italic>SNORD12C</italic>.</p><p>Sequence conservation among species is generally viewed as an indication of functional significance of a given genomic feature. We searched for evidence of sequence conservation within the set of intronic/intergenic lncRNAs expressed in pancreatic tissues by comparing their mapping coordinates with those from conserved DNA elements in vertebrates (phastCons 46way vertebrates), mammals (phastCons 46way placental) and primates (phastCons 46way primates) obtained from the UCSC genome browser. After normalization by the number of conserved elements present in each group, relatively greater overlap with conserved DNA elements was observed within primate, mammalian and vertebrate sequences, in this order (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Figure S1). The overlap of intronic/intergenic RNAs with evolutionarily conserved DNA elements was greater than the expected by chance alone, as judge by the overlap attained with a set of randomly selected intronic/intergenic DNA sequences with same length and CG% content (Fisher's exact test <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05, Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Figure S1). In addition, a fraction of the lncRNAs mapping to intronic/intergenic regions (49 sequences out 335 analyzed, 15%) appear to fold into stable RNA secondary structures (P &#x0003e; 0.5) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://verjo102.iq.usp.br/sites/tahira/structures.html">http://verjo102.iq.usp.br/sites/tahira/structures.html</ext-link>), as predicted by the RNAz program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Altogether, these observations provide additional support to the notion that at least a fraction of the noncoding transcripts mapping to intronic/intergenic regions may exert functional roles in pancreatic cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Enrichment of promoter-associated chromatin marks (H3K4me3) and start sites of capped transcripts suggest that intronic lncRNAs are independent transcriptional units</title><p>Given the paucity of information about the biogenesis of lncRNAs originated from intronic and intergenic regions, we searched for regulatory elements in the genome that could be associated to their transcriptional control. First, we investigated the distribution of trimethylation of lysine 4 in histone 3 (H3K4me3), a chromatin modification associated with regions of transcription initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], in the vicinity of intronic/intergenic lncRNAs. Genomic coordinates of H3K4me3 marks measured in 13 cell lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] were obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser. Only H3K4me3 marks with a <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-5 </sup>were used to limit the experimental noise. The nearest H3K4me4 mark relative to the known boundaries of intronic/intergenic lncRNAs (based on sequenced ESTs) expressed in pancreatic tissues was selected and the distance annotated.

Our expression measurements of intronic lncRNAs do not permit to distinguish between i) intron lariats resulting from splicing of a pre-mRNA or ii) independent transcriptional units located within intron-annotated genomic regions. We have focused on poly(A+)-selected RNA fractions followed by oligo-dT primed reverse transcription to minimize the chance of labeling targets from non-polyadenylated spliced lariats. We argue that the identification of subsets of transcripts that map to intronic regions and whose steady-state levels allows the detection by microarrays indicate that these are not rapidly turned-over intron lariats.

For the remaining transcripts, absence of sequence conservation should not be taken as evidence of no biological relevance, since it is known that well-characterized functional lncRNAs are poorly conserved across their global sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].</p><p>As proposed by Washielt et al.

It is well documented in the literature that small regulatory RNAs can be generated by processing of long RNA precursors transcribed from intronic and intergenic regions of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].

Only a discrete overlap was found, indicating that long intronic/intergenic transcripts are predominantly not precursors of known microRNAs/snoRNAs, yet leaving open the possibility that these transcripts may represent precursors of uncharacterized novel small RNAs.</p><p>We found significant enrichment of H3K4me3, a promoter-associated chromatin mark frequently found in RNA Pol II transcribed regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], in the vicinity (up to 2 kb) of intronic (p &#x0003c; 0.05) noncoding transcripts as compared to randomly selected genomic DNA sequences. A comparable H3K4me3 enrichment was observed nearby known protein-coding transcripts, suggesting that transcription of protein-coding mRNAs and intronic lncRNAs initiates at promoter regions with similar chromatin contexts. We also observed a significant enrichment of CAGE tags proximal to known start sites of intronic lncRNAs expressed in pancreatic tissues, corroborating the notion that at least a fraction of these is independent transcriptional units. Since pancreatic tissues were absent from the study that generated the CAGE tags used for cross-reference, these results possibly underestimate the co-localization of intronic/intergenic lncRNAs with <italic>bona fide </italic>transcription start sites of capped transcripts.</p><p>Differently from protein-coding mRNAs, we did not find significant enrichment of CpG island in the vicinity of intronic and intergenic RNA sequences expressed in pancreatic tissues. Based on this observation, we propose that methylation of CpG islands is not involved in the transcriptional regulation of most intronic/intergenic lncRNAs expressed in pancreatic tissues. Nonetheless, the full set of observations regarding the structure, conservation and genomic context argues that at least a fraction of intronic/intergenic transcripts detected in pancreatic tissues are independent transcriptional units rather than transcriptional noise originated from random Pol II firing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], prompting us to investigate in more detail their relative expression levels in tumor and non-tumor pancreatic tissues.</p><p>Differential expression of intronic lncRNAs in prostate and renal cancer has already been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Here we extend these observations to pancreatic cancer, asking whether there were sets of intronic/intergenic lncRNAs deregulated in clinical samples of pancreatic tumor. Comparing expression profiles from primary tumors with samples from histologically non-malignant pancreatic tissue and chronic pancreatitis (CP) we identified a 147-gene signature correlated with primary pancreatic tumor. This strategy was devised to favor the identification of tumor specific markers rather than transcripts associated with the stromal cell component, which is augmented in both tumor and CP samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We sought to validate the pancreatic cancer expression signature by performing a meta-analysis with published gene expression studies of pancreatic cancer. Only 23% of the protein-coding mRNAs present in our pancreatic cancer signature were also identified in other reports. This modest overlap can be accounted for by differences in platforms and the heterogeneity of pancreatic tumor samples. Notwithstanding, we observed a high agreement (17/24, 71%) between the expression changes measured in our signature and those retrieved from published data, which provides independent support for our result and validates our sample set and methodological approach. This set included genes already reported in the literature as differentially expressed in pancreatic cancer and that have been investigated as biomarkers for pancreatic cancer (i.e. <italic>S100A6 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], <italic>S100P </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], <italic>TIMP1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] and <italic>NF-&#x003ba;B </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]). In agreement with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], the analysis of gene enriched categories in the pancreatic cancer expression signature indicated the over-representation of genes involved in focal adhesion. Over-representation of focal adhesion genes in the pancreatic cancer signature is suggestive that deregulation of genes encoding proteins involved in the connection and signaling to the extracellular matrix plays an important role in the malignant transformation and/or maintenance of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. This set included integrin beta 5 (<italic>ITGB5</italic>), which we found to be upregulated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Itgb5 protein has been investigated as diagnostic biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] and is target of the inhibitor drug EMD121974, which is under clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Thus, <italic>ITGB5 </italic>is an attractive candidate to be tested as biomarker and/or new drug target in pancreatic cancer.</p><p>Interestingly, a significant fraction (29%) of the 147-gene signature correlated with primary pancreatic tumor was comprised by lncRNAs mapping to intronic or intergenic regions, suggesting that noncoding RNAs could exert roles related to tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer. This result prompted us to investigate the existence of subsets of lncRNAs with expression levels altered in metastatic samples.</p><p>We identified a statistically significant metastasis signature of 355 differentially expressed transcripts that includes 220 protein-coding genes, 134 intronic/intergenic transcripts and 6 known lncRNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>, Table S3). In addition to protein-coding genes previously shown to be deregulated in pancreatic metastasis (7 out of 19), the metastasis signature comprises known genes already associated to metastasis in other types of cancer (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>, Table S4), thus pointing to potentially interesting candidates for testing as new targets for treatment of the metastatic disease in pancreatic cancer.</p><p>The significant fraction of lncRNAs in the metastasis signature (38% of total) suggests that deregulation of these lncRNAs could also be associated with the metastatic process. Expression changes of protein-coding mRNAs from genes of the MAPK pathway has already been described in pancreatic carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Here we found 9 intronic lncRNAs mapped to genes correlated to the MAPK pathway in the metastasis signature. We also identified expression changes in gene <italic>loci </italic>related to apoptosis, including 42 protein-coding mRNAs and 6 intronic lncRNAs; this pathway was one out of 12 described by Jones <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] as genetically altered in pancreatic cancer. Four intronic lncRNAs belong to both categories. These results prompted us to document in more detail the nature of the 11 transcripts mapping to intronic regions of gene <italic>loci </italic>associated with the MAPK pathway or related to apoptosis, i.e., their relative orientation to the corresponding protein-coding mRNAs.</p><p>Strand-specific RT-PCR assays using RNA aliquots from tumor tissue samples showed that 4 intronic transcripts have antisense orientation relative to the protein-coding mRNA: <italic>PPP3CB</italic>, <italic>ATF2</italic>, <italic>TGFBR2 </italic>and <italic>MAPK1</italic>. Antisense transcripts originated in <italic>PPP3CB </italic>intronic regions were also detected in MIA PaCa-2 cells. The antisense orientation relative to the corresponding protein-coding mRNA provide strong evidence to support that these noncoding RNAs are produced from independent transcriptional units, possibly under control of a different promoter region.</p><p>Transcripts mapping to intronic regions with the same orientation of the corresponding protein-coding mRNA were detected in the <italic>ATF2</italic>, <italic>TGFBR2 </italic>and <italic>MAPK1</italic>, as well as in the 7 other gene <italic>loci </italic>tested (<italic>ARRB1</italic>, <italic>MAP3K1</italic>, <italic>MAP3K14</italic>, <italic>MAP2K5</italic>, <italic>PTEN, DAPK1 </italic>and <italic>RAPGF2</italic>), in both tissue and MIA PaCa-2 RNA samples. These sense-oriented intronic transcripts could indeed be <italic>bona fide </italic>RNAs originated from independent transcription, but also result from reverse transcription of unprocessed mRNA precursors or of stable RNA lariats generate during pre-mRNA splicing. Further experiments will be necessary to determine the precise nature of these sense-oriented intronic RNAs.</p><p>The relative abundance of two sense (<italic>DAPK1, MAP3K14</italic>) and one antisense-oriented (<italic>PPP3CB</italic>) intronic transcripts in samples of primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma and pancreatic metastases was independently accessed by qRT-PCR, confirming the results measured in the microarray hybridizations. Four additional intronic lncRNAs showed concordant results between qRT-PCR and the microarrays (<italic>ARRB</italic>, <italic>RAPGF2</italic>, <italic>ATF2 </italic>and <italic>PTEN</italic>). Expression changes of 4 intronic lncRNAs were not concordant between qRT-PCR and microarray (<italic>MAP3K1</italic>, <italic>TGFBR2</italic>, <italic>MAP2K5 </italic>and <italic>MAPK1</italic>). The amount of RNA and the number of patient tissue samples available for the qRT-PCR experiments were limiting, and the marginally significant and non-validated lncRNA candidates were tested only in few samples in an initial round of validation. It is possible that some of the intronic lncRNA candidates that failed the initial round of validation would still be validated as differentially expressed if tested in additional tissue samples. However, an alternative explanation for the non-validation of some candidates is the presence of array hybridization artifacts such as cross-hybridization or target amplification biases.</p><p>Intragenic lncRNAs have been shown to modulate in <italic>cis </italic>the expression of mRNAs expressed in the same <italic>locus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. We measured the relative abundance of mRNAs produced in the <italic>PPP3CB</italic>, <italic>DAPK1 </italic>and <italic>MAP3K1</italic>4 <italic>loci </italic>in the same samples and did not observe statistically significant expression differences between primary tumors and metastasis. This result indicates that intronic RNAs produced in these <italic>loci </italic>do not affect in <italic>cis </italic>the abundance of the corresponding protein-coding transcripts. This conclusion is also supported by the absence of significant correlation between expression levels of protein-coding and noncoding RNAs originating from <italic>PPP3CB </italic>and <italic>DAPK1 loci</italic>. The possibility that intronic lncRNAs differentially expressed in metastatic samples may exert regulatory functions acting in <italic>trans </italic>is compelling and warrants further studies.</p><p>It has been shown that a significant portion of the noncoding component of the human transcriptome is comprised of non-polyadenylated RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We note that our analysis was limited to the set of lncRNAs interrogated by the array platform (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and by the use of poly(A+)-enriched RNA, and therefore is not comprehensive in terms of describing the full complement of lncRNAs expressed in pancreatic tissues. Thus, additional studies using unbiased approaches such as RNAseq or tiling arrays will be required to catalog all poly(A+) and poly(A-) transcripts expressed in pancreatic tissues with distinct degrees of malignancy and for the identification of novel regulatory lncRNA candidates involved in the malignant transformation and tumor progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this work we report that noncoding RNAs originating from intronic and intergenic genomic regions are expressed in tumor and non-tumor pancreatic tissues. Enrichment of promoter-associated chromatin marks plus the observation of antisense orientation of intronic transcripts relative to mRNAs expressed from the same <italic>loci </italic>provide evidence that these messages are not by-products of random transcription or pre-mRNA splicing but rather, are independent transcriptional units. Further investigation will be required to determine the biogenesis of these lncRNAs.</p><p>We identified gene expression signatures correlated to primary and metastatic stages of pancreatic cancer, which in addition to protein-coding mRNAs comprise collections of long intronic and intergenic noncoding RNAs. Further studies will be necessary to reveal possible biological functions and molecular mechanisms exerted by these lncRNAs in tumorigenesis and/or progression of pancreatic tumors.</p><p>In summary, our work contributes with novel candidate biomarkers of pancreatic cancer and highlights the importance of investigating the biological relevance of long noncoding RNAs in order to fully understand the molecular basis of the disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patient Samples and Cell Lines</title><p>A total of 38 pancreatic samples stored in freshly-frozen tissue collections were obtained with informed consent from patients seen at Hospital das Cl&#x000ed;nicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S&#x000e3;o Paulo (HC-FMUSP). Primary tumor tissues (T) were obtained from 15 patients with no evidence of metastasis. Nine samples of histologically normal pancreatic tissue fragments (NT) were dissected from non-neoplasic tissue sections adjacent to tumor sites. Six samples of metastases originated from primary pancreatic tumors (M) were obtained from biopsies in affected organs (one from peritoneum, one from ganglion and four from liver tissues). Eight tissue samples from patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) were also collected. All tissue sections were reviewed by a pathologist for histological confirmation and whenever necessary, macro-dissected to guarantee that 80% or more of the sections used for gene expression analysis were composed of neoplastic/pancreatitis tissue.</p><p>Pancreatic carcinoma cell lines MIA PaCa-2 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained using DEMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), 3 mM L-glutamine, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and microarray target preparation</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from pancreatic tissue samples (50-100 mg tissue) using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's recommendations. RNA cleanup including a DNase I digestion step was performed using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen). RNA integrity was measured by the relative abundance of 28S/18S ribosomal subunits, verified through micro fluid capillary electrophoresis (Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100).</p><p>To generate cRNA targets, 1 &#x003bc;g of total RNA from each sample was linearly amplified in two rounds of reverse transcription followed by <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription according to Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Briefly, oligo dT-T7 was used to prime first-strand cDNA synthesis (SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis - Invitrogen). After second-strand cDNA synthesis (cDNA Polymerase Mix - Clontech), cRNA targets were produced by <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription (MegaScript T7 - Ambion). In the second round of amplification, cRNAs produced in the first-round were reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers and used as template for <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription in the presence of amino-allyl UTP. Prior to hybridization, cRNA targets were labeled by coupling with mono-reactive Cy5-esters (Amersham). Quantification of cDNA yield and dye incorporation was performed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Typically, 50-100 &#x003bc;g of cRNA were obtained following two rounds of linear amplification. Two sets of cRNA targets were generated from each RNA sample and independently hybridized to microarray slides.</p></sec><sec><title>Microarray design and hybridization</title><p>Construction of the spotted custom-cDNA microarray platform was described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Probes were selected from the over 1 million EST clone collection generated during the Human Cancer Genome Project, a large-scale EST sequencing project that used cDNA libraries generated from poly(A) mRNA derived from over 20 different types of human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Transcripts from the EST dataset were annotated as protein-coding, putative intronic lncRNA or intergenic lncRNA following mapping to the human genome sequence and cross-referencing with genome mapping coordinates of annotated genes (RefSeq dataset) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Intronic/intergenic lncRNAs used for microarray spotting were randomly selected from the annotated EST dataset. Transcripts annotated as "intronic lncRNAs" comprise sequences that mapped within an intronic region of a protein-coding gene. Transcripts annotated as "intergenic lncRNAs" comprise sequences that map to genomic regions devoid of any annotated gene. To be annotated as intronic or intergenic a given transcript could not overlap a genomic region spanning an exon of annotated protein-coding genes. "Known lncRNAs" refer to transcripts whose genomic coordinates overlap fully with the coordinates of noncoding RNAs from the RefSeq dataset (accession Id = NR_nnnnnn). Transcripts annotated as "protein-coding gene" overlapped with exons of protein-coding RefSeq transcripts in genomic space. To account for possible unannotated intron retention events, partial transcripts mapping to exon/intron boundaries were annotated as "exonic".</p><p>In the course of this work microarray probes were re-mapped to the latest version of the human genome (hg19) and re-annotated to reflect updated RefSeq and UCSC gene models (Oct. 2010). Each glass-slide contains 3,355 cDNA fragments spotted in duplicate, plus positive (cDNA from housekeeping genes) and negative (plant and bacterial DNA) controls. Spotted cDNAs comprise 722 ESTs mapping to intronic regions of well-annotated (RefSeq) protein-coding genes, 74 ESTs mapping to known RefSeq lncRNAs, 188 ESTs mapping to intergenic regions of the genome. The array also contained 2,371 ESTs mapping to exons of protein-coding genes associated with cancer based on a literature search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], comprising genes involved in apoptosis, tumorigenesis, metastasis, cancer metabolism and cancer progression.</p><p>For each sample, cRNA targets were ressuspended in a final volume of 200 &#x003bc;l of 1&#x000d7; Microarray Hybridization Solution v.2.0 (GE Healthcare) containing 25% formamide, denaturated at 92&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes and incubated with microarrays at 42&#x000b0;C for 16 hours using an automated slide processor (GE Healthcare).

Next, for each slide, the fifty percent of probes with the lowest intensity values were filtered out. A mean expression value for each probe, in each patient sample, was calculated when at least 3 out of 4 replicates showed valid measurements. Only probes with valid measurements in at least 75% of the samples in any of the histological groups (NT, T, PA or M) were selected, resulting in a total of 1,607 probes for further analysis. The ComBat program was used to remove systematic variations in gene expression across experiments resulting from the use of different batches of microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>].
