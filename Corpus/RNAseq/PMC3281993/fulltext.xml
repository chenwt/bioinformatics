Although natural selection operating on cancers favors the outgrowth of malignant clones with replicative immortality, the continued survival of a cancer is generally restricted by the life span of its host. Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) is an unusual cancer that has survived beyond the death of the individual that spawned it by acquiring adaptations for transmission between hosts. This cancer has spread through the Tasmanian devil population and is threatening the species with extinction (<xref rid="bib10 bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins et&#x000a0;al., 2006; McCallum et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). The genomes of the Tasmanian devil and its transmissible cancer, DFTD, are thus of interest both from the perspective of conservation of a threatened species as well as for the insights they may provide into the&#x000a0;origins, somatic evolution and population genetics of an extraordinarily divergent neoplastic clonal lineage.</p><p>The Tasmanian devil (<italic>Sarcophilus harrisii</italic>) is a marsupial carnivore endemic to the island of Tasmania, Australia. Tasmanian devils are solitary nocturnal scavengers that weigh up to 12&#x000a0;kg and generally live for 5 or 6 years in the wild (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Owen and Pemberton, 2005</xref>). They are seasonal breeders and females rear a maximum of four pouch young each year (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Owen and Pemberton, 2005</xref>). The species has limited genetic diversity, although three genetically distinct geographically defined subpopulations have been described (<xref rid="bib11 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jones et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Miller et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>DFTD was first observed in northeastern Tasmania in 1996 (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). The disease is characterized by the appearance of tumors, usually on the face and inside the mouth of affected animals, which frequently metastasise and usually cause death within months (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>) (<xref rid="bib10 bib13 bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Lachish et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Loh et&#x000a0;al., 2006a</xref>). Most commonly observed in sexually mature individuals of 2 years or older, DFTD occurs equally in male and female devils (<xref rid="bib10 bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Loh et&#x000a0;al., 2006a</xref>). The cancer has spread rapidly through the Tasmanian devil population and has been associated with devil population decline (<xref rid="bib10 bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Lachish et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Epidemiological studies have documented the expansion of the disease down the east coast of Tasmania and its continuing progression toward the west coast (<xref rid="bib10 bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Lachish et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>DFTD spreads by the direct transfer of living cancer cells, usually through bites inflicted on the face during mating and feeding interactions (<xref rid="bib9 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Hamede et&#x000a0;al., 2008; Pearse and Swift, 2006</xref>). DFTD is believed to be of neural crest origin, and the cancer cells express a number of genes of the Schwann cell lineage (<xref rid="bib17 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Loh et&#x000a0;al., 2006b; Murchison et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). The mechanism whereby the clone avoids immune rejection during colonization of allogeneic hosts remains unknown. Although low genetic diversity may contribute to DFTD susceptibility, experiments have indicated that devils are normally capable of mounting immune reactions to allogeneic grafts (<xref rid="bib12 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Kreiss et&#x000a0;al., 2011; Siddle et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>DFTD is one of two known naturally occurring clonally transmissible cancers, the other being the canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) of dogs (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Murchison, 2009</xref>). CTVT is&#x000a0;a sexually transmitted lineage that is found around that world and that may have first arisen thousands of years ago from the cells of a wolf or East Asian breed of dog (<xref rid="bib26 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Murgia et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Rebbeck et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Genetic analysis of the global diversity of CTVT cancers has indicated that the lineage has achieved considerable heterogeneity, with substantial lineage diversity present worldwide (<xref rid="bib26 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Murgia et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Rebbeck et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Divergence time estimates suggest that modern CTVT may represent a recent global sweep of an ancient lineage (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Rebbeck et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). In contrast to CTVT, little is known of the population diversity of DFTD or the dynamics of its spread through its host population.</p><p>Cancer genomes are characterized by somatic changes including single-base substitution mutations, small insertions and deletions (indels), structural rearrangements, and copy number alterations. Analysis of the catalog of somatic mutations in cancer genomes can lead to greater understanding of the mutational events that triggered clonal outgrowth and the exposures or DNA repair defects that were responsible for the mutations in the first place (<xref rid="bib30 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pleasance et&#x000a0;al., 2010a, 2010b</xref>). DFTD is a transmissible clone that has spread through the devil population in a process similar to metastasis. Its widely divergent lineage as a malignant clone make it an almost unique model for&#x000a0;studying the genomic stability and long term evolution of cancer cells.</p><p>We have sequenced, assembled, and annotated the normal genome of the Tasmanian devil, and we have used this reference to analyze the genomes of a second normal Tasmanian devil and two geographically distant DFTD cancer subclones. In addition, we have analyzed the genetic diversity present in 104 DFTD tumors collected from distant locations throughout Tasmania over a period of 7 years. Our analysis has led to the identification of genetic features of the original devil that gave rise to DFTD, a description of the underlying mutational processes that have characterized DFTD progression, annotation of gene variants that may have contributed to DFTD pathogenesis, and a map of the clonal dynamics of the disease during its spread through Tasmania.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>The Tasmanian Devil Genome</title><p>To generate a reference genome for the Tasmanian devil, we sequenced and assembled the genome of a 5-year-old female Tasmanian devil. Sequencing libraries were prepared from genomic DNA extracted from a cell line derived from normal fibroblasts. These were sequenced from both ends, yielding 2.87 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> pairs of 100&#x000a0;bp sequence reads. Additional &#x0201c;mate pair&#x0201d; libraries, produced by circularising genomic DNA fragments of between 3 kilobase pairs (kb) and 10 kb in length, were generated and 50&#x000a0;bp was sequenced from both ends in order to assist with genome assembly.</p><p>The genome was assembled with the Phusion2 assembly pipeline (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Mullikin and Ning, 2003</xref>), and assembly features are summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. We estimated the size of the Tasmanian devil genome to be between 2.89 and 3.17 gigabase pairs (Gb) using both sequencing and flow cytometry data (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref> available online). This is comparable with previous estimates of the Tasmanian devil and other marsupial genome sizes (<xref rid="bib20 bib21 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Mikkelsen et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Miller et&#x000a0;al., 2011; Renfree et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). The Tasmanian devil genome has a G+C content of 36.4%, similar to that of the opossum (37.8%) but lower than that of humans (45.2%).</p><p>To determine the chromosomal locations of our assembled contigs, we individually sorted each of the seven Tasmanian devil chromosomes from the female devil fibroblast cell line using a flow cytometer. Fifty thousand copies of each devil chromosome were collected, amplified, and sequenced. Alignment of the chromosome reads with the assembled contigs was used to assign the contigs to chromosomes; in addition, this method was used to detect and correct assembly errors by identifying contigs with homology to more than one chromosome. Using this method, we were able to assign 35,534 supercontigs (99%) to chromosomes. The number of bases assigned to each chromosome correlated with the flow cytometry measurement of chromosome DNA content (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Tasmanian devil chromosomes were named according to the system described by Pearse and Swift (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Pearse and Swift, 2006</xref>), which differs in the naming of chromosomes 1 and 2 to a previous karyotype nomenclature for devils (<xref rid="bib4 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Eldridge and Metcalf, 2006; Martin and Hayman, 1967</xref>). We used cross-species chromosome painting to determine the homology between devil&#x000a0;and opossum chromosomes (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>). We then used conservation with the opossum genome as a template for ordering supercontigs on each devil chromosome.</p><p>Tasmanian devil genes were identified using the Ensembl genome annotation pipeline (<xref rid="bib3 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Curwen et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Potter et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>), modified to incorporate devil transcriptome data. In total 18,775 protein-coding gene models were constructed, 1,213 of&#x000a0;which did not have orthologs in the human or opossum genomes. We specifically searched the Tasmanian devil genome for a set of 451 genes that have been causally linked with cancer in humans (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Futreal et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Orthologs for 398 of these genes&#x000a0;could be detected in the Tasmanian devil genome. Three hundred sixty-three microRNAs (miRNAs) were annotated in the&#x000a0;Tasmanian devil genome by aligning small RNA sequence reads (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Murchison et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>).

The number of variants in the DFTD genomes was somewhat higher than the number of variants observed in the normal female devil, and in a second normal male genome sequenced to assess normal variation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B). This is not surprising, given that the DFTD genome contains variants that were present in the constitutional genome of the devil that first gave rise to the DFTD clone (the founder devil), as well as somatic variants that have arisen since DFTD has been a malignant clonal lineage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B). These estimates are consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Miller et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Cytogenetic analyses indicated that the two&#x000a0;DFTD subclones have differences in their karyotypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A). 87T is pseudodiploid with 13 chromosomes, whereas 53T is pseudotetraploid with 32 chromosomes. We used labeled flow-sorted chromosomes derived from a normal devil cell line as probes for forward chromosome painting of 87T. This experiment revealed several cytogenetic changes in DFTD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>C and 2D). Reverse chromosome painting, using labeled DNAs derived from flow-sorted chromosomes from 87T,&#x000a0;provided further insights into the translocations in 87T and revealed heterozygous deletions on chromosomes 1, 2, and 3, as well as trisomy 5p (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>E).

We next devised methods to identify subsets of variants of germline origin (i.e., those that were present in the constitutional genome of the founder devil) and those of somatic origin (i.e., those that arose during clonal proliferation of the DFTD lineage) in order to investigate the origin and somatic evolution of the DFTD clone.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Origin of DFTD</title><p>DFTD was first observed in 1996 in northeast Tasmania (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Previous studies have indicated that the cancer is derived from the cells of one devil (the DFTD founder), and has subsequently spread through the devil population as&#x000a0;a&#x000a0;clone (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Pearse and Swift, 2006</xref>). We do not have DNA from the founder's normal genome, as this animal was a wild Tasmanian devil that lived and probably died prior to 1996. However, variants from this devil's constitutional genome remain within the&#x000a0;DFTD cells that make up the tumors of thousands of devils.</p><p>We sought to reconstruct the genome of the founder devil by searching for common variants between the genomes of the two DFTD subclones, 87T and 53T. These variants will include normal variation that was present in the founder's genome as well as somatic variants in DFTD that arose prior to divergence of the 87T and 53T lineages. We found 700,436 common single base substitutions and 251,257 common indels between 87T and 53T (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B). At least 563,877 single-base substitution variants and 235,610 indels are likely to be the founder's germline variants, as we also found them in either the female or male normal devil genomes. The remaining 136,559 substitutions and 14,647 indels will include private germline variants that were specific to the founder devil and not found in the two normal genomes that we sequenced as well as somatic mutations that have been acquired by the DFTD lineage.</p><p>The gender of the founder devil is unknown. Like other marsupials, Tasmanian devils have X and Y sex chromosomes, and males are the heterogametic sex. Previous studies have indicated that neither of the sex chromosomes is cytogenetically identifiable in DFTD (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Pearse and Swift, 2006</xref>). It is possible that the sex chromosomes initially present in the constitutional genome of the founder devil have been lost during DFTD carcinogenesis or that these chromosomes have been rearranged in the DFTD genome such that they are not cytogenetically identifiable. We first searched for the presence of the Y chromosome gene <italic>SRY</italic> in DFTD. As expected, the <italic>SRY</italic> gene could be amplified from the genome of a male devil but not from a female devil; however, our assays could not detect <italic>SRY</italic> in the DFTD genome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A). We next searched for evidence of the X chromosome in the DFTD genome. Reverse chromosome painting experiments and copy number analysis of 87T indicated that the X chromosome is present in approximately two copies in this genome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>). These are likely to be a homologous pair rather than recent duplicates, as the number of single-base substitution variants mapping to the X chromosome in the two DFTD genomes was comparable to the number of variants found on the X chromosome in the female normal devil genome and approximately double the number of X chromosome variants found in the male normal genome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B). The data therefore suggest that the DFTD founder devil was a female.</p><p>DFTD was first observed in northeast Tasmania (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). To explore further the geographic origin of the founder devil we sequenced the mitochondrial genomes (excluding the control region) of 92 Tasmanian devils from 25 locations in Tasmania and constructed a phylogenetic tree based on their sequences (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C). We found evidence for six mitochondrial haplotypes among normal devils. Three of these had widespread distributions throughout Tasmania and three were confined to locations in the northwest of Tasmania, consistent with other studies (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Miller et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). The 87T and 53T DFTD mitochondrial genomes were most closely related to one of the widespread devil haplotypes.</p><p>There is evidence of horizontal transfer of mitochondrial genomes between hosts and cancers in another transmissible cancer lineage, CTVT, which has led to multiple distinct clades of CTVT mitochondrial haplotypes (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Rebbeck et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). To test whether horizontal transfer of mitochondria occurs in DFTD, we sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of 104 DFTD tumors and included their haplotypes on the phylogenetic tree (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C). All of the DFTD mitochondria were either identical to or apparently derived from a single devil haplotype, suggesting that they are clonally derived from the founder devil. These analyses suggest that mitochondrial horizontal transfer does not occur or is not widespread in DFTD, and indicate that the founder devil belonged to a haplogroup that is currently widespread throughout Tasmania.</p><p>DFTD was first observed in 1996 (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). However, we do not know the timing of the emergence of the DFTD clone. Given the overt and disfiguring symptoms of DFTD, as well as its dramatic recent effects on devil population size (<xref rid="bib10 bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Lachish et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), it seems unlikely that the disease remained undetected for a long period prior to 1996. Indeed, retrospective studies of devil skulls, preserved specimens and pelts collected between 1941 and 1989 revealed no evidence for DFTD prior to the 1990s (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Loh et&#x000a0;al., 2006a</xref>). However, it is possible that the current DFTD epidemic is the most recent manifestation of an ancient clone with a long history of coexistence with the Tasmanian devil population. Our mitochondrial genome analysis indicates that the founder devil's mitochondrial genome is identical to those found in many modern devils (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C). In addition, DFTD mitochondrial genomes are in most cases more closely related to the founder than to each other (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C). These observations are consistent with a recent origin for DFTD.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Somatic Evolution of DFTD</title><p>Having identified genetic features and variants present in the constitutional genome of the DFTD founder devil, we next performed a detailed analysis of DFTD variants of somatic origin.&#x000a0;Somatic variants are those that have arisen during the establishment and progression of DFTD as a clonal lineage. Analysis of somatic variants in two divergent DFTD lineages may provide insight into the mutational processes that have operated in DFTD as well as the genetic changes that have driven its growth.</p><p>We cannot directly ascertain the set of somatic variants in&#x000a0;DFTD because the founder devil died in obscurity in the Tasmanian bush more than a decade ago. However, we compiled a set of DFTD single-base substitutions enriched for somatic mutations by identifying variants that were present in one DFTD genome but absent in the other. We identified 15,160 single-base substitutions that were present in 87T but not 53T, and 17,790 that were in 53T but absent from 87T (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B). These variants could have arisen as somatic base substitution mutations. Alternatively, as we do not know the germline genotype of the DFTD founder devil, they could have been heterozygous germline variants that were lost in either of the two DFTD lineages. However, we established that most of these variants are likely to have arisen as somatic substitutions by demonstrating the absence of 15 out of 16 in the genomes of 110 normal devils. Moreover, the nonsynonymous to synonymous (NS/S) ratios for the 87T and 53T unique variants were 2.78&#x000a0;and 2.08 respectively, a range typical of somatic variants in human cancers and compatible with that expected from random mutagenesis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A). By contrast, the NS/S ratios of germline devil single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were 0.9 and 0.98 for the normal male and female devil genomes, respectively, similar to that of common SNPs in humans and indicative of substantial negative selection. Finally, as somatic mutations are likely to arise in the heterozygous state, the observation that variants unique to each DFTD lineage contain a high proportion of heterozygous variants provides further evidence for these sets being strongly enriched for somatic mutations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B).</p><p>These estimates suggest that 87T and 53T have each acquired between 15,000 and 17,000 single-base substitution mutations since divergence from their most recent common ancestor tumor. We do not know how many somatic mutations were present in the DFTD lineage prior to 87T and 53T divergence. However, the observation that the total number of private variants inferred in the most recent common ancestor tumor (136,559) is comparable to the number of private variants in a normal male genome (135,134), as well as the NS/S ratio for these variants (0.8), suggests that the large majority of the private variants in the common ancestor tumor were of germline origin. This suggests that the prevalence of somatic substitution mutations in DFTD may not be substantially greater than 17,000. This is somewhat higher than the number of mutations observed in many human tumor types (approximately 5,000 per cancer genome) (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Greenman et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). However, it is less than are found in many human melanomas and lung cancers, which are often the result of past mutagenic exposures, or in human cancers with mutator phenotypes due to DNA mismatch repair defects (<xref rid="bib30 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pleasance et&#x000a0;al., 2010a, 2010b</xref>).</p><p>Cancers often have mutational processes that are different to those which operate in the germline. Comparison of the mutation spectra of Tasmanian devil germline variation to the sets of variants highly enriched for somatic mutations in 87T and 53T revealed that, as expected, devil germline SNPs were enriched for transitions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C). However, we also observed elevated proportions of A:T &#x02192; T:A, A:T &#x02192; C:G, and G:C &#x02192; T:A transversion mutations in DFTD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C). This pattern was independently detectable in 87T and 53T since their divergence from their most recent common ancestor tumor, but was not detectable in the variants inferred in these two tumors' most recent common ancestor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C). This suggests that this mutation profile is the result of an endogenous mutational process&#x02014;for example, a defect in DNA repair&#x02014;that was acquired before the divergence of the two lineages, or that it was caused by independent exposure of the two lineages to a carcinogenic environmental agent.</p><p>Copy number changes and structural rearrangements are commonly somatically acquired by cancer genomes. Although the majority of the copy number variants that we identified in 87T and 53T were common to both lineages (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>), some copy number variants, including, for example, the hemizygous deletion on chromosome 3 in 87T, occurred in only one of the two tumors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>D). Such variants are likely to have arisen since the divergence of the 87T and 53T tumor lineages and have therefore been somatically acquired during DFTD evolution. We identified and validated 11 and 17 rearrangements that were specific to the 87T and 53T DFTD genomes, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>E and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). Thirteen of the 28 rearrangements unique to either 87T or 53T had between two and six bases of microhomology at the breakpoint region, indicating that DFTD may employ microhomology-mediated end joining as a repair process for double-stranded DNA breaks.</p><p>Most of the somatic variants that are present in DFTD are likely to be selectively neutral passenger mutations. However, a subset of somatic variants in the DFTD genome will be driver mutations that have provided selective advantage to the cancer during passage through its devil hosts. Three hundred twenty-four genes were predicted to contain nonsynonymous substitution and indel variants that were present in 87T and 53T but not in either of the normal devil genomes (<xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). These included 313 genes with single-base substitutions and 11 genes with indels. A search for predicted nonsynonymous mutations in a set of 138 genes that are known to be mutated by single-base substitutions and indels in human cancers (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Futreal et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>) yielded heterozygous single-base substitutions in <italic>RET</italic> and <italic>FANCD2</italic> that were not present in either of the two normal genomes that we sequenced. Both mutations were predicted to cause single base substitution mutations that have not previously been described in cancer (<xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>).</p><p>Changes in the copy number of cancer genes and truncation or fusion of genes through rearrangements can also promote oncogenesis. Two genes, <italic>MAST3</italic> and a novel gene with similarity to <italic>BTNL9</italic>, were predicted to be homozygously deleted in DFTD. The functions of these two genes are not well understood, although the butyrophilin gene family, of which the <italic>BTNL9</italic>-like gene is a member, may be involved in immune modulation (<xref rid="bib1 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Arnett et&#x000a0;al., 2009; Stammers et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). Neither of the DFTD genomes contained any predicted regions of high-level amplification (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>). We found several putative rearrangements involving genes, including a balanced translocation involving <italic>PDGFA</italic> (<xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>).</p><p>Although DFTD is not virally transmitted, it is possible that a virus may have contributed to DFTD pathogenesis. We searched for the presence of virus DNA in DFTD by aligning virus-derived DNA sequences contained in the RefSeq database with the assembled DFTD genomes as well as the normal devil genome assembly. We did not find evidence for exogenous viruses in the DFTD genome. However, it is possible that DFTD contains viral sequences that were not detectable using this method.</p><p>DFTD colonizes its devil hosts as an allogeneic graft. In order to investigate the mechanisms whereby DFTD evades host immune rejection, we searched for genetic variants in 25 genes involved in the antigen processing and presentation machinery (described by gene ontology IDs GO:0019885 and GO:0019882). Fifteen of these genes could be identified in the devil genome, and one gene, <italic>NOD1</italic>, had a predicted rearrangement that was predicted to be present in both DFTD genomes but absent from the normal Tasmanian devil genomes (<xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Further analysis and annotation of immune genes in the Tasmanian devil genome will be required to elucidate the genetic mechanisms of DFTD immune evasion.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Divergence and Clonal Dynamics of DFTD Lineages</title><p>We have described the somatic changes that have occurred in two DFTD cancers, 87T and 53T, collected in the Forestier Peninsula in the southeast of Tasmania and Narawntapu National Park on the north coast of Tasmania, respectively, since divergence from their most recent common ancestor tumor. Observational epidemiological studies have indicated that DFTD first arrived in the Forestier Peninsula in 2004. The first DFTD case observed in Narawntapu National Park was in 2007. However, we do not know the routes that were followed by these lineages across Tasmania, nor do we have any information about the clonal dynamics of DFTD disease spread. We investigated whether DFTD progression into new territories is characterized by linear colonization and occupation, or rather by repeated waves of lineage replacement.</p><p>The evolutionary dynamics of the DFTD clone during its expansion across Tasmania can be traced by analysis of the observed patterns of somatic mutation. We collected 104 DFTD tumors from 69 Tasmanian devils captured in several locations throughout Tasmania between 2004 and 2010 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>). We genotyped this set of tumors for 16 variants that we had previously identified either in 87T or 53T but not in both tumors and thus are likely to be somatic (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S5</xref>). In addition, we analyzed the mitochondrial genomes (excluding the control region) from the entire set of DFTD tumors, leading to the identification of 21 somatic mitochondrial DFTD variants (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S5</xref>). These experiments revealed differences in the population of DFTD in different regions of Tasmania.</p><p>The observation that all of the tumors in the isolated Forestier Peninsula cluster into a single lineage suggests that this tumor population was founded by a single subclone of DFTD, precursors of which are located on the east coast of Tasmania (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>). Divergence within this lineage after its introduction has given rise to a number of tumor subclones found only within the Forestier Peninsula. One of these lineages (illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref> with a green dot, black outline) appears to have increased in frequency between 2007 and 2010 in a manner resembling a selective sweep (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>, lower panel). These fluctuations in the dominant tumor type could be due to selection, or they could alternatively be due to simple neutral processes.</p><p>In contrast to the Forestier Peninsula, the mainland Tasmanian DFTD population shows the emergence and simultaneous maintenance of several distinct tumor subclones (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>). The tumor lineage to which 53T belongs appears to be&#x000a0;a dominant clone in the north and northwest (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>, dots with green outline). Several tumors were found to have unique patterns of variation. For example, each of the two tumors that we sampled from northeastern Tasmania, the location where DFTD was first observed in 1996, had their own individual patterns of variation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>, orange and black dots, gray outline), suggesting that tumor diversity may be greater in this region, perhaps reflecting its status as the possible origin of DFTD (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>DFTD Diversity within Individual Hosts</title><p>We collected two or more DFTD tumors from 20 individual devils in our set. In some cases the additional tumors were facial or oral, and in others they were in submandibular lymph nodes and internal organs.

In three of these cases, both genotypes were found in tumors in other animals, indicating that the two tumors were probably derived from separate DFTD bites. This suggests that prior exposure to&#x000a0;DFTD does not protect devils from subsequent DFTD inoculations. However, in each of the remaining three cases, one of the&#x000a0;two genotypes was not found in a tumor in any of the other animals that we sampled.

DFTD has existed as a malignant clonal lineage for at least 15 years by repeated subcloning through the Tasmanian devil population. Our analysis of the genomes of two geographically distant DFTD subclones has indicated that DFTD is continuing to acquire new variations in its karyotype, genomic copy number and DNA sequence. Despite evidence for ongoing somatic change in the DFTD lineage, the overall level of mutation that has been accrued by two DFTD lineages since divergence from their most recent common ancestor tumor is comparable with the number of changes that are observed within some human cancers (<xref rid="bib30 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pleasance et&#x000a0;al., 2010a, 2010b</xref>). This is perhaps surprising, given that DFTD has probably undergone a greater number of mitoses than most human cancers. It indicates, however, that DFTD is&#x000a0;a&#x000a0;relatively stable lineage and that a high level of genomic instability has not been required for the cancer to become transmissible.</p><p>Analysis of the genetic diversity of DFTD subclones throughout mainland Tasmania suggests that the evolution of DFTD has been characterized by linear radiation of DFTD subtypes from their common origin. Geographical analysis of DFTD lineage diversity indicates a wide distribution of variant DFTD subclones as well as local coexistence of different subclones, sometimes even within a single host. Our analysis identified a DFTD founder population on an isolated peninsula. Divergence within this lineage has led to the appearance of several DFTD subtypes, one of which has recently become dominant in a manner resembling a selective sweep. Future genomic analysis of hundreds of DFTD genomes will provide further insight into the diversity and evolution of DFTD, and may perhaps help to predict the future trajectory of this clone and its impact on the devil population.</p><p>The transfer of cancer cells between individuals is normally prevented both by physical barriers and by the action of the immune system. The ability of transmissible cancers to circumvent these obstacles demonstrates the potential of cancer cells&#x000a0;to become parasitic clonal lineages. DFTD and CTVT are the only two known naturally occurring transmissible clonal lineages. Our studies have highlighted similarities and differences between the two lineages. Previous reports have indicated that the most recent common ancestor of today's globally distributed CTVT clones existed between 47 and 2,000 years ago (<xref rid="bib26 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Murgia et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Rebbeck et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). DFTD, however, is probably not more than 20 years old. CTVT has been observed to periodically take up mitochondria from its host by horizontal transfer (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Rebbeck et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>); in contrast, we do not find any evidence for this phenomenon in DFTD. Interestingly, it has been proposed that many modern CTVT tumors represent the most recent global sweep of a subclone of the disease (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Rebbeck et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). We observed a similar sweep of DFTD tumors on the&#x000a0;Forestier Peninsula. Both CTVT and DFTD continue to acquire new copy number variations (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Future analysis of both the DFTD and CTVT lineages and their hosts will help to determine the common and unique features of these two cancers and will perhaps reveal common genetic changes that favor the outgrowth and progression of clonally transmissible cancers.</p><p>Although there are no known naturally occurring transmissible cancers that affect humans, there are rare reports of cancer transmission between two or more humans.

Here we have described a whole-genome analysis of such a cancer, and our studies have provided insights into the genetic identity of the individual that founded the DFTD clone, as well as patterns of ongoing DFTD somatic evolution and clonal dynamics. This work will enable more detailed studies of the structure and history of the Tasmanian devil population and its&#x000a0;response to the DFTD epidemic.

Read files from individual lanes were processed to generate kmer words at a given size (k&#x000a0;= 61). K-tuples were then merged and sorted into a table so that kmer words shared by different reads could be linked. A relation matrix was used to record the shared kmer words among all the reads. Setting a minimum threshold of shared k-tuples, short reads can then be clustered into groups using kmer sharing information in the relational matrix. After obtaining small read clusters with a controllable size (&#x0223c;100,000 reads), we used Phrap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phrap.com/">http://www.phrap.com/</ext-link>) to generate contigs.</p><p>For the normal female Tasmanian devil genome, we generated 2.87&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> 100&#x000a0;bp reads.

Since single end reads are combined into &#x0201c;pairs,&#x0201d; the gaps due to missing single repetitive reads are filled by paired partners. After read clustering, we obtained 390,842 read groups containing 1.022&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> read pairs.

The PCR duplication rate of the mate pair sequence reads was very low (&#x0003c;5%). We removed chimeric read pairs by excluding read pairs if one or two ends were found in the middle of the contig, but the edge length was larger than the insert size. To minimize the effect of read pairs overlapping biotin junctions (the circularization junction point that is introduced during mate pair library construction) we only used those pairs with full-length genome alignment. We then used RPono, a package in the Phusion2 pipeline, to build supercontigs. At the end of this process, we had an assembly of 3.15 Gb with an N50 of 839 kb. To further improve our assembly, we aligned our supercontigs with the opossum genome assembly (Monodelphis5.0); this yielded our draft assembly with a total of 3.17 Gb assembled bases and with an N50 of 1.84 megabases (Mb) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

About 40% of the reads were sequenced from a stranded RNA protocol. To test the gene coverage of our draft genome, we performed an independent de novo assembly of the paired RNA-seq reads using T-IDBA (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Peng et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). We assembled 470,729 transcripts in 239,560 Mb. The RNaseq de-novo assembly had an N50 of 687&#x000a0;bp (94,029 contigs) and an N80 of 314&#x000a0;bp (250,268 contigs).

We aligned them to the genome using BLAST (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Altschul et&#x000a0;al., 1990</xref>). 95.3% of the transcripts could be aligned with 0.05% mismatches and 0.01% gaps to the assembly which indicates that our genome assembly has coverage for the majority of coding sequences in the devil genome.</p></sec><sec id="tdbox1sec14"><title>Gene Annotation</title><p>Tasmanian devil gene annotation was performed using the Ensembl Genebuild pipeline (<xref rid="bib3 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Curwen et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Potter et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>), summarized below.</p><sec id="tdbox1sec15"><title>1. Raw Compute Stage: Searching for Sequence Patterns, Aligning Proteins and cDNAs to the Genome</title><p>The annotation process of the Tasmanian devil assembly began with the &#x0201c;raw compute&#x0201d; stage whereby the genomic sequence was screened for sequence patterns including repeats using RepeatMasker (version 3.2.8) (Smit et&#x000a0;al., 1996&#x02013;2010), Dust (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Morgulis et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>) and TRF (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Benson, 1999</xref>). RepeatMasker and Dust combined masked 49.0% of the devil genome. Transcription start sites were predicted using Eponine-scan (<xref rid="bib48 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Davuluri et&#x000a0;al., 2001; Down and Hubbard, 2002</xref>).

(Passing only Genscan results to BLAST is an effective way of reducing the search space and therefore the computational resources required). This resulted in 269,535&#x000a0;UniProt, 309,553&#x000a0;UniGene and 284,670 Vertebrate RNA sequences aligning to the genome.</p></sec><sec id="tdbox1sec16"><title>2. Targeted Stage: Generating Coding Models from Devil Evidence</title><p>Devil protein sequences were downloaded from public databases (UniProt SwissProt/TrEMBL and GenBank) and filtered to remove sequences based on predictions. The devil sequences were mapped to the genome using Pmatch (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Slater and Birney, 2005</xref>). Models of the coding sequence (CDS) were produced from the proteins using Genewise (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Birney et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Two sets of models were produced, one with only consensus splice sites and one where non-consensus splices were allowed; where a single protein sequence had generated two different coding models at the same locus, the BestTargeted module was used to select the coding model that most closely matched the source protein to take through to the next stage of the gene annotation process. The generation of transcript models using devil-specific data is referred to as the &#x0201c;Targeted stage.&#x0201d; This stage resulted in 215 of 281 devil proteins used to build 215 coding models.</p></sec><sec id="tdbox1sec17"><title>3. cDNA and EST Alignment</title><p>Devil cDNAs were downloaded from GenBank, clipped to remove polyA tails, and aligned to the genome using Exonerate (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Birney et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Of these, 21 of 27 devil cDNAs aligned with a cut-off of 90% coverage and 97% identity.</p></sec><sec id="tdbox1sec18"><title>4. Similarity Stage: Generating Additional Coding Models Using Proteins from Related Species</title><p>Due to the paucity of devil specific protein and cDNA evidence, the majority of the gene models were based on proteins from other species. UniProt alignments from the Raw Compute step were filtered to favor proteins classed by UniProt's Protein Existence (PE) classification level 1 and 2. Proteins from other PE levels were used where no other evidence was available; similarly, mammalian proteins were favored over non-mammalian. WU-BLAST was rerun for these sequences and the results were passed to Genewise to build coding models. The generation of transcript models using data from related species is referred to as the &#x0201c;Similarity stage.&#x0201d; This stage resulted in 109,194 coding models.</p></sec><sec id="tdbox1sec19"><title>5.

Pseudogenes, Protein Annotation, Non-coding Genes, Cross Referencing, Stable Identifiers</title><p>The gene set was screened for potential pseudogenes. Before public release the transcripts and translations were given cross references to external databases, while translations were searched for domains/signatures of interest and labeled where appropriate. Stable Identifiers were assigned to each gene, transcript, exon and translation. (When annotating a species for the first time, these identifiers are auto-generated. In all subsequent annotations the stable identifiers are propagated based on comparison of the new gene set to the previous gene set.)</p><p>Small structured non-coding genes were added using annotations taken from RFAM (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths-Jones et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>) and miRBase (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths-Jones et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>).
