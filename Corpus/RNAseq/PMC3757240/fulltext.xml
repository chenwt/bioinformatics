HSP90 is therefore an attractive drug target, but the efficacy of HSP90 inhibitor may be limited by HSP90 inhibition induced feedback mechanisms. Through pooled RNA interference screens, we identified that heat shock factor 1(<italic>HSF1</italic>) is a sensitizer of HSP90 inhibitor. A striking combinational effect was observed when <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown plus with HSP90 inhibitors treatment in various cancer cell lines and tumor mouse models. Interestingly, <italic>HSF1</italic> is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient samples and HCC is sensitive to combinational treatment, indicating a potential indication for the combinational treatment. To understand the mechanism of the combinational effect, we identified that a <italic>HSF1</italic>-target gene <italic>DEDD2</italic> is involved in attenuating the effect of HSP90 inhibitors. Thus, the transcriptional activities of <italic>HSF1</italic> induced by HSP90 inhibitors provide a feedback mechanism of limiting the HSP90 inhibitor's activity, and targeting <italic>HSF1</italic> may provide a new avenue to enhance HSP90 inhibitors activity in human cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HSF1</kwd><kwd>cancer cells</kwd><kwd>HSP90 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>Melanoma</kwd><kwd>HCC</kwd><kwd>DEDD2</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Molecular chaperones assist in the folding of nascent polypeptides and the correct assembly or disassembly of protein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. A majority of chaperones are the so-called heat-shock proteins (HSPs), which are expressed in response to increased temperature or a variety of other cellular stresses. Among them, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a conserved molecular chaperone and is involved in stabilizing and activating more than 200 proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Since many HSP90 &#x02018;clients' are known oncogenic proteins, such as tyrosine kinases[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], steroid hormone receptors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], AKT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], HIF1&#x003b1;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] and MMP2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], that are known to sustain cancer cell growth, differentiation and survival. HSP90 chaperone machinery enables mutated oncoproteins to escape from misfolding and degradation and allows for malignant transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Therefore, HSP90 is considered as a synthetic lethal target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p>After the first HSP90 inhibitor, 17-AAG (tanespimycin), entered clinical trials in 1999, thirteen different HSP90 inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical evaluation in cancer patients in twenty-three active oncology trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Each of these inhibitors disrupts HSP90 activity by replacing ATP in the N-terminal nucleotide-binding pocket [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. NVP-AUY922 and NVP-HSP990 are novel, non-geldanamycin-derivative HSP90 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Both compounds showed significant antitumor activity in a wide range of mutated and wild-type cancer cell lines, primary tumor cells and animal models of cancer, including melanoma, myeloma, gastric cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer(NSCLC), hepatocellular cancer, sarcoma, and breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Progress has also been made in terms of identifying sensitive cancer indications and effective drug combinations: in HER2+ breast cancer, HSP90 inhibitors block HER2 signaling and suppress tumor growth as the stability of HER2 protein is dependent on HSP90. In a Phase II clinical trial following combination of trastuzumab with 17-AAG treatment, a response rate of 24% was reported and clinical benefit was observed in more than 57% of evaluated patients[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p><p>Although significant progress has been made and promising results have been seen in breast cancer patients receiving HSP90 inhibitor treatment, HSP90 inhibitor was also shown to lack efficacy in certain cancer types, such as melanoma. In a Phase II trial of 17-AAG in patients with metastatic melanoma, no objective anti-melanoma responses were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the resistant mechanisms of cancer cells in response to HSP90 inhibition will help us to develop the effective combinational therapy with HSP90 inhibitor.</p><p>To identify the genetic modulators of HSP90 inhibition, we performed pooled shRNA screening to search the potential combinational targets of HSP90 inhibitor, and identified <italic>HSF1</italic> as a sensitizer of HSP90 inhibitor. HSF1 is a conserved transcription factor and a major regulator of the heat shock response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Beyond heat shock response, HSF1 also regulates a transcriptional program highly specific to malignant cell including cell cycle, cell signaling, metabolism, adhesion and translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Recently, eliminating HSF1 was showed to protect mice from tumors induced by mutation of the RAS oncogene or a hot spot mutation in tumor suppressor p53 and from DEN-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Loss of tumor suppressor NF1 activates HSF1 to promote carcinogenesis through dysregulated MAPK signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Moreover, HSF1 knock-out or knock-down cells were shown to be more sensitive to HSP90 inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Those studies indicate that HSF1 may play an important role in tumor initiation, development and maintenance, and contribute to cell sensitivity to HSP90 inhibitor. However, the functional role of HSF1 in human cancer cell resistance to HSP90 inhibitors and the mechanisms underlying the combination effect of <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown and HSP90 inhibitors are not fully understood. Moreover, the downstream targets of HSF1 which may play a role in attenuating the effect of HSP90 inhibitor are not fully appreciated.</p><p>In this study, we observed that <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown combined with HSP90 inhibitors led to striking inhibitory effects on cancer cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown combined with HSP90 inhibition facilitates the degradation of oncogenic proteins, induces cancer cell apoptosis, and decreases activity of the ERK pathway. HSF1 expression is significantly up-regulated in HCC, suggesting a tumor type that may be targeted by combinational treatment. Finally, we identify <italic>DEDD2</italic> as a HSF1 target gene involved in the resistance to HSP90 inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Pooled shRNA screening reveals that <italic>HSF1</italic> as a top sensitizer to HSP90 inhibitor</title><p>To identify genes that modulate the efficacy of HSP90 inhibition on tumor cell growth, we performed a large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) genetic screen with a collection of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors targeting 1,000 human genes in A375 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). A barcoding technique was used to identify genes whose suppression caused resistance or sensitivity to two separate concentrations of NVP-AUY922 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). 163 and 360 shRNA constructs were significantly depleted form either low- or high-dose NVP-AUY922 treated samples (FDR&#x0003c;=0.15).

When shRNA expression was induced by Doxycycline, robust <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown was achieved in all three cancer cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We next tested whether <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown has a combinational effect with NVP-AUY922 or NVP-HSP990. Induction of <italic>HSF1</italic> shRNA (but not the NTC shRNA) led to IC50 of NVP-HSP990 shifting from 19nM to 6nM in A375 cell, 12.7nM to 5.2nM in A2058 cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The combination effect was even more dramatically observed in extended colony formation assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In HCT116 cells, <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown led to a significant shift of LD50 of either NVP-HSP990 or NVP-AUY922 (more than 6 fold change) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). To further validate <italic>HSF1</italic> as a sensitizer of HSP90 inhibitor, the combinational effect of <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown with HSP90 inhibitor was tested in A375 xenograft mouse model. <italic>HSF1</italic> shRNA alone inhibited tumor growth by 53% T/C, and knockdown was confirmed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">F</xref>).

HSP90 inhibition leads to a decreased level of p-ERK and an increase of cell apoptosis</title><p>To understand the mechanism of the combination effects of <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown and HSP90 inhibition, we tested: 1) whether <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown may facilitate the degradation of HSP90 client protein by HSP90 inhibition, such as BRAF or HER2 oncogenic proteins; 2) whether HSP90 inhibition may enhance the attenuation of MAPK signaling mediated by HSF1 knockdown as recent finding suggests that <italic>HSF1</italic> deficiency attenuates MAPK signaling in mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] and 3) HSF1 may regulate other target genes rather than HSP70, which may play a role in attenuating the effect of HSP90 inhibition. Therefore, we examined the status of HSP90 client proteins and the downstream effects in cell treated with either <italic>HSF1</italic> shRNA or HSP90 inhibitor or combination of HSF1 shRNA and HSP90 inhibitor. HCT116 cells were treated with different doses of NVP-HSP990 and HSF1 knockdown in combination with NVP-HSP990 (5nM) reduced the HSP70, p-ERK and HER2 levels significantly while NVP-HSP990 or <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown alone did not(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). HSF1 knockdown in combination with NVP-HSP990 (25nM) led increased cleaved PARP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The combination also led an enhanced degradation of BRAF in A375 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). A decreased level of HSP70, p-ERK and increased level of cleaved PARP were also observed in melanoma cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) and hepatocellular cancer cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). To understand how <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown affects the cell proliferation under HSP90 inhibitor treatment, cell cycle analysis was performed. <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown didn't affect the percentage of cancer cells in cell cycle while HSP90 inhibitor caused more cancer cells into S+G2M phase (data not shown). In contrast, the percentage of cancer cells in the S+G2M phase was significantly decreased in <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown group than in the control group under HSP90 inhibitor treatment(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), indicating that under HSP90 inhibition the knockdown of <italic>HSF1</italic> blocks cancer cells to enter the cell cycle, thereby decrease the proliferation of cancer cells. Next, we examined whether <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown may enhance apoptosis of cancer cells under HSP90 inhibitor treatment by staining the cells with 7AAD and Annexin V. Similarly, <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown didn't affect the apoptosis of cancer cells while HSP90 inhibitor induced the apoptosis of cancer cells (data not shown). <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown further enhanced the apoptotic proportion of cancer cells under HSP90 inhibitor treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Thus, the combination treatment of <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown and HSP90 inhibition facilitates the degradation of HSP90 client proteins, such as BRAF and HER2, inhibits MAPK growth signaling and results in cell cycles arrest and cell apoptosis.</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Combination of <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown and HSP90 inhibitor leads to a decreased level of p-ERK and an increased cell apoptosis rate</title><p>A.

To identify additional HSF1-target genes, we compared the gene profiles in A375 cells with or without <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown treated or untreated with HSP90 inhibitor. Several genes are up-regulated by HSP90 inhibitor treatment and this upregulation are diminished by <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Most of those genes belong to well-known HSF1-regulated cell stress pathway, such as: <italic>HSPA1L, HSPA1A, HSPA6, HSPB1, HSPA4C and DNAJR1</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Among these top hits, apart from heat-shock pathway genes regulated by HSF1, BAG3 and DEDD2 are involved in cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Previously, BAG3 was identified as a HSF1 target gene and DEDD2 was defined as one of genes included in the molecular signature in response to the HSP90 inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. BAG3, a member of the Bcl-2-associated athanogen family, was reported as a mediator of a novel macroautophagy pathway that uses the specificity of HSP70 to misfolded proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. DEDD2 associates with DEDD and is involved in the regulation of nuclear events mediated by the extrinsic apoptosis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. DEDD2 might be an important mediator for death receptors and target caspases to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. However, the functional roles of BAG3 and DEDD2 in cancer cell response to HSP90 inhibition are not explored. Therefore, we decided to further validate whether <italic>BAG3</italic> and <italic>DEDD2</italic> may play a role in the combinational effect mediated by <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown and HSP90 inhibition. Like <italic>HSP70</italic>, both <italic>BAG3 and DEDD2</italic> mRNA expression were increased upon HSP90 inhibition, which were abolished upon <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement Fig. S4</xref>). DEDD2 protein expression was not significantly regulated by HSP90 inhibition, but its basal level was decreased upon <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). In comparison, HSP70 protein level was significantly increased by HSP90 inhibition, which was abolished by <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Furthermore, DEDD2 expression was elevated by over-expression of HSF1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). ChIP experiment also showed that HSF1 is bound to <italic>DEDD2</italic> promoter in response to HSP90 inhibition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>DEDD2</italic> is a direct target gene of HSF1. <italic>DEDD2</italic> knockdown alone mildly enhances effect of HSP90 inhibitor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). In comparison, BAG3 knockdown did not affect the activity of HSP90 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement Fig. S5</xref>). Taking consideration of the possible redundancy function of DEDD and DEDD2, knockdown of both <italic>DEDD</italic> and <italic>DEDD2</italic> was performed by using siRNA in the combinational experiment and a significant combinational effect with HSP90 inhibitor was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>).

The inhibition of HSP90 also increases HSF1 trimer stability and prolongs the heat shock response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Previously, studies suggest that HSF1 transcriptional activity is upregulated by HSP90 inhibition, which may limit the efficacy of HSP90 inhibitors through the activation of heat-shock responsive genes including HSP27 and HSP70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. However, the functional role of HSF1 itself in response to HSP90 inhibition is not fully appreciated. We found that knockdown of <italic>HSF1</italic> sensitizes cancer cells to HSP90 inhibitors in many different cancer lineages, including melanoma (A375, A2058), hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep3B, Huh7) and colon cancer (HCT116). More importantly, the combination of <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown with HSP90 inhibition prevents tumor growth significantly in xenograft mouse model (stasis or regression). We also observed that the combined treatment with <italic>HSF1</italic> shRNA and HSP90 inhibitor leads to reduction of HSP90 inhibitor-induced HSP70 expression and p-ERK signal and induction of cleaved PARP.</p><p>Targeting HSF1 in combination with HSP90 inhibitor in HCC is particularly interesting because HSF1 expression level, both in mRNA and protein, is remarkable higher in primary HCC sample than normal hepatocytes. HSF1 knockout mice are viable and healthy, suggesting that inhibition of HSF1 might not be toxic to normal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Apart from combination with potential HSF1 inhibition, HSP90 inhibitor was also proposed to combine with mTOR inhibitor since blocking HSP90 may disrupt rapamycin-induced activation of alternative signaling pathways in HCCs and substantially improve the growth-inhibitory effects of mTOR inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. HCC is an aggressive human cancer and current therapies are not very effective. HSP90 inhibitor in combination with HSF1 inhibitor or mTOR inhibitor may provide an additional therapeutic strategy for HCC.</p><p>The question is how to drug HSF1 as a transcription factor. A promising approach to target <italic>HSF1</italic> is to use therapeutic siRNA to knockdown <italic>HSF1</italic>. Although a significant progress has been made in developing siRNA therapy, there are still many hurdles to overcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Many efforts have also been put into drugging the HSF1 pathway. A couple of small compounds have been identified to have the ability to inhibit heat shock-induced upregulation of HSP and other HSF1 targets in cells, such as quercetin and KNK437[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. In particular, the anti-malaria drug quinacrine (QC) was showed to prevent heat shock response in cancer cells and suppresses HSF1 induced HSP70 expression in a relatively selective manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. In future, developing the potent and selective HSF1 pathway inhibitors might eventually be useful for treating human cancer in combination with HSP90 inhibitor or other agents.</p><p>We also compared the gene profile between melanoma cells treated with HSP90 inhibitor with or without <italic>HSF1</italic> knockdown. As expected, most genes regulated by HSF1 in response to HSP90 inhibitors are related to heat shock response. Some of them, such as <italic>HSP70</italic>, have been shown to have a combinational effect with HSP90 inhibitor previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. <italic>DEDD2</italic> is up-regulated by HSP90 inhibition and this up-regulation is reversed by HSF1 knockdown. Interestingly, only DEDD2 is regulated by HSF1 while DEDD is not regulated by HSF1 under HSP90 inhibitor treatment (data not shown). Knockdown of both <italic>DEDD2</italic> and <italic>DEDD</italic>, but not either alone, enhances HSP90 inhibitor efficacy, suggesting the redundancy function of these proteins.</p><p>In this study, we identified that HSF1 transcriptional activities are induced by HSP90 inhibitors, which may provide a resistance mechanism through up-regulating a protective &#x0201c;heat shock&#x0201d; response and other transcriptional targets, such as <italic>DEDD2</italic>. However, a couple of questions still remain to be answered: 1) Are there any other transcriptional targets regulated by HSF1 required for HSF1-mediated resistance to HSP90 inhibitor in different settings? 2) Are there any co-regulators whose activities are required for HSF1-mediated resistance to HSP90 inhibitor? These questions will further prompt us to initiate large-scale screens to directly identify the HSF1-key-targets in different settings and HSF1-cofactors that are important for HSF1 transcriptional activities induced by HSP90 inhibitors in future. While a subset of HSF1-dependent-targets may play important roles in attenuating the efficacy of HSP90 inhibitors, the newly identified HSF1-target genes and/or HSF1-cofactors will not only help us to understand how HSF1 transcriptional function is regulated but may also reveal novel therapeutic targets in combination with HSP90 inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>METHOD AND MATERIALS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>A375, A2058, HCT116, Hep3B and Huh7 cells were obtained from American Type culture Collection.
