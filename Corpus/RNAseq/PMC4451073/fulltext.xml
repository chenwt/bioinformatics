CL-deficiency in humans is caused by mutations in the tafazzin (<italic>Taz</italic>) gene and results in a multisystem pediatric disorder, Barth syndrome (BTHS). It has been reported that tafazzin deficiency destabilizes mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and affects supercomplex assembly. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of Taz-knockdown on the mitochondrial proteomic landscape and metabolic processes, such as stability of respiratory chain supercomplexes and their interactions with fatty acid oxidation enzymes in cardiac muscle. Proteomic analysis demonstrated reduction of several polypeptides of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, including Rieske and cytochrome c1 subunits of complex III, NADH dehydrogenase alpha subunit 5 of complex I and the catalytic core-forming subunit of F<sub>0</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATP synthase. Taz gene knockdown resulted in upregulation of enzymes of folate and amino acid metabolic pathways in heart mitochondria, demonstrating that Taz-deficiency causes substantive metabolic remodeling in cardiac muscle. Mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes are destabilized in CL-depleted mitochondria from Taz knockdown hearts resulting in disruption of the interactions between ETC and the fatty acid oxidation enzymes, very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, potentially affecting the metabolic channeling of reducing equivalents between these two metabolic pathways. Mitochondria-bound myoglobin was significantly reduced in Taz-knockdown hearts, potentially disrupting intracellular oxygen delivery to the oxidative phosphorylation system. Our results identify the critical pathways affected by the Taz-deficiency in mitochondria and establish a future framework for development of therapeutic options for BTHS.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Study was funded by National Institute of Health (NIH) grant 1R01HL108867.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="23"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cardiolipin is a unique mitochondrial tetra-acyl phospholipid that has four fatty acyl chains. In most mammalian tissues the acyl-group composition is highly specific being predominantly comprised of 18-carbon unsaturated acyl chains, the vast majority of which are linoleic acid. A tetralinoleoyl cardiolipin (L<sub>4</sub>CL) is a major form of cardiolipin in the mammalian cardiac mitochondria where it constitutes 80&#x02013;90% of CLs [reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128561.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]]. L<sub>4</sub>CL-deficiency in humans results in the multisystem pediatric disorder known as Barth syndrome (BTHS) (OMIM: 302060). The causative BTHS gene, tafazzin (<italic>Taz</italic>), is located on the X-chromosome [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Taz is an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed mitochondrial transacylase that is required for the final step of CL biosynthesis, including remodeling and generation of L<sub>4</sub>CL species. Mutations in the <italic>Taz</italic> gene result in reduction of L<sub>4</sub>CL and accumulation of CL species with unusual acyl-group compositions with higher degrees of saturation [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128561.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>CL is crucial for mitochondrial protein transport and the recycling machinery. Also, it is an integration site of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) supercomplexes and is essential for optimal activities of individual ETC complexes, ATP-synthase, and adenine-nucleotide translocase [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, CL is required to maintain proper cristae architecture in mitochondria [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. L<sub>4</sub>CL-deficient mitochondria form abnormal, circular or honeycomb-like structures, a characteristic feature of defective mitochondria of striated muscles in BTHS patients and Taz-deficient flies and mice. Cardiolipin deficiency disrupts multiple processes and biological pathways such as fatty acid metabolism, mitochondrial fission and fusion, lipid signaling, apoptosis and autophagy [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128561.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies have shown that tetracycline-inducible gene knockdown suppresses <italic>Taz</italic> gene expression by &#x0003e; 90% and results in profound L<sub>4</sub>CL deficiency in cardiac and skeletal muscles of B6.Cg-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor</italic><sup><italic>tm1(H1/tetO-RNAi</italic>:<italic>Taz</italic>,<italic>CAG-tetR)Bsf</italic></sup>/ZkhuJ, or TazKD mice, mimicking a biochemical phenotype of human BTHS [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

Reduction of L<sub>4</sub>CL in BTHS alters global gene expression, inducing alternative energy producing pathways, conceivably to compensate for diminished energy output of defective mitochondria [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

Paired labeled samples were mixed together and subjected to isoelectric focusing (first dimension) using the IPGphore 3 system with Immobiline DryStrips (18 cm, pH 3&#x02013;11 NL) (GE Healthcare) and then to SDS PAGE (second dimension) on the Ettan DALT system, as recommended by the manufacturer. Gels were scanned immediately after SDS PAGE using Typhoon TRIO (GE Healthcare). Images were analyzed by Image QuantTL software and subjected to in-gel analysis and cross-gel analysis using DeCyder 6.5 software (GE Healthcare). Spots of interest were picked by Ettan Spot Picker (GE Healthcare) based on the in-gel analysis and spot-picking design by DeCyder software. Proteins in the gel spots were digested with modified porcine trypsin protease (Trypsin Gold, Promega). The digested tryptic peptides were desalted by Zip-tip C18 (Millipore). Peptides were eluted from the Zip-tip with 0.5 &#x003bc;l of matrix solution (&#x003b1;-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate) and spotted on the MALDI plate.</p><p>MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight;) and TOF/TOF (tandem MS/MS) were performed on a 5800 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex).

Ion source gas 1 (GS1), ion source gas 2 (GS2) and curtain gas (CUR) were respectively kept at 7, 0 and 25 vendor specified arbitrary units. Interface heater temperature and ion spray voltage was kept at 150 C, and at 2.3 kV respectively. Mass spectrometer method was operated in positive ion mode set to go through 3626 cycles for 90 minutes, where each cycle performing one TOF-MS scan type (0.25 sec accumulation time, in a 350 to 1250 m/z window) followed by thirty information dependent acquisition (IDA)-mode MS/MS-scans on the most intense candidate ions having a minimum 150 counts. Each product ion scan was operated under vender specified high-sensitivity mode with an accumulation time of 0.06 secs and a mass tolerance of 50 mDa.

ProteinPilot search parameters included all biological modification as variable modifications and carboxyamidomethyl cysteine was used as a fixed modification. Trypsin was used as the cleavage specificity with up to 2 missed cleavages. The precursor mass tolerance was automatically set by the ProteinPilot software based on the instrument type used&#x02014;in this case a quadrupole-Tof instrument. The False Discovery Rate (FDR) was determined by the ProteinPilot/Paragon software to be less than 1% from a search of a decoy, inverse sequence database of the UniProt/SwissProt mouse database described above. Data normalization across all iTRAQ tag channels was accomplished in the ProteinPilot software using the bias correction function. This function evaluated the relative ratio of the iTRAQ tags across all the peptides identified and normalizes the ratios such that the collective ratio of all the tags is 1:1:1:1, prior to calculating relative differences among individual peptides/protein.

A substantial amount of NDUFA9 subunit of complex I was present in the 35% sucrose fraction, whereas the pellet fraction (P) contained only small amounts of NDUFA9, UQCRC2 and ATP5A corresponding to C-I, C-III and C-V, respectively. Distribution of ETC complexes between 20&#x02013;35% sucrose fractions indicates that these complexes are associated with high-molecular mass structures in normal mitochondria. In contrast, only UQCRC2 subunit of C-III and ATP5A subunit of C-V were abundant in the 20&#x02013;25% fractions in TazKD mitochondria. Strikingly, subunits of C-I and C-IV were almost absent in any gradient fractions, except a trace amount in the 35% fraction (<xref rid="pone.0128561.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Interestingly, the insoluble pellet from TazKD samples contained substantial amounts of polypeptides of C-I, C-III and C-V compared to WT. Redistribution of ETC complexes into the pellet suggests that CL-deficiency causes accumulation of mitochondrial proteins into large insoluble or mis-folded structures, likely reducing or abolishing their enzymatic function.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Interactions of supercomplexes with fatty acid oxidation (FAO) enzymes are disrupted in TazKD hearts</title><p>Recently, it has been demonstrated that complex I in liver mitochondria physically interacts with VLCAD, which catalyzes the first step of FAO, the major energy producing pathway in adult cardiomyocytes [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

LCHAD, encoded by the mitochondrial trifunctional protein alpha subunit gene, exhibits acyltransferase activity [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These findings imply the existence of very large metabolic units or &#x0201c;hypercomplexes&#x0201d; in mitochondria, consisting of FAO enzymes and ETC complexes, where FAO and oxidative phosphorylation pathways converge. Because the presence of CL in the IMM is essential for stabilizing ETC supercomplexes, it is apparently crucial for the stability of FAO-ETC interactions. Therefore, we investigated whether CL-deficiency affects interaction of ETC complexes with FAO enzymes. Western blot membranes with samples from individual sucrose gradient steps were probed with antibodies specific for the FAO enzymes, VLCAD, LCHAD and MCAD. VLCAD and LCHAD were enriched in the 20&#x02013;25% sucrose fractions, along with C-I, C-II and C-IV, suggesting that approximately 45&#x02013;50% of these enzymes are physically associated with high-molecular mass SCs (<xref rid="pone.0128561.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). In contrast, interaction of MCAD with SCs is minimal because less than 10% of the total loaded MCAD was in the 15% fraction and only a trace amount in the 20% fraction. The remaining MCAD was diluted across the entire 15.5 ml of sucrose gradient and was not detectable by Western blot analysis (<xref rid="pone.0128561.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>).

The absence of FAO enzymes in sucrose gradient fractions from CL-depleted mitochondria indicates that interactions between FAO enzymes and ETC SCs are abolished, suggesting the importance of CL in the interactions of FAO enzymes with ETC complexes in cardiac mitochondria.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Activation mitochondrial folate / one carbon metabolism genes in TazKD hearts</title><p>We detected a robust increase in relative abundances of the MTHFD2 and ALDH1L2, enzymes that are involved in the folate metabolism.

Proteomic analysis also revealed a 1.7-fold reduction of ISCU (iron-sulfur cluster scaffold protein), which is involved in the biosynthesis of Rieske subunit and C-III assembly. The relative abundance of another C-III component, a heme containing cytochrome c1, was also significantly reduced in CL-deficient mitochondria.

In bovine cardiac mitochondria, supercomplexes are composed of three individual complexes in the stoichiometric arrangement I<sub>1</sub>-III<sub>2</sub>-IV<sub>1</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], while, in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, the mitochondrial ETC lacks C-I, and a supercomplex is formed with C-III and C-IV mostly in the stoichiometric ratio III<sub>2</sub>-IV<sub>1</sub>. With limited direct protein-protein contacts and an average distance &#x0003e; 2 nm between complexes, it is most likely that supercomplexes are held together by protein-lipid rather than protein-protein interactions. It has been previously shown that each supercomplex could contain 200&#x02013;400 molecules of CL [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], implying that CL is a scaffold for assembly of supercomplexes in mitochondria and essential for converging different metabolic fluxes. Supercomplexes are destabilized in CL-depleted mitochondria of lymphoblasts in BTHS patients. In particular, CL-deficiency causes dissociation of C-IV from supercomplex C-I/(C-III)<sub>2</sub>/C-IV, with concomitant accumulation of C-I/(C-III)<sub>2</sub> in lymphoblasts from BTHS patients [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128561.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>Using a combination of blue-native electrophoresis with SDS-PAGE, we demonstrated that interactions between C-IV and complexes I-III, are destabilized in L<sub>4</sub>CL-depleted mitochondria. Further studies using ultracentrifugation of gently solubilized mitochondria on a sucrose gradient with subsequent Western blot analysis of gradient fractions confirmed the disassociation of C-IV from supercomplexes and revealed that interaction of C-I with C-III is also greatly compromised in L<sub>4</sub>CL-deficient mitochondria. Our proteomic studies revealed the reduction of COQ3 and COQ9 that are involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis. Reduction in these two enzymes would likely reduce the effective amount of ubiquinone available as an electron carrier between C-I and C-III and, therefore, would further diminish the efficiency of electron flow in mitochondrial ETC.</p><p>Considering the relatively modest changes in major ETC polypeptides, it appears that differences between WT and TazKD are more related to the assembly of the complexes and supercomplexes. Most of the major proteins are still present but they are not organized properly in TazKD mitochondria.</p><p>Together, diminished amounts of Rieske and cytochrome c1 subunits in C-III, in the setting of destabilization of ETC SCs, and the potentially reduced amount of available CoQ would be detrimental for efficient electron flux, generation of proton gradient across mitochondrial membrane, and, ultimately, for aerobic ATP synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Fatty acid oxidation and CL-deficiency</title><p>Physical interaction of two long chain FAO enzymes, VLCAD and ACAD9 has been reported recently [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128561.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It has been proposed that interaction of FAO enzymes with ETC complexes facilitates an efficient transfer of reducing equivalents from VLCAD via electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) to ETF-dehydrogenase, resulting in reduction of CoQ (substrate of C-III). Additionally NADH, a product of the L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenation reaction that is catalyzed by LCHAD in FAO, may also be channeled to C-I without a significant release into the mitochondrial matrix [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Co-migration of VLCAD and LCHAD in gradient fractions with C-I, C-III and C-IV suggests the physical interaction of long-chain FAO enzymes with a mitochondrial supercomplex. Disruption of FAO-ETC interactions in TazKD mitochondria suggests that CL is involved in the assembly of VLCAD-ETC and LCHAD-ETC supercomplexes, forming higher order metabolic units, or &#x0201c;hypercomplexes&#x0201d;. We previously demonstrated that WT mice are capable of dynamic switches of their metabolic fuel preferences from glucose to fatty acids when subjected to aerobic exercise, resulting in a sudden drop in respiratory exchange ratio values in indirect calorimetric measurements. In contrast, TazKD mice lack this adaptive mechanism, and carbohydrate metabolism continuously surges up in response to increased workload [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is plausible that the physical interaction between FAO enzymes and ETC complexes is a pre-requisite for this metabolic switch.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Myoglobin as an oxygen carrier and CL-deficiency</title><p>Our results reveal that mitochondrial-bound myoglobin is decreased more than 2-fold, while the total cellular myoglobin level remains unaffected in the hearts of TazKD mice. Myoglobin is the principal intracellular oxygen carrier that transfers oxygen molecules from the plasma membrane to mitochondria. Myoglobin is necessary to support cardiac function during development of zebrafish and mice, but adaptive cardiac remodeling can fully compensate for the deficit in cellular oxygen transport in myoglobin-knockout mice [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128561.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Myoglobin does not have any known specific receptor on mitochondria, and its binding to the mitochondrial membrane is likely mediated by the electrostatic interaction of positively charged oxymyoglobin molecules with the negatively charged mitochondrial membrane.</p><p>It is feasible that oxymyoglobin interaction with CL-depleted mitochondria is reduced, diminishing the effective amount of available oxygen to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. While this hypothesis requires further study, our data on reduced mitochondrial-bound myoglobin are consistent with the recently reported results obtained from human subjects with BTHS. When stressed with aerobic exercise on the treadmill, participants with BTHS had markedly reduced ability to extract blood oxygen compared to unaffected participants, even though blood was oversaturated with oxyhemoglobin [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The reduced effective concentration of oxymyoglobin at CL-depleted mitochondrial membrane in combination with dissociation of C-IV from SCs may explain the reduced oxygen extraction capability in BTHS patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Folate / one carbon metabolism and CL-deficiency</title><p>MTHFD2 is a rate-limiting enzyme of mitochondrial folate-coupled, one-carbon metabolism and is essential for developing embryos, but becomes silenced in adulthood, even in proliferative tissues [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128561.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Silencing of the Mthfd2 gene after birth coincides with the loss of proliferation potential of neonatal mouse heart (<xref rid="pone.0128561.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Folate and one carbon metabolism pathways are intimately coupled with methionine cycle and regulate homocysteine levels in tissues and plasma [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] [reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]]. Perturbations in folate metabolism during prenatal development cause severe neural tube defects in humans and mice [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128561.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128561.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Interestingly, methyl donor deficiency in rats induces cardiomyopathy with imbalanced acetylation / methylation of PGC1&#x003b1;, decreased complex I activity and impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Activation of mitochondrial folate metabolism in TazKD harts is corroborated by recently published RNAseq-based gene expression analysis of TazKD hearts [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Activation of Mthfd2 gene expression in adult TazKD cardiomyocytes causes accumulation of MTHFD2 protein in myofilaments, which is consistent with its localization in the intermyofibrillar mitochondria. Surprisingly, MTHFD2 protein is also present in intercalated disks at intercellular junctions (<xref rid="pone.0128561.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). The biological significance of overexpression of Mthfd2 gene in Taz-deficient cardiomyocytes is unclear. However, robust activation of Mthfd2 gene has been detected in the skeletal muscles of knockout mice that are deficient in the mitochondrial helicase, Twinkle, and exhibit multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions and respiratory chain deficiencies [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], suggesting that activation of mitochondrial folate / one carbon metabolism may represent a general compensatory response to mitochondrial defects in striated muscles.</p><p>THF-1C metabolism, along with pentose phosphate cycle, is a major production route of NADPH, which is involved in ROS detoxification [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Mitochondrial folate mediated one carbon metabolism is coupled with oxidation of one carbon units derived from serine, glycine or sarcosin [see [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] for review]. Interestingly, Mthfd2 activation is accompanied with a quantitative increase of glutamate/aspartate carrier SLC25A13, perhaps echoing an increased mitophagy and protein / amino acid catabolism in TazKD cardiomyocytes [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Increased amino acid transport in TazKD mitochondria may also explain higher than WT respiration of TazKD mitochondria when glutamate and malate were used as substrates [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In present studies transgenic mice with tet-off system were used to achieve an efficient silencing of Taz gene. Mice received approximately 100 mg doxycycline x kg bw-1 x day-1. It is known that doxycycline is toxic for mitochondrial metabolism in liver, affecting oxidative phosphorylation rates and gene expression levels of key mitochondrial regulators including Tfam, sFis1, Mfn2, and Opa1 [<xref rid="pone.0128561.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. To minimize the possible side effects of doxycycline on the mitochondrial proteome, both control and TazKD mice were maintained on the doxycycline-containing rodent chaw. Nevertheless, we cannot completely exclude the effects of doxycycline-induced toxicity on cardiac mitochondria. It is possible that TazKD mice are more sensitive to doxycycline-induced cardiac injury than WT controls.</p><p>In summary, we have identified and quantitated the changes in cardiac proteome of mouse model of human Barth syndrome. Our findings indicate that Taz knockdown in mice diminishes mitochondrial ETC complex III activity, destabilizes ETC supercomplexes and disrupts interaction between ETC and FAO systems (<xref rid="pone.0128561.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). The identification of a set of metabolic pathways affected by tafazzin deficiency in mitochondria, as well as adaptive changes to compensate for mitochondrial defects, represents a framework for the development of therapeutic strategies to ameliorate outcomes in this enigmatic disease.</p><fig id="pone.0128561.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0128561.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Hypothetical pathophysiological mechanism of Barth syndrome.</title><p>In normal mitochondria with high content of CL in the IMM, respiratory complexes are assembled into supercomplexes and form even higher-order structures (hypercomplexes) by interacting with FAO enzymes. In contrast, in CL-depleted mitochondria from BTHS hearts, supercomplexes are destabilized, and the relative quantities of NDUFA5 (C-I), SDHA (C-II), UQCRFS1 and CYC1 (C-III) and ATPA (C-V) are reduced. Defects in respiratory chain complexes would likely induce overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In CL-deficient mitochondria, disassociation of FAO enzymes from RC complexes would reduce the efficiency of metabolic channeling through these pathways. Reduced oxygen availability at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) due to low myoglobin binding to mitochondria would further diminish aerobic ATP synthesis, but might also reduce generation of ROS.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0128561.g007"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128561.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Entire Western blots for cropped images shown in <xref rid="pone.0128561.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0128561.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128561.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Raw data of proteomic analysis.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0128561.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0128561.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Schlame</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ren</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Greenberg</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Haller</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>. <article-title>Molecular symmetry in mitochondrial cardiolipins</article-title>. <source>Chemistry and physics of lipids</source>. <year>2005</year>;<volume>138</volume>(<issue>1&#x02013;2</issue>):<fpage>38</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>49</lpage>. .<?supplied-pmid 16226238?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16226238</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0128561.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Chicco</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sparagna</surname><given-names>GC</given-names></name>. <article-title>Role of cardiolipin alterations in mitochondrial dysfunction and disease</article-title>. <source>Am J Physiol Cell Physiol</source>. <year>2007</year>;<volume>292</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>C33</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>44</lpage>. .<?supplied-pmid 16899548?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16899548</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0128561.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Bolhuis</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hensels</surname><given-names>GW</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hulsebos</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Baas</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Barth</surname><given-names>PG</given-names></name>. <article-title>Mapping of the locus for X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy with neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria (Barth syndrome) to Xq28</article-title>. <source>American journal of human genetics</source>. <year>1991</year>;<volume>48</volume>(<issue>3</issue>):<fpage>481</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>5</lpage>. .<?supplied-pmid 1998334?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1998334</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0128561.ref004"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Vreken</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Valianpour</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Nijtmans</surname><given-names>LG</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Grivell</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Plecko</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wanders</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal><article-title>Defective remodeling of cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol in Barth syndrome</article-title>. <source>Biochem Biophys Res Commun</source>. <year>2000</year>;<volume>279</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>378</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>82</lpage>. .<?supplied-pmid 11118295?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11118295</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0128561.ref005"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Houtkooper</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Rodenburg</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Thiels</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>van Lenthe</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Stet</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Poll-The</surname><given-names>BT</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
