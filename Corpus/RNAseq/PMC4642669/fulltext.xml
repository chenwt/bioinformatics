However, both NGS data and their analysis are error-prone, which can lead to the generation of false positive (FP) SNPs. We explored the relationship between FP SNPs and seven factors involved in mapping-based variant calling &#x02014; quality of the reference sequence, read length, choice of mapper and variant caller, mapping stringency and filtering of SNPs by read mapping quality and read depth. This resulted in 576 possible factor level combinations. We used error- and variant-free simulated reads to ensure that every SNP found was indeed a false positive.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The variation in the number of FP SNPs generated ranged from 0 to 36,621 for the 120 million base pairs (Mbp) genome. All of the experimental factors tested had statistically significant effects on the number of FP SNPs generated and there was a considerable amount of interaction between the different factors. Using a fragmented reference sequence led to a dramatic increase in the number of FP SNPs generated, as did relaxed read mapping and a lack of SNP filtering. The choice of reference assembler, mapper and variant caller also significantly affected the outcome. The effect of read length was more complex and suggests a possible interaction between mapping specificity and the potential for contributing more false positives as read length increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The choice of tools and parameters involved in variant calling can have a dramatic effect on the number of FP SNPs produced, with particularly poor combinations of software and/or parameter settings yielding tens of thousands in this experiment. Between-factor interactions make simple recommendations difficult for a SNP discovery pipeline but the quality of the reference sequence is clearly of paramount importance. Our findings are also a stark reminder that it can be unwise to use the relaxed mismatch settings provided as defaults by some read mappers when reads are being mapped to a relatively unfinished reference sequence from e.g. a non-model organism in its early stages of genomic exploration.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12859-015-0801-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>False positive</kwd><kwd>SNP</kwd><kwd>NGS</kwd><kwd>Read mismapping</kwd><kwd>Misassembly</kwd><kwd>Mapping stringency</kwd><kwd>Read length</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Single-nucleotide polymorphisms are used as molecular markers in diverse applications, such as human disease genetics, plant and animal breeding, population genetics and forensics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The emergence of NGS technologies has yielded dramatic improvements in costs and throughput [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

In addition to sequencing errors, which vary in pattern and rate depending on the sequencing platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the short read lengths that prevail in NGS, together with the repetitious nature of the genomes of many organisms, can lead to errors in the genome assembly and/or read mapping stages.</p><p>The traditional approach to SNP discovery is based on mapping reads to a reference sequence, but several new approaches have been suggested which are mapping-free (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). Their uptake appears to have been slow, however, and the majority of projects currently still employ a mapping-based approach for SNP discovery.</p><p>Kumar et al. (2012) have argued that SNP discovery improves with better quality reference genomes. Misassembly of the reference sequence creates the conditions required for reads to be mismapped in the first place, as the origin of a read may not be available in an imperfect assembly. This is of particular relevance for SNP discovery projects where a well assembled and well curated reference sequence is not yet available. The reference sequences of most sequenced organisms are classified as a &#x0201c;permanent draft&#x0201d; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gold.jgi-psf.org/statistics">https://gold.jgi-psf.org/statistics</ext-link>), and have undergone little or no manual curation following the primary assembly stage. Typically, the resulting genome sequences are fragmented and incomplete with substantial numbers of misassemblies. All of these imperfections may subsequently cause read mismapping, and our study specifically addresses the issues associated with this.</p><p>In the present work, we have investigated the effects of a number of factors on the generation of false positive SNPs (loci incorrectly identified as polymorphic) using the &#x0223c; 125 Mbp genome of the flowering plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Simulated NGS read datasets varying in length from 50 to 1000 base pairs (bp) were used to generate both new genome assemblies and mappings to test the effects of NGS read length, different software for genome assembly, read mapping and SNP calling (including variable parameter settings), as well as SNP filtering, on FP SNP generation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Read datasets preparation</title><p>The five chromosome sequences of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Sequences/whole_chromosomes">ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Sequences/whole_chromosomes</ext-link>, served as the template for the generation of the simulated reads for our study. The SimSeq read simulator (last update 4.12.2011; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jstjohn/SimSeq">https://github.com/jstjohn/SimSeq</ext-link>) was used to generate haploid, error-free paired-end and mate-pair reads (the latter created specifically for the assembly stage) from each of the chromosome sequences (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Supplementary data section SD.1). This sampling mode allowed us to assume that every SNP encountered in the mappings must be an FP SNP which is due to read mismapping as there were no other sources of variant alleles. Paired-end reads were produced with 100-fold coverage depth and at lengths of 50, 100, 150, 300, 500, and 1000 bp (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Fragment sizes for these were 90, 180, 270, 540, 900 and 1800 bp respectively. Mate-pair reads were produced with 50-fold coverage depth at a length of 150 bp, with a fragment size of 3000 bp.

In order to keep coverage comparable among all mappings, we used the same mismatch rate across all read lengths, rather than a fixed number of mismatches. To enable any SNPs to be called, at least one mismatch per read must be allowed. With a minimum read length of 50 bp this equates to a mismatch rate of 1 mismatch in 50 bp, or 2 %. We aimed to compare strict and relaxed mismatch stringencies, and thus we chose the default of the latest BWA algorithm as the relaxed setting. This was calculated as being equivalent to 14 % mismatches per read. We then applied both mismatch rates (2 % and 14 %) to each of the mappers.

This allowed the jobs to run in a fraction of the time that would otherwise have been required. This is achieved by querying the list of contigs, discarding those that have no reads mapped to them, splitting the remainder into discrete regions that can be processed independently by FreeBayes, before finally concatenating the results back together into a single VCF (Variant Call Format) file.</p><p>For GATK, we designed a pipeline script to perform duplicate markup with Picard Tools (version 1.119 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard</ext-link>)), and local realignment around indels and variant calling with GATK. The base quality recalibration step was left out as we did not have known variants as part of our study design. To evaluate the effect of the mapping quality, both variant callers were configured to run with (MAPQ = 20) and without (MAPQ = 0) mapping quality filtering.

To simplify the design of the experiment, we used only the 150 bp read length dataset for assembly. Our choice of this read length was based on two considerations: a) a large number of ongoing sequencing projects use Illumina Hiseq reads as their primary source of sequence and the current maximum read length for this is 150 bp (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://systems.illumina.com/systems/hiseq_2500_1500/performance_specifications.ilmn">http://systems.illumina.com/systems/hiseq_2500_1500/performance_specifications.ilmn</ext-link>), and b) even projects involving the assembly of very large, complex genomes such as wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] use reads as short as this or even shorter (barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], norway spruce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]) as their primary source of sequence.</p><p>To investigate variations in read mapping, the simulated read sets described above were then mapped to the two <italic>de novo</italic> genome assemblies, as well as the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> reference genome, using two widely used read mappers, Bowtie2 and BWA.

The latter two technologies produce longer reads but are currently associated with substantial error rates and their use in variant calling is still in its early stages.

Out of 576 factor level combinations, 211 contained zero FPs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Supplementary file snpNumbersStats.xlsx). These included sets using the BWA mapper on the &#x0201c;strict&#x0201d; mismatch setting with the GATK variant caller for all combinations of depth filtering/no depth filtering, all three assembly types, MAPQ settings of 0 or 20, and the full range of read lengths. Zero FP SNPs were also found for sets using the BWA mapper on the &#x0201c;strict&#x0201d; mismatch setting with the FreeBayes variant caller and a MAPQ setting of 20 for all combinations of depth filtering/no depth filtering, all three assembly types, and the full range of read lengths. For the control assembly only, the FP count remained at zero in the combinations above even if the &#x0201c;relaxed&#x0201d; mismatch setting was used. The Bowtie2 mapper found zero FPs for the control assembly only and read lengths of 150 bp or fewer, with all combinations of depth filtering/no depth filtering, variant caller, stringency and MAPQ settings, as well as on the &#x0201c;strict&#x0201d; setting with 500 or 1000 bp reads. None of the mappings against the <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies achieved a zero FP count on the relaxed mismatch setting. At the other end of the spectrum, the largest mean number of FPs encountered was 36,260.5 (300 bp reads, Allpaths assembly, relaxed Bowtie2 mapping, MAPQ filter 0, FreeBayes, no depth filtering).</p><p>The majority of factor level combinations in the control group (139 out of 192) contained no FP SNPs at all, and most of the remainder had less than 1000 FP SNPs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Supplementary file snpNumbersStats.xlsx). There was, however, a large amount of variability within the control group, and some call sets contained very large numbers of FP SNPs. The worst performing combination in the control group comprised 300 bp reads mapped with Bowtie2 using relaxed mapping, variant-called with FreeBayes, using no depth filter and a MAPQ filter of 0, and yielded an average of 20,471.5 FP SNPs. The equivalent combination of tools using the strict mapping setting resulted in an average of only 17.0 FPs, a reduction of 3 orders of magnitude. This is a powerful illustration of the drastic effect of mapping stringency on FP SNP discovery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Main effects and interactions among experimental factors</title><p>All factors, apart from experimental replicate, had highly significant main effects on FP SNP number in the multifactorial ANOVA (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Supplementary file ANOVA_FullResults.xlsx). However, there was a large number of highly significant higher-order interaction terms in the ANOVA results, and these indicated many complex interactions between experimental factors. The results presented here should be viewed in the context of these interactions, as global means hide much of the complexity of our findings. Figures <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> show trellis plots for the two major higher-order interactions that summarise most of the variability attributed to interaction terms. The equivalent numerical values are shown in Tables <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. The residual term due to differences among the replicates accounted for less than 0.03 % of the total variation.

We therefore mapped reads against the published genome of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, as well as <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies of our simulated NGS reads. The publicly available genome of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> has been sequenced with Sanger technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and has undergone many years of labour-intensive manual curation. This is in stark contrast to the reference sequences for many non-model organisms which may be the product of relatively limited sequencing, minimal assembly effort and little subsequent quality control or validation. In this scenario, significant swathes of the genome may be misassembled or not assembled at all, and consequently read mismapping may occur on a large scale because the true targets for reads are not available in many cases. This can lead to mismatches with the reference sequence which produce FP SNPs that look inconspicuous in every respect and are therefore difficult to remove by filtering.</p><p>The difference in FP SNP numbers brought on by providing our own <italic>de novo</italic> assembled reference amounted to several thousands as a result of misassembly or non-assembly alone. The genome used here is small (approx. 125 Mbp) and contains relatively few repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The effects observed here (and consequently false positive numbers) are likely to be much more pronounced with larger, more complex genomes where misassembly is much more prevalent. Large, complex genomes of this kind are common in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and other organisms.</p><p>We also observed significant numbers of FP SNPs in some of the control call sets based on mapping against the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> sequence. This was surprising, but seemed to be mostly due to certain unfavourable combinations of tools and parameters. The majority of call sets in the controls (282 out of 384) contained no FP SNPs at all, and most of the remainder had less than 1000 FP SNPs. All of the control call sets with more than 1000 FP SNPs (<italic>n</italic> = 20) were done on the relaxed mapping settings which brings home the importance of conservative mapping even when the reference sequence is well assembled.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Choice of tools for assembly, mapping and variant calling</title><p>This study did not aim to compare the performance of specific tools involved in variant calling, but rather to provide proof of principle that false discovery rates in SNP calling can be significantly affected by the quality of reference sequence, tool choice and tool parameters. Equally, the current study did not aim to explore whether longer reads, or indeed longer read fragments, provide better <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies, as this has been covered elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>The assembly tools used for producing our <italic>de novo</italic> reference sequences from the simulated reads comprised Velvet and Allpaths-LG. Velvet is one of the first generation of short read assemblers but has had continuous improvements and updates over many years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Allpaths-LG is a relatively recent tool and developers have taken a new approach by requiring input of at least two different fragment size libraries to ensure a high quality assembly. Allpaths consistently performed well in both of the Assemblathon competitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], so we were surprised that the reference sequence produced by this tool was inferior to that produced by Velvet for most of the major metrics in the QUAST analysis (N50, assembly length, # misassemblies, genome fraction, # genes, largest contig), and it consistently yielded greater numbers of FP SNPs than the corresponding Velvet assemblies.</p><p>The two mapping tools used here, Bowtie2 and BWA, are arguably among the most commonly used tools for short read mapping. Both provide a good trade-off between accuracy and performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and have stood the test of time probably for this reason. On average, BWA performed better in this study, but when mapping short (50&#x02013;150 bp) reads against the good quality Control reference sequence with MAPQ_20 filtering, both tools performed equally well, giving zero false positives.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>SNP filtering</title><p>Filtering by MAPQ and maximum read depth both cut FP SNP numbers significantly. Their contribution to the overall variation in the data was relatively small but it is very clear from the data that these filters should be applied wherever it is appropriate. A notable exception for this is data where large differences in read coverage are expected, for example RNAseq &#x02014; here, a depth filter would be counterproductive. The effect of MAPQ filtering was less clear-cut &#x02014; applying the MAPQ_20 filter to the GATK callsets actually increased FP numbers slightly in this experiment. This is counterintuitive and requires further investigation. For the FreeBayes call sets, FP numbers did drop when the MAPQ_20 filter was applied, and it is clear from these results that this should be applied as a matter of routine when using this variant caller.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Read length</title><p>The numbers of FP SNPs observed as a function of read length ran counter to our prior expectation that longer reads should result in fewer FP SNPs due to greater mapping specificity and therefore reduced mismapping rates. We only observed this for the two MAPQ_0 BWA mappings against the Control reference sequence. For most of the other call sets, FP SNP numbers increased with read length. In the Bowtie2 mappings against the Control reference sequence, the pattern observed had a sharp peak for the 300 bp read mappings. The potential to cause FP SNPs seems to be related to the length of the read, providing that reads are mapped with the same mismatch <italic>rate</italic> as length increases, as was the case in our experiment. Every mismatch with the reference has the potential to become a FP SNP if suitable numbers of reads are mismapped together, and both longer reads and greater mismatch rates exacerbate this problem in theory (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).
<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Mismatches <italic>versus</italic> read length. Numbers of theoretically possible mismatches per read as a function of read length and mismatch settings</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2015_801_Fig8_HTML" id="MO8"/></fig></p><p>This is also illustrated by the example shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>. Here, Tablet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] screenshots are shown of the same region in mappings of different read lengths (only 50, 300 and 1000 bp shown for brevity) for what is otherwise the same factor level combination (Allpaths reference sequence, relaxed Bowtie2 mapping). This is a region that is clearly prone to read mismapping and it would appear from inspection of the 50 and 300 bp mappings alone that the longer the reads, the more FP SNPs are generated. However, the 1000 bp read mapping shows no signs of SNPs, and it appears as though the 1000 bp reads from the region that contributes the crossmapped reads in the 50 and 300 bp mappings simply have too many mismatches to be mapped here. This suggests that greater mapping specificity does play a role in this example, and for this particular region the use of longer reads has prevented mismapping and the ensuing FP SNPs. Visual inspection of our data has produced many other examples where the 1000 bp mapping instead contained even larger numbers of FP SNPs than any of the comparable shorter read mappings, but also cases where the 50 bp mapping was the only one containing any FP SNPs at all. Taken together, this is indicative of local variation in the potential for longer reads having greater mapping specificity &#x02014; whether or not read length makes a difference clearly depends on the underlying sequence context, and this will have contributed a significant amount of noise to our data which is obvious from both the plots and the data analysis.

All screenshots show the same region on chromosome 1, which has been mapped with reads from the correct region on chromosome 1, but also reads from chromosome 2. FP SNPs are visible as vertical, red dotted lines. In this example, the 50 bp reads (<italic>top</italic>) introduce a small number of FP SNPs, the 300 bp (<italic>middle</italic>) reads introduce a substantially larger number, but in the mapping of the 1,000 bp reads (<italic>bottom</italic>) there are no FP SNPs, presumably indicating that the 1,000 bp reads from the contaminating region on chromosome 2 contain too many mismatches to be mapped here</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2015_801_Fig9_HTML" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p>The potential of the longer reads to cause greater damage seems to be mitigated at least to some extent by their greater mapping specificity &#x02014; the rate of increase of FP SNP numbers with read length in this experiment (Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) was not as pronounced as could be expected from what is theoretically possible (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Our original assumption was that longer reads map more specifically, thereby reducing the potential for mismapping. The expectation would then be that longer reads have lower rates of mismapping than shorter reads. Information about mismapping is readily available for this dataset due to our use of simulated reads which retain information about their origin in the read name. We analysed the rates of mismapping (i.e. the percentage of reads at SNP locations that contained the alternate allele and originated from a different chromosome or a different region on the same chromosome) for each call set and plotted these as a function of both read length and assembly (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>).

For the Allpaths-assembled reference and the controls, rates of mismapping appeared to decline with increasing read length (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). For the Velvet-assembled reference sequences, this trend appeared to be reversed, and we currently have no explanation for this phenomenon.</p><p>The picture emerging from this is that there are probably two opposing forces involved here. On the one hand, there is the potential for longer reads to cause greater number of FP SNPs by introducing greater numbers of mismatches. On the other hand, we may have greater mapping specificity in longer reads, which means fewer reads get mismapped as read length increases, with an accompanying decrease in the likelihood of SNPs being called due to low alternate allele numbers. Within the current experiment, we did not simulate reads of the kind of lengths that are now being generated by e.g. the Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore technologies, and it would be highly interesting to explore in future experiments whether mapping reads of several kilobases in length genuinely improves mismapping.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Genomic patterns of FP SNP locations</title><p>Regions containing FP SNPs were strongly enriched for transposable elements, reflecting the concentration of repeat elements in these regions and a large proportion of FP SNPs were located in the pericentromeric regions of the chromosomes, where such repetitive sequences are prevalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

First and foremost, the quality of the reference sequence is of paramount importance. Fragmentation, misassembly and non-assembly of regions within the reference sequence lead to read mapping targets being effectively unavailable, and the corresponding reads mapping to incorrect locations, leading to FP SNP accumulation. The second major determinant of FP SNP numbers in our experiment is the stringency of the read mapping, with relaxed mappings generally producing larger numbers of FP SNPs than strict mappings. However, these differences were found to be large only for the combination of Bowtie2, longer reads (300, 500, 1000 bp) and high quality reference sequence, and BWA with the poor quality reference sequences. This is an important finding, as both the mappers used here are supplied with relatively relaxed mismatch settings as defaults. We strongly discourage users from running read mappers on relaxed mismatch setting defaults to maximise the numbers of reads mapped. However, there is a caveat in that very strict mappings may lead to false negative SNPs, and more work is required to formulate an optimal approach to determining a mismatch rate that minimises both false positive and false negative SNPs.</p><p>The choice of mapper and variant caller also have significant effects upon FP SNP discovery, as does the use of MAPQ and depth filters for SNPs.</p><p>Read length was seen to play a comparatively minor role in FP SNP generation, with a complex relationship emerging between read length and FP SNP number. We conclude that the potential for greater mapping specificity in longer reads is at least partially offset by the increased numbers of mismatches they can contribute, which potentially translates into greater numbers of FP SNPs. Overall, we recommend that a good quality reference sequence is extremely important for mapping-based variant calling, along with stringent mappings and appropriate filtering of SNPs by at least MAPQ and coverage depth.</p><p>The above result highlights the importance of interactions among the factors in a SNP discovery pipeline. It is not sufficient just to specify individual parameter values in isolation, as these can be advantageous or disadvantageous depending upon the choice of the other factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec30"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12859_2015_801_MOESM1_ESM.zip"><label>Additional file 1</label><caption><p>
