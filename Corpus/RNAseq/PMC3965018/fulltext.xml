Since that small beginning, the RefSeq project has realized significant growth in the number and type of sequence records provided and in the number and taxonomic breadth of the organisms represented. NCBI&#x02019;s RefSeq project now provides sequence records for genomes, transcripts and proteins for viruses, microbes, organelles and eukaryotic organisms. The genomic records provided for mammals include: (i) annotated nuclear and mitochondrial genomes; (ii) non-transcribed pseudogenes; (iii) haplotype-specific regions, such as the human leukocyte antigen-A (<italic>HLA-A</italic>) encoding regions and (iv) RefSeqGene records (described below), which are created for a subset of human genes to provide stable coordinate systems needed by clinical testing laboratories. Transcript records may be protein-coding, non-coding (ncRNA), or structural RNAs.</p><p>RefSeq records are generated for mammals and other higher eukaryotes in several ways. A gene may be represented by transcript, protein or genomic RefSeqs (with an NM, NR, NP or NG accession prefix, hereafter referred to as &#x02018;known&#x02019; RefSeqs) generated by automatic and manual processing of public sequence data maintained by members of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Consortium (INSDC) (<xref rid="gkt1114-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). An additional source is NCBI&#x02019;s eukaryotic genome annotation pipeline, which provides predicted model RefSeq records (with an XM, XR or XP accession prefix, hereafter referred to as &#x02018;model&#x02019; RefSeqs). Some RefSeq records may also be based on data imported from expert databases, such as the International Immunogenetics Information System (IMGT) (<xref rid="gkt1114-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), miRBase (<xref rid="gkt1114-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and pseudogene.org (<xref rid="gkt1114-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Curation by NCBI staff, focused particularly on the mammalian RefSeq branch, and collaboration with external groups helps in maintaining the quality of the collection and other resources it affects, including NCBI&#x02019;s Gene resource. We collaborate with official nomenclature groups (<xref rid="gkt1114-B6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref>), the Consensus CDS (CCDS) project (<xref rid="gkt1114-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), the Genome Reference Consortium (<xref rid="gkt1114-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), the Locus Reference Genomic initiative (<xref rid="gkt1114-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), UniProt (<xref rid="gkt1114-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and others. Curation and collaboration contribute new and updated sequence records, appropriate gene and protein names, feature annotation, relevant literature and help to ensure correct gene placement and to address sequence quality concerns. These activities in turn improve the outcome of the eukaryotic genome annotation pipeline.</p><p>In this article, we report on recent growth of the mammalian RefSeq dataset, changes to NCBI&#x02019;s eukaryotic genome annotation pipeline and newly expanded annotation that provides supporting evidence and more biologically relevant information in a RefSeq record.</p></sec><sec><title>GROWTH AND ACCESS</title><p>A comprehensive RefSeq file transfer protocol (FTP) release is provided bi-monthly (<ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/</ext-link>) and can be downloaded as either the complete dataset or as subsets organized by major taxonomic group, such as mammals or molecule type. New and updated RefSeq records are provided daily and a full release of transcript and protein records for select mammals as well as the human RefSeqGene complement (described below), is available weekly. RefSeq FTP release 61, distributed in September 2013 included more than 41 million sequence records from over 29 000 organisms. The largest subset of the RefSeq release consists of microbial (primarily bacterial) genome and protein records, which are processed differently from eukaryotic RefSeq records and are not the focus of this report. Additional information on the growth of the complete dataset, or of specific subsets, is available on the RefSeq web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/statistics/">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/statistics/</ext-link>) and from the FTP site (<ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/release-statistics/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/release-statistics/</ext-link>).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt1114-T1">Table 1</xref> summarizes the yearly growth of the RefSeq transcript datasets for human and other mammals that have a nuclear genome assembly; the relative proportion of select categories including model transcripts, curated known transcripts and ncRNAs (both model and known RefSeqs) is also reported. Compared with previous releases, the increase in number of mammalian taxa and the number of mammalian transcript records from release 54 (July 2012) to release 60 (July 2013) is a consequence of improvements to the eukaryotic genome annotation pipeline (described below) that result in a large increase in model RefSeqs. Considering human data separately, a gradual growth trend is observed over time. Decreases in the total number of human RefSeq transcripts and genes between some years (such as following the July 2009 release 36) can be attributed to several factors including incremental changes to the annotation pipeline that resulted in fewer predicted models and/or improved gene-level tracking and curation efforts to remove low-quality records or re-classify a protein-coding gene to a pseudogene. The recent larger increase in total transcript records for mammalian species is not as pronounced for the human subset, in part because the data is derived from annotation that predates the use of RNA-Seq evidence in the pipeline. In addition, model RefSeq records comprise a comparatively small portion of human RefSeq transcripts as a result of our emphasis on curating human sequence data&#x02014;in release 60, 79% of the RefSeq transcript records for human were curated by NCBI staff. RefSeq release 60 included transcripts for 26 266 genes, of which 43% had more than one alternatively spliced transcript record. <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkt1114-T1">Table 1</xref> also indicates a continued expansion of ncRNA representation which is achieved through a combination of computed genome annotation, curation and collaboration with authoritative sources such as miRBase (<xref rid="gkt1114-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).

The evidence-based pipeline generates genome annotation based on alignments of known RefSeq transcripts and proteins, INSDC transcripts and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot proteins with some supplemental HMM modeling based on the GENSCAN algorithm (<xref rid="gkt1114-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) used for genomes with less primary data. Extensive redevelopment of the pipeline over the last few years, including greater automation and parallel computing, resulted in a considerable increase in pipeline throughput. These improvements have allowed us to release a total of 42 genome annotations between January and August 2013, including 32 vertebrate genomes of which 22 are mammals. This number is nearly double the number of annotations produced in the entirety of 2012 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1114-F1">Figure 1</xref>). NCBI annotation priorities and a list of the genomes currently or recently annotated, with links to annotation release-specific resources, can be found on the eukaryotic annotation status page: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/status/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/status/</ext-link>.

The computational challenge posed by the vast amount and short length of reads generated by next-generation technologies was addressed in several ways: only single representatives of identical sequences retrieved from SRA are aligned, alignments with near-identical boundaries and same splice sites are collapsed and alignments representing very rare introns, likely to be background noise, are filtered out. At each step, information is recorded about the samples and number of reads represented by each alignment, so the level of support can be used to evaluate alignments and gene predictions.</p><p>The addition of short reads to the pool of evidence used for gene prediction permits the identification of more protein-coding and ncRNA alternative splice variants by the NCBI gene prediction software, Gnomon, and consequently, the supplementation of the RefSeq set. A recent policy change allows a gene to be represented by a mixture of known and predicted model RefSeqs providing a model RefSeq has an alternative splice pattern and all introns are supported by a single transcript or protein or by a single RNAseq sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt1114-F2">Figure 2</xref>). Consequently, model RefSeq annotation was modified to include computed transcript variant and, as relevant, protein isoform names that begin with &#x02018;X&#x02019; to distinguish them from the analogous names provided for known RefSeqs, although for model RefSeqs a &#x02018;Transcript Variant&#x02019; description comment is not included. These changes in the annotation pipeline account for the recent larger rate of increase in the number of mammalian records included in the RefSeq dataset. Other changes to model transcript and protein records include the addition of a &#x02018;Genome Annotation Data&#x02019; structured comment that, among other things, identifies the model record as a product of a specific NCBI annotation release. In addition, the scope of supporting evidence reported as a note on the gene feature now includes RNAseq data (e.g<italic>.</italic> XM_005267559.1).

Although most attributes are simply informative, curation of others including &#x02018;protein contains selenocysteine&#x02019; and &#x02018;ribosomal slippage&#x02019; plays a critical role in ensuring correct sequence representation and in turn, correct genome annotation. Transcripts that contain selenocysteine (Sec) use the UGA codon (typically a translation termination signal) to incorporate the Sec residue. Ribosomal slippage requires a ribosome to shift from the initiating reading frame to one of the two other frames. Neither occurrence follows standard rules of protein synthesis. Consequently, curation is required because standard computational tools cannot distinguish the dual functionality of the UGA codon or predict a programmed frameshift. Currently, the curated RefSeq dataset includes records for 267 selenoprotein-containing genes from 17 mammals (including the 25 known human genes) and 33 ribosomal slippage genes from 10 mammals.</p></sec><sec><title>Exon feature annotation</title><p>Exon features are annotated on human and mouse RefSeq transcripts based on Splign alignments to the reference assembly. Exon numbers are no longer provided. Our previous convention was to number the exons annotated on each transcript based on the set of exons represented in all RefSeq transcripts for the gene; exon numbers were not transcript-specific and were not stable because they were recalculated if a new RefSeq transcript record was added to the gene. Thus, adding a new record that included a more distal 5&#x02032; exon would result in renaming all of the exons on the other RefSeq records for the gene. The instability of exon numbers reported on RefSeq transcript records led to confusion and could have negative consequences if exon numbers were treated as a stable nomenclature in scientific communications. RefSeqGene genomic records continue to provide exon number information for the subset of transcripts selected as cDNA reference standards (described below).</p></sec><sec><title>Protein annotation criteria</title><p>A protein is annotated on a transcript based on an accumulated knowledge of translation, published data, conservation and consideration of the location and length of the ORF. Predicting a protein product encoded by an alternatively spliced transcript may be straightforward when the predicted protein is translated from the same start codon, is in the same reading frame and is of similar length to a &#x02018;canonical&#x02019; form. Uncertainty in prediction arises when upstream ORFs are present that may have an inhibitory effect on downstream translation or when alternative splicing has a significant effect on the CDS compared with the canonical form. For example, alternative splicing may produce a variant that shares the translation initiation codon with the canonical form, but a downstream frameshift either introduces a premature stop codon that may render the transcript a candidate for NMD, or generates a C-terminus diverged from the canonical form.</p><p>The RefSeq Project is increasing the representation of proteins in certain situations given findings in ribosome profiling (<xref rid="gkt1114-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) that suggest translation initiation can occur at multiple sites on a given transcript. We are no longer treating upstream ORFs that have a strong Kozak signal and encode proteins of more than 35 amino acids as inhibitory based on newer studies that indicate upstream ORFs (uORFs) appear to negatively regulate but not fully inhibit translation of the downstream primary ORF (<xref rid="gkt1114-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="gkt1114-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Non-coding RefSeq transcripts associated with protein-coding genes are under review to determine if translation of a downstream ORF is likely. Transcripts that may be subject to NMD will be represented as protein-coding if a downstream in-frame ORF that can encode a protein at least 50% the length of the canonical form exists (and is not predicted to be subject to NMD). Predicted proteins that are &#x0003c;50% the length of the canonical protein for the gene may still be represented in some cases when considering additional criteria such as shared translation initiation codon, epigenomic evidence for novel promoters, publications and sequence conservation. Although the arbitrary nature of a length threshold is recognized, our previous approach did not sufficiently consider ribosomal leaky scanning, re-initiation pathways or other translational regulatory factors such as mRNA structure and was overly conservative. Although this revised policy will result in annotation of a larger number of predicted alternate proteins, some alternatively spliced transcripts will continue to be represented as non-coding because no ORF meets our quality criteria.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>REFSEQGENE STATUS</title><p>RefSeqGene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/rsg">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/rsg</ext-link>) is the subset of the RefSeq project that provides human gene-specific genomic sequence records to serve as stable reference standards for clinical reporting. The sequence and its feature annotations are established in collaboration with the Locus Reference Genome (LRG) project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lrg-sequence.org">http://lrg-sequence.org</ext-link>) (<xref rid="gkt1114-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), the CCDS project (<xref rid="gkt1114-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and gene-specific experts. A genomic sequence is identified to represent a gene including sufficient sequence to include possible core regulatory regions (usually about 5 kb upstream and 2 kb downstream of the terminal exons); the RefSeqGene record always represents the gene in the sense strand. Transcript alignments are packaged with the RefSeqGene record to facilitate mapping coordinates from the RefSeqGene to reference standard transcripts. RefSeq transcripts that are selected as reference standards for feature annotation of RefSeqGene records (including exon features) are identified in the COMMENT section of the RefSeq record (see NM_000820.2 for an example). Exons of a RefSeqGene are named in two stages. Until an LRG reference standard sequence is established, the exons are annotated according to the RefSeq transcripts selected to determine exon placement. For example, RefSeqGene NG_029703.1 includes exon numbers for the GAS6 gene based on NM_000820.2, but not on other available transcripts for the gene (NM_001143945.1 and NM_001143946.1). As more stakeholders are included as the LRG reference standard is established, the set of reference transcripts may be updated and the exon numbers may be updated to their final state. Versions of the RefSeqGene record with an LRG identifier (e.g. LRG_1) match the LRG record exactly with respect to sequence, exons and annotated transcripts. The relationships between RefSeqGene and public LRG sequences are reported daily to RefSeqGene&#x02019;s ftp site (<ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/RefSeqGene/LRG_RefSeqGene">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/RefSeqGene/LRG_RefSeqGene</ext-link>); at the time of writing this manuscript, &#x0003c;10% of RefSeqGene sequences had been implemented as LRG.</p><p>RefSeqGene records are annotated with variations in NCBI&#x02019;s dbSNP (<xref rid="gkt1114-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and ClinVar (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/</ext-link>) databases, so the graphical display (e.g<italic>.</italic>

For example, future goals include reporting attributes for regulatory uORFs, indicating when RefSeq transcripts for a gene originate from inferred (epigenomics support) or published alternate promoters, multifunctional &#x02018;moonlighting&#x02019; proteins, polymorphic pseudogenes (where a locus is a pseudogene or encodes a protein product depending on population) as well as providing information about curator uncertainty with regard to the protein product (e.g. an alternative transcript with a short predicted protein or transcripts with long 5&#x02032;-UTRs that contain uORFs). We are currently focusing on expanding attribute reporting based on observations or analysis of the transcript and protein sequence. Mitochondrial localization information is provided with the initial attribute set because: (i) this impacts a large number of proteins; (ii) the mitochondrial transit peptide may be mis-reported as a signal peptide by some prediction programs and (iii) the information is more readily available. We are not currently planning to report other subcellular localization data as it is frequently difficult to determine exactly which protein (when there are multiple alternative splice variants) is actually localized to the reported location. In addition, an additional category of Evidence Data is planned that will report evidence in support of the annotated start codon, based partially on the incorporation of ribosome profiling data into RefSeq curation workflow.</p><p>Significant growth in the RefSeq mammalian (and vertebrate) collection is anticipated. Improvements to the NCBI eukaryotic genome annotation pipeline will expand representation of the number of taxa, the number of alternatively spliced transcripts and the total number of exons. Criteria to expand the use of RNAseq data are being developed for several purposes, including its use as a source of primary evidence for extending UTRs and for creating one- to two-exon ncRNA records lacking polyadenylation support, where the transcript is supported by more than one RNA-Seq sample.</p><p>Other development plans include providing detailed genome annotation reports on the evidence data used by the annotation pipeline, the quality of the resulting annotation and information regarding what annotation changed following annotation of a new assembly version or re-annotation of an existing assembly. Development to restructure and improve the organism-oriented data downloads from the Genomes FTP site (<ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/</ext-link>) is in progress.
