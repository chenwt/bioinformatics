Alternative methods for long-term storage of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains, although urgently needed, do not exist. Herein, we describe a narrow interval of low temperatures under which the larvae of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> can be stored in quiescence for up to two months. The development of larvae was arrested at the pre-wandering stage under fluctuating thermal regime (FTR), which simultaneously resulted in diminishing the accumulation of indirect chill injuries. Our physiological, metabolomic, and transcriptomic analyses revealed that compared to larvae stored at constant low temperatures, the larvae stored under FTR conditions were able to decrease the rates of depletion of energy substrates, exploited brief warm episodes of FTR for homeostatic control of metabolite levels, and more efficiently exerted protection against oxidative damage.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The potential to store insects for a long term at low temperatures would procure considerable benefits. Long-term storage could supplement, or even replace, tedious and expensive continuous rearing practices currently used in mass rearing facilities that produce insects for pest management purposes, or in large <italic>Drosophila</italic> centres that preserve valuable genetic lines and mutant strains. Two basic strategies for low-temperature insect storage are known: (i) cryopreservation of embryos at cryogenic temperatures, most often in liquid nitrogen at &#x02212;196&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, and (ii) long-term storage at temperatures below the threshold for development, which is typically applicable for insects in diapause<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The methods for long-term storage of fruit flies (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) although urgently desired, currently produce unsatisfactory results. Despite the growing list of successfully cryopreserved insect embryos in liquid nitrogen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, the attempts to cryopreserve embryos of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have been only partially successful in the past<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The theoretical possibility of cryogenic technique use for the conservation of complex tissues or whole organisms appeared mostly unsuccessful or very problematic in practice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. We previously described a protocol for cryopreservation of larvae of another drosophilid fly, <italic>Chymomyza costata</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Thereafter, in an attempt to adapt this protocol for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, we could ensure survival of fruit fly larvae after conversion of the freezable fraction of body water into ice (freeze tolerance), yet such larvae had no capacity to survive in liquid nitrogen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Here, we extend our previous effort, and analyse whether the larval stage possess some capacity for long term storage at moderately low temperatures.</p><p>A strategy of long-term storage at temperatures slightly below the threshold for development, exploiting the natural features of insect diapause, presents itself as a useful alternative to cryopreservation in many insects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. However, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> adults show very weak capacity to enter reproductive diapause<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and larvae possess absolutely no capacity for diapause. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is a fly of tropical origin, its larval stage is evolutionarily adapted for rapid growth and development under warm conditions, and all ontogenetic stages are highly susceptible to cold<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In insect species that lack diapause, the potential for practical long-term storage at low temperatures could be limited unless the host of problems linked to development of indirect chill injury is solved. The causes of indirect chill injury are insufficiently understood but likely involve a complex of detrimental changes: metabolic disorder, oxidative stress, depletion of free chemical energy, and disturbance of ionic and osmotic homeostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>The first goal of our study was to determine the temperature conditions that are sufficiently cold to halt the developmental processes (inducing quiescence), but warm enough to avoid/slow down accumulation of indirect chill injury. Based on previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and our previous results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, we focused on constant low temperatures (CLTs) in the range from +3 to +9&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and assessed the time limits of larval storability. Next, we attempted to extend the storage time by applying fluctuating thermal regimes (FTRs). In FTRs, relatively long periods of cold are alternated, most often on a daily basis, with relatively short periods at high/optimal temperature. In various insects, a brief exposure to high temperature allows repair of chill injury accrued during preceding cold periods and, consequently, extends storage at low temperatures (for a recent review, see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Using a combination of low temperature-induced quiescence and FTR-based suppression of chill injuries, we were able to store viable larvae for up to 2 months. Next, we conducted metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses of CLT- and FTR-exposed larvae in order to describe the physiological basis of long-term survival of the chill susceptible larvae in quiescence. We identified developmental failures, depletion of energy substrates, loss of metabolite homeostasis and oxidative damage as potential mechanisms responsible for accumulation of indirect chill injury, which sets physiological limits on <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> low-temperature storability.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae can be stored in quiescence for up to 2 months</title><p>We assayed survival and storability of fully grown 3rd instar larvae of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> at different thermal regimes for various periods ranging from 1 d to 60 d. Five constant low temperatures (CLTs: 3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 7&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and 9&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) and two fluctuating thermal regimes (FTRs: 5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/11&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/11&#x02009;&#x000b0;C; for more explanations, see Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1a</xref>) were assessed. Upon transfer to low temperatures, larvae halted ontogeny at the pre-wandering stage and entered into quiescence. The &#x02018;temperature-window&#x02019; for successful quiescence is theoretically delimited by the temperature of the upper limit of cold injury zone (ULCIZ) from below<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and the temperature of the lower developmental threshold (LDT) from above<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Although diapausing insects are often able to shift their ULCIZ to deep sub-zero temperatures (even to &#x02212;196&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in extreme cases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>), the temperature-window for quiescence in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae is relatively narrow. It spans approximately from 6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (ULCIZ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) to 10&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (LDT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). We confirmed this narrow quiescence window by observing the rapid occurrence of chilling injury and mortality in larvae at CLTs of 3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1b</xref>) and 5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Conversely, most larvae continued developing, wandered, and pupariated, but were not able to proceed further in development and died at CLT 9&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1d</xref>) (&#x02018;pupariation mortality,&#x02019; see grey lines in survival diagrams). At CLTs 6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 7&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, <italic>i.e.</italic> at optimum temperatures for quiescence, larval survival was relatively high and small proportions of larvae (up to 13%) succumbed to pupariation mortality. The survivor larvae, however, showed impaired capacities to form puparia and emerge as fit adults. Thus, only 0.9% and 2.1%, adults emerged after 60 d-storage at CLT 6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and CLT 7&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1c</xref>), respectively.</p><p>Application of FTR protocol significantly improved survival at low temperatures. The positive effect of FTR was especially apparent in the experiment comparing survival at CLT 5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) vs. FTR 5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/11&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The highest long-term survival was recorded at FTR 6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/11&#x02009;&#x000b0;C where 54.5% larvae were still alive after 60-d-long storage and 13.1% healthy adults emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). The general rationale used to explain the positive effect of FTR on insect survival at low temperature is based on the assumption that brief, periodic exposures to high temperature allow repair of indirect chill injury accrued during preceding cold periods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. During warm episodes, insects could re-establish the ion balance that was partially lost during preceding chilling episodes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In addition, the insects probably can exploit the warm episodes for: repair/degradation of damaged proteins via heat shock protein-assisted processing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>; replenishment of potentially depleted ATP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>; management of oxidative damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>; or synthesis of cryoprotectants that would be useful in subsequent cold spells (for detailed discussion, see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). We will discuss some of these mechanisms later.</p><p>We observed (Ko&#x00161;t&#x000e1;l <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished observations) that a small fraction of larvae survived at FTR 6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/11&#x02009;&#x000b0;C even after 3 months, but these larvae were not able to metamorphose into adults. We also observed that increasing the temperature of warm episodes of FTR by just a single degree C (from 11&#x02009;&#x000b0;C to 12&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) or extending the duration of the warm episode of FTR by just 2&#x02009;h (from 4&#x02009;h to 6&#x02009;h) allowed slow continuation of larval development resulting in high pupariation mortality (Ko&#x00161;t&#x000e1;l <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished observations). Practical applicability of the FTR 6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/11&#x02009;&#x000b0;C storage protocol to other strains (other than Oregon R that was used in this study) or mutant strains of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is not straightforward, but would require careful assessment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Physiological limits of low temperature storability in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae</title><p>The insect cold tolerance literature recognizes three basic types of cold-associated injury (for review see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>): <italic>freezing</italic> of body water resulting in cellular dehydration, osmotic concentration of solutes, and mechanical damage to cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>; <italic>direct chilling</italic> injury upon exposure to severe cold shock, which causes dissociation of multimeric proteins, protein denaturation, and membrane lipid phase transitions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>; and <italic>indirect chilling</italic> injury upon chronic exposures to relatively mild low temperatures, which causes gradual accumulation of various metabolic disorders including oxidative stress, depletion of energy substrates and/or ATP, and disturbance of ionic and osmotic homeostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Our analysis focused on indirect chilling injuries as we exposed the larvae to temperatures slightly <italic>above</italic> the ULCIZ.</p><p>The survival data were best-fitted using two-phase exponential decay curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b&#x02013;d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1c</xref>). The first phase of fast decay of survival was observed in both CLT and FTR conditions during the early part of storage (approximately 1&#x02013;2 weeks). We speculated that this high initial mortality could be linked to developmental failures in larvae that were out of the optimal ontogenetic stage for entry into quiescence (too early or too late in development) when being transferred to storage conditions. We defined the developmental failure as an inability to proceed correctly through the specific ontogenetic stage when the blockade of morphogenetic processes was incomplete during quiescence. The developmental failure was most clearly expressed in our experiments at constant 9&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, when all larvae proceeded successfully to wandering and pupariation stages but were not able to form and proceed through the pupal stage. Later during storage, the rate of decrease in survival was much slower (second, slow decay phase). This meant that the larvae that managed to arrest their ontogeny at an optimal stage for quiescence were able to survive until a combination of accumulated indirect chill injuries killed them. The nature of chill injuries will be discussed next.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Alterations in metabolomic profile linked to entry into quiescence</title><p>Our metabolomic analysis revealed variations in the levels of 37 different metabolites (see complete list in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>) linked to storage at CLT 6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (will be abbreviated as CLT in next text) and FTR 6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/11&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (will be abbreviated as FTR in next text). We subjected these data to between-class PCA analysis, which clustered the treatments and found statistically significant differences between them (Monte Carlo test, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). The plot of PC1 and PC2 components, collectively accounting for 64.80% of total inertia, is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>. Exposure to 6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for a period as short as 18&#x02009;h exerted a strong influence on metabolite composition, as witnessed by clear separation of the treatment Start from the treatment CLT1. The PCA analysis further revealed that the metabolomic response occurred in two phases. During the first phase (from Start to day 3, green arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), the clusters of all treatments gradually moved along the PC1 and PC2 axes in negative directions. According to the projection of individual metabolites on the correlation circle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), this gradual shift was driven mainly by increasing concentrations of some aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, DOPA) and of methionine, whereas the concentrations of most organic acids (except citrate and aconitate), and fructose and alanine, decreased. The shift proceeded &#x02018;faster&#x02019; under CLT than under FTR conditions. That was because numerous metabolites showed characteristic staircase-like trends under FTR conditions, where the concentrations were driven to opposite directions during the cold and warm episodes (see four examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). These results indicated that loss of initial metabolite homeostasis proceeded faster under CLT than under FTR. Collectively, the first phase was characterized by metabolite changes suggesting a slowdown of intermediary metabolism, including glycolysis and TCA turnover: (i) glucose slightly decreased and fructose was rapidly depleted despite that very high concentrations of both sugars were present in the larval diet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. These results indicated that food intake/digestion was severely compromised; (ii) pyruvate, the end-product of glycolysis, decreased and two end-products of fermentation, lactate and alanine, decreased as well; (iii) two upstream intermediates of TCA, citrate and aconitate, increased, whereas the others decreased (ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, and malate) suggesting a blockade of TCA at the locus of isocitrate dehydrogenase, which converts isocitrate to ketoglutarate.</p><p>The samples taken on day 7 of exposure shifted far along the PC2 axis in the positive direction. Again, the direction of this shift was similar in CLT and FTR treatments, whereas the distance shifted was longer in CLT than in FTR. During this second phase (blue arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>), metabolic suppression probably continued, but the metabolite composition partially recovered (the concentrations of TCA intermediates showed a trend toward initial conditions) and/or new homeostatic conditions were established. Under the new homeostatic conditions, metabolism probably shifted toward higher exploitation of proteins and lipids as energy substrates: (i) the concentrations of trehalose, a principle sugar in insect circulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, were maintained high and almost constant; (ii) the breakdown of proteins was indicated by increasing concentrations of free amino acids. For instance, glutamine concentrations increased from 10.4&#x02009;nmol mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> FM at Start to 29.7&#x02009;nmol mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> FM (day 7 of CLT) or 34.8&#x02009;nmol mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> FM (day 7 of FTR). Glutamine may serve as a sink and deposit of amino-groups released from other amino acids during their degradation; and (iii) the lipid breakdown was indicated by increasing glycerol concentrations.</p><p>The changes in metabolite profiles were broadly similar at CLT and FTR. This similarity probably reflects the fact that temperatures were favourable for survival (above ULCIZ) in both treatments. Nevertheless, larvae survived longer at FTR than at CLT and our metabolomics analysis confirmed that the warm episodes of FTR may generally serve the purpose of re-setting the homeostatic conditions, reverting potentially detrimental trends, and removal of potentially toxic intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>; see also refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Alterations of gene expression linked to entry into quiescence</title><p>Gene expression patterns changed profoundly in response to cold exposure irrespective of whether it was applied as the FTR or CLT regime.

Direct validation using qRT-PCR analysis in 11 selected genes confirmed high reliability of our RNAseq results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p>The Venn&#x02019;s diagrams in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> suggested that a large part of the gene expression response to cold was common to FTR and CLT regimes. White ovals delimit numbers of cold-responding DE-genes shared between FTR and CLT conditions: 819 up-regulated and 833 down-regulated in total. We performed the enrichment analysis of these shared DE sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>, parts A, B) and found that the gene categories associated with catabolic processes of carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids, respiration, and energy production were significantly under-represented. Diverse glycosyl hydrolases, and among them specifically mannosidases, formed the most down-regulated category. Mannosidases are enzymes degrading yeast cell walls containing polymannose chains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. These results indicated, in agreement with metabolomics, that digestion of food, catabolism, and energy production were not only severely compromised, but probably also actively down-regulated (as indicated by relatively low abundances of relevant transcripts) upon transfer to low temperatures. Conversely, the gene categories associated with activity of glutathione transferases and metabolism of xenobiotics were significantly over-represented under CLT and FTR conditions compared to Start. These results identify metabolic disorders (accumulation of potentially toxic intermediates), loss of redox balance, and oxidative damage as potential sources of indirect chill injury linked to storage at low temperatures (see also refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>).</p><p>The global difference in gene expression between FTR and CLT regimes was relatively small. When comparing two treatments with the same end-temperature of 6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, <italic>i.e.</italic> FTR7C vs. CLT7, 295 sequences were up-regulated, whereas 217 sequences were down-regulated (see red ovals in the Venn&#x02019;s diagrams associated with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>, parts C, D). The enrichment analysis of these DE-genes identified that some GO terms associated with chitin metabolism and cuticle formation were differently regulated between CLT and FTR. Such differences might be related to slow development in cuticle, the dynamism of which was probably suppressed more at CLT than at FTR (see our previous discussion on incomplete developmental arrest in quiescence). Other differences between CLT and FTR concerned the GO terms associated with either glycosyl hydrolases on one side or iron binding, redox reactions, and glutathione transferases on the other side, <italic>i.e.</italic> the processes that were generally either down- or up-regulated, respectively, under both CLT and FTR conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>, parts C, D). To further document the overall similarity in expression trends under two thermal regimes, CLT and FTR, we performed an extended qRT-PCR validation analysis of mRNA transcripts in four selected genes, <italic>maltase A8</italic>, <italic>glutathione transferase D5</italic>, <italic>larval cuticular protein 1,</italic> and <italic>amyrel</italic>. Results of extended validation exemplify that relatively small differences in gene transcript abundances on day 7 might arise simply as a result of slightly different rates of generally similar trends under CLT and FTR conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p>Only 116 sequences were up-regulated and 126 sequences were down-regulated in the T vs. C episode of FTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>, parts E, F). The effect of altering the warm and cold episodes during FTR was analysed using enrichment analysis of these DE-genes. No significantly warm-over-represented gene category was found. We found only one significantly warm-under-represented category that included four cysteine-rich genes with unknown function (described by two different terms: SM00689 and IPR006611). In addition, the category of stress genes, including several heat shock factors (<italic>hsr omega</italic> and <italic>hsf</italic>) and genes coding for proteins involved in response to extreme temperatures (<italic>DnaJ</italic>, <italic>Hsp60</italic>, <italic>Hsc2</italic>, and <italic>Hsp83</italic>), was found to be marginally significantly warm-under-represented (meaning: cold-over-represented).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Differences in physiology between the larvae stored at CLT vs. FTR</title><p>We compared the mass parameters, hydration, basic biochemical composition, selected metabolites, total ATP content, potassium concentration in haemolymph, and two biomarkers of oxidative damage in the larvae collected at the Start of the experiment and after 30 days of storage at CLT or FTR. We found that larvae experienced significant losses of fresh mass (FM, 26.8%), dry mass (DM, 37.0%), and water mass (WM, 23.2%) at CLT, which was in striking contrast to FTR-stored larvae that were able to maintain all these parameters practically constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>). The most plausible explanation for this difference was that the larvae stored at FTR ingested food during warm episodes, whereas the larvae stored at CLT were starving. Therefore, the CLT-stored larvae probably had to rely on their internal reserves much more than FTR larvae. Consequently, CLT-stored larvae exhibited massive depletions of energy substrates: 69.0% of glycogen, 31.3% of proteins, and 29.5% of lipids were lost within 30 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>). Extrapolating these decreasing trends to longer durations of storage, it is reasonable to expect that the depletion of energy substrates, especially of glycogen, will limit storage time at CLT at some point lying close to the empirically observed limit of 60 days. Interestingly, the FTR-stored larvae were able to maintain their lipid reserves constant for 30 days, similar to diapausing larvae of <italic>C. costata</italic> stored at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In holometabolous insects, the fat stores accumulated during the larval stage are brought forward to the pupa and serve as energy stores for metamorphosis and early adult life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> pupae consumed 35% and 27% of their initial lipid and carbohydrate reserves, respectively, to fuel metamorphosis into the adult form<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Therefore, even a partial depletion of energy stores during the larval stage may critically limit survival during future ontogenetic steps.</p><p>The alteration of metabolic pathways during larval quiescence, either at CLT or FTR, resulted in depletion of specific intermediary metabolites (pyruvate, ketoglutarate, and glutamate), whereas other metabolites were accumulated (glutamine, proline, and arginine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>). Interestingly, we recently showed that all three accumulated metabolites could stimulate high freeze-tolerance in larvae of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> when applied as food additives<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. In theory, the accumulated proline and glutamine, probably in combination with trehalose and some other amino acids, could stabilize cells by preventing or reducing partial unfolding of proteins and membrane fusion in the larvae exposed to thermal stress linked to quiescence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. The cryoprotective function of arginine is probably exerted specifically during freeze dehydration, which is not relevant for storage in quiescence (for discussion on cryoprotective roles of metabolites, see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Natural accumulation of proline has been observed in various insects during cold acclimation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. The cryoprotective role of proline was directly proven in plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> and proline was found to be essential for cryopreservation of <italic>C. costata</italic> larvae in liquid nitrogen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. It seems likely that the cold-induced accumulation of proline, and its metabolic associates, has been bolstered in the process of evolutionary adaptation to cold in some cold-hardy organisms. No, or only a weak, evolutionary adaptation to cold, however, is expected in larvae of <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> These larvae were designed by evolution for rapid growth and development under warm conditions of tropics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Our results strongly support the view that the accumulation of proline is a widespread feature resulting from redirecting the metabolic pathways during metabolic suppression. As such, the accumulation of proline might serve as pre-adaptation in natural selection of organisms forced into dormancy during cooling of their habitats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.</p><p>The two metabolites that specifically accumulated only in CLT-stored larvae were lactate and alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>). These results suggested that CLT-stored larvae had to rely more than FTR-stored larvae on ATP production via the anaerobic glycolytic pathway, and/or that CLT-larvae were not able to effectively metabolize the end products of the fermentation pathways. Despite this difference, the larvae were similarly balancing the processes of ATP production and consumption at both regimes, CLT and FTR. Relatively small and similar decreases of total ATP levels were observed during 30 days of storage at CLT (18.9% of ATP lost) and FTR (17.7% of ATP lost) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>). The balanced supply of ATP is critically needed to secure basic metabolic and homeostatic processes during quiescence. For instance, the quiescent larvae proved their ability to maintain relatively low concentrations of potassium in their haemolymph for at least 30 days at both CLT and FTR conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). In contrast, the characteristic increase of extracellular potassium concentration (hyperkalaemia) occurred in the larvae when we transferred them from 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C to 0&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Within 30-min of exposure at 0&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, the potassium concentration significantly increased, almost 2-fold, compared to initial conditions and the insects died. Cold-induced hyperkalaemia was shown to be strongly correlated with the degree of chilling injury in different insects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. The cold-induced hyperkalaemia is believed to stem from an inability to energize the primary ion pumping systems in the hind gut and/or Malpighian tubules and, consequently, to maintain organismal osmotic and ionic homeostasis. Hyperkalaemia leads to cell membrane depolarization, which probably initiates a cascade of detrimental processes, including uncontrolled activation of cellular proteases and lipases that ultimately destroy cell integrity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>.</p><p>Results of previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and those of our enrichment gene expression analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>) have suggested that metabolic disorder and oxidative stress might be important causes of indirect chilling injury. Therefore, we assessed the levels of lipid hydroxyperoxides (LPOs) and protein carbonyls (PLs) in the quiescent larvae stored at CLT and FTR. Indeed, we found that CLT-stored larvae might suffer from oxidative stress as the levels of both biomarkers of oxidative damage were slightly elevated. Although these elevations were only marginally significant in statistical terms, they may represent actual tolerable limits, as suggested by a parallel analysis of stress biomarkers in control larvae exposed to paraquat-augmented diet (for more details, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>). No elevations of LPO and PL levels were observed under FTR conditions. These results suggest that while the detoxification and anti-oxidant systems were transcriptionally bolstered in quiescent larvae at both CLT and FTR conditions, the systems were functioning more efficiently at FTR than at CLT conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Insects, thermal conditions and survival/storability assays</title><p>All experiments were conducted with Oregon R strain of <italic>Drosophila (Sophophora</italic>) <italic>melanogaster</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>.

The amount of LPO was expressed as percentage of total phospholipids extracted from larval muscle in chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) followed by acetonitrile/hexane phase separation as described earlier<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. Protein carbonyls (PCs) were analyzed after their tagging with DNPH followed by colorimetric assay of DNP hydrazones formed in the reaction provided in the Protein Carbonyl Assay Kit (ab126287, Abcam). PCs were expressed in nmols per total protein extracted from larval muscle as described above.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Ko&#x00161;t&#x000e1;l, V. <italic>et al.</italic> Physiological basis for low-temperature survival and storage of quiescent larvae of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster.

(<bold>b</bold>) Schematic depiction of major processes, catabolic and energy production pathways, selected energy substrates, metabolites, and ATP. Metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses collectively suggest that processes of food intake, digestion, catabolism, and energy metabolism are generally suppressed during quiescence (dashed black arrows). The growth and development, and associated anabolic processes, are arrested. In contrast, the metabolic pathways resulting in accumulation of some amino acids, and the processes linked to homeostasis and cell protection are relatively bolstered in quiescent larvae (dashed red arrows). The small diagrams represent fold-differences in levels of selected compounds between larvae collected at the Start of experiment and after 30 days of storage at FTR (red columns and numbers) and CLT (blue columns and numbers). Some of the accumulated amino acids may stabilize cells of quiescent larvae (proline, dashed green arrow). For complete dataset, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>.
