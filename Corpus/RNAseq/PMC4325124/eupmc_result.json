    "Substantial efforts are being made in research on the molecular genetic characterization of prostate cancer. The number of fundamental research programs in prostate cancer molecular biology and genetics is overwhelming. However, a significant gap appears to exist between the huge number of studies on the genetic characterization of prostate cancer, which often have limited translation into clinical practice or simply were not conceived to be so translated, and clinical practice. From a clinical point of view, this balance should be urgently shifted towards rapid translation into urological practice. However, prostate cancer is characterized by prominent genetic heterogeneity, which could be a very difficult barrier to overcome. In this review, we discuss the possible clinical applications of scientific data from fundamental studies of prostate cancer genetics, the main problems with the translation of these data to clinics, and future perspectives."
