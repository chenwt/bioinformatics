In a previous genome-wide analysis of the TF repertoire of the plant-symbiotic fungus <italic>Tuber melanosporum</italic>, we identified various enzymes, including the sulfur-assimilation enzyme phosphoadenosine-phosphosulfate reductase (PAPS-red), as potential transcriptional activators. A functional analysis performed in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, now demonstrates that a specific variant of this enzyme, PAPS-red A, localizes to the nucleus and is capable of transcriptional activation. TF moonlighting, which is not present in the other enzyme variant (PAPS-red B) encoded by the <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> genome, relies on a transplantable C-terminal polypeptide containing an alternating hydrophobic/hydrophilic amino acid motif. A similar moonlighting activity was demonstrated for six additional proteins, suggesting that multitasking is a relatively frequent event. PAPS-red A is sulfur-state-responsive and highly expressed, especially in fruitbodies, and likely acts as a recruiter of transcription components involved in S-metabolism gene network activation. PAPS-red B, instead, is expressed at low levels and localizes to a highly methylated and silenced region of the genome, hinting at an evolutionary mechanism based on gene duplication, followed by epigenetic silencing of this non-moonlighting gene variant.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>There is an increasing interest for multifunctional, especially &#x0201c;moonlighting&#x0201d; proteins, defined as proteins endowed with two or more, often unrelated functions associated to a single polypeptide chain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

The reasons for the growing interest in moonlighting proteins have mainly to do with their inherent biological curiosity, the challenge they pose in genome/proteome annotation and their possible implications in biological circuitry analysis, <italic>de novo</italic> protein design and human diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Multiple, apparently unrelated functions (e.g., cytosolic enzymes also acting as structural, chaperone/scaffold, cell motility-related or transport proteins) have been documented for moonlighting proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. In some cases, a strict taxonomic specificity of moonlighting activities has also been documented (see<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> for a review). For example, different metabolic enzymes have been recruited as structural proteins of the eye lens (&#x0201c;crystallins&#x0201d;) in a strictly species-specific manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>A special case in point is represented by metabolic enzymes that moonlight as transcription factors, specifically designated as &#x0201c;trigger enzymes&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> or &#x0201c;metabolism-related transcription factors&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, i.e., proteins with the ability to couple metabolic state sensing with gene expression regulation, thus coordinating cell activity and adaptation in a metabolic signal-dependent manner. The latter include a variety of metabolic enzymes and cofactors (e.g., acetyl-CoA, S-adenosyl methionine and NAD<sup>+</sup>) directly or indirectly involved in gene expression regulation, with different documented or purported roles such as DNA/RNA binding, modulatory interaction with selected transcription machinery components, co-activator/repressor function and chromatin remodeling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> (reviewed in<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>Following up to the sequencing and annotation of the genome of the black truffle <italic>Tuber melanosporum</italic>, a filamentous mycorrhizal ascomycetous fungus, we carried out a genome-wide <italic>in silico</italic> and functional screening of the <italic>Tuber</italic> proteome searching for proteins endowed with transcription factor (TF) activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Given the as yet poor genetic tractability of truffles, this screening, named &#x0201c;transcription activator trap&#x0201d; (TAT)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, was conducted in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. It used as readout the ability of polypeptides representative of the entire <italic>Tuber</italic> proteome to confer reporter gene transactivation capacity to a deletion derivative of the yeast TF Gal4, capable of DNA-binding but lacking transactivation capacity. In this way, we functionally validated approximately one-fifth (37 out of 201) of the <italic>in silico</italic> predicted <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> TFs, but also identified 43 polypeptides whose potential ability to act as transcriptional activators had not been described before. The latter group comprised six metabolic enzymes, with a prevalence of dehydrogenases/reductases. These included PhosphoAdenosine-PhosphoSulfate reductase (PAPS-red), a key enzyme of the sulfur assimilation pathway, responsible for activated sulfate (PAPS) reduction and sulfite formation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p>At variance with other fungi, the <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> genome encodes two PAPS reductase enzymes, designated as PAPS-red A and B. The former enzyme (PAPS-red A), which was retrieved as a potential transcriptional moonlighter in our TAT screen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, is expressed at high levels in fruiting bodies, where sulfur assimilation is also involved in the production of secondary sulfur metabolites (S-Volatile Organic Compounds; S-VOCs) as components of the truffle aroma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>Focusing on this enzyme, we show here that although devoid of a conventional (<italic>in silico</italic> predictable) nuclear localization signal (NLS), <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> PAPS-red A has an autonomous nuclear localization capacity. As revealed by functional comparison with PAPS-red enzymes from two unrelated ascomycetes (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>) as well as with the <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> PAPS-red B enzyme, transcriptional moonlighting appears to be a unique property of PAPS-red A. Transcriptional activation capacity is associated to a transplantable, 23 amino acids C-terminal polypeptide extension, containing a peculiar alternation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids, as previously observed in several eukaryotic TFs, including yeast Gal4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p><p>The present work thus identifies a novel transcriptional moonlighting enzyme whose &#x0201c;second job&#x0201d; TF activity may be instrumental to the fine tuning of sulfur metabolism-related genes in an organism with a high reduced-sulfur demand such as <italic>T. melanosporum</italic>. We also document the potential transcriptional moonlighting activity of six additional black truffle proteins, three of which have an enzymatic metabolic activity as their &#x0201c;first job&#x0201d;.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>T. melanosporum</italic> PAPS-red A is a sulfur assimilation enzyme capable of transcriptional activation</title><p>PAPS reductase catalyzes the second step of reductive sulfur assimilation and is responsible for the conversion of activated sulfate (PAPS) to sulfite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In the <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> genome it is encoded by two paralogous genes designated as PAPS-red A (GSTUMT00002663001) and PAPS-red B (GSTUMT00001561001), which are 99% and 98% identical at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence level, respectively. Both PAPS-red genes, whose nucleotide sequence identity (98.8%) extends to 3&#x02009;kb upstream to the coding region, are composed of three exons with conserved exon-intron junctions. This extensive similarity suggests that both PAPS-red gene products are likely active catalytically. However, while PAPS-red B is located in a transposon-rich, highly methylated region of the <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and is very poorly expressed, PAPS-red A is expressed at high levels, especially in fruiting bodies (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>, for a summary of RNAseq data).</p><p>In keeping with the lack of expression of PAPS-red B, four independent PAPS-red A clones, but no PAPS-red B sequence, were isolated from our previous TAT screen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. We thus focused on this enzyme form and cloned its full-length cDNA, corresponding to an N-terminally 35 aa extended version of the originally mispredicted GSTUMT00002663001 gene model. This cDNA was used to verify the catalytic competence of the predicted PAPS-red A enzyme by testing its ability to suppress the methionine auxotrophy phenotype of a <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mutant strain lacking the orthologous, PAPS-red encoding gene <italic>MET16</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> PAPS-red A effectively complemented the biosynthetic defect of the <italic>met16</italic>&#x00394; mutant strain and restored its ability to grow on synthetic medium lacking exogenously supplied methionine.</p><p>A common feature of PAPS reductase and other sulfate assimilation genes in various organisms is their upregulation in response to sulfate-starvation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. This also applies to PAPS-red A, whose mRNA levels increase more than 10-fold in sulfate-starved <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> mycelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Additionally, PAPS red A expression levels are 14-fold more elevated in a high sulfur-demand tissue such as <italic>Tuber</italic> fruitbodies compared to free-living mycelia cultured under S-sufficient conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). The above results indicate that <italic>Tuber</italic> PAPS-red A is not only catalytically competent and capable of functionally replacing the well-characterized yeast enzyme, but it is also tightly regulated in a life-cycle stage and sulfur state-dependent manner.</p><p>To verify the moonlighting transcriptional activity of PAPS-red A, we conducted an independent set of &#x0201c;transcription activator trap&#x0201d; assays using a newly assembled fusion construct containing the full-length PAPS-red A cDNA linked in-frame to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of yeast Gal4. These new TAT assays confirmed our previous observations on the transcriptional activity of the <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Specifically, the ability of PAPS-red A to act as an activation domain (AD) effectively trans-activating the expression of Gal4-dependent <italic>LacZ</italic> and <italic>HIS3</italic> reporter genes. In fact, as shown by the TAT assay results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, the Gal4-DBD-PAPS-red A fusion led to the production of well-detectable &#x003b2;-galactosidase enzyme levels and fully restored histidine prototrophy as well as resistance to high concentrations (up to 50&#x02009;mM) of the His3 enzyme inhibitor 3-amino-triazole (3-AT).</p><p>In order to gain information on the general or organism-specific nature of the transcriptional moonlighting activity of PAPS reductase, two additional constructs expressing Gal4-DBD-PAPS-red fusions containing the orthologous enzymes from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>N. crassa</italic> were assembled and tested with the TAT assay. As further shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, no growth on histidine-lacking medium containing 10&#x02009;mM 3-AT was observed with the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> PAPS-red fusion, while only a slight growth at the lowest cell dilution and in the presence of the lowest 3-AT concentration (10&#x02009;mM), but no growth in the presence of a higher 3-AT concentration (50&#x02009;mM), were observed with a fusion construct bearing PAPS-red from <italic>N. crassa</italic>. Transactivation capacity, i.e. the ability to functionally replace the activation domain of yeast Gal4 in the recruitment of downstream components of the RNA Pol II transcription apparatus, thus appears to be a most prominent, and perhaps unique feature of the <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> PAPS-red A enzyme, rather than a common property of ascomycete PAPS-reductases.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Autonomous nuclear translocation capacity of <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> PAPS-red A</title><p>In the TAT assay, the Gal4-DBD fusion partner contains the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the yeast Gal4 activator. Furthermore, no putative NLS could be recognized by various signal search programs in the <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> PAPS-red A polypeptide. This raised the possibility that the observed transactivation capacity of the truffle enzyme may reflect, and be due to, forced accumulation into the nuclear compartment in association with the Gal4-DBD, rather than a genuine and physiologically significant nuclear activity.</p><p>We addressed this point with another yeast-based assay, named &#x0201c;nuclear transportation trap&#x0201d; (NTT)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, which measures the ability of a foreign (&#x0201c;query&#x0201d;) polypeptide to drive nuclear accumulation, and thus transcriptional activity, of an NLS-lacking fusion protein comprising the DBD of the bacterial regulator LexA fused to the activation domain of yeast Gal4. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, which compares the NTT assay performance of <italic>Tuber</italic> PAPS-red A with that of <italic>Neurospora</italic> PAPS reductase, both proteins appear to be capable of inducing basal levels of nuclear internalization, sufficient to support yeast growth in the absence of exogenously supplied histidine, under permissive conditions, i.e., at the minimum cell input dilution and in the presence of the lowest concentration (10&#x02009;mM) of the 3-AT inhibitor. However, a considerably higher growth (up to the fourth cell input dilution) under more stringent (100&#x02009;mM 3-AT) selection conditions and a stronger <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter gene signal were produced by the <italic>Tuber</italic> PAPS-red A- compared to the <italic>Neurospora</italic> PAPS-red-containing construct. This suggests that although both proteins contain cryptic nuclear localization signals capable of driving nuclear entry to different extents, considerably higher levels of nuclear internalization, and thus a more sustained reporter gene activation, are supported by <italic>Tuber</italic> PAPS-red A. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, this conclusion is also corroborated by the results of a fluorescence microscopy analysis indicating the dual, cytoplasmic and nuclear, localization of an N-terminal GFP fusion derivative of the <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> PAPS-red A enzyme, compared to the predominantly cytoplasmic localization of the corresponding <italic>Neurospora</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> GFP-PAPS-red fusion proteins.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Transactivation capacity is associated to a transplantable C-terminal polypeptide extension of <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> PAPS-red A</title><p>Having demonstrated the apparently unique transcriptional moonlighting activity of <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> PAPS-red A, we next compared its polypeptide sequence with those of the homologous but transcriptionally inactive enzymes from yeast and <italic>Neurospora</italic>. As shown by the sequence alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, the central portion of the enzyme, including the active site region, is highly conserved, with a minimum sequence similarity of 74%. Instead, fairly divergent N- and C-terminal extensions, ranging in size from 35 to 41 and 17 to 23 amino acids, respectively, are present in the <italic>Tuber</italic> and <italic>Neurospora</italic>, but not in the yeast PAPS reductase.</p><p>To gain insight on the possible functional significance of these sequence extensions, Gal4-DBD and LexA-Gal4-AD fusion derivatives of <italic>Tuber</italic> PAPS-red A lacking either the N-terminal or the C-terminal extension were assembled and tested by the TAT and the NTT assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, deletion of the N-terminal 35 amino acids extension caused a slight impairment of <italic>LacZ</italic> and <italic>HIS3</italic> transactivation capacity, only detectable in the presence of a high 3-AT concentration (<italic>right panel</italic>), whereas a complete loss of transactivation capacity was caused by removal of the C-terminal 23 amino acids extension. In contrast with the marked effect of C-terminal extension deletion on transactivation, only a slightly reduced ability to drive nuclear internalization was revealed by the NTT assay analysis of the C-terminus deletant compared to the N-terminal deletant and to the control construct bearing the full-length PAPS-red A sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). The latter finding suggests that the cryptic NLS associated to PAPS-red A is located in the C-terminal part of the <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> enzyme core region.</p><p>To further validate the transcriptional activation capacity of the <italic>Tuber</italic> PAPS-red A C-terminus, we directly fused the C-terminal 23 amino acids of PAPS-red A to the C-terminus of the Gal4DBD and tested the ability of the resulting chimeric protein to transactivate reporter gene expression. This minimal fusion construct turned out to be transactivation-incompetent, possibly due to the lack of structural constraining by the core region of the full-length PAPS-red A polypeptide. We thus tested the transactivation capacity of the same <italic>Tuber</italic> PAPS-red A C-terminal peptide fused to the core sequence of the transcriptionally inactive <italic>Neurospora</italic> enzyme (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>, this chimeric protein construct (<italic>Nc</italic>N<italic>-Tm</italic>C PAPS-red A) bearing only the last 23 C-terminal amino acids of <italic>Tuber</italic> PAPS-red A, was indeed capable of activating <italic>LacZ</italic> and <italic>HIS3</italic> transcription, also conferring resistance to 50&#x02009;mM 3-AT.</p><p>Altogether the above data -i.e., loss of PAPS-red A transactivation capacity upon C-terminal extension deletion and gain of transcriptional activation function by <italic>Neurospora</italic> PAPS reductase upon transplantation of the PAPS-red A C-terminal peptide- indicate the C-terminal 23 amino acids of <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> PAPS-red A as the key region required for the moonlighting transcription factor activity of this sulfur metabolic enzyme.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Three hydrophilic to hydrophobic amino acid substitutions in the C-terminal peptide extension of PAPS-red A are required for transactivation function</title><p>PAPS-red B also comprises a 23 aa. C-terminal extension, which contains three of the five amino acid substitutions that distinguish this enzyme form from PAPS-red A, all corresponding to hydrophilic (PAPS-red B) to hydrophobic (PAPS-red A) amino acid replacements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). We thus asked whether these amino acid changes might influence transactivation function. To address this question, we converted the three hydrophobic residues of PAPS-red A into the hydrophilic residues present at equivalent positions in PAPS-red B by site-directed mutagenesis. As revealed by the TAT assay data in Fig. 6b, substitution of these three amino acids caused a complete loss of transactivation capacity. This indicates that a specific amino acid sequence motif rather than simply the length of the C-terminal extension is critical for transactivation. This motif consists of an alternation of hydrophilic amino acid residues with stretches of hydrophobic amino acids and is compatible with an amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>).

In this regard, <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> PAPS-red A may resemble some sugar metabolism enzymes (e.g., hexokinase and galactokinase) that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and other yeasts, as well as in higher eukaryotes, have been shown to moonlight, often in a species-specific manner, as non-DNA-binding transcriptional regulators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.</p><p>In keeping with a gene transactivation function of PAPS-red A, is also the fact that as previously observed for many eukaryotic transcriptional activators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,27&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> such function critically depends on a C-terminally located polypeptide region displaying a peculiar alternation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids. Originally identified in the yeast transcriptional activator Gal4 as responsible for interaction with multiple transcription components (e.g., three different subunits of the general transcription factor TFIID, TFIIB, the mediator subunit Gal11, the HAT complexes SAGA and NuA4, plus the chromatin remodeler Swi/Snf<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), this AD sequence feature has subsequently been documented in several eukaryotic transcription factors, where it has been shown to promote interaction with various downstream-acting transcriptional effectors, including chromatin remodeling and HAT-containing complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Transplantability, as observed for the PAPS-red A C-terminal peptide, and lack of stringent structural requirements are additional features of these &#x0201c;simple&#x0201d; (and rather promiscuous) activation domains. Of note, the last 33 amino acids of PAPS-red A, which include its activating C-terminal extension, are predicted to form an &#x003b1;-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,c</xref>) that is only two amino acids apart from the enzyme active site. Furthermore, based on the 3D structure of the orthologous yeast enzyme, this &#x003b1;-helix is predicted to be exposed on the surface of the protein.</p><p>A final question regards the taxonomic rank specificity of PAPS reductase moonlighting activity and its mode of evolution. We have shown that transcriptional activity is not present or extremely weak in the case of the PAPS-red from the ascomycetes <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>N. crassa</italic>, respectively, and that relatively small (easily evolvable) sequence changes can convey such an activity to otherwise transcriptionally inactive PAPS-red enzymes. It is presently not known whether transcriptional moonlighting is associated to PAPS reductase enzymes from closely related <italic>Tuber</italic> species. We note, however, that the PAPS-red C-terminus of the whitish truffle <italic>T. borchii</italic> (accession number AF462035) as well as those of two other truffle species (<italic>T. aestivum</italic> and <italic>T. magnatum</italic>; Pezizomycete Pan-genome consortium, personal communication) more closely resemble the transcriptionally inactive PAPS-red B rather than the PAPS-red A enzyme. Also worth of note is the presence of two PAPS-red genes in <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> but not in any of the other <italic>Tuber</italic> species sequenced so far (Pezizomycete Pan-genome consortium, personal communication). As in other cases of moonlighting protein variants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, acquisition of transcriptional moonlighting activity by <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> PAPS-red A has likely involved a duplication of the gene coding for the non-moonlighting PAPS-red B. What is quite unusual, however, and perhaps more typical of complex eukaryotic genomes, is the fact that the PAPS-red B gene was transcriptionally inactivated via incorporation into a transposon-rich, highly methylated and silenced region of the <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. While transcriptional silencing of the non-moonlighting PAPS-red B gene might be aimed at avoiding cellular competition with the transcriptionally active PAPS-red A enzyme, the specific metabolic advantages conferred by a transcriptional moonlighting PAPS reductase enzyme in a particular truffle species such as <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> remain to be determined.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Functional complementation assay</title><p>To test the catalytic competence of <italic>T. melanosporum</italic> PAPS reductase, full-length PAPS-red A was cloned in the yeast expression plasmid pYX212, transformed into the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mutant strain CC362-2A (<italic>leu2</italic>, <italic>ura3</italic>, <italic>met16</italic>; kindly provided by Yolande Surdin-Kerjan, Laboratoire d&#x02019;enzymologie du CNRS Gif-sur-Yvette, France)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> and tested for its ability to suppress the methionine auxotrophy phenotype of such strain.
