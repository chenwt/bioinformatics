Although a recent high-throughput sequencing (HTS) analysis revealed that this transcription occurs
promiscuously throughout almost the entire genome in 1-cell stage embryos, a detailed investigation of this
process has yet to be conducted using protein-coding genes. Thus, the present study utilized previous RNA
sequencing (RNAseq) data to determine the characteristics and regulatory regions of genes transcribed at the
1-cell stage. While the expression patterns of protein-coding genes of mouse embryos were very different at
the 1-cell stage than at other stages and in various tissues, an analysis for the upstream and downstream
regions of actively expressed genes did not reveal any elements that were specific to 1-cell stage embryos.
Therefore, the unique gene expression pattern observed at the 1-cell stage in mouse embryos appears to be
governed by mechanisms independent of a specific promoter element.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>1-cell embryo</kwd><kwd>Gene expression</kwd><kwd>Preimplantation embryo</kwd><kwd>RNA sequence</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Prior to fertilization, growing oocytes actively transcribe their genes, but this process is discontinued when
they are fully mature [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This transcriptional pause is maintained after
fertilization, and during this transcriptionally silent period, all biological processes are governed by maternal
mRNA that was transcribed and then accumulated during the growth phase of the oocytes [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In mice, the first gene expression from the zygotic genome occurs at the mid-1-cell stage
[<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Transcriptional activity is
low in the initial stages of this process and then gradually increases during the 1- and 2-cell stages [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, a large part of the mRNA in 1-cell stage embryos is maternally
derived and transcribed during oocyte growth.</p><p>Previous studies investigating global gene expression profiles in preimplantation mouse embryos via the use of
microarrays identified genes transcribed at the 2-cell stage and later, but not at the 1-cell stage [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This is likely because, depending on the transcription, there is only a small increase in the amount
of mRNA during the 1-cell stage, and a comparison of the amounts of mRNA in oocytes and 1-cell stage embryos
cannot detect such a small increase. In a recent study, a more quantitative analysis using RNA sequencing (RNAseq)
identified approximately 600 genes that are transcribed at the 1-cell stage by identifying genes that showed a
1.5-fold increase between the oocyte stage and the 1-cell stage [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].
Moreover, we recently found that nascent transcripts are rarely spliced in 1-cell stage embryos, and an analysis
of the parts of the transcripts that were derived from introns revealed approximately 4,000 protein-coding genes
that are transcribed at the 1-cell stage [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, that particular study
was conducted with a global view of transcription in the entire genome, and as a result, the characteristics of
the expression patterns and regulatory regions of the protein-coding genes were not analyzed in detail. Thus, the
present study analyzed the characteristics and regulatory regions of the genes that were transcribed at the 1-cell
stage to further elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression in 1-cell stage embryos.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Analysis of transcriptome data</title><p>An analysis to determine the transcriptomes in metaphase II (MII) stage oocytes and preimplantation embryos

Therefore, the RPKM values for the introns of the genes transcribed in the 1-cell stage
embryos should be considerably higher in 1-cell stage embryos than in MII stage oocytes. By comparing the
intron RPKM values between MII stage oocytes and 1-cell stage embryos, genes transcribed at the 1-cell stage
could be identified even if they were also actively transcribed in oocytes. The genes in the 1-cell stage
embryos for which the RPKM values for the introns were at least 1.5-fold greater than those in MII stage
oocytes were identified; a total of 11,470 genes were transcribed in the 1-cell stage embryos (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jrd/62/1/62_2015-131/_article/supplement">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of gene expression patterns in 1-cell stage embryos</title><p>To examine the regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression at the 1-cell stage, the actively expressed

similarities in the sets of actively expressed genes between the preimplantation embryos and various tissues,
the genes could be roughly classified into three groups. The first group included all tissues, the second
group included embryos at all stages of preimplantation development (except for the 1-cell stage), and the
third group consisted of only 1-cell stage embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Hierarchical clustering of MII oocytes, preimplantation embryos, and 12 different tissues.

was unique.</p><p>The unique gene expression pattern of 1-cell stage embryos may be the result of the active expression of
genes that are either not expressed or expressed at low levels in the majority of tissues and embryos during
other stages and/or the low expression levels of genes that are actively expressed in the majority of tissues
and embryos. An analysis of the actively expressed genes in various adult tissues and preimplantation embryos
indicated that both of these phenomena were associated with the unique pattern of gene expression at the
1-cell stage. An assessment of the actively expressed genes that were unique to a tissue and embryonic stages
revealed that the unique genes comprised approximately 10% of the genes in all tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p> Uniquely expressed genes in preimplantation embryos and tissues.

expressed in more than 80% of the tissues and embryos was generated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jrd/62/1/62_2015-131/_article/supplement">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link>), and the percentages of these genes that
were actively expressed in each tissue and embryo were determined. Although more than 80% of the commonly
active HK genes were indeed actively expressed in all tissues and embryos at and after the 4-cell stage, only
40% of these genes were present in the list of genes actively expressed in 1-cell stage embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p> Commonly expressed housekeeping (HK) genes among MII stage oocytes, preimplantation embryos and

those in all tissues and other stages of embryos except for the 2-cell stage. Taking together the fact that
the percentages of unique genes in the actively expressed genes were distinctly different between the 1- and
2-cell stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2B</xref>), the gene expression pattern at the 1-cell
stage differed significantly from the patterns at the other stages, which suggests that the regulatory
mechanisms were specific to this stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis to determine the regulatory regions of the genes transcribed at the 1-cell stage</title><p>A promoter analysis of the genes actively transcribed at the 1-cell stage was performed to determine the
mechanisms that regulate gene expression during this stage. The GC box, CAAT box, TATA box and Inr in the
proximal and core promoter regions of the actively expressed genes (top 2,000) were analyzed. All elements
were found in similar proportions among the embryos, including 1-cell stage embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p> Analysis of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in the promoters of actively expressed genes

the 1-cell stage, a k-mer analysis (k = 6) was conducted for the 1,000 bp upstream and 200 bp downstream
regions of the TSS of the actively expressed genes. To accomplish this, 6-mer sequences of all possible
combinations (4,096 motifs) were created and aligned to those upstream and downstream regions of the actively
expressed genes. Next, the numbers of genes that were aligned with each sequence at least once in their
upstream and downstream regions were counted, and the sequences were ranked using the numbers of genes; the
top five sequences in each stage of embryonic development and the oocytes and tissues are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig. 5</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_005" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p> The 6-mer sequences found most frequently (top 5) in the upstream and downstream regions in actively

order to characterize gene expression patterns, but use of this value is not appropriate for the analysis of
preimplantation embryos because it represents the relative expression level and, therefore, is not usable when
the total amount of mRNA expressed in a cell differs between samples. Indeed, the total amount of mRNA is
greatly altered during preimplantation development. For instance, the amounts of mRNA have been estimated to be

associated with the corresponding tissue is marked as &#x025cb;, but not associated is &#x000d7;.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>; almost all of the phenotypes were related to the characteristics of the tissues. For example, the
three most frequently observed phenotypes in the adrenal gland were abnormal aldosterone levels, abnormal
adrenal cortex morphology and abnormal thoracic cage morphology. Of these phenotypes, the first two were
evidently related to the function and morphology of the adrenal gland, respectively, and thus the list of
actively expressed genes reflected the characteristics of the tissues. This suggests that the list of actively
expressed genes is useful for characterization of the gene expression patterns in oocytes, preimplantation
embryos and various tissues.</p><p>We found that the gene expression pattern in 1-cell stage embryos is unique. Many genes were actively expressed
in 1-cell stage embryos and were not actively expressed in embryos during any other stage or in any other tissue
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref>), and a large part of the commonly expressed HK genes were
not actively expressed in 1-cell stage embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref>). During the
1-cell stage, intergenic regions are actively expressed, retrotransposons (mainly LINE-1) are explosively
transcribed [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and intergenic regions are widely expressed [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, the mechanisms by which particular genes are specifically expressed do not seem to
function at the 1-cell stage, which appears to cause a genome-wide activation of transcription at this
stage.</p><p>An analysis to determine the regulatory regions of actively expressed genes was unable to identify any promoter
elements or nucleotide sequences that were specific to 1-cell stage embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Figs. 4</xref> and<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005"> 5</xref>), which seems to be consistent with the
findings of a reporter gene assay from a previous study by our group [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
In that study, an original reporter plasmid without a promoter element was evidently transcribed when it was
microinjected into 1-cell stage embryos but not when it was microinjected into oocytes or 2-cell stage embryos.
Subsequently, transcription started from several sites upstream of the reporter gene. In the present study, no
specific promoter elements were identified in the plasmid sequence upstream of the TSS, but there were G/C rich
regions. Thus, although no specific sequences were observed, some transcription factors may have been
involved.</p><p>Our recent study indicated that the GC box is involved in the expression of <italic>Tktl1</italic> in 1-cell
stage embryos [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, it has been shown that the nuclear
concentration of SP1, which is a transcription factor associated with the GC box, increases when transcription
is initiated at the 1-cell stage [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. SP1 binding does not necessarily require a complete GC box consensus sequence because a single
generalized hexamer (GGGCGG) substitution and multiple decamer substitutions (G[T]GGGCGGG(A)G[A]C[T]) are
tolerated, even if binding affinity is decreased [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, SP1 targets various G/C-rich regions in the genome. It was
suggested that the chromatin structure is loosened in 1-cell stage embryos [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which would facilitate SP1 binding to these regions,
albeit with low affinity. Although G/C-rich regions have been identified in 90% of actively expressed genes in
all types of tissue and embryos, as well as 1-cell stage embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig.
4</xref>), enhancers and core promoter elements are required for stable transcription in the presence of a
tight chromatin structure in tissues and embryos after the 1-cell stage.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid (to FA) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports,
