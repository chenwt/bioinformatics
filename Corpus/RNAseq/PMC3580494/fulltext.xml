Recently, a new layer of post-transcriptional expression regulation was revealed that involves competition among transcripts for binding to specific microRNAs (miRNAs; 22 to 25 nucleotide noncoding RNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Negative regulation of mRNA levels by miRNAs appears to be widespread among eukaryotes and involves the recognition and binding of mature miRNAs to miRNA response elements (MREs) that are often located in the 3' untranslated regions of target mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. miRNAs are largely preserved in animal evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and mutations in either MREs or miRNAs have been associated with gene expression changes leading to phenotypic differences (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). While these observations imply that miRNAs have considerable functional importance, their experimental deletion rarely results in overt phenotypes and the effects on gene expression of altered miRNA levels are often only modest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A miRNA can regulate large numbers of transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and target recognition is thought to result in decreased miRNA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Consequently, transcripts can indirectly alter the abundance of other transcripts if they share MREs; transcripts that engage in such post-transcriptional crosstalk have been termed 'competitive endogenous RNAs' (ceRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Several protein-coding transcripts have been shown to act as ceRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The protein-coding and miRNA-mediated roles of mRNAs are not independent: targeting of miRNAs to a transcript's MREs can result in decrease levels of its encoded protein and mRNA abundance will regulate, through competition for miRNAs, the levels of other transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It is this coupling between RNA- and protein-dependent functions of a transcript that renders the biological importance and implications of ceRNAs so difficult to determine. As a result, it has remained unclear whether a transcript's MREs might be sufficiently important for its miRNA decoy function to act autonomously of its protein-coding capability - for example, by conferring robustness to transcriptional networks or by buffering genetic noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Noncoding transcripts have also been shown to function as competitive endogenous RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Whether these noncoding ceRNAs have other functions - for example, with additional transcriptional or chromatin regulation roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] - remains to be established.</p><p>To date, studies have only focused on the post-transcriptional roles of transcribed pseudogenes that share MREs with their duplicated homologous transcripts (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). <italic>PTENP1</italic>, for example, is a processed (that is, retroduplicated) pseudogene that acts as a ceRNA by modulating the expression level of its parental gene <italic>PTEN</italic>, a known tumor suppressor, with which it shares several predicted MREs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Complete or partial deletion of <italic>PTENP1 </italic>occurs in several human tumors and is associated with decreased expression of <italic>PTEN</italic>, which in turn is expected to result in cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. <italic>PTENP1</italic>, and other transcribed pseudogenized gene duplicates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], provide important insights into the origin of new competitive endogenous RNAs by gene duplication that establish indirect transcript-transcript interactions between homologous, including parent-retroduplicated, gene pairs. Nevertheless, because most ceRNA networks will involve crosstalk between multiple, often non-homologous, transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], we have as yet little information on the relative importance of miRNA-mediated roles of mRNAs - for example, whether these are subordinate to their presumed primary, often protein-coding, functions. Only by addressing this question will we be able to understand fully the contribution of such post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms to animal transcriptional regulation.</p><p>To separate the RNA- from the protein-mediated actions of mRNAs, we identified genes that each lost their role as a protein-coding message in the rodent lineage (including mice and rats), and compared them to their human orthologs that each retained protein-coding capability; these are termed unitary pseudogenes. In contrast to the high number of duplicated and retroduplicated pseudogenes (of which <italic>PTENP1 </italic>is an example) in mammalian genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], unitary pseudogenes are rare. Unitary pseudogenes derive from the lineage-specific acquisition of disrupting mutations in the coding sequences of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Some pseudogenes have been observed to be transcribed and can function as RNAs, and thus might be considered to be <italic>bona fide </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Investigations of transcribed unitary pseudogenes allow us to dissect their miRNA-mediated roles away from their ancestral protein-coding functions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). In-so-doing, we are able to consider whether these noncoding roles have been conserved between humans and rodents since they last shared a common protein-coding ancestor approximately 90 million years ago. Conservation of ancestral post-transcriptional miRNA decoy functions would imply that the miRNA-mediated interactions between transcripts are biologically relevant, linking, for example, functionally related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] or serving as a post-transcriptional buffer of gene expression.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of rodent-specific unitary pseudogenes</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>Evolution of rodent-specific pseudogenized bifunctional transcripts.

We performed exhaustive 6-frame translated pairwise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] alignments between the 758 human polypeptide templates and their regions of conserved synteny (extended by 5 kb upstream and downstream) in the mouse and rat genomes and that of dog (used as an out-group) to identify mammalian protein-coding genes that were lost specifically in mouse and rat (that is, rodent-specific unitary pseudogenes). In the three species, we classified the sequence corresponding to the best alignment either as a unitary pseudogene or else as a conserved gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Using this approach we predicted 48 human protein-coding genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) that have conserved their protein-coding potential in dog and that are unitary pseudogenes in mouse and rat. Predictions were visually inspected to ensure that: 1) frame-shifting indels or premature stop codon mutations were specific to both rodents; and 2) chromosomal gene order for genes immediately upstream and downstream of the lineage-specific unitary pseudogene was conserved in all four species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>The 48 rodent-specific unitary pseudogenes are comparable in number to primate unitary pseudogenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], suggesting that proteins are lost at similar rates in the rodent and primate lineages. The human carboxypeptidase O (<italic>CPO</italic>) gene is one example whose mouse or rat ortholog is a unitary pseudogene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c, d</xref>). It maps to an unannotated region of the mouse genome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>) whose pairwise human-mouse alignment reveals two disabling mutations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) that are predicted to result in a truncated open reading frame in the rodent <italic>CPO </italic>orthologous sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcribed mouse unitary pseudogenes do not encode conserved peptides</title><p>We used publicly available RNAseq data across six adult mouse tissues to identify rodent-specific unitary pseudogenes that are transcribed in these mouse tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].

We then validated the expression of 16 of these 17 unitary pseudogenes using a second RNAseq dataset that includes data from 19 mouse tissues/cells and that has a higher sequencing depth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The failure to validate expression of the seventeenth unitary pseudogene (<italic>LCNL1</italic>) may reflect this transcript's relatively low expression level.

The median score associated with codon substitution frequencies between mouse and rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] for unitary pseudogene transcripts was found to be -16.1, which is smaller than zero, as expected for noncoding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and substantially smaller than the corresponding score (25.4) for 1,000 randomly selected protein-coding gene transcript fragments matched in size to the unitary pseudogene transcripts (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-16</sup>, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). The nucleotide substitution pattern between mouse and rat indicates that these transcribed unitary pseudogenes are unlikely to encode a conserved protein. We next estimated the coding potential of mouse unitary pseudogene transcripts using CPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], which considers the length of putative open reading frames and their homology to known mammalian proteins. Only 3 out of the 97 transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides were annotated as coding. As expected, the putative open reading frames in these transcripts are homologous but incomplete due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations to the protein-coding ortholog in humans. Furthermore, the fraction of unitary pseudogene transcripts annotated as coding is over 20 times smaller than found for 1,000 randomly selected protein-coding transcript fragments with matching size, a highly significant difference (656/1,000, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-4</sup>, two-tailed Fisher's exact test). These findings indicate the 17 transcribed unitary pseudogenes are unlikely to have retained their protein-coding capacity.</p></sec><sec><title>miRNA decoy functions are preserved after loss of protein-coding potential</title><p>We next compared the expression level (FPKM values; total number of fragments per kilobase of sequence per million reads mapped) and tissue specificity (maxT<italic><sub>S</sub></italic>) between unitary transcribed pseudogenes and protein-coding genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>; Materials and methods) across six adult mouse tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The median expression of transcribed unitary transcripts (median FPKM = 0.56; Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>) is significantly lower than that of protein-coding genes (median FPKM = 2.91, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-4</sup>, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test; Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>). In contrast, mouse unitary pseudogenes are as ubiquitously expressed in adult mice (Materials and methods) as protein-coding genes (median maxT<italic><sub>S </sub></italic>= 0.26 and 0.28, respectively; <italic>P </italic>= 0.42, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test; Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>).</p><p>If a transcribed mouse unitary pseudogene has maintained the decoy roles of its protein-coding ancestral transcript (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>), one expects that its tissue expression profile would be conserved and thus shared with its protein-coding human ortholog. Indeed, we found (see Materials and methods) that these 17 mouse unitary pseudogene-human gene ortholog pairs are more highly correlated (median Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.20) than randomly sampled pairs of protein-coding genes (median Pearson correlation coefficient = 0; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>) in their expression profiles. This implies that the relative expression levels of these unitary pseudogene transcripts, across the adult tissues we tested, were preserved, at least in part, after loss of protein coding capability.</p><p>We then looked for the conservation of post-transcriptional regulatory networks involving the mouse unitary pseudogene or its human protein-coding gene ortholog. To do this, we asked whether a gene pair whose tissue expression values are significantly positively correlated in mouse are also significantly positively correlated in their expression in human. For a mouse gene, <italic>M<sub>i</sub></italic>, we identified a set of mouse genes, <italic>m</italic>, whose expression is significantly correlated (empirical <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05) with <italic>M<sub>i</sub></italic>. Similarly, for the human one-to-one orthologous gene, <italic>H<sub>i</sub></italic>, of mouse <italic>M<sub>i</sub></italic>, we identified the set of human genes, <italic>h</italic>, whose expression is significantly correlated with <italic>H<sub>i</sub></italic>'s expression values.

This analysis provides evidence, albeit at lower levels than for mouse-human protein-coding pairs, for the conservation of expression for orthologous mouse unitary pseudogene-human gene pairs. The conservation of their expression patterns is likely due to the preservation of their ancestral regulatory elements. We hypothesized that this conservation reflects, at least in part, the preservation of post-transcriptional networks involving these rodent-specific unitary pseudogene transcripts after the loss of their ancestral protein-coding capability (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Conserved genetic interactions of transcribed unitary pseudogenes</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>We estimated the correlation in expression between orthologous mouse (green) or human (blue) loci (<italic>M<sub>i </sub></italic>and <italic>H<sub>i</sub></italic>, respectively, ovals) and other protein-coding genes (rectangles) annotated in mouse or human genomes.

However, it has remained unclear whether a transcript's role as a miRNA 'decoy' is crucial for either its molecular or organismal function, or whether the biological importance of the decoy role is marginal, owing to the promiscuity of miRNA-binding. To address this issue, we considered 48 rodent-specific unitary pseudogenes that have lost their protein-coding capability during rodent evolution. Consistent with previous reports, a substantial fraction of unitary pseudogenes are expressed despite apparently lacking an open reading frame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The loss of an open reading frame implies that such rodent-specific unitary pseudogenes no longer encode a functional protein and that, if transcribed, conservation of their transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms is independent of their ancestral coding function. We have shown that despite their loss of protein-coding potential, the ancestral tissue expression patterns and gene expression levels show tendencies to be retained in the rodent transcribed unitary pseudogenes. We have presented evidence that the preservation of ancestral post-transcriptional networks is due, at least in part, to the retention of MREs within competitive endogenous RNA transcripts.</p><p>Our analysis of naturally occurring hypomorphs (namely, unitary pseudogenes) has allowed us to infer the relative importance of non-protein to protein encoded functions of a set of mRNAs. For human orthologs of 17 rodent transcribed unitary pseudogenes we have provided evidence that their miRNA decoy functions are unlikely to be subordinate to their protein-coding functions. We tested and validated this prediction using <italic>BCAS4</italic>, an exemplar of one such transcribed unitary pseudogenes. Instead, it appears that the post-transcriptional regulatory roles of some loci can outlive their protein-coding functions, and are sufficiently important for selection against deleterious mutations to maintain their transcription.</p><p>Transcription of duplicated and unitary pseudogenes in eukaryotes has been previously proposed to argue for their functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. A few anecdotal examples have demonstrated that new noncoding functions can arise from pseudogenized protein-coding loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. A well-known example of such loci is <italic>Xist</italic>, which arose in eutherians by pseudogenization of a pre-existing protein-coding gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and is essential for X-chromosomal inactivation in early developmental stages in mammalian females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. These unitary pseudogenes appear to retain the functions, namely their post-transcriptional miRNA-dependent roles, of their orthologous protein-coding ancestors. It remains unknown whether transcribed pseudogenes more frequently evolve new functions, or retain, at least in part, their preexisting functions. Similar questions have been asked of the evolution of duplicated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], although the lack of duplication of these transcribed unitary pseudogenes has clearly prohibited the partitioning of both ancestral functions.</p><p>Our conclusions are based on the analysis of unitary pseudogenes that arose in the common ancestor of rodents. We note that unitary pseudogenes in other mammalian lineages have also been shown to be often transcribed and that crosstalk between transcripts that share MREs has been described in diverse eukaryotic lineages. Consequently, we hypothesize that transcription of expressed unitary pseudogenes led to the preservation of auxiliary post-transcriptional regulatory roles of bifunctional mRNAs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Annotation of unitary pseudogenes in mouse</title><p>Transmap annotations of human mRNAs in the mouse, rat and dog genomes were downloaded from UCSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].
