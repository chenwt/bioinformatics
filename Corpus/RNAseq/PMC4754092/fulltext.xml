Although the current adjuvant treatment modalities may improve survival for some colon adenocarcinoma patients to a certain extent, others benefit little [<xref rid="b1-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Moreover, recently accumulated evidence indicates that colon adenocarcinoma is a genetically heterogeneous and complicated disease caused by abnormalities in gene structure and/or expression [<xref rid="b2-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to identify novel biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic potentials in colon adenocarcinoma and to develop new targeted therapy.</p><p>Recently, MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have become a focus in cancer research. miRNAs are a class of endogenous, small, noncoding RNA molecules (18&#x02013;25 nucleotides), able to repress protein translation by binding to the target mRNAs [<xref rid="b3-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. miRNAs have critical regulatory roles in several basic cellular processes, such as differentiation and proliferation, which may affect some major biological systems, like cancer [<xref rid="b4-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, miRNAs can target up to hundreds of mRNAs, which makes them very powerful regulators. Aberrant miRNA expression can disturb a multitude of cell signaling pathways and profoundly influence cancer onset and progression. Changes in the expression of miRNAs have been observed in a variety of human tumors, including colon adenocarcinoma [<xref rid="b5-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Currently, there are 2 major approaches applied to explore the relationships between miRNAs and colon adenocarcinoma. One is that miRNAs can regulate many known oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways involved in the pathogenesis of colon adenocarcinoma. For example, p53, a well-known tumor suppressor gene, has been found to be mutated in about 40&#x02013;50% of colon adenocarcinoma [<xref rid="b6-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recent studies have proved there are important connections between miRNAs and p53 [<xref rid="b7-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The other is that expression profiles of various miRNAs may show potentials as biomarkers for prediction of prognosis and a distinction of certain diseases, including colon adenocarcinoma. It was reported that patients with overexpressed miR-21 have worse survival prognosis for stage II or stage III colon adenocarcinoma [<xref rid="b5-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b8-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we analyzed the expression data of miRNAs of colon adenocarcinoma in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and screened the differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and their target genes (DEGs). Through constructing a regulation network of miRNA-gene by Cytoscape, we hoped to discover new biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic potentials and contribute to the diagnosis and therapy of colon adenocarcinoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>miRNA data</title><p>The colorectal adenocarcinoma miRNASeq and level 3 RNAseq data were downloaded from the TCGA database. There were a total of 228 samples, including 220 colon adenocarcinoma and 8 normal samples; these data were classified into 2 cohorts.

All these comments results coincided with that of the KEGG pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Analysis of miRNA-Gene regulatory network for colon adenocarcinoma</title><p>A miRNA-Gene regulatory interaction network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-medscimonit-22-460">Figure 4</xref>) consisting of differentially expressed genes was eventually constructed after the data in IntAct and Reactome database were merged. The network contained a total of 107 nodes and 153 pairs of interaction relationships. The nodes contained a total of 47 miRNAs and 60 cancer-related genes, wherein 32 cancer genes were associated with colon adenocarcinoma or colorectal cancer. In this regulatory interaction network, 63 nodes were up-regulated (red) and 44 were down-regulated (green).</p><p>In a network, the nodes often connected to many peripheral nodes were referred to as hub nodes. In the miRNA-gene network of colon adenocarcinoma, sorted according to the descending number of connections, the top 10% of nodes were IGF1, ESR1, NR3C1, PGR, MMP1, F2, CXCL12, MMP3, hsa-mir-590, FGFR2, IGF2, and GFRA1. IGF1, ESR1, MMP1, F2, CXCL12, MMP3, IGF2 had already been identified as colon adenocarcinoma-related genes. Although NR3C1and PGR were not annotated to be colon adenocarcinoma-related genes, they were also associated with other cancers, and their statuses in connection with other genes were second only to IGF1 and ESR1. Therefore, we speculated that these 2 genes had significant relationships with colon adenocarcinoma.</p><p>Five network clusters with many miRNAs regulating the target genes collectively were obtained by network cluster analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-medscimonit-22-460">Figure 5</xref>), involving a total of 8 miRNAs, including hsa-mir-454, hsa-mir-19b-1, hsa-mir-19b-2, hsa-mir-590, hsa-mir-18a, hsa-mir-148a, hsa- mir-301a, and hsa-mir-26b. NR3C1 combined with IGF1 and ESR1 were regulated by hsa-mir-590 and hsa-mir-18a collectively, indicating that NR3C1 may be also associated with colon adenocarcinoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>ROC analysis</title><p>The ROC analysis of 8 miRNAs that synergistically regulated colon adenocarcinoma-related genes showed they were suitable to be used as bio-molecular markers to distinguish tumor and normal samples.

GO annotation and KEGG pathway analysis showed these target genes were mainly enriched in ion, especially calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) transportation. Ca<sup>2+</sup> can regulate various cellular processes through activating or inhibiting cellular signaling pathways and many Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated signaling pathways are involved in tumorigenesis, such as invasion and metastasis [<xref rid="b18-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It was reported the aberrant expression of some Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels or pumps may be associated with tumorigenesis. For example, TRPM8 is over-expressed in prostate cancer while SERCA3 is down-regulated in colon adenocarcinoma [<xref rid="b19-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Considering the ability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling to regulate pathways like proliferation or apoptosis, alteration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels or pumps in cancers may be considered as therapeutic targets. Furthermore, many pharmacological agents can modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and pumps; thus, they are regarded as druggable. Previous studies also found that changes in the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump SERCA3 were extensively characterized in colon adenocarcinoma [<xref rid="b20-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump or the genes regulating them could serve as anticancer therapeutic targets for colon adenocarcinoma.</p><p>In the constructed miRNA-gene network, several genes, including IGF1, ESR1, MMP1, and F2, were already known as colon adenocarcinoma-related genes. For example, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is one of the factors contributing to the increased risk in colon cancer [<xref rid="b22-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. IGF-1 can activate many signaling pathways involved in carcinogenesis, such as PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and STAT3 [<xref rid="b23-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Inhibition of these pathways may have preventive and therapeutic potential. Estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1) was also shown to increase colon cancer cell proliferation and increase cancer incidence. Although NR3C1and PGR genes were not annotated to be colon adenocarcinoma-related, they were associated with other cancers. The nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1 (NR3C1) is a gene that exists in the cytoplasm in a multiprotein complex, and it can encode glucocorticoid receptor. The expression level of NR3C1 was an important factor for glucocorticoid sensitivity [<xref rid="b24-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Evidence shows that NR3C1 displayed methylation in carcinomas and some adenomas, and it was identified as a novel target gene inactivated by promoter hypermethylation during colorectal cancer development, indicating it may appear occasionally in the early events in colorectal cancer development [<xref rid="b25-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. PGR (progesterone receptor) status was also shown to exert a significant impact on prognosis of ER+/HER2&#x02013; breast cancer [<xref rid="b26-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It was found that PGR positivity correlated with response to tamoxifen therapy, both in the adjuvant setting and metastatic setting. Thus, the PGR status could serve as an independent predictive factor for survival [<xref rid="b27-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b29-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition, NR3C1and PGR statuses in connection to other genes were second only to IGF1 and ESR1. Therefore, we speculated that these 2 genes may also have significant relationships with colon adenocarcinoma.</p><p>Finally, we obtained 8 miRNAs (hsa-mir-454, hsa-mir-19b-1, hsa-mir-19b-2, hsa-mir-590, hsa-mir-18a, hsa-mir-148a, hsa-mir-301a, and hsa-mir-26b) regulating colon adenocarcinoma-related genes and they may be considered as biomarkers for distinguishing colon tumor samples and normal samples. miR-590 was found to be a complement region of RhoB gene [<xref rid="b30-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. RhoB is known to show tumor suppressor activity, and its down-regulation was related to many changes, such as migration and adhesion in aggressive tumors. Studies indicated that RhoB could be considered as an important target for miR-590 in regulating cell proliferation and invasion in colorectal cancer [<xref rid="b31-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. He et al. reported that in clinical colorectal cancers, the expression level of miR-17-92 was up-regulated in 15% of tested samples and showed 4-fold up-regulation of the corresponding normal tissues [<xref rid="b32-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Moreover, it was demonstrated that patients with high expression of miR-18a tended to have a poorer prognosis than patients with expression group [<xref rid="b33-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, the expression of miR-18a was believed to be a prognostic factor for predicting survival of colorectal cancer patients. As in the expression of miR-18a, metastatic lymph node ratio is also an important prognostic factor of colorectal cancer patients. Expression of miR-18a at metastatic lymph nodes may decrease the prognosis [<xref rid="b34-medscimonit-22-460" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Moreover, NR3C1combined with IGF1and ESR1 were all regulated by hsa-mir-590 and hsa-mir-18a, further indicating that NR3C1 was related to colon adenocarcinoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We successfully constructed a miRNA-Gene regulatory network, which involved 60 cancer-related genes and 47 miRNAs.
