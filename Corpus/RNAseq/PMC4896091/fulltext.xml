id="P2">The liver X receptors (LXRs) are transcriptional regulators of cellular and systemic cholesterol homeostasis. In the setting of cholesterol excess, LXR activation induces the expression of a battery of genes involved in cholesterol efflux <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, facilities cholesterol esterification by promoting fatty acid synthesis <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, and inhibits cholesterol uptake by the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. The fact that sterol content is maintained in a narrow range in most cell types and in the organism as a whole suggests that extensive crosstalk between regulatory pathways must exist. However, the molecular mechanisms that integrate LXRs with other lipid metabolic pathways, are incompletely understood. Here we show that ligand activation of LXRs in liver not only promotes cholesterol efflux, but also simultaneously inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis. We further identify the long non-coding RNA <italic>LeXis</italic> as one mediator of this effect. Hepatic <italic>LeXis</italic> expression is robustly induced in response to western diet feeding or pharmacologic LXR activation. Raising or lowering the levels of <italic>LeXis</italic> in liver affects the expression of cholesterol biosynthetic genes, and the levels of cholesterol in the liver and plasma. <italic>LeXis</italic> interacts with and affects the DNA interactions of Raly, a heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein that is required for the maximal expression of cholesterologenic genes in mouse liver. These studies outline a regulatory role for a non-coding RNA in lipid metabolism and advance our understanding of the mechanisms orchestrating sterol homeostasis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">It is well established that the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is downregulated under conditions where sterols are abundant through the inhibition of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) processing<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Interestingly, however, under conditions where hepatic cholesterol content was not enriched, activation of LXR with the selective synthetic agonist GW3965 also acutely suppressed the expression of sterol synthesis genes in mouse liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended data Fig. 1a</xref>). The effect could not be explained by changes in intracellular cholesterol levels, as LXR activation has been shown to lower hepatic cholesterol content <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, which would lead to up-regulation of the SREBP-2 pathway.</p><p id="P4">To investigate the mechanism by which LXRs suppress cholesterol biosynthesis, we performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling on primary mouse hepatocytes treated with vehicle or GW3965 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended data Fig. 1b</xref>). The most robustly induced gene in our RNA-sequencing analysis was a predicted noncoding RNA annotated as 4930412L05Rik (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended data Fig. 1c</xref>). Parallel profiling of noncoding and protein-coding transcripts using microarrays also identified 4930412L05Rik as the highest induced transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended data Fig. 1d</xref>). We named this transcript <italic>LeXis</italic> (Liver-expressed LXR-induced sequence). Interestingly, the <italic>LeXis</italic> gene locus lies in close proximity to the canonical LXR target gene <italic>Abca1</italic> in mouse. Analysis of chromatin structure from ENCODE <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> indicated that <italic>LeXis</italic> and <italic>Abca1</italic> were distinct genes with separate promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). We defined the transcripts produced from the <italic>LeXis</italic> gene using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended data Fig. 2</xref>). <italic>LeXis</italic> and <italic>Abca1</italic> were induced by LXR (GW3965) and RXR (LG268) agonists in primary hepatocytes in an LXR-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Fig. 3a</xref>). <italic>LeXis</italic> was induced in LXR&#x003b1;&#x02212;/&#x02212; and LXR&#x003b2;&#x02212;/&#x02212; hepatocytes, indicating that both LXR isotypes are capable of regulating <italic>LeXis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Fig. 3b</xref>). Induction of <italic>LeXis</italic> was not sensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, and was not dependent on SREBPs, since 25-hydroxycholesterol (which blocks SREBP processing) also induced <italic>LeXis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Fig. 3c and 3d</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Administration of GW3965 to mice induced the expression of <italic>LeXis</italic> in multiple metabolically-active tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Fig. 3e</xref>). We also observed a prominent, LXR-dependent induction of <italic>LeXis</italic> expression in response to western diet feeding, consistent with a potential role for <italic>LeXis</italic> in the response to cholesterol excess (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Despite being physically adjacent, the <italic>LeXis</italic> and <italic>Abca1</italic> loci are regulated independently. <italic>LeXis</italic> was neither expressed at baseline nor induced by LXR in peritoneal macrophages, a cell type in which <italic>Abca1</italic> expression is prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). A luciferase reporter containing the <italic>LeXis</italic> promoter was induced by LXR/RXR in cotransfection assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Fig. 3f</xref>), and we identified an LXR-response element within the <italic>LeXis</italic> promoter region that was bound by LXR&#x003b1; in ChIP-qPCR assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Fig. 3g</xref>). The Coding Potential Calculator (CPC) and Coding Non-Coding Index (CNCI) algorithms predict low coding potential of <italic>LeXis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Fig. 3h,i</xref>). In addition, we found no evidence of production of a protein product from <italic>LeXis</italic> using <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription-translation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Fig. 3j</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To explore the function of <italic>LeXis in vivo</italic>, we transduced mice with adenoviral vectors encoding GFP control or <italic>LeXis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended data Fig. 4a</xref>). Remarkably, <italic>LeXis</italic> expression decreased serum cholesterol, but not triglycerides, in chow-fed C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). No differences in liver function tests were observed between the two groups, and there was no evidence of ER stress or inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended data Fig. 4b,c</xref>). Fractionation of lipoproteins revealed reduced cholesterol in both the LDL and HDL fractions in <italic>LeXis</italic>-expressing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The effects of <italic>LeXis</italic> were distinct from the consequences of hepatic expression other LXR target genes, such as <italic>Abca1</italic> and <italic>Idol</italic>, which raise serum cholesterol<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Unbiased pathway analysis of global gene expression revealed that the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway was strongly downregulated in <italic>LeXis</italic>-transduced livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended data Fig. 4d</xref>). These results were validated by real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). These results suggested that the cholesterol lowering effects of <italic>LeXis</italic> were due, at least in part, to suppression of cholesterol biosynthesis. Consistent with this interpretation, we observed a strong trend towards lower cholesterol content in the livers of mice overexpressing <italic>LeXis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended data Fig. 4e</xref>). For reasons that are not yet clear, treatment of isolated primary hepatocytes did not faithfully reflect the effects of either LXR agonist treatment or <italic>LeXis</italic> expression on genes linked to sterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended data Fig. 4f,g</xref>).</p><p id="P8">A reduction in plasma cholesterol suggests an increase in lipoprotein clearance or a decrease in sterol production<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. To assess the contribution of LDLR to the actions of <italic>LeXis</italic>, we transduced <italic>Ldlr</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice with control or <italic>LeXis</italic>&#x02013;expressing adenovirus. We observed decreases in plasma cholesterol levels and hepatic cholesterol content in response to <italic>LeXis</italic> in <italic>Ldlr</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, suggesting that the Ldlr is not required for <italic>LeXis</italic> effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended data Fig. 4h, i</xref>). To assess the contribution of Srebp-2 signaling to LXR-mediated inhibition of cholesterologenesis, we administered GW3965 to control or liver-specific Scap knockout mice (L-Scap KO)<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Consistent with previous studies <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, GW3965 treatment did not alter serum cholesterol levels in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Surprisingly, however, GW3965 increased serum cholesterol levels in L-Scap KO mice, suggesting the loss of a suppressive effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f and 2g</xref>). LXR target genes, including <italic>LeXis</italic> itself, were induced by GW3965 in both groups; however, the suppression of steroidogenic genes was abrogated in L-Scap KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended data Fig. 4j</xref>). Furthermore, expression of <italic>LeXis</italic> also failed to lower serum cholesterol or to suppress cholesterogenic gene expression in L-Scap KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">extended data Fig. 4k</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To address the role of <italic>LeXis</italic> in the setting of dietary cholesterol challenge, we used adenoviral vectors to express shRNA constructs targeting <italic>LeXis</italic> in mouse liver<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Knockdown of <italic>LeXis</italic> with either of two different shRNA constructs increased serum HDL cholesterol levels in mice fed a western diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended data Fig. 5a&#x02013;d</xref>). There was also an increase in liver cholesterol content in shLeXis-transduced mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended data Fig. 5e</xref>). Gene expression analysis revealed increased expression of a number of cholesterol biosynthetic genes in response to <italic>LeXis</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended data Fig. 5f</xref>). Similar effects of <italic>LeXis</italic> knockdown were observed in mice treated with GW3965 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended data Fig. 5g,h</xref>). There was no consistent evidence of ER stress or inflammation in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended data Figs. 5i,j,k</xref>).</p><p id="P10">As a complementary acute loss-of-function approach, we utilized antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to target <italic>LeXis</italic> expression<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Three different ASOs that potently blocked hepatic <italic>LeXis</italic>, but not saline or non-targeting ASO controls, increased serum cholesterol levels in the setting of LXR activation, with no evidence of hepatotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended data Figs. 5l,m</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>LeXis</italic> ASO administration increased cholesterogenic gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We generated <italic>LeXis</italic>-deficient mice to determine the consequences of chronic loss of <italic>LeXis</italic> function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended data Fig. 6a&#x02013;6c</xref>). Although serum cholesterol levels in <italic>LeXis</italic>-deficient mice in the setting of LXR activation were not different from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), the expression of sterol synthesis genes in the liver was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>LeXis</italic>-null mice had increased hepatic cholesterol content when challenged with western diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Gross and histologic examination of livers from <italic>LeXis</italic>-deficient mice null mice showed changes consistent with lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g and 3h</xref>). In contrast to the acute LXR agonist studies above, gene expression analysis of <italic>LeXis</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice maintained on western diet showed a trend toward decreased sterol synthetic gene expression, likely reflecting the marked increased hepatic cholesterol content in this setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended data Fig. 6d</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To begin to understand how <italic>LeXis</italic> was influencing hepatic metabolism, we analyzed its subcellular localization. <italic>LeXis</italic> was almost exclusively located in the insoluble nuclear pellet in fractionation studies, along with the known nuclear lncRNAs <italic>XIST</italic> and histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Single molecule RNA fluorescence <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridization with <italic>LeXis</italic>-specific probes further confirmed its nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Its presence in the nucleus suggested that <italic>LeXis</italic> might influence, and therefore we tested its ability to impact RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. Expression of <italic>LeXis</italic> in mouse liver reduced RNA polymerase II engagement at the promoters of <italic>Srebf2</italic> and its target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Prior work has shown that nuclear lncRNAs can affect transcription by modifying the recruitment of proteins to chromatin <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. We used an unbiased lncRNA:chromatin affinity capture technique to pulldown <italic>LeXis</italic> from mouse liver and identify interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended data Fig. 7a</xref>) <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Analysis of the <italic>LeXis</italic> interactome by mass spectrometry identified the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein Raly <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> as a binding partner. Similar to <italic>LeXis</italic>, Raly was located in the nuclear pellet (chromatin) fraction of hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended data Fig. 7b</xref>). Moreover, an antibody to Raly retrieved <italic>LeXis</italic> in co-immunoprecipitation studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended data Fig. 7c,d</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Raly contains both an RNA-binding domain and a leucine-zipper coiled domain, suggesting it may act as a regulatory factor <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, prior unbiased analysis of gene coexpression networks has identified <italic>Srebf2</italic> as one of the top genes positively coregulated with Raly <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Other studies have shown direct binding of Srebp-2 at the Raly promoter <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Unbiased protein homology analysis revealed extensive structural conservation between Raly and RNA Binding Protein 14 (also known as CoAA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">extended data Fig. 7e</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, a known steroid receptor coactivator <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. This led us to hypothesize that Raly may act as transcriptional cofactor for genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. In line with this idea, adenovirus-mediated knockdown of Raly in mouse liver reduced serum cholesterol, mimicking the effect of <italic>LeXis</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended data Fig. 7f</xref>). This effect was correlated with reduced expression of <italic>Srebf2</italic> and its target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended data Fig. 7g</xref>). Unbiased gene expression profiling of liver revealed that Raly knockdown preferentially affected cholesterol biosynthetic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended data Fig. 8a,b</xref>). The effects of Raly were independent of LDLR expression, since they were preserved in <italic>Ldlr</italic>-null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended data Fig. 9a,b</xref>). The actions of <italic>LeXis in vivo</italic> were dependent on Raly, since the ability of <italic>LeXis</italic> to alter serum cholesterol levels and hepatic gene expression was impaired in the setting of Raly knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">extended data Fig. 9c</xref>). Finally, ChIP-qPCR analysis of mouse liver revealed that Raly associated with cholesterol biosynthetic gene promoters, and that Raly occupancy was reduced in the setting of <italic>LeXis</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended data Fig. 9d</xref>).</p><p id="P15">This work identifies the non-coding RNA <italic>LeXis</italic> as additional mediator of the complex effects of LXR signaling on hepatic lipid metabolism. Our data suggest that <italic>LeXis</italic> contributes to the ability of LXRs to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. It is important to acknowledge, however, that the involvement of additional pathways in this crosstalk is not excluded by the present work. The demonstration that <italic>LeXis</italic> expression is responsive to dietary cues and can modulate physiologic pathways with links to common diseases expands our understanding of the regulatory potential of non-coding RNA. Interestingly, the consequences of acute and chronic loss of <italic>LeXis</italic> expression are only partially overlapping, perhaps reflecting compensation in the setting of developmental deletion <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P16">Although the rapid sequence evolution of lncRNAs presents a challenge to identifying functional counterparts between species <sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, Batch Coordinate Conversion between mouse and human assemblies revealed moderate conservation of the <italic>LeXis</italic> genomic sequence in a region adjacent to the human <italic>ABCA1</italic> gene. An annotated putative lncRNA (TCONS 16452) in this region was robustly induced by LXR activation in human hepatocyte cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended data Fig. 10</xref>).
