To identify novel ncRNAs that may identify key pathways in breast cancer development, we performed high-throughput transcript profiling of tumor and normal matched-pair tissue samples. Initial transcriptome profiling using high-density genome-wide tiling arrays revealed changes in over 200 novel candidate genomic regions that map to intronic regions. Sixteen genomic loci were identified that map to the long introns of five key protein-coding genes, CRIM1, EPAS1, ZEB2, RBMS1, and RFX2. Consistent with the known role of the tumor suppressor ZEB2 in the cancer-associated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization reveals that the intronic regions deriving from ZEB2 as well as those from RFX2 and EPAS1 are down-regulated in cells of epithelial morphology, suggesting that these regions may be important for maintaining normal epithelial cell morphology. Paired-end deep sequencing analysis reveals a large number of distinct genomic clusters with no coding potential within the introns of these genes. These novel transcripts are only transcribed from the coding strand. A comprehensive search for breast cancer associated genes reveals enrichment for transcribed intronic regions from these loci, pointing to an underappreciated role of introns or mechanisms relating to their biology in EMT and breast cancer.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work was supported by American Cancer Society [RSG-09-054-01 to BJ] - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.org/">www.cancer.org/</ext-link>, Magee-Womens foundation [0027467 to BJ] - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mwrif.org">www.mwrif.org</ext-link>; and National Institutes of Health [GM079756 to BJ] - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov">www.nih.gov</ext-link>.

While many important classes of non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been identified, ranging from small RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) to long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], to extraordinarily long ncRNAs such as the 108 kb <italic>Air</italic> transcript [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the functions of most ncRNAs remain unknown [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>One approach to discover important RNAs is to identify those that are dysregulated in diseases. While genes can associate with a disease as a side-effect of an aberrant mechanism, minimally, the identification of disease-associated RNAs can lead to the discovery of new molecular mechanisms that can aid in the diagnosis or prognosis of the disease, and sometimes lead to a therapeutic path [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, transcriptome sequencing in cancer tissues has led to the discovery of novel ncRNAs such as PCAT-1, a specific regulator of cell proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and chimeric, cancer-associated RNAs [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Breast cancer treatment has been revolutionized in the recent decades with the use of individual biomarkers such as ER&#x003b1; and HER2/neu [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Gene expression profiling studies in the past decade have also led to the development of multi-gene biomarkers [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] such as MammaPrint, a 70 gene diagnostic test used to evaluate whether patients would benefit from chemotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition to the clinically established biomarkers that are all based on protein-coding genes, several new promising candidate biomarkers have been found to correlate with breast cancer. Dozens of lncRNAs from the HOX gene cluster were recently found to have reduced expression in breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], while other HOX lncRNAs were detected in primary tumors but not in metastatic breast cancer. The metastasis-associated HOTAIR, a 2.2 kb long intergenic ncRNA, is overexpressed in metastases, and its high level of expression in primary breast tumors is a predictor of metastasis and death [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These results may lead to the identification of new biomarkers, better understanding of molecular classification of breast cancer sub-types [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>To identify biomarkers for breast cancer, we conducted an unbiased screen of the human transcriptome. We used GTAs for genome-wide expression profiling to identify genes that were altered in cancer versus control human breast cancer samples. Approximately 200 potential breast-cancer markers were identified and validated by quantitative PCR. This study focuses on 16 genomic regions that were significantly (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) misregulated in tumor samples. Changes in expression were validated by RNA in situ hybridizations (ISH) to compare the localization patterns in normal and tumor breast tissues. ISH experiments not only confirm the observed down-regulation of these RNAs in tumor, but also reveal that some of these transcripts, such as those deriving from ZEB2 introns, are down-regulated in epithelial tumor cells. ZEB2 is a tumor suppressor gene and is also required during embryogenesis, particularly for neural crest formation [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We examined the expression of ZEB2 intronic regions in developing mice. Intronic ZEB2 RNAs are not only conserved sequences in mice, but also have strong tissue-specific expression in the mouse brain, with strongest expression in the cortical plate, a pattern that is similar yet distinct from the canonical ZEB transcript. These data suggest that these regions may be alternatively-spliced transcripts or novel transcripts from within known genomic regions. To differentiate these possibilities, we performed paired end sequencing and found that the expressed intronic regions do not have protein coding potential and are frequently transcribed in a pattern that resembles distinct, yet defined transcriptional units, supporting the idea that the identified loci correspond to novel ncRNAs and variants. Our results identify novel RNAs from intronic regions that associate with breast cancer and embed a highly complex, transcriptional landscape that is misregulated in cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals and cell culture</title><p>Timed pregnant mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories.

For instance, Chr5 yielded an unannotated cluster of six up-regulated regions within 10 kb (Chr5:34198635&#x02013;34208794), and recent studies have revealed multiple lncRNA [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] transcripts also from this region.</p><fig id="pone.0120296.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0120296.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Tiling array difference signals between normal and tumor samples for a long candidate region relevant to breast cancer biology.</title><p>The entire 195 kb long CRIM1 locus (red) trends toward downregulation in tumor samples.

To validate the expression patterns, qRT-PCR was performed in an independent set of matched-pair tissues from four different patient samples by selecting representative unique candidate regions that are genomically clustered. This resulted in the identification of 23 regions that were either consistently up- or down-regulated in tumor. The expression patterns of these 23 regions were then validated in an independent set of 28 different patient and control samples (14 matched-pair tissues) (<xref rid="pone.0120296.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>).

The 23 candidate biomarker regions fall within the introns of seven protein-coding genes (CRIM1, EPAS1, PELI1, ZEB2, RBMS1, RFX2, and ILRAPL1) and the intron of an uncharacterized RNA, SMA4. Although these genes do not have an established role in breast cancer, they are known to affect critical processes related to development or cell proliferation. For instance, ZEB2, a 1.2 kb mRNA derives from a very long transcriptional unit that spans over 136 kb and is thought to be a tumor suppressor [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

Candidates that exhibited the strongest association with breast tumors were regions from the longest introns of RFX2, EPAS1, RBMS1, ZEB2, and the three different introns of CRIM1. Proximal regions frequently manifest similar expression patterns. For example, the expression of all three CRIM1 regions are well correlated within both normal and tumor tissue types, yielding a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.95 between the first two regions (CRIM1:1 vs CRIM1:2) that are separated by over 50 kb and r = 0.77 for the first and third loci (CRIM1:1 vs CRIM1:7), separated by ~75 kb. The coordinated expression patterns that range from correlation coefficients close to 1.0 to more modest correlation numbers (e.g., 0.77 for CRIM1:1 vs CRIM1:7) imply that introns of the host genes harbor multiple exons, some of which are linked by a single transcript (e.g. CRIM1:1 vs CRIM1:2) while others likely represent distinct transcripts (e.g. CRIM1:1 vs CRIM1:7).</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Multiple intronic transcripts are aberrantly regulated in epithelial cells</title><p>Since most breast cancers originate from normal epithelial cells, we sought to investigate whether the intronic target regions were differentially regulated within epithelial cells.

Riboprobes were designed to detect unique non-repetitive regions within introns of CRIM1, RFX2, and ZEB2. To evaluate whether the expression patterns of these intronic regions are different from those of the host genes, we also designed probes against annotated exonic regions of these genes. Epithelial cell types in these experiments were identified by their characteristic cell morphology under 400X magnification of Nuclear Fast Red-stained nuclei. Consistent with the observed down-regulation of RFX2, ZEB2, and CRIM1 regions using qRT-PCR, in-situ hybridizations with probes corresponding to these genomic loci clearly reveal that these loci are down-regulated in tumor epithelium (<xref rid="pone.0120296.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0120296.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>.).</p><p>Since multiple differentially expressed regions within the 136 kb long ZEB2 were detected by both tiling arrays and qRT-PCR, and because ZEB is a tumor suppressor gene that regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transitions during development and tumorigenesis [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the expression patterns of ZEB2 transcripts were analyzed in more detail.

However, ZEB2:2g and ZEB2:2h transcripts are expressed at a lower level than the ZEB2 mRNA (<xref rid="pone.0120296.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). To confirm that the ZEB2 region was misregulated in breast cancer epithelial cells, we examined the expression pattern of the ZEB2 protein using immunohistochemistry. To identify epithelial cells, double immunofluorescence staining was performed on normal and breast cancer tissue sections with the epithelial cell marker MUC1 (E29) and the ZEB2 protein.

These results support the notion that the unusually long transcriptional unit of ZEB2 is frequently misregulated in cancer. Some of the ZEB2 intronic regions such as ZEB2:2g seem to serve as better markers of misregulation of the ZEB2 locus than the canonical ZEB2 exonic regions, a pattern we also observed for transcripts from the CRIM1 and RFX2 locus (<xref rid="pone.0120296.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0120296.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0120296.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Examples of candidate intronic ncRNAs that are downregulated in breast cancer tissues, compared to the expression patterns of their host genes.</title><p>In situ hybridization of the cognate host gene mRNAs (in blue) for ZEB2 (<bold>A</bold>), CRIM1 (<bold>B</bold>) and RFX2 (<bold>C</bold>), and the candidate intronic ncRNA (Black) in sample-matched normal (left panels) and cancer tissues (right panels).

We therefore compared their expression pattern to the endogenous ZEB2 gene. In addition, functionally important transcripts are usually conserved between mammalian species, so we first determined if these human transcripts are genomically conserved sequences in mice and whether they are also transcribed. Comparing the human genomic sequence of regions encompassing Zeb2:2a, Zeb2:2g, and Zeb2:2h (<xref rid="pone.0120296.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) to the mouse sequence over an approximately 500bp stretch, reveal sequence identities of 69%, 89%, and 75%, respectively. To determine if these conserved regions are transcribed in mice and whether they manifest tissue-specific expression patterns, a common attribute of functionally important RNAs such as lincRNAs[<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we used ISH to examine their expression pattern in developing mice in middle stages of embryogenesis. Despite the high sequence identities shared by mouse and human sequences, the gene structure in mice as well as the function of these sequences could be very different, though an understanding of the general expression patterns of these sequences in mice could help inform future functional studies. To enable direct comparison of our results with emerging genome-wide ISH studies such as the mouse Allen Brain Atlas[<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], mouse brain was used. ISH reveals expression of Zeb2:2a, Zeb2:2g, and Zeb2:2h in the brain (<xref rid="pone.0120296.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). During development, the canonical ZEB2 exonic regions are strongly expressed in the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory nerve (<xref rid="pone.0120296.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B and J</xref>), as well as enriched in the cortical plate and the ganglionic eminence (<xref rid="pone.0120296.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). The hypothalamus, midbrain and hindbrain express lower levels of the ZEB2 transcript. In contrast, the intronic regions show broader expression patterns, suggesting that Zeb2 and its intronic transcripts are under different modes of regulation. Zeb2:2h is highly expressed in neurons throughout the brain with higher levels of expression in the cortical plate, ganglionic eminence, hypothalamus and olfactory bulb (<xref rid="pone.0120296.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C, G and K</xref>). In the cerebral cortex, expression of Zeb2:2h is higher in the mature neurons in the cortical plate than in neuronal progenitors (<xref rid="pone.0120296.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C and K</xref>). The difference in expression is especially striking in the developing olfactory bulb, where the ZEB2 is enriched in the olfactory nerve, while Zeb2:2h shows strong expression in the developing mitral and granule cell layers (<xref rid="pone.0120296.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J-K</xref>). Outside the central nervous system, Zeb2:2h is uniquely enriched in the otic sensory epithelium and in the trigeminal gland. Further, the expression of Zeb2:2h in the brain persists into adulthood, where it is enriched in the granular layer of the cerebellum, in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, in the olfactory bulb, and in the caudate putamen (<xref rid="pone.0120296.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L</xref>).

They are similar to Zeb2:2h in the cortex, hypothalamus, trigeminal, and otic sensory epithelium. In the olfactory bulb they are enriched in the olfactory nerve, similar to the endogenous ZEB2.

We performed Direct RNA Sequencing of MCF7 cells and two samples of breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The polyadenylation sites identified by DRS did not map to any of the transcriptional units inferred by sequencing or by northern blot, suggesting that the breast-cancer associated regions we identified are non-polyadenylated transcripts. While DRS might not capture the polyadenylation state of every transcriptional unit due to the depth of the sequencing reads, the observation that none of the well-expressed transcriptional units yielded a DRS signal suggests that the majority of these regions do not represent polyadenylated transcripts. To establish whether these clustered regions correspond to alternative transcript variants of the host gene or other protein-coding genes, we analyzed all read paired-end read clusters for their coding potential and found that the majority of the intronic transcripts are predicted to represent ncRNAs (<xref rid="pone.0120296.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). While the gene prediction algorithms are not fully accurate, the striking differences in the coding potential scores of these regions compared to other exonic regions suggest that most of these are ncRNAs.

Genetic markers that can help in the diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment of breast cancer are highly desired to improve both breast cancer treatment and understanding of the underlying biology. With the emergence of high-throughput gene expression quantification platforms such as deep-sequencing, it has become feasible to find novel genes to serve as markers or targets in cancer treatment. We performed a comprehensive search to identify novel genomic associations in the breast cancer transcriptome. Surprisingly, despite the fact that as much as 90% of the genome is transcribed and the majority of full-length transcriptional units remain undefined in intergenic regions, intronic locations rather than intergenic regions emerged as key candidates associating with breast cancer. It is possible that such enrichments may be because intronic regions are more transcriptionally active. Nevertheless, it is useful to note that while only a minority (15%) of genes are more than 100 kb of genomic sequence, the identified locations are biased towards unusually long genes that span over 100 kb [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. An original list of ~220 candidate regions from GTA analysis was narrowed down to 16 breast-cancer associated regions that are located within the introns of five well-characterized genes. Among these, the down-regulation of at least three regions (CRIM1:1, RFX2:1a, and ZEB2:2g) in breast epithelial cells suggest that they may be useful as clinical markers for pathologic evaluation of cancerous breast cells from tissue biopsies.</p><p>Among the CRIM1:1, RFX2:1a, and ZEB2:2g regions that derive from well characterized gene loci, the ZEB2 locus is particularly interesting. The canonical ZEB2 gene, recently recognized as a tumor suppressor [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120296.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], is known to regulate the Epithelial&#x02013;Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) program, a pathway that changes adherent epithelial cells into less adherent migratory cells, a process critical for oncogenic progression and metastasis of tumor cells [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Consistent with ZEB2 as a tumor suppressor, several reports have documented down-regulation of ZEB2 mRNA in multiple cancers including those of brain, breast, colon, liver, skin, and pancreas [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120296.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120296.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In cancers of liver and pancreas, ZEB2 is epigenetically silenced [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120296.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the observations that ZEB2 introns are transcribed in modular patterns, potentially generating many ncRNAs, and that such intronic transcripts are strongly associated with breast cancer add a new direction to the analysis of the ZEB2 locus. These findings are very intriguing when considering the recent discovery that ZEB2 mRNA acts as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to repress the PTEN tumor suppressor gene by sequestering miRNAs that would otherwise down-regulate PTEN [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Due to extensive transcription detected in this locus, some of the intronic ZEB2 RNAs could also act as ceRNAs that sequester regulatory factors, such as miRNAs or other proteins. In addition to being a tumor suppressor, ZEB2 is critical for proper brain development. ZEB2 mutations cause the Mowat-Wilson syndrome, a disease characterized by mental retardation, Hirschsprung disease, microcephaly, and distinct facial malformations [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120296.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Consistent with the role of ZEB2 locus in brain development, we find ZEB2 intronic transcripts in mouse brain with unique expression patterns for different intronic regions that seem to express ncRNAs. We note that the expression patterns of ZEB2 regions in mice may not accurately represent the biology of ZEB2 regions in human. However, our analysis using both human and mouse tissues seems to point to an unusual level of transcriptional activity and regulation at ZEB2 intronic regions. Our results reveal that the ZEB2 locus, implicated in multiple diseases including cancer, is a far more complex region than is currently understood.</p><p>The detection of intronic transcripts that have disparate expression patterns is intriguing, particularly in the context of cancer. To gain insights into the cause of cancer-associated transcripts that derive from long introns, we need to evaluate the following three possibilities. First, these long introns may be stabilized during transcription as a single pre-mRNA or as different pre-mRNAs harboring various unspliced introns. However this would imply that different unspliced long pre-mRNA isoforms accumulate in normal cells while they are down-regulated in cancer cells. This seems unlikely not only because such long pre-mRNAs would be unstable, but because it seems more logical to expect the contrary, up-regulation of aberrantly spliced transcript isoforms in cancer [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Furthermore, paired end sequencing results clearly reveal many intronic locations that are more expressed than the canonical exons. Such intronic locations also appear as overlapping and tightly clustered regions that indicate the presence of transcript units independent of introns, consistent with our northern blot results and other studies[<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A second possibility is that the spliced introns may be processed as RNA fragments of varying stability, which would lead to the accumulation of different intronic transcripts in the cell. Third, long intragenic RNAs such as lncRNAs may be transcribed as nested-genes at these locations. The latter two possibilities are consistent with both the observed down-regulation of intronic transcripts in tumors, the different expression patterns of various intronic regions within a given gene locus, and the clustered pattern of abundant paired-end reads. Indeed, processing of introns to generate more stable RNAs is a well-known phenomenon in the miRNA and the related mirtron pathway where miRNA-embedded introns are processed by Drosha in either a co-transcriptional manner [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] or after lariat de-branching [<xref rid="pone.0120296.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120296.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. More studies are needed to differentiate between the two possibilities and determine the mechanisms behind the misregulation of the newly identified intronic regions in cancer. These novel breast-cancer associated intronic regions provide a rich set of novel targets for the diagnosis or treatment of breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0120296.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Intronic reads were predicted to have little coding potential.</title><p>Reads mapping to introns and exons in the 219 regions detected by tiling arrays were used for this analysis using the support-vector machine-based Coding Potential Calculator (cpc.cbi.pku.edu.cn).
