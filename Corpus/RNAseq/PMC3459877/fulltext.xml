During the last 10&#x02013;15 years, glaciers and ice caps have been rapidly disappearing and more frequent intense rainfall events have been happening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Philippart1">[1]</xref>. Owing to the huge amount of freshwater inflowed, the seas and oceans are disproportionately affected. Salinity of the superficial water and the inshore water decreased acutely in rainy season, which can incur the increasing mortality outbreaks and distribution shifts of marine species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Johnson1">[2]</xref>. Salinity is a limiting factor to the survival and distribution of many marine organisms, especially as it varies downward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Gunter1">[3]</xref>. Most marine invertebrates, as osmoconformers, have blood osmolarities close to that of seawater, lacking the ability to regulate the osmotic pressure of the internal medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Berger1">[4]</xref>. It is doubtful whether changes in amino acid concentration are rapid enough to prevent cellular swelling in animals exposed to seawater whose salinity dropped abruptly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Davenport1">[5]</xref>. Most marine invertebrates such as molluscs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Jorge1">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Laing1">[8]</xref> and echinoderms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Meng1">[9]</xref> were demonstrated to suffer large-scale mortality when the salinity dropped below 20&#x02030;. Therefore, to certain aquatic economic species such as blue mussel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Tremblay1">[10]</xref>, salinity fluctuation owing to rainfall in summer brought huge economic losses to aquaculture.</p><p>The Pacific oyster <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic> is a dominant species in many intertidal locations as well as an important aquacultured bivalve species. Summer mortality of the Pacific oyster attracted extensive attention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Chaney1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Fleury1">[12]</xref> around the world. Salinity fluctuate is a considered factor without doubt. <italic>C. gigas</italic> grows in optimal salinity ranged from 20&#x02030; to 25&#x02030;, whereas they can occur at salinities below 10&#x02030; and will survive salinities in excess of 35&#x02030;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Helm1">[13]</xref>. Given its euryhalinity, the Pacific oyster, as a marine mollusc, is a good model for studies of hypoosmotic stress. Considerable efforts have been invested so far in the mechanisms of salinity adaptations, and osmolytes had been proved to play a primary role in the osmotic activities of the Pacific oyster, such as the large amount of nitrogenous solutes, against the fluctuating extracellular osmolality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Yancey1">[14]</xref>. Free amino acids had been identified to be important as intracellular osmolytes in <italic>C. gigas</italic> and contribute to the hypoosmotic adaption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Somero1">[15]</xref>. Moreover, molecular studies about the genes that are in relation to cellular osmo-regulatory mechanism of the oyster had been conducted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Toyohara1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Hosoi1">[17]</xref>. However, previous studies only covered several genes that regulate the individuals to adapt to the extracellular osmolality. The molecular mechanisms of osmo-adaptation remained unknown.</p><p>Recently, the next-generation sequencing technologies make large-scale sequencing possible by high-throughput and cost-efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Marguerat1">[18]</xref>. The development of novel high-throughput DNA sequencing methods has provided a new means of both mapping and quantifying transcriptome. The method, known as RNAseq, has clear advantages over existing approaches with sequencing depth at least 5 orders of magnitude <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Mortazavi1">[19]</xref> and highly accurate for quantifying expression levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Wang1">[20]</xref>. To date, transcriptomes have been sequenced for various marine bivalves, such as clam, yesso scallop, vent mussel and oyster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Joubert1">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Lorgeril1">[25]</xref>. The countable, almost digital, nature of RNAseq data makes them particularly attractive for the quantitative analysis of transcript expression levels, which can give reliable measurements of transcript levels in one or more conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Marguerat1">[18]</xref>. By now, the next-generation sequencing technologies have shown probabilities to expanding sequencing database of more and more species, and influenced the analysis of gene regulation highly.</p><p>In the present study, we examined the whole transcriptome responses to low salinity stress of the Pacific oyster for the first time using the Illumina's sequencing technology. Considering individual monitoring of the oyster responses to salinity stress, two libraries were established from the gills of oysters that exposed to optimal and low salinity seawater, respectively. The study aimed to compare the expression patterns of the two libraries to better understand the transcriptomic regulation in oyster to low salinity stress and identify genes involved in osmoregulation of the Pacific oyster. The results of this study are an important resource for future researches on mechanism of tolerance to hypoosmotic stress for marine invertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sequencing and assembly</title><p>To have access to the transcriptome of the oyster and obtain the quantitative and qualitative gene expression database for hypoosmotic stress, two libraries were established from the control group (PC library) and the treated group (PT library). Characteristics of the two libraries are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0046244-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>.

In <italic>Litopenaeus vannamei</italic>, mRNA of zinc proteinase is more expression in WSSV resistant individuals, which proved it played a role in immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Zhao1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Pan1">[44]</xref>.,. These data may indicate that low salinity shock only triggers the first step of innate immunity that acts by detecting initiating effectors responses, namely pathogen recognition, whereas the antimicrobial defenses are suppressed Meanwhile, high representation of sequences for stress proteins, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), was also evidenced up-regulated. HSPs, as molecular chaperones, are closely linked to the innate immune system. HSP70 can interfere with the process of apoptotic cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Beere1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Mosser1">[46]</xref>, and it is verified to be up-regulated by stressful conditions in oysters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Chapman1">[47]</xref>.</p><p>Our study highlighted Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins that were all down-regulated significantly such as protocadherin, calmodulin, copine family proteins and calcium-binding EGF domain protein. These calcium-binding genes are involved in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Wang2">[48]</xref>. In addition, their expressions are relevant to the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and they take part in the calcium-binding signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Tomsig1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Rao1">[50]</xref>.

In the immune cell activation, the early key feature is an increase of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which acts as a second messenger of signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Bettencourt2">[51]</xref>. In addition, the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is higher with exposure to live bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Bettencourt2">[51]</xref>. Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium-binding protein that modulates many kinds of biological processes affected by cytosolic calcium ions, such as muscle contraction, fertilization, cell proliferation, apoptosis and so on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Woo1">[52]</xref>. Moreover, the CaM-dependent signal transduction have been found to play an important role in shrimp defense against pathogen infection in Pacific white shrimp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Ji1">[53]</xref>. Furthermore, it has been shown that the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dropped with the decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the external environment in <italic>C. gigas</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Shumway1">[28]</xref>. Owing to the lower concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and no artificial live bacteria stimulus, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding signaling pathways and proteins tended to be down-regulated.</p><p>Apoptosis, programmed cell death, also called cell suicide, was also evidenced in our data with significant difference. Among them, Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein, an apoptosis suppressor, inhibits the caspase activity directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Eckelman1">[54]</xref>. In addition, IAPs are involved in signal transduction and cell cycle regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Richter1">[55]</xref>. Those down-regulated genes like caspases are apoptosis triggers or to be active in response to apoptosis triggers. As PD-L1, it acts on nonhematopoietic cells to protect tissues from autoimmune attack <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Sharpe1">[56]</xref>. PDCD1, a surface receptor binds to PD-L1, inhibits T-cell proliferation and controls apoptosis process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Sharpe1">[56]</xref>. Here, the expressions of genes related to apoptosis all focused on inhibiting apoptosis. From our data, we can conclude that the ability of apoptosis suppression, namely enhanced cellular survival, may be one of reasons to be euryhalineorganism for <italic>C. gigas</italic>.</p><p>The data presented here reveal that genes involved in cell adhesion and communication, signal receptors, and cytoskeleton may play an important role in salinity shock. Cell adhesion is intimately related to the processes of cell motility and cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Gumbiner1">[57]</xref>. These genes may contribute to oyster recovery to adjust to the hypoosmotic shock and osmotic stress signaling. Among them, Fer and Fps that expressed significant changes in our data are the only two known members of a distinct subgroup of the protein-tyrosine kinase. Fps may involve a signaling role downstream from multiple cytokine receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Zirngibl1">[58]</xref>. Fer both plays roles in signaling and involves in regulation of cell-cell interactions and cell-cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Kim1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Kim2">[60]</xref>. They may participate in the signal transduction in response to low salinity. LRIG3, as a cell surface receptor, mediates signaling across the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Guo1">[61]</xref> and is also found to be the positive regulation of BMP signaling that exquisitely controls homeostatic events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Gumienny1">[62]</xref>, suggesting that LRIG3 in our study controls homeostatic events to accommodate the internal osmolality. Collagen is an abundant protein that is part of the extracellular matrix and deposited or broken down as part of the process of tissue growth and repair. Therefore, the reduction of collagen production may imply that more energy would be available to fuel stress responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Lang1">[63]</xref>. In the contrary, the up-regulated gene, ankyrins as a family of ubiquitously expressed membrane adaptor molecules associates with the spectrin-based cytoskeleton network and various membrane proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Bennett1">[64]</xref>. They highly expressed in transcriptome that may be relevant to targeting ion transport proteins and cytoskeleton rearrangement with tubulin and actin (up-regulated genes) to maintain internal and external osmotic pressure balance. In addition, genes involved in cell cycle, like MEGF10 and Protein fosB, also showed changes here. MEGF10 was down-regulated for inhibiting cell motility and cell proliferation in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Suzuki1">[65]</xref>. Protein fosB interacts with c-jun proteins enhancing their DNA binding activity in cellular proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Zerial1">[66]</xref>. The cell cycle control was suggested to be a key element of the osmotic stress response in blue mussels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0046244-Lockwood1">[27]</xref>. Thus, genes involved in the cell cycle may arrest in response to salinity stress in <italic>C. gigas</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Using the next-generation sequencing technologies, the present study demonstrated the value of whole transcriptome analysis generated by RNAseq for accurate quantification of gene expression. Through more than 1.5 million sequence reads obtained, we established transcriptome data set for oysters subjected to hypoosmotic stress for the first time, and the data we generated could enrich on genomic resources of this non-model organism. Moreover, we provided a catalog of genes and cellular functions that are potential targets for mechanisms of adaption to low salinity by quantifying gene expression. The results provide not only a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control or contribute to the responses to osmotic stress of the oysters, but also an initial look at the cascade of gene expression patterns of marine organisms that occur in response to osmotic stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s5"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Oyster materials</title><p>Adult individuals of <italic>C. gigas</italic> were purchased from an oyster farm in Weihai, Shandong Province, China, in 2010, and acclimatized over a week in 25&#x02030; filtered seawater at 20&#x000b0;C. The Pacific oyster is not the endangered or protected species, and no specific permits were required for our studies. Twenty-four oysters were individually tagged and divided into two groups in separate tanks. One group was exposed in the optimal salinity filtered seawater (25&#x02030;), as the control group (PC); another group was exposed in the simulated conditions of increased fresh water input (8&#x02030;), as the treated group (PT). A part of the shell edge (about 10 mm long and 5 mm wide) of each specimen was chipped away in order to ensure the free exchange of seawater between the inside and outside of the shell. Each group was distributed in two tanks, and disposed for 8 hours simultaneously. After that, six oysters of each group were chosen randomly to be sacrificed, and their gill tissues were dissected and saved in RNA store (Dongsheng Biotech.).</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>RNA extraction</title><p>The gills from 6 specimens saved in RNA store of each group were balanced mixed.
