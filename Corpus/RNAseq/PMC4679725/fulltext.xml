Furthermore, published epigenomic profiles are not specific to H3K36me3 or metastatic tumors. To determine if progressive <italic>SETD2</italic> and H3K36me3 dysregulation occurs in metastatic tumors, H3K36me3, <italic>SETD2</italic> copy number (CN) or <italic>SETD2</italic> mRNA abundance was assessed in two independent cohorts: metastatic ccRCC (<italic>n</italic>=71) and the Cancer Genome Atlas Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma data set (<italic>n</italic>=413). Although <italic>SETD2</italic> CN loss occurs with high frequency (&#x0003e;90&#x00025;), H3K36me3 is not significantly impacted by monoallelic loss of <italic>SETD2</italic>. H3K36me3-positive nuclei were reduced an average of ~20&#x00025; in primary ccRCC (90&#x00025; positive nuclei in uninvolved vs 70&#x00025; positive nuclei in ccRCC) and reduced by ~60&#x00025; in metastases (90&#x00025; positive in uninvolved kidney vs 30&#x00025; positive in metastases) (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). To define a kidney-specific H3K36me3 profile, we generated genome-wide H3K36me3 profiles from four cytoreductive nephrectomies and <italic>SETD2</italic> isogenic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput DNA sequencing and RNA sequencing. SETD2 loss of methyltransferase activity leads to regional alterations of H3K36me3 associated with aberrant RNA splicing in a SETD2 mutant RCC and <italic>SETD2</italic> knockout cell line. These data suggest that during progression of ccRCC, a decline in H3K36me3 is observed in distant metastases, and regional H3K36me3 alterations influence alternative splicing in ccRCC.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer of the kidney and renal pelvis affect more than 65&#x02009;000 patients annually and is 1 of the 10 leading causes of cancer death.

In a cohort of unmatched uninvolved kidney, primary RCC and resected metastases (bone, brain and lungs), H3K36me3-positive nuclei were reduced an average of ~20&#x00025; in primary RCC (90&#x00025; positive nuclei in uninvolved vs 70&#x00025; positive nuclei in RCC) and were reduced by ~60&#x00025; in metastases (90&#x00025; positive in uninvolved kidney vs 30&#x00025; positive in metastases; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

To define the H3K36me3 profile in cytoreductive nephrectomy tissue from patients with advanced RCC, we examined the genome-wide distribution of H3K36me3 by ChIP sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Since the detection of <italic>SETD2</italic> mutations may vary because of tumor heterogeneity, IHC of H3K36me3 was used to phenotype the tumors into either a high-H3K36me3 group (more than 60&#x00025; of the tumor staining for H3K36me3) or a low-H3K36me3 group (less than 10&#x00025; staining; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

Consistent with prior studies in other species, we observed enrichment of H3K36me3 signals in exon regions compared with introns for both uninvolved kidney and RCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Of all eight ChIP sequencing libraries, the SETD2 mutant (RCC3) had the largest depletion of H3K36me3 at exons. To make comparisons across eight ChIP libraries, we determined the average fragment densities for 26&#x02009;558 human genes. The calculated average fragment densities for all human gene bodies were used for further analysis to screen samples for differences in H3K36me3 marked genes.

The ChIP PCR results were also concordant with the calculated average H3K36me3 fragment densities from ChIP sequencing; smaller average H3K36me3 fragment densities identified by ChIP sequencing were associated with decreased H3K36me3-binding events detected by ChIP PCR. Interestingly, ChIP sequencing identified genes such as <italic>MAGI1</italic> with paradoxically higher H3K36me3 enrichment in SETD2 mutant RCC and global loss of H3K36me3 at the ChIP qPCR-amplified sites was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><p>To assess the diversity of RNA splicing isoforms, we performed in parallel, ChIP and RNA sequencing, of the SETD2 mutant tumor (RCC3) and matched uninvolved kidney specimen.

For all of the genes, exon&#x02013;intron islands were identified where differential splicing occurs more frequently in association with loss of H3K36me3 than in other areas of the gene. For example, for <italic>IL7R</italic>, RNA sequencing identified splicing events involving exons 5, 6, 7 and 8 in SETD2 mutant tumor (RCC3). The most abundant RNA splicing isoform (highlighted in red) is a splice event where exon 6 is excluded. Our data indicate that H3K36me3 redistribution occurs at discrete intragenic regions in SETD2 mutant RCC (RCC3) and is associated with diverse RNA splicing isoforms.</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of SETD2 methyltransferase activity is associated with genome-wide alterations of H3K36me3 and diverse RNA splicing isoforms in isogenic RCC cell lines</title><p>To further study SETD2-regulated events <italic>in vitro</italic>, we generated isogenic <italic>SETD2</italic> cell lines to analyze both alterations in H3K36me3 and RNA splicing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> We used zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) to target the <italic>SETD2</italic> gene to generate homozygous deletions in VHL-deficient (786-O) RCC cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).

To our knowledge, our data represent the first comparison of H3K36me3-specific profiles of metastatic RCC tumors with a defined <italic>SETD2</italic> genotype. Some of the first questions we asked were whether CN loss of <italic>SETD2</italic> is linked to H3K36me3 levels, and whether there is progressive loss of H3K36me3 as a function of tumor progression. Our data from nephrectomy specimens indicate that that chromosome 3p loss leads to <italic>SETD2</italic> CN loss in more than 90&#x00025; of tested specimens and <italic>SETD2</italic> mutations decrease H3K36me3, which is consistent with prior observations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> However, <italic>SETD2</italic> CN loss alone may not have a proportional effect on loss of H3K36me3, with a relatively high level of H3K36me3 levels remaining in tumors with 3p loss. This observation suggests that decreased <italic>SETD2</italic> mRNA expression after monoallelic loss is not sufficient to alter SETD2 methyltransferase activity. It is nevertheless possible that subtle changes in SETD2 protein levels may have a cooperative biological effect in these early tumors through the monoallelic loss of other chromosome 3p tumor suppressors.</p><p>Biallelic <italic>SETD2</italic> inactivation may be a later event during tumor progression. We observed a substantial decrease of nuclear staining for H3K36me3 in bone, brain and lung metastases compared with primary lesions (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). These findings suggest a link between loss of H3K36me3 and RCC tumor progression or adaptation. The predicted mutational frequency of <italic>SETD2</italic> in early-stage primary RCC tumors is 12&#x00025; however, our data indicated a considerably higher loss of H3K36me3 in more advanced lesions, which suggests either a higher prevalence of <italic>SETD2</italic> mutations in metastatic RCC or the presence of additional post-translational mechanisms that downregulate H3K36me3. Indeed, multiregion sequencing of ccRCC has identified parallel evolution of distinct <italic>SETD2</italic> mutations that phenotypically converge on loss of SETD2 catalytic activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> In addition to RCC, <italic>SETD2</italic> mutations (12&#x02013;15&#x00025;) have been characterized in bladder cancers, gliomas and sarcomas, and we hypothesize cancers with loss of SETD2 methyltransferase function share similar genomic regions with H3K36me3 alterations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Sequencing of matched diagnosis-remission-relapse samples in pediatric leukemias identified acquisition of <italic>SETD2</italic> mutations further supporting a link between decreased H3K36me3 and disease progression or adaptation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> High-resolution H3K36me3 profiling of other SETD2 mutant cancers may identify these regions with aberrant chromatin accessibility.</p><p>To better characterize the effects of SETD2 dysregulation on genome-wide H3K36me3 levels and on mRNA splicing, we performed H3K36me3 profiling in four paired RCC tumors and uninvolved kidneys through ChIP sequencing and interrogation of H3K36me3 at genomic sites flanking the alternatively spliced cassette exons. The impact of SETD2 loss of function on H3K36me3 profiles at SETD2-dependent alternatively spliced exons in RCC has not been previously examined. We selected five genes with SETD2-dependent alternatively spliced exons for further study by ChIP PCR and identified dysregulation of H3K36me3 in samples with biallelic <italic>SETD2</italic> loss. Our DNA and RNA sequencing in SETD2 mutated tumors and cell lines suggest that a key result is the manifestation of H3K36me3 redistribution and aberrant splicing isoforms. We confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription&#x02013;PCR changes in alternative splicing isoforms with H3K36me3 depletion. At this time, the clinical and functional significance of these alternate splice variants and their impact on RCC tumor biology are not known, but form the basis of future work on elucidating their effect on RCC biology.</p><p>Loss of SETD2 function can affect tumor biology in a number of different ways, including a direct impact on p53 transcriptional regulation, and an indirect effect via loss of H3K36me3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> H3K36me3 regulates DNA mismatch repair, DNA double-strand break repair, alternative splicing and chromatin remodeling, and these functions are linked to chromatin readers with proline&#x02013;tryptophan&#x02013;tryptophan&#x02013;proline domains that interact with methylated lysine residues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Treatment of SETD2 protein-deficient cell lines with DNA-damaging agents fail to activate DNA repair mechanisms and leads to increased genomic deletions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup>As SETD2 is a non-redundant histone H3 methyltransferase, it is likely that loss of SETD2 will change gene marking by H3K36me3, thus altering the recruitment of chromatin readers. H3K36me3 is recognized by chromatin readers, and regional alterations of H3K36me3 caused by SETD2 dysregulation may lead to repositioning of other proline&#x02013;tryptophan&#x02013;tryptophan&#x02013;proline domain-containing proteins.

Although the tumors were selected from cytoreductive nephrectomies and underwent macrodissection, our H3K36me3 profile represents the aggregate epigenetic environment of the kidney, which includes stroma and infiltrating immune cells such as lymphocytes. We used both input DNA and matched uninvolved kidney as controls, but we did not disaggregate the tumor from the stroma, given the large amount of total DNA required for ChIP sequencing. Our paradoxical finding of increased H3K36me3 in specific genomic regions may also be influenced by large-scale recruitment of specific non-tumor cell populations that possess these histone methylation patterns. Additional filters, such as using a minimal fragment density threshold, could reduce the number of false-positives. Nonetheless, we believe these data provide an accurate representation of H3K36me3 marked genes in tissue because ChIP PCR confirmed differences in H3K36me3 binding to specific genomic sites among <italic>PBRM1</italic> mutant, SETD2 mutant, <italic>PBRM1</italic> mutant and <italic>SETD2</italic> wild-type specimens. As RCC can display intratumoral heterogeneity, we attempted to control for macroscopic heterogeneity by using H3K36me3 IHC of whole-tumor specimens as a surrogate for SETD2 methyltransferase activity to stratify the cytoreductive nephrectomies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, there was relatively high level of H3K36me3 in primary RCC despite the near universal loss of one <italic>SETD2</italic> allele in clear cell RCC. We observed a significant decrease of H3K36me3 activity in distant metastases relative to primary tumor, however, H3K36me3 levels were not predictive of clinical site of metastases or of the number of distant metastases. In tumors and cell lines with <italic>SETD2</italic> mutations, we observed significant intragenic redistribution of H3K36me3, and alterations in splice isoforms when compared with non-SETD2 mutated controls. The phenotypic impact of these epigenetic alterations is challenging to define, because recruitment of chromatin readers may have an immediate effect on the cellular phenotype, or may be part of a more complex process that evolves over time in conjunction with other genomic or phenotypic alterations in the cancer cell. Nonetheless, as we develop a mechanistic understanding of the role <italic>SETD2</italic> loss and H3K36me3 play in RCC tumors, we will be able to tailor drug strategies that target the downstream consequences of <italic>SETD2</italic> loss and H3K36me3 dysregulation more precisely, and alter the course of RCC and other SETD2 mutated cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patient samples</title><p>Early-stage <italic>SETD2</italic> wild-type and SETD2 mutant RCC samples were identified by the Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, Michigan, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> For metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), tissue samples were collected from patients enrolled in two phase II trials at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, while undergoing either radical or partial nephrectomy for sporadic clear cell RCC (ccRCC).
