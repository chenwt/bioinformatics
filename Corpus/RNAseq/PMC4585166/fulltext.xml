The glycan-associated metabolic features encoded by bifidobacteria are believed to be strongly influenced by cross-feeding activities due to the co-existence of strains with different glycan-degrading properties. In this study, we observed an enhanced growth yield of <italic>Bifidobacterium bifidum</italic> PRL2010 when co-cultivated with <italic>Bifidobacterium breve</italic> 12L, <italic>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</italic> 22L, or <italic>Bifidobacterium thermophilum</italic> JCM1207. This enhanced growth phenomenon was confirmed by whole genome transcriptome analyses, which revealed co-cultivation-associated transcriptional induction of PRL2010 genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, such as those encoding for carbohydrate transporters and associated energy production, and genes required for translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis, thus supporting the idea that co-cultivation of certain bifidobacterial strains with <italic>B. bifidum</italic> PRL2010 causes enhanced metabolic activity, and consequently increased lactate and/or acetate production. Overall, these data suggest that PRL2010 cells benefit from the presence of other bifidobacterial strains.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>microbiota</kwd><kwd>microbe&#x02013;microbe interactions</kwd><kwd>RNAseq</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="29"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Bifidobacteria are key gut commensals of human beings, reaching a high-relative abundance when their host is an infant (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Ventura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Turroni et al., 2014b</xref>). These bacteria have a saccharolytic lifestyle and their metabolism is consequently directed toward the utilization of carbohydrates that are naturally occurring in their ecological niches, which not only include dietary glycans, such as resistant-starch and xylan, but also host-derived glycans, i.e., mucin and human milk oligosaccharides (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Turroni et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Duranti et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In order to access these glycans, bifidobacteria have evolved an enzymatic repertoire of extracellular glycosyl hydrolases (GH) that catalyze the breakdown of such polysaccharides, with the production of mono, di/trisaccharides that are then imported into the cell through the action of specific carriers (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Turroni et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, other species such as <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic> ssp. <italic>infantis</italic> possess apparently unique molecular mechanisms to capture intact oligosaccharides to be further processed intracellularly (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Sela, 2011</xref>). It should, however, be considered that in their ecological niche bifidobacterial populations may interact with different strains/species which may lead to competition for or co-operative sharing of nutrients.</p><p>Biotic interactions between bacteria can either positively or negatively influence the fitness of the affected organisms (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Pande et al., 2015</xref>). Several of these interactions rely on either the active or passive release of chemical molecules into the environment (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Phelan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 2013</xref>). In this context, interspecies cross-feeding has been observed for <italic>Bifidobacterium bifidum</italic> PRL2010 and <italic>Bifidobacterium breve</italic> UCC2003 cells when cultivated on sialyllactose as the unique carbon source (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Egan et al., 2014a</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated metabolic cross-feeding between <italic>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</italic> and lactate-utilizing, butyrate-producing <italic>Firmicutes</italic> bacteria related to <italic>Eubacterium hallii</italic> and <italic>Anaerostipes caccae</italic> (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Belenguer et al., 2006</xref>). This is significant and relevant to host health as butyrate is widely regarded as a beneficial short-chain fatty acid produced by elements of the microbiota. Furthermore, bacterial cross-feeding opportunities as facilitated by members of the colonic microbiota have been considered to be pivotal for carbohydrate turn-over in this ecological niche (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">De Vuyst and Leroy, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, extensive scientific efforts have been made to decode bifidobacterial genome sequences, which are part of a novel discipline called probiogenomics, directed to understand the genetics sustaining the adaptation of these bacteria to the intestine (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Ventura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Milani et al., 2014</xref>). In this context, the genome sequence of <italic>B. bifidum</italic> PRL2010, an infant gut isolate, exhibits several genetic adaptations to the human gut and for this reason is employed as a model strain to investigate the biology of infant-associated bifidobacteria (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Turroni et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Serafini et al., 2014</xref>). The ability of PRL2010 to utilize host-derived glycans such as mucins and human milk oligosaccharides, and the capacity to produce pilus-like structures to facilitate gut colonization and immuno modulation, are clear examples of such genetic adaptations (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Turroni et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Serafini et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigate possible cross-feeding activities of simple bifidobacterial communities under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions, targeting specific complex, diet-associated carbohydrates. Such cross-feeding activities were investigated employing transcriptome analysis of bifidobacterial communities by means of RNAseq as well as by assessment of the metabolic profiles of these bifidobacterial consortia. The main findings of the current study are that <italic>B. bifidum</italic> PRL2010 does not utilize starch or xylan, unless co-cultured with a strain that produces extracellular glycoside hydrolases that can degrade these substrates. These findings provide evidence of mutalisitic cross-feeding between certain bifidobacterial strains when co-cultured in media containing starch or xylan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Growth Conditions</title><p><italic>Bifidobacterium bifidum</italic> PRL2010 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Turroni et al., 2010</xref>) on its own, or in combination with <italic>B. breve</italic> 12L.

The copy-number of a gene, and the deduced cell number (since the genes targeted were in single copy per genome) of a given strain used in the co-cultivation experiments was evaluated by comparing the cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained with those from a standard curve. Standard curves were calculated from serial dilutions of a culture with a known cell number (as determined by viable count assessment) for each bacterial strain vs. Ct produced for each target gene. In the case of PRL2010 we used the following primer couple: BBPR_0282-UNI (5&#x02032;-GCGAACAATGATGGCACCTA-3&#x02032;) and BBPR_282-REV (5&#x02032;-GTCGAACACCACGACGATGT-3&#x02032;).

Separation was carried out using a Shodex Sugar SH1011 column (8.0 mm ID &#x000d7; 300 mm) at 60&#x000b0;C with the detector temperature maintained at 30&#x000b0;C. The mobile phase was prepared in 20 mM H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and run at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min for 30 min. Injection volume was set at 10 &#x003bc;L and speed of draw and eject was set to 100 &#x003bc;L/min. External sugar standards (glucose, maltose, xylose, and maltotriose) and organic acid (acetic acid and lactic acid) standards were purchased from Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich Co. (USA). Concentrations of individual sugars and organic acids in samples were calculated from calibration curves drawn from external standards for five different concentrations (0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 20 mg/L). Each metabolic profiling experiment was carried out in triplicate (three measurements were performed for each replicate). Glucose and maltose consumption was calculated by subtracting the values at 24 h from time zero. Since the concentration of metabolites produced is dependent upon the cell density at the end of fermentation (i.e., more cells would yield more endproducts), raw metabolite values were normalized by cell density to correct for differences in biomass.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA Extraction and Purification</title><p>Total RNA was isolated using a previously described method (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Turroni et al., 2011a</xref>). Briefly, cell pellets/tissue materials were resuspended in 1 mL of QUIAZOL (Qiagen, UK) and placed in a tube containing 0.8 g of glass beads (diameter, 106 &#x003bc;m; Sigma). Cells were lysed by shaking the mix on a BioSpec homogenizer at 4&#x000b0;C for 2 min (maximum setting). The mixture was then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min, and the upper RNA-containing phase was recovered. The RNA sample was further purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation according to an established method (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Sambrook and Russel, 2001</xref>). RNA quality was checked by analyzing the integrity of rRNA molecules by a Tape Station (Agilent Technologies).</p></sec><sec><title>RNAseq with Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM)</title><p>One hundred nanogram of total RNA was used as the starting input for RNA-Seq library preparation.

The efficacy of rRNA depletion was checked by a Tape Station (Agilent Technologies), after which rRNA-depleted RNA samples were fragmented using RNaseIII (Life Technologies, USA) followed by size evaluation using a Tape Station (Agilent Technologies). Whole transcriptome libraries were constructed using the Ion Total-RNA Seq Kit v2 (Life Technologies, USA). Barcoded libraries were quantified by qRT-PCR and each library template was amplified on Ion Sphere Particles using Ion One Touch 200 Template Kit v2 (Life Technologies, USA). The samples were loaded on 316 Chips and sequenced by means of a PGM instrument (Life Technologies, USA). Sequencing reads were depleted of adapter sequences and quality filtered (with overall quality, quality window, and length filters) using a custom script implying fastq-mcf<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup> (settings: &#x02013;qual-mean=25, -w 5 &#x02013;q 20 &#x02013;l 100).

In addition, cultivation experiments involving all the strains used in this study were also performed on MRS without carbon source, revealing, as expected, the absence of any sign of growth. These carbohydrates were selected in order to represent carbon sources that may occur in the human gut as they are derived from a plant-derived, glycan-based diet (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chassard and Lacroix, 2013</xref>). Notably, of all the possible strain pair combinations, only those bi-associations that included PRL2010 cells displayed significant differences in growth with respect to the respective mono-associations (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>; Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S1</xref>). As expected, PRL2010 cells did not exhibit any significant growth on starch or xylan when grown in a mono-culture (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Turroni et al., 2012</xref>). However, when this strain was co-cultivated with 22L or 12L cells on a MRS-supplemented with starch, the number of cells increased (about three- and fourfold, respectively, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005) compared to the situation of mono-association, respectively (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). In contrast, 12L appears to significant decrease (compared to mono-association; fourfold, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) during growth on starch when co-cultivated with the presence of PRL2010 cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). Conversely, <italic>B. bifidum</italic> PRL2010 did not appear to influence the growth yields (changes less than twofold) of 22L cells on starch, or that of 12L when cultivated on xylan, as displayed by unchanged growth yields of bi-association compared to mono-association of these strains (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>).

The results of this metabolic comparison between mono-associations and bi-associations (as collected from three independent experiments) are depicted in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>. Bifidobacteria produce acetate and lactate as a result of their saccharoclastic fermentative metabolism through the so-called bifid shunt (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Sela et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Pokusaeva et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, lactate production from starch and xylan fermentation showed significant differences between bifidobacterial species. Whereas acetate production from xylan fermentation varied significantly between certain species in mono-associations (PRL2010 vs. 12L, 12L vs. 22L, and 12L vs. JCM1207), and between 12L and all 12L co-cultivations, its production from starch did not show significant variation between species or bi-associations (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref></bold>). Since <italic>B. bifidum</italic> PRL2010 did not exhibit significant growth utilizing starch as a sole carbohydrate, acetate, and lactate production was not observed 24 h into the fermentation. Although growth of PRL2010 was enhanced when co-cultivated with 12L, 22L, or JCM1207 in a medium containing xylan as the sole carbon source, it did not appear to influence acetate and lactate production compared to the respective mono-associations (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref></bold>). Interestingly, lactate production during co-cultivation of 22L and JCM1207 in starch increased compared to the respective mono-associations (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref></bold>). This may be indicative of bacterial proto-cooperation when grown on starch, as the same relationship was not observed with xylan. <italic>B. breve</italic> 12L cells produced significantly more lactate and acetate while fermenting xylan in pure culture as compared to its bi-association with other species (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B,D</xref></bold>). This suggests that 12L energy metabolism may be inhibited by the presence of other bifidobacteria. Interestingly, 12L did not produce biomass when grown in axenic culture, suggesting metabolic flux in the absence of cellular growth. Glucose and maltose depletion during starch fermentation varied among species. <italic>B. breve</italic> 12L cells consumed more glucose alone than when co-cultivated with PRL2010, JCM1207, and 22L cells in starch fermentation (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E,F</xref></bold>). However, this did not coincide with a significant decrease in lactate production (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref></bold>). While fermenting starch individually, 22L and JCM1207 consumed similar amounts of glucose (2.56E-10 and 6.33E-10 mg/cell, respectively) and maltose (2.83E-10 and 8.96E-10 mg/cell, respectively), whereas they consumed onefold more glucose and maltose than their consumption in pure cultures during co-culture (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E,F</xref></bold>). This, in turn, resulted in a twofold increase in acetate and lactate production in co-culture compared to the situation in mono-associations (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;C</xref></bold>). Although PRL2010 did not produce significant biomass from xylan or starch fermentation, it appears that glucose and maltose from degradation of starch was depleted from the growth medium regardless. This may be explained by the fact that PRL2010 is utilizing free glucose and/or maltose that may be present in very low amounts in the starch-supplemented growth medium (carbohydrate contaminants), thereby allowing very limited growth (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E,F</xref></bold>). In general, organic acid production, and sugar consumption did not exhibit a linear correlation among the tested strains. This is likely due to the hydrolysis of dietary oligosaccharides yielding increased concentrations of monomeric and dimeric sugars derived from xylan or starch before they enter the bifid shunt (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Ze et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p><bold>Metabolic profiling of co-cultivated bifidobacteria.

In order to increase the robustness of our RNAseq data, two technical replicates starting from the same library for each RNAseq trial were performed. When compared to the reference condition (mono-association) it was identified that the number of genes whose expression in either PRL2010 or the other strains, was significantly up-regulated (greater than or equal to twofold change, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005) ranged from 0 to 121. We used cluster orthologous gene (COG) analysis in order to identify differentially transcribed genes that may contribute to specific biological functions within the gut. As illustrated in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>, carbohydrate metabolism, corresponding to COG category [G], is one of the COG functions of PRL2010 most significantly affected by the interaction with another bifidobacterial strain. This is probably due to a response to the presence of specific breakdown capabilities exploited by 22L, 12L, or JCM1207 cells. In this context, we observed an up-regulation of an ABC-type transporter-encoding gene (BBPR_1824), as well as an major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter-encoding gene (BBPR_0146), thus possibly involved in the uptake of simple sugars when co-cultivated with 22L or 12L cells on MRS containing starch as a unique carbon source (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). This finding can be explained by the fact that the extracellular amylases encoded by strains 22L (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Duranti et al., 2014</xref>) and 12L (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bottacini et al., 2014</xref>) generate simple carbohydrates, which may then be imported by PRL2010 cells through its carbohydrate transporter arsenal (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Turroni et al., 2012</xref>). Other transcriptionally induced genes of <italic>B. bifidum</italic> PRL2010 cells encompass enolase (BBPR_0711), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (BBPR_354), phosphoglycerate kinase (BBPR_1038), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (BBPR_0587), and phosphoglycerate mutase (BBPR_1487), whose functions are predicted to be related to (carbohydrate-dependent) energy production and conversion through the glycolytic pathway (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S1</xref>). These observations indicate that PRL2010 cells have enhanced flux through their central fermentative pathway in the presence of 22L or 12L cells. Notably, we also observed the enhanced transcription of genes encoding the various subunits of the ATPase system of PRL2010 strain, which may occur in response to medium acidification as a result of enhanced metabolic activity. Co-cultivation of PRL2010 cells with strain JCM1207 on a xylan-based medium also increased the transcription levels of genes that are predicted to be involved in the carbohydrate metabolism (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). In particular, 121 genes of PRL2010 exhibited transcriptional up-regulation. The upregulated genes include several ORFs-encoding glycolytic enzymatic repertoire of PRL2010, such as enolase (BBPR_0711), phosphoglycerate mutase (BBPR_1487), and pyruvate kinase (BBPR_0747; <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p><bold>Transcriptomic profiling of genes predicted to be involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates by bifidobacteria in response to the different bi- associations.

Notably, among the up-regulated genes, we observed B12L_1818 encoding a putative IIBC component of a phosphotransferase system (PTS), which is involved in carbohydrate metabolism (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). Co-cultivation of strain 12L with PRL2010 caused transcriptional up-regulation of 42 genes of <italic>B. breve</italic> 12L on xylan-based medium, some of which are known to be involved in energy generation through the bif shunt, such as pyruvate kinase (B12L_0681) and phosphoglucomutase (B12L_1523; <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). This is consistent with the observation that 12L produces significantly more organic acid endproducts in axenic culture than when co-cultured with another bifidobacterial species. In contrast, the transcriptomes of strain 22L when cultivated on starch, and that of JCM1207 strain when grown on xylan-based medium were shown to be unaltered when these strains were co-cultivated with PRL2010 cells compared to transcriptome data obtained when these strains were in mono-association. Such findings confirmed the results achieved by growth experiments (see above).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we assessed possible glycan cross-feeding activities between simple bifidobacterial communities when metabolizing complex carbohydrates that, being present in the diet, are expected to be commonly found in the human gut. Our results highlight the existence of a gut commensal relationship between different bifidobacterial species (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">S1</xref>). We showed the <italic>in vitro</italic> ability of <italic>B. bifidum</italic> PRL2010 to cross-feed on sugars released by the starch- and/or xylan-degrading activities of <italic>B. adolescentis</italic> 22L, <italic>B. breve</italic> 12L, and <italic>B. thermophilum</italic> JCM1207. The generated information advances our knowledge on the metabolic adaptability and versatility of these strains, which no doubt will facilitate colonization of the human gut. Interestingly, when <italic>B. bifidum</italic> PRL2010 was co-cultivated with <italic>B. breve</italic> 12L we observed effects on the transcriptomes of both strains, apparently affecting the glycolytic pathway. The observed transcriptional changes may represent a molecular example of a mutualistic relationship between these two bifidobacterial strains, perhaps being a reflection of their common ecological origin, i.e., the infant gut.</p><p>The precise characterization of such complex interactions between gut microbiota members is pivotal in the process of modulation of the composition of the intestinal microbial population, especially during probiotic treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank GenProbio s.r.l. for financial support of the Laboratory of Probiogenomics.
