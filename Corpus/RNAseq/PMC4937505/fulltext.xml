This triggers an adaptive response called the &#x0201c;unfolded protein response&#x0201d; (UPR), and prolonged exposure to ER stress leads to cell death. Caspases are reported to play a critical role in ER stress-induced cell death but the underlying mechanisms by which they exert their effect continue to remain elusive. To understand the role caspases play during ER stress, a systems level approach integrating analysis of the transcriptome, proteome, and proteolytic substrate profile was employed. This quantitative analysis revealed transcriptional profiles for most human genes, provided information on protein abundance for 4476 proteins, and identified 445 caspase substrates. Based on these data sets many caspase substrates were shown to be downregulated at the protein level during ER stress suggesting caspase activity inhibits their cellular function. Additionally, RNA sequencing revealed a role for caspases in regulation of ER stress-induced transcriptional pathways and gene set enrichment analysis showed expression of multiple gene targets of essential transcription factors to be upregulated during ER stress upon inhibition of caspases. Furthermore, these transcription factors were degraded in a caspase-dependent manner during ER stress. These results indicate that caspases play a dual role in regulating the cellular response to ER stress through both post-translational and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, this study provides unique insight into progression of the unfolded protein response into cell death, which may help identify therapeutic strategies to treat ER stress-related diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="G1"><sup>1</sup></xref> stress results from the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER, subsequently activating a coordinated adaptive program, termed the &#x0201c;unfolded protein response&#x0201d; (UPR). The ability of a cell to detect and circumvent ER stress during times of elevated physiological demand for protein folding is key to maintaining cellular homeostasis. ER stress has been linked to many diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and diabetes (Reviewed in (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)); therefore, understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of this pathway are important for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for a wide range of disease pathologies.</p><p>Mammalian cells have three key mediators of the ER stress response: double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1&#x003b1; (IRE1&#x003b1;), and Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6). Once misfolded proteins are detected, PERK, IRE1&#x003b1;, and ATF6 activate transcription factors that are released to the nucleus, where they initiate a transcriptional response primarily involved in cellular adaptation and survival (Reviewed in (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)). Additionally, the kinase domain of PERK phosphorylates elongation initiation factor 2&#x003b1; (eIF2&#x003b1;) suppressing general translation, whereas the endo-ribonuclease domain of IRE1&#x003b1; degrades nascent mRNA. These cellular adaptations promote cell survival by preventing an influx of additional nascent polypeptides into the ER and provide the cell with an opportunity to degrade or fold proteins that have already accumulated. If the underlying cause of stress is not properly resolved, apoptotic cell death can occur, however the mechanisms that regulate induction of cell death in response to ER stress are unknown.</p><p>Caspases are a family of cysteine aspartate-specific proteases involved in cell death and inflammation (Reviewed in (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)). There are three main classes of caspases: those involved in inflammation, apoptotic initiators, and apoptotic executioners. Apoptotic initiators such as caspase-8 and -9 exist as inactive monomers that upon dimerization undergo auto-proteolysis between the large and small subunits to create a stable, active dimer. Executioner caspases including caspase-3 or -7 exist as inactive dimers that subsequently become activated by proteolytic cleavage between the large and small subunit by active initiator caspases. Interestingly, introduction of an active executioner caspase into any mammalian cell induces cell death, however, the underlying mechanisms are not well characterized. Several studies have investigated the role of specific caspases known to become activated during ER stress, however, the exact process by which caspases induce cell death in response to ER stress, remain elusive (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>In this study, a comprehensive systems level approach was used to profile the biological response to ER stress and resultant data were interrogated to better understand the role of caspases during ER stress. Taken together, these data reveal a dual regulatory role for caspases in ER stress-induced cell death: a post-translational regulatory role controlling protein expression of direct caspase substrates and a transcriptional regulatory role that controls expression of genes involved in cell fate decisions in response to ER stress. Furthermore, this study provides unique insight into the progression of the UPR at the transcript, protein, and post-translational level providing a valuable resource for further investigation into the cellular response to ER stress.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Cell Culture and Reagents</title><p>HeLa cells and HCT116 cells maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml penicillin/streptomycin.

Peptides were eluted directly into an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA) at a spray voltage of 1.2 kV using an Advance CaptiveSpray ionization source (Michrom BioResources/Bruker, Auburn, CA). For the HCD-MS2 method, precursor ions were analyzed in the orbitrap at 30,000 resolution. MS/MS was performed by isolating the 10 most abundant precursor ions with a 2-Da window, fragmented using HCD at 40% normalized collision energy, and analyzed in the orbitrap at 30,000 resolution. For the CID-MS2/HCD-MS3 method, precursor ions were analyzed in the orbitrap at 60,000 resolution. MS/MS was performed by isolating the 10 most abundant precursor ions with a 1.8-Da window, fragmented using CID at 35% normalized collision energy, and analyzed in the ion trap. Multiple fragment ions were further subjected to HCD fragmentation at a normalized collision energy of 50 and acquired at 30,000 resolution in the Orbitrap for tandem mass tag (TMT) quantitation (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>For peptide identification, ReAdW (v.4.3.1) was used to generate peaks and MS/MS spectra were searched using Mascot (v.2.3.02) against a concatenated target-decoy database comprised of human protein sequences (UniProt Dec. 2011, 119,247 total entries) and known contaminants. MS/MS spectra were searched by Mascot using trypsin or chymotrypsin plus C-terminal aspartic acid cleavage with up to four missed cleavages total. For example, the trypsin plus C-terminal aspartic acid mascot search allowed for N-terminal cleavage at K or R and C-terminal cleavage at K, R, or D with a total of four potential missed cleavages. Searches also included a 50 ppm precursor ion tolerance, and 0.8 Da fragment ion tolerance. Variable modifications were permitted for methionine oxidation (+15.9949 Da), carbamidomethylation (+57.0215) on cysteine residues and fixed TMT modification of the N terminus and lysine residues (+229.1269).

Global protein profiling (GPP) samples were further processed to a 2% protein level FDR using Protein Sieve (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Protein level data was determined by averaging peptide data; peptide level data are determined by summing peptide spectral match level TMT intensity and fed downstream as the relative abundance to the maximal intensity. Peptide spectral match level data were fed downstream as raw abundance. Only peptide spectral matches with a combined reporter ion intensity greater than 2000 were included in further analyses.

Relative peptide intensity from the caspase substrate profiling (CSP) and transcripts quantified in the RNA sequencing data set were clustered in a similar way, except that cluster number was set to 5 for caspase substrates and 9 for transcripts.

It was observed that inhibition of caspase activity resulted in a significant reduction in cell death in both tunicamycin or thapsigargin treated cells. For example, at the 72 h time point, 48% of tunicamycin treated cells and 40% of cells treated with thapsigargin stained positive for cell death markers. In contrast, in the absence of caspase activity, only 21% and 9% of cells were positive, respectively.

The exact role of caspases in this process, however, remains unclear. To investigate the involvement of caspases in ER stress-induced cell death, a study was conducted to monitor the kinetics of caspase substrate cleavage during ER stress. HeLa cells were treated for 0 to 72 h with tunicamycin and lysed in a urea-based lysis buffer. To determine which caspases become activated in response to ER stress, Western blot analysis was used to examine proteolytic cleavage and activation of caspases-2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10 during ER stress (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M115.055376/DC1">Supplemental Fig. 1A</ext-link>).

We postulated that identification of caspase substrates where caspase activity leads to loss of protein expression may help identify which caspase substrates are likely responsible for caspase-dependent cell death. To better understand the effect of ER stress on caspase substrates at the protein level, global protein profiling was performed. Whole cell lysate samples from each of the six time points described in the caspase substrate profiling experiment were proteolytically digested, chemically labeled with TMT and chromatographically fractionated using a high pH reverse phase gradient.

Using this approach, substrates that were post-transcriptionally downregulated and therefore likely degraded in a caspase-dependent manner were identified. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>D</italic> shows data for MAGED2 which has transcript level and caspase substrate product abundance inversely correlated with protein level. It is transcriptionally upregulated, downregulated at the protein level, and cleaved by caspases after 24 h of treatment with tunicamycin. This pattern strongly suggests that expression levels of MAGED2 are downregulated most likely as a result of proteolytic cleavage by caspases leading to increased protein turnover during ER stress. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>E</italic> shows the correlation plot for Sequestosome/p62, an example of a substrate where all three data sets are highly correlated. Sequestosome is upregulated both at the transcriptional and at the protein level and therefore it is uncertain whether caspase cleavage of this protein would impact the ability of Sequestosome to carry out cellular processes. MAP3K7 is an example of a caspase substrate that is downregulated at the protein level but transcript levels remain flat throughout the treatment window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>F</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>). Because transcript levels are largely unaffected, downregulation of MAP3K7 at the protein level is likely a result of direct caspase activity. Last, caspase substrates like the E3 ubiquitin ligase UHRF1 have transcript levels highly correlated with protein level data. These substrates are downregulated both transcriptionally and at the protein level, and although loss of function may contribute to cell death in response to ER stress, it is unclear whether these proteins are downregulated in a caspase-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>G</italic>) (See all 346 correlation plots in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M115.055376/DC1">supplemental Fig. S5</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Caspase-dependent Transcriptional Regulation Occurs During ER Stress</title><p>Based on the observation that many caspase substrates appeared to be transcriptionally downregulated, the impact of caspases on the transcriptional response to ER stress was investigated.

To address this, RNA sequencing was performed to determine the impact of ER stress on transcription in the presence or absence of caspase activity.

Using immunoaffinity enrichment of caspase substrates combined with global proteome profiling and RNA sequencing, we were able to identify caspase substrates that are post-transcriptionally downregulated at the protein level. This analysis allowed identification of proteins that are deactivated by caspases and thereby potentially contributing to cell death. Unexpectedly, transcription levels of many caspase substrates were greatly downregulated during ER stress. Based on this observation we investigated the role of caspases in transcriptional regulation in response to ER stress. Our findings show that activity of caspases on transcription factors CREB1, STAT6, and SRF resulted in a loss of expression of these three proteins thereby preventing expression of a subset of their target genes. This previously unappreciated role for caspases in transcriptional regulation is likely playing a role in cell fate decisions during chronic ER stress by altering the balance of cell survival and cell death.</p></sec><sec><title>Caspases Directly Regulate Protein Expression Through Proteolytic Cleavage of Substrates</title><p>Proteolytic cleavage of substrates by caspases could result in a number of outcomes: (1) loss of function of the protein, (2) the cleavage product could act as a dominant negative and inhibit normal cellular function of the uncleaved protein, (3) activation of a novel function of that protein, or (4) have no effect at all. Furthermore, newly formed proteolysis products may have varying stabilities, with some neo-peptides either stabilized or destabilized in comparison to their uncleaved precursor. This adds additional caveats when interpreting protein level data, as this is determined through averaging peptide level data. However, in general, averaging peptide abundance to determine the protein level is still the most feasible way to quantify protein levels on a global scale. With these considerations in mind, we believe our data show that the majority of caspase substrates identified have reduced protein levels during ER stress (346/445) indicating that caspase activity most likely results in loss of function for these proteins. It has long been thought that caspases induce cell death through deactivation of many proteins and that it is the cumulative effect of cleaving many proteins that ultimately results in the cell's demise. Further investigation into these caspase substrates that are downregulated at the protein level will be required to fully appreciate whether loss of expression of substrates identified in this study are sufficient for cell death.</p><p>Interestingly several clusters appear to show a decrease in caspase substrate abundance at the 48 h time point (clusters 1, 3, 4, and 5). We see this same pattern in peptides immunoprecipitated from both trypsin and chymotrypsin digested cell lysates (which were performed separately), suggesting this variation is likely biological rather than technical (see Rb example, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M115.055376/DC1">supplemental Fig. S3</ext-link>). More studies are required to further characterize this observation and to determine whether fluctuations in caspase activity, protein synthesis, protein turnover or all of the above are playing a role in this decrease in caspase cleavage product late in the ER stress response.</p><p>Many substrates identified in this study are known to play key roles in the ER stress response. For example, calreticulin, Ero1A, and several heat shock proteins (Hsp105, Hsp74L, and Hsp7C) that serve as protein folding chaperones were all identified as caspase substrates in this analysis. These proteins are known to play an important role in protein folding and thus it is tempting to speculate that caspases may actively inhibit this process. Moreover, proteins involved in ER trafficking and ER-associated degradation (CopA, Sec24D, Sec16A, Sec62, and Sequestosome/p62) are also revealed to be caspase substrates in this study. These results strongly suggest that one function of caspase activation may be to counteract the adaptive phase of the UPR by preventing proper protein folding and degradation, thereby driving cells into apoptosis.</p><p>Some of the substrates identified also play an important role in cancer and tumor metastasis. As many of these proteins are important for cellular growth and proliferation, it is not entirely unexpected that these would be caspase substrates if the ultimate aim of caspase activation is cell death. For example, YAP and Rb are both cleaved by caspases and degraded in a caspase dependent manner. These substrates are particularly interesting because of their well-known role in cellular proliferation and cell cycle control, respectively. Caspase-mediated inhibition of these proteins is likely to impact cell survival and indicates that caspases not only actively induce cell death but also prevent cell survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Caspases Indirectly Regulate Protein Expression Through Proteolytic Cleavage of Transcription Factors</title><p>Using gene set enrichment analysis, we identified transcription factors for which a significant number of transcriptional target genes were upregulated in response to caspase inhibition. Analogous to their target genes, several of these transcription factors displayed greater than 2-fold change in gene expression in response to caspase inhibition and were therefore excluded from further analyses (for example, EGR1 and ATF3, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/M115.055376/DC1">supplemental Table S7</ext-link>). However, some transcription factors including CREB1, STAT6, and SRF, exhibited only minor gene expression changes compared with their target genes in response to caspase inhibition. Interestingly, in contrast to their gene expression profile, these transcription factors displayed drastic changes in protein level expression suggesting caspases could be playing a role in regulating expression of these proteins during ER stress. Furthermore, Western blot analyses confirmed that during ER stress, CREB1, STAT6, and SRF are all degraded in a caspase dependent manner.</p><p>CREB1 is a member of the leucine zipper family of CRE sequence binding proteins that has been shown to play an important role in cellular growth, proliferation, and may contribute to the development of cancer. CREB1 has been previously shown to play a role in protection against tunicamycin treatment in rat cells potentially through competition for CRE binding sites with ATF4 and ATF6 that would otherwise upregulate a pro-apoptotic gene expression profile (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Additionally, CREB1 has also been shown to be a caspase substrate in response to treatment with the pan-kinase inhibitor staurosporine (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Combining these observations with the results of this study, one could hypothesize that CREB1 initially plays a pro-survival role in the early stages of ER stress, however following caspase activation, CREB1 is degraded in a caspase-dependent manner in order to allow for expression of pro-apoptotic genes.</p><p>Similarly, SRF has previously been described as a caspase substrate in response to extrinsic apoptosis inducers and cleavage of SRF results in a loss of c-Fos expression (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). SRF is a member of the MADS family of transcription factors that binds to Serum Response Elements (SRE) and leads to stimulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. In conditions where caspases are inhibited, for instance in viral infection or chemical perturbation, both CREB1 and SRF induce expression of genes that are pro-survival. Caspase regulation of these transcription factors may aim to extinguish expression of a subset of prosurvival genes normally regulated by these two proteins.</p><p>In contrast to SRF and CREB1, STAT6 has never been previously shown to be a caspase substrate prior to this study. STAT6 is a STAT family transcription factor found to upregulate expression of pro-survival Bcl-2 family members in response to IL-4 treatment of B cells (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). During ER stress, STAT6 is cleaved and unlike CREB1 and SRF, the protein is not degraded but rather is present as a stable, lower molecular weight fragment. Based on antibody epitope and molecular weight shift by Western blot we have determined that cleavage of STAT6 results in a loss of the C terminus including the LXXLL motif known to be important for dimerization with transcriptional co-regulatory proteins (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). This truncated STAT6 may potentially act as a dominant negative because the protein homodimerizes during transcriptional activation. One gene upregulated by STAT6 during ER stress in the absence of caspase activity is CITED2 (Cbp/p300-interacting transactivator 2), which plays a role in cellular differentiation and loss of expression of this gene is associated with congenital cardiovascular defects. Furthermore, STAT6 activation also leads to upregulation of Sgk1, which is known to phosphorylate and activate CREB1. Although further experiments are required to fully assess the relationship between STAT6 and CREB1, it is possible that STAT6 plays a role in CREB1 activation in response to ER stress.</p><p>Overall in this study, quantitative proteomic approaches combined with gene expression profiling and transcription factor gene set analysis were employed to identify caspase substrates that are deactivated during chronic exposure to ER stress. The identities of proteins responsible for caspase-dependent cell death have long remained elusive. Our study has revealed the identity of 346 caspase substrates downregulated at the protein level during ER stress, likely resulting in cell death. Only through integration of multiple data sets could we determine a transcriptional regulatory role for caspases during ER stress. These data sets can inform future systems-level studies as well as studies focused on a particular protein of interest. Moreover, these results can be further queried to identify unique signatures of ER stress that may lead to the identification of relevant, measurable biomarkers to be used in studies focusing on ER stress-related disease pathologies.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec>
