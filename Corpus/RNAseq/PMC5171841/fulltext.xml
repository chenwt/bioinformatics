However, the sources of heterogeneity of DNA methylation among tumours remain poorly defined. Here we capitalize on the availability of multi-platform data on thousands of human tumours to build integrative models of DNA methylation. We quantify the contribution of clinical and molecular factors in explaining intertumoral variability in DNA methylation. We show that the levels of a set of metabolic genes involved in the methionine cycle is predictive of several features of DNA methylation in tumours, including the methylation of cancer genes. Finally, we demonstrate that patients whose DNA methylation can be predicted from the methionine cycle exhibited improved survival over cases where this regulation is disrupted. This study represents a comprehensive analysis of the determinants of methylation and demonstrates the surprisingly large interaction between metabolism and DNA methylation variation.

Altered DNA methylation is a feature of cancer and between-patient variability is prevalent. Here, the authors integrate data on thousands of human tumours, and find that expression levels of methionine metabolism genes are predictive of methylation features, and that the breakdown of this relationship is a negative prognostic marker.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>DNA methylation is a major epigenetic mechanism that determines cellular outcome by regulating gene expression and chromatin organization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> in a manner more dynamic than previously appreciated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

While inter-tissue variability in DNA methylation is mainly explained by differentiation and tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, very little is known about the functions and determinants of the high inter-individual variation among tumours of the same tissue type. Notably, a recent twin study on the determinants of inter-individual variability in DNA methylation reported that genetic difference among individuals account for only 20&#x00025; of total variance with the remaining variance explained by environmental and stochastic factors that are yet to be identified<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>The source of the methyl group for methylation is <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is generated from the methionine (met) cycle and is coupled to serine, glycine, one-carbon (SGOC) metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.

Although the network contributes methyl units to DNA, whether and to what extent this interaction is apparent in tumours and may contribute to cancer biology is unknown.</p><p>We set out to comprehensively quantify the contribution of various factors in explaining variation in DNA methylation. The advent of standardized genomics and other high-dimensional multi-platform &#x02018;omics' data through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) allows for systematic assessments of molecular features across cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. With combined statistical analysis, computational modelling and machine-learning approaches, we directly evaluated the quantitative contributions of molecular and clinical variables that lead to DNA methylation. We found a surprisingly large contribution for the expression of the methionine cycle and related SGOC network genes in explaining DNA methylation and identified numerous contexts, where this interaction may contribute to cancer pathology.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Quantification of the determinants of DNA methylation</title><p>It has been previously proposed that factors normally regulating the epigenome are disrupted in cancer, leading to increased variability of the cancer epigenome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. However, the nature and contributions of such factors are largely unknown. On analysis of global and local DNA methylation in tumours as measured by the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip arrays, we indeed found higher variation among tumours from the same tissue versus between different tissue types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a&#x02013;d</xref>; Methods). Arrays were used over bisulfite sequencing because of the higher availability of these data in a standardized format allowing for an integrative analysis. To establish quantitative relationships between DNA methylation and molecular and clinical features of tumours, we developed an integrative statistical modelling and machine-learning approach with the goal of identifying the relative contributions to within-cancer DNA methylation variation (Methods). We incorporated hundreds of variables into comprehensive statistical models of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Factors with a known role in DNA methylation machinery (chromatin remodelling enzymes and transcription factors), as well as factors with a potential biochemical link to DNA methylation (SAM metabolizing enzymes, met cycle enzymes and other SGOC enzymes that are connected to the met cycle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) were together considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We also curated available clinical information such as age, gender and cancer stage in the calculations, where appropriate. Furthermore, since mutations are known to affect the cancer methylome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, we included all recurrent genetic lesions (somatic mutations and copy number alterations) for each cancer type in our models. Together, over 200 variables were collectively analysed for each cancer type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Our models are therefore not completely agnostic as we pre-select classes of biological variables that are known to affect DNA methylation to avoid loss of statistical power by including too many features (for example, expression of all genes in the genome). Therefore, to test for potential bias, we also considered the expression levels of sets of random genes with functions non-related to DNA methylation as additional variables in our models (see Methods). Subsequently, we incorporated all variables into unbiased selection algorithms suitable for dealing with large numbers of prediction variables. For this task, we considered two independent approaches: a generalized linear model (Elastic Net<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and a machine-learning algorithm (Random Forest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). A distinct computation was carried out for each 10&#x02009;kb genomic region with variable methylation (s.d.&#x0003e;0.2) in each cancer type. Samples of each cancer type were divided into three independent test subsets and three training subsets, and separate models were generated using each subset. The models were then combined resulting in a single final model for each 10&#x02009;kb region of DNA methylation in each cancer. Model performance was evaluated by measuring mean squared prediction error of test samples from Elastic Net and Random Forest separately (Methods).</p><p>We observed that our models predicted test set DNA methylation with small mean squared error (MSE&#x0003c;0.04) in many regions across the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Comparison of the performances of the two methods showed that Random Forest and Elastic Net algorithms were able to predict DNA methylation with comparable MSEs on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). In general, predictability of local DNA methylation was largely dependent on cancer type as well as chromatin region in each model. For example, we observed that local DNA methylation was most predictable in prostate and lung cancers and least predictable in liver and bladder cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Together with the high variation in local DNA methylation levels seen in liver and bladder cancers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>), these results suggest a higher stochasticity in the epigenetic signatures for these two cancer types compared with others in this study. On annotating genomic regions, where local DNA methylation could be predicted with a low error (MSE&#x0003c;0.04) in each cancer, we found that the majority of the predictable regions lie within 20&#x02009;kb of the transcriptional start site (TSS) of a gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>), suggesting that regulation of DNA methylation by the factors included in our models is stronger at genic regions.</p><p>We next performed a set of tests to evaluate the robustness of our modelling approach. To this end, we compared the original gene expression variables included in our models with a group of variance-matched randomly selected genes from the genome (see Methods) in their ability to predict DNA methylation. In the presence of both groups of gene expression variables (original and random), both Elastic Net and Random Forest models selected our original variables significantly more frequently than random genes (higher rank corresponds to higher contribution; Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>P</italic> value=0.0007 for Elastic Net and &#x0003c;0.0001 for Random Forest; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>; see Methods). When the same test was performed in the presence of five additional common gene families (receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), receptor serine kinases (RSK), Toll-like receptors (TLR), MAPK signalling (MAPK) and WNT signaling (WNT)), all but RTKs ranked significantly lower (Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.0001) than the original gene expression variables that we initially included in our models based on biological functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>; Methods). Together, these tests provide additional validation and confirm that the Elastic Net and Random Forest algorithms are suitable for quantitation of variable contributions in determining DNA methylation. Given that our models are not completely agnostic, we do not rule out the possibility of existence of potentially highly contributing factors other than the hundreds of variables that we considered (for example, RTKs). As such, the results should be interpreted in the context of relative contributions among the variables included and the abilities of these variables in predicting DNA methylation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Metabolism is a major predictor of DNA methylation in cancer</title><p>Using the results of the integrative modelling, we next quantified the relative contribution of different functional classes of variables in explaining DNA methylation variation within each cancer type. For this, we measured two independent metrics, one using the Random Forest variable importance scores, and the other using a binary score for whether or not a variable was selected by the Elastic Net models (non-zero coefficient). For each variable, an overall importance score was calculated by averaging its relative importance across all models of 10&#x02009;kb DNA methylations, and an overall usage score was calculated by measuring the fraction of 10&#x02009;kb regions in which Elastic Net models selected the variable (Methods). To estimate the contribution of each functional class of variables in explaining total variation in DNA methylation, we pooled all variables in the same functional category and averaged across their importance and usage scores separately (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>).</p><p>Results from both Random Forest and Elastic Net algorithms identified a considerable contribution from the variables within the SGOC metabolic network relative to other classes of variables (&#x02018;other SGOC enzymes' was the second highest scoring among all classes, closely following &#x02018;transcription factors' according to both methods. &#x02018;methionine cycle enzymes' was the third and fourth according to Random Forest and Elastic Net, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Previous studies have shown that transcription factor abundance and occupancy strongly mediate dynamic DNA methylation turnover in regulatory regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Consistent with this observation, our results confirm the &#x02018;transcription factors' class has the highest contribution to predicting DNA methylation levels across human tumours. Notably, even in the presence of most if not all known variables that are thought to mediate the status of DNA methylation, metabolic factors still uniquely explained a large part of the variability in methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>).</p><p>Given the contribution of the methionine cycle and its biochemical link to DNA methylation, we further explored the variables within the met cycle class compared with all other variables in their ability to predict DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Within the met cycle class, methionine adenosyltransferase 2 beta (MAT2B) and betaine-homocysteine <italic>S</italic>-methyltransferase 2 (BHMT2) exhibited higher predictive values than methionine synthase (MTR) and adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY) on average (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c,d</xref>). Notably, in the presence of the nearly 200 other variables in the computations, the met cycle&#x02014;especially MAT2B&#x02014;still contributed substantially to DNA methylation prediction (MAT2B was ranked among the top 5&#x00025; of highly selected variables in prostate, breast, liver, lung and brain cancers; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). We observed that the levels of MAT2B contribute to DNA methylation in nearly half of the variable regions across the genome even after accounting for various factors related to DNA methylation (MAT2B was selected by 42&#x00025; of all Elastic Net models with MSE&#x0003c;0.04 on average; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). Together, our results confirm that metabolism contributes to DNA methylation in many cases of human cancer, and the association between metabolism and DNA methylation is stronger in some genomic regions than others.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Functional annotation of metabolically regulated regions</title><p>Results of the integrative modelling across cancers indicate that defined regulation of DNA methylation happens in regions where gene expression may be affected, thereby suggesting that this regulation could drive essential cancer biology. We next set out to characterize all regions across the genome where the association between DNA methylation and the met cycle activity is particularly strong. To identify such regions, we designed a scanning algorithm to locate genomic regions spanning multiple CpGs with significant peaks of correlation of methylation with expression of met cycle enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>; Methods). We performed this analysis on each of the eight cancer types separately and identified distinct peak sets across the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). To assess potential bias towards highly methylated regions and regions where there is higher probe density, we analysed the relationship between average absolute methylation of individual CpGs and their correlation with met cycle expression, and found no significant association (<italic>P</italic> value of correlation=0.62), confirming that the identified peaks are distinct from highly methylated regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>; Methods).</p><p>Density plots of peak distributions relative to the TSS of the nearest gene were concentrated around the TSS in all cancers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>), as expected given the higher density of probes in gene regulatory regions in the Illumina arrays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). However, by further visualizing the distribution of the peaks immediately surrounding the TSS, we observed that peak distributions are more diffuse around the TSS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>) compared with the probe density distribution control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). This suggests potential enrichment in areas of the genome overlapping with gene body regions and CpG island shores, where dysregulated DNA methylation has previously been observed in human cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The peak distribution density plots extended up to a few hundred kilobases in distance from the nearest TSS, suggesting that DNA methylation at inter-genic parts of the genome may also be affected by the activity of met cycle.</p><p>We next tested the met cycle specificity of the identified peaks by correlating them with expression of randomly selected genes in the genome (Methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). For the majority (&#x0003e;83&#x00025;) of the identified peaks, the met cycle's correlation with DNA methylation was significantly non-random (<italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). These results show that our approach was able to identify genomic regions where DNA methylation levels are specifically affected by the met cycle activity.</p><p>We next set out to identify genes that overlap with the identified peaks in each cancer type. Functional annotation of genes overlapping these peaks by means of pathway enrichment analyses across a comprehensive collection of more than 70 gene-set libraries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> showed enrichment of epigenetic features in these regions consistently across all cancers. Strikingly, many of our peaks overlapped with peaks of histone-3 lysine-27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c&#x02013;f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a&#x02013;d</xref>) as reported by both the encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE) human project<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and the RoadMap epigenomics project<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In cancers of the lung and bladder, histone-3 lysine-9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) peaks were also significantly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>). H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 are both associated with repression of gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Our findings therefore suggest that variation in the met cycle's activity may contribute to aberrant expression from normally silenced loci and heterochromatin instability in cancer.</p><p>In addition to histone marks, tissue-specific and cell identity gene sets were also enriched in relevant cancer types, including &#x02018;breast and ovarian cancer genes' in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>); &#x02018;abnormal nervous system' and &#x02018;abnormal neuron morphology' in brain cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>); &#x02018;asthma' and &#x02018;lung carcinoma' gene sets in lung cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>); &#x02018;kidney-specific' gene set in kidney cancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>); and &#x02018;large intestinal genes', &#x02018;inflammatory bowel disease' and &#x02018;colorectal carcinoma' gene sets in colon cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Finally, a number of developmental and signalling pathways were among the enriched pathways, including &#x02018;transforming growth factor-beta signalling' in kidney (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>), &#x02018;cell communication' pathway in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) and &#x02018;G-protein coupled signalling' in bladder cancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>). Organ and embryonic morphogenesis pathways were enriched in breast (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>), bladder (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>) and prostate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7d</xref>), all of which are hormonally driven cancers. Interestingly, a previous study in breast cancer showed that embryonic developmental genes are enriched in regions of DNA hypomethylation compared with normal breast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Together, these results illustrate the functional importance of the relationship between met cycle and DNA methylation across cancers.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Contribution of metabolism to DNA methylation at cancer genes</title><p>So far, we have shown that there is a surprising enrichment of peak regions of metabolically regulated DNA methylation at loci that link to essential aspects of cell identity and chromatin structure. We next questioned whether cancer-specific loci may also exhibit this interaction. We chose 19 well-characterized cancer-related genes such as tumour protein p53 (<italic>TP53</italic>), phosphatase and tensin homologue (<italic>PTEN</italic>) and oestrogen receptor 1 <italic>(ESR1)</italic>, as well as 4 genes frequently differentially methylated in cancer, such as APC-WNT signaling pathway regulator adenomatous polyposis coli (<italic>APC</italic>), RAS association domain family member 1 (<italic>RASSF1</italic>), glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase pi 1 (<italic>GSTP1</italic>) and <italic>O</italic>-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (<italic>MGMT</italic>)(see Methods). A recent study showed that DNA methylation for any given gene has two major principal components: one representing the promoter region and the other representing the coding sequence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Furthermore, CpG methylation at promoter regions of genes is typically associated with repression, while gene body methylation is thought to increase expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. We therefore applied our integrative modelling to DNA methylation at promoter and gene body regions of each cancer gene separately. In addition to the integrative approach, we also generated models using only the met cycle genes as prediction variables to quantify the predictive ability of met cycle in the absence of other factors. Thus, each cancer gene locus was analysed once using the integrative approach and once using met cycle alone and threefold cross-validation was performed in each case as previously described (Methods). Model performance was evaluated by calculating the error of prediction of test set methylation, as shown for two examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>: oestrogen receptor 1 (<italic>ESR1</italic>) promoter in breast cancer (MSE=0.004; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>); and androgen receptor (<italic>AR</italic>) promoter in prostate cancer (MSE=0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). <italic>ESR1</italic> promoter methylation in breast cancer and <italic>AR</italic> promoter methylation in prostate cancer are two examples of events that are known to contribute to the pathogenesis and prognosis of the corresponding tumour types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. We further assessed the integrative models of promoter methylation at these two loci, and found many SGOC (including met cycle) variables among the top predictive variables of promoter methylation according to the variable importance measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>; Methods).</p><p>Notably, the models across all cancers in the study were able to predict cancer gene methylation with high accuracy even using the met cycle variables in the absence of all other variables (85&#x00025; of the predictions were made with MSE&#x0003c;0.01; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a,b</xref>). As in the case of local methylation, cancer gene methylation was also more strongly explained by the expression of MAT2B compared with other met cycle variables on average (selected by 24&#x00025; of all integrative models; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8c</xref>), consistent with the function of this enzyme that directly affects SAM levels. Relative variable class comparisons confirmed considerable contribution from the &#x02018;methionine cycle enzymes' and &#x02018;other SGOC enzymes' among other classes of variables (highest after &#x02018;transcription factors' and &#x02018;mutations'; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8d,e</xref>).</p><p>We independently evaluated these findings by applying the same models to both permuted cancer gene methylation values and also randomly generated methylation values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>). In all tests, met cycle contribution was significantly (<italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;10e&#x02013;16) higher when applied to cancer gene methylation versus permutations or random numbers (Methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>), confirming the specificity of signals contained in the true DNA methylation values at cancer loci. Furthermore, we tested the performance of the machine-learning algorithm using randomly generated variables for prediction of cancer gene methylation (Methods) and found in each of the cases tested that the predictions made with the original variables are uniformly more accurate than what is made using simulated random variables (original model MSE smaller by 1.4- to 2-fold than random model MSE on average; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10a&#x02013;d</xref>). We also simulated a data set where prediction variables and the response are related via linear relationships and compared the accuracy of predictions in this simulated linear data set with our original dataset (Methods). We saw in all cases that the improvement in MSE from our data set (MSE 1.4- to 2-fold smaller than random MSE) is even more than what we observed with data of the same dimension that have a linear relationship (MSE 1.3-fold smaller than random MSE; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10e,f</xref>). These independent tests confirm that machine learning using the Random Forest algorithm is able to identify non-random signals in the data, and also that it can detect nonlinear relationships between prediction variables and the response.</p><p>Next, we ranked all of the variables based on their overall usage according to the integrative models of cancer gene promoter and body methylations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Notably, many SGOC (including met cycle) enzymes were among the most frequently selected variables in all cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11a&#x02013;f</xref>). Importantly, our models highly ranked many clinical and molecular factors previously shown to be associated with DNA methylation in the existing literature (green arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11a&#x02013;f</xref>). Examples of such positive controls include DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3A or DNMT3B) enzymes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> that were consistently among the top variables in all cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11a&#x02013;f</xref>), and patient's age (or age at diagnosis)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> that was highly ranked in prostate, colon, breast, kidney and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11a&#x02013;f</xref>). We also observed oestrogen receptor (ER) status to be one of the most important contributors to DNA methylation variation in breast cancer consistent with previous publications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11b</xref>). Furthermore, we found the mutational status of the histone methyltransferase SET-domain containing-2 (<italic>SETD-2</italic>) as a significant contributor in kidney (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11c</xref>), smoking in bladder and lung (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11d,f</xref>), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (<italic>IDH1</italic>) mutational status in brain cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Each of these findings are in agreement with the current knowledge about determinants of DNA methylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. These results further validate our models and also emphasize the importance of the contribution observed for the SGOC variables (including the met cycle).</p><p>Previous work has shown that expression of enzymes across different regions of the SGOC network is predictive of metabolic flux through the network<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Notably, we observed that several SGOC genes are consistently among the highly ranked variables by both Random Forest and Elastic Net models in multiple cancer types. Therefore, to understand which features of SGOC metabolism contribute to the interaction with methylation, we defined a sub-network that was commonly highly ranked by the models in multiple cancer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h</xref>; Methods). This SGOC sub-network comprises the MAT enzymes in the met cycle (MAT2B and MAT2A), as well as enzymes within serine&#x02013;glycine metabolism such as phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and glycine amidinotransferase (GATM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h</xref>). We generally observed negative associations between DNA methylation and expression of PHGDH and GATM, but positive associations with expression of MAT enzymes. A cautionary note however is that in many disease states, levels of particular metabolites in the methionine cycle substantially deviate from physiological ranges, thus activating compensatory mechanism and leading to correlation with DNA methylation in directions opposite of what would be expected from the biochemistry of the reactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Therefore, when interpreting the direction of correlations between metabolic enzyme levels and DNA methylation, it is important to note that they not only depend on the stoichiometry of the corresponding enzymatic reactions but also on endogenous abundance of the related metabolites. Together, our results suggest that a particular flux configuration through the SGOC metabolic network&#x02014;which previous studies have shown to be predictable from gene expression patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02014;may be important for regulation of DNA methylation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cancer pathogenesis of metabolically regulated DNA methylation</title><p>Involvement of the met cycle in promoter and gene body methylation at cancer genes suggests a potential implication for this metabolic pathway in explaining part of the variability in cancer pathogenesis and patient outcome. To further assess this relationship, we divided patients in each cancer type into two groups based on overall predictability of their cancer loci methylation by the met cycle (see Methods). We then compared survival rates between the two groups (&#x02018;predictable' by met cycle versus &#x02018;not predictable' by met cycle) in each cancer type using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimator<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a&#x02013;h</xref>). An improved overall survival for the &#x02018;predictable' group was observed, although the magnitude of this trend varied depending on cancer type with brain, kidney, liver and colon cancers showing statistically significant differences (log-rank test <italic>P</italic> values: brain=3.92e&#x02013;05; liver=0.0048; kidney=0.0085; and colon=0.04; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a&#x02013;d</xref>). The difference in survival between the predictable and non-predictable groups was not significant in the rest of the cancers studied here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e&#x02013;h</xref>), possibly explained by limited power due to data censoring at later time points. The overall patterns however suggest that the regulation of DNA methylation by the met cycle may be important in maintaining a normal epigenome, and disruption of this relationship in specific subtypes of tumours can lead to high epigenetic stochasticity in those tumours that correspond to poor clinical outcomes. This is consistent with a previous study that showed DNA methylation stochasticity increased across samples with increasing malignancy (from normal to adenoma to carcinoma)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>To validate the results of our survival analyses, we applied multivariate Cox regression models to account for covariates such as mutations and clinical factors that are known to be associated with survival rates (Methods). We performed this test in the cases of brain, liver and kidney cancers, where the univariate analyses found highly significant differences between the predictable and non-predictable groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a&#x02013;c</xref>). The models including covariates still showed a significant difference (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) between the predictable and non-predictable groups of patients even after taking mutational and clinical factors into account (see Methods for the list of covariates considered in each cancer), suggesting that a unique part of variation in survival may be explained by epigenetic regulation. We next tried to further validate our results through comparison with independent analyses of the TCGA data by the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (cBioPortal)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> and Prediction of Clinical Outcome from Genomic profiles (PRECOG)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. These analyses found lower survival in prostate cancer patients harbouring tumours with deep deletions in the met cycle genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12a</xref>), and higher survival in kidney cancer patients where the met cycle enzymes are overexpressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12b</xref>). These results confirm a relationship between met cycle and survival in the same direction as predicted by our hypothesis.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we conducted a pan-cancer TCGA analysis of the molecular and clinical contributions to within-cancer (inter-individual) variation in DNA methylation. Through several lines of integrated analysis, we found the overall expression of both the methionine cycle and SGOC network to be strong predictors of multiple aspects of DNA methylation and consistently ranked as one of the highest contributing factors to cancer-associated DNA methylation such as methylation of numerous cancer genes. Within the methionine cycle, we consistently observed a more significant contribution from MAT2B and BHMT2, suggesting that the regulation may be occurring at these enzymatic steps. MAT2B is the enzyme that converts methionine to SAM, therefore it is expected that this enzyme affects SAM levels more directly than other metabolic enzymes. The significance of BHMT2 but not MTR suggests that metabolism of choline and betaine may be more prevalent than folates in cases where one-carbon metabolism fuels DNA methylation. It is important to note that given the nature of our calculations, the results do not prove causal relationships. As such, they should not be interpreted as direct evidence for regulation of DNA methylation by the model variables, but rather as predictive associations.</p><p>We introduced a novel approach to identify chromatin regions with strong correlations between DNA methylation and metabolic enzyme levels. The identified regions for the met cycle enzymes significantly overlapped with histone modifications, consistent with enzymatic cross-talk between the two epigenetic processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The enrichment of gene signatures of repressing histone marks such as H3K27me3 in all cancers points to a possible role for the met cycle in maintenance of DNA methylation at silenced loci. Previous studies have reported aberrant methylation of transcriptionally repressed genes in cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. In fact, heterochromatin instability arising from increased variability in DNA methylation is a phenomenon observed in many cancers and is thought to contribute to epigenetic plasticity and tumour progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Our results provide evidence for this model of dysregulated cancer epigenome and further suggest that disruption of the regulation of DNA methylation by the met cycle&#x02014;which can be a cause or consequence of tumorigenesis&#x02014;may be one of the sources of methylation stochasticity leading to higher malignancy. Survival analyses confirm that tumours with a weaker association between their cancer gene methylation and the met cycle expression are more malignant in comparison with tumours wherein this relationship is closer to normal. In addition to epigenetic overlaps, genes with important tissue-specific functions and disease states were also found to fall under the metabolism&#x02013;DNA methylation peaks. DNA methylation at cell-type-related disease and lineage-specific genes has previously been shown to be dynamic and functionally important<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Our results further strengthen the idea that met cycle regulation of methylation is strongly associated with normal tissue function.</p><p>Application of the integrative modelling to cancer genes revealed a major role for MAT enzymes (MAT2B and MAT2A), as well as PHGDH and GATM&#x02014;enzymes involved in serine and glycine metabolism, respectively. Importantly, MAT2B and MAT2A have been shown to co-localize in nuclei and bind DNA through complex formation with chromatin binding proteins providing direct evidence for the role of these enzymes in regulation of transcription via methylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Our results illustrate that higher levels of MAT2B are associated with more &#x02018;regulated' methylation and higher survival, suggesting potentials for genetic or dietary interventions with methionine cycle intermediates in cancer patients. PHGDH diverts the glycolytic flux into the <italic>de novo</italic> serine synthesis pathway that allows glycolysis to provide methyl units. GATM diverts glycine into the creatine synthesis pathway in which SAM is consumed to produce creatine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Creatine synthesis is therefore in competition with the methionine cycle over cellular pools of SAM, explaining why enzymes within the serine&#x02013;glycine metabolism generally tend to be negatively correlated with the met cycle and DNA methylation.</p><p>Overall, this study provides the first comprehensive quantification of the determinants of inter-individual DNA methylation variation in human cancers. The activity of the methionine cycle that emerges in these findings could be either sensed directly by the DNA, or indirectly through interplay with dynamic histone methylation, which itself is tightly regulated by the status of methionine metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Owing to limitation in the coverage of the DNA methylation arrays, it remains to be determined if our findings are generalizable to methylation across the entire genome, including all non-CpG methylation sites as well as hydroxy-methylation sites. Nevertheless these findings altogether identify metabolism as a major determinant of DNA methylation status in human cancer. It is important to note that the current TCGA data set contains one sample per individual tumour and therefore our conclusions do not necessarily explain the variation in clonal populations within a given tumour. Future studies using multiple samples per tumour or single-cell epigenomics are therefore required to characterize the determinants of intratumour epigenetic heterogeneity. Finally, our study identifies an association between altered tumour metabolism and DNA methylation, while the sources of alterations in metabolism itself remain to be elucidated but can be addressed using similar approaches.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data curation</title><p>Publically available genome-wide mRNA expression and DNA methylation data were downloaded from TCGA portal (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/">https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/</ext-link>).

We performed this test on local DNA methylations (all variable 10&#x02009;kb regions) in brain cancer (lower-grade glioma) as an example and repeated the integrative modelling using this set of randomly selected genes in addition to all other variables present in the original models. All gene expression variables were then ranked using a similar approach as described above.

To further test our gene expression variables against other gene families, five popular gene sets were considered: RTK, RSK, TLR, MAPK signalling and WNT signalling families. The list of genes in these families were obtained from the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/genefamilies/">http://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/genefamilies/</ext-link>).

In each cancer type, we first selected one of the major enzymes in the met cycle with the highest overall Spearman correlation with global and local DNA methylations (<italic>BHMT2</italic> in brain, breast, prostate and liver; <italic>MAT2B</italic> in lung and bladder; and <italic>AHCY</italic> in colon and kidney cancers), and calculated the Spearman correlation between its expression and the beta value of each individual probe across the genome. We then sorted the probes according to genomic coordinates and aligned the &#x02212;log10 of the <italic>P</italic> values obtained from the Spearman correlations along the chromosomes. Next, we applied a sliding window scan for regions of strong association across the genome separately in each cancer type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). For this, probes with the highest correlations (top 10&#x00025; across the genome) were located and a 6&#x02009;kb window (&#x0002b;3 and &#x02212;3&#x02009;kb) flanking the genomic coordinate of the original probe was scanned. A region was reported as a &#x02018;peak' if the following criteria were met: (1) region included at least three probes with a correlation in the same direction as the original probe (positive or negative); (2) at least 80&#x00025; of all probes within the region had a significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.00001) correlations with met cycle expression. After applying these filters, the selected regions were annotated and genes overlapping with each of the peaks were used for subsequent pathway enrichment analyses.

This function finds all turning points (peaks and pits) in a series of points (in this case, aligned correlation coefficients), and calculates the information quantity of each turning point using Kendall's information theory. Finally, it measures a <italic>P</italic> value against a random distribution of the turning points in a given series, with smaller <italic>P</italic> values corresponding to less random shape and a higher probability of a turning point corresponding to a real peak or pit. We selected regions containing turning points with the most significant <italic>P</italic> values (lowest 20&#x00025;) in each cancer type and subsequently tested them for specificity for the met cycle as described in the following section.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Test of specificity of peaks for the met cycle</title><p>Each of the selected peaks was tested for specificity of their correlations with the met cycle expression (versus gene expression in general). For this, 500 genes were randomly selected from the genome in each cancer type, and the Spearman correlation coefficient was measured between their expression and the methylation of every probe within a given peak. The fraction of significant correlations was calculated for all of the 500 genes as well as for the met cycle gene. A randomization <italic>q</italic>-value was calculated for the met cycle gene by comparing it with the distribution of the correlations calculated for the 500 random genes.

In the first case, we permuted the DNA methylation values of each cancer gene, and repeated the modelling using the met cycle variables. In the second case, we generated random beta values (from uniform distribution in the range of 0&#x02013;1) and used those as the response variables in the calculations.
