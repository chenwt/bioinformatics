The liver, in particular, plays a crucial role in adaptive metabolic adjustment during hibernation. Studies on ground squirrels and bears reveal that many genes involved in metabolism are differentially expressed during hibernation. Especially, the genes involved in carbohydrate catabolism are down-regulated during hibernation, while genes responsible for lipid &#x003b2;-oxidation are up-regulated. However, there is little transcriptional evidence to suggest physiological changes to the liver during hibernation in the greater horseshoe bat, a representative heterothermic bat. In this study, we explored the transcriptional changes in the livers of active and torpid greater horseshoe bats using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. A total of 1358 genes were identified as differentially expressed during torpor. In the functional analyses, differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in metabolic depression, shifts in the fuel utilization, immune function and response to stresses. Our findings provide a comprehensive evidence of differential gene expression in the livers of greater horseshoe bats during active and torpid states and highlight potential evidence for physiological adaptations that occur in the liver during hibernation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.

During torpor, the minimum body temperature of mammalian hibernators can drop below freezing and the minimum torpor metabolic rate can decrease to 4.3% of basal metabolic rate [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], which enables hibernators to conserve as much as 90% of their normal energy usage [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The liver, as a critical organ for metabolism, is likely to play a major role in physiological regulation during hibernation [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Energy metabolism during hibernation involves an important physiological transition in fuel utilization, i.e. shifting from carbohydrate oxidation to the catabolism of fat [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Lipid stored in white adipose tissue is hydrolyzed by lipase and converted to free fatty acids and glycerol during hibernation, a state of negative energy balance [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the liver, glycerol and free fatty acids can be converted to glucose and ketone bodies, respectively. The ketone bodies can then be transmitted to other tissues as an energy source [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145702.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The hibernation phenotype results from modulation of existing mammalian biochemical capabilities through the differential expression of existing genes [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and much effort has been devoted to determining the genes that are differentially expressed during hibernation. In the liver, genes involved in carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolism, detoxification and molecular transport were identified as differentially expressed between active and hibernating ground squirrels, with most of these genes down-regulated during hibernation [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the American black bear (<italic>Ursus americanus</italic>), a large mammalian hibernator, comparison of microarrays between the livers of active and hibernating bears identified more than 300 differentially expressed genes; the majority of the genes that were over-expressed during hibernation play a role in protein biosynthesis and fatty acid catabolism while the genes with lower expression have roles in lipid biosynthesis and carbohydrate catabolism [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145702.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although these studies are valuable for increasing our understanding of the physiology of the liver in mammalian hibernators, animals used in these studies were limited to squirrels and bears, and little is known about the changes of gene expression in the liver of hibernating bats.</p><p>Bats (order Chiroptera) are the only mammals capable of sustained flight [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and hibernating species exhibit a typical mammalian hibernation behavior. Because of bats&#x02019; small body size, high energy consumption when active, and limited fat storage capacity, winter hibernation is important for bats facing fluctuating food supplies (especially strictly insectivorous bats living in temperate regions) [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145702.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Horseshoe bats from temperate regions are well-known hibernators [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145702.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The greater horseshoe bat is a small insectivorous bat widely distributed in Europe, Africa, South Asia and Australia and China and has become a model species in the hibernation studies of bats [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145702.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. During hibernation their body temperature during hibernation drops from 40&#x000b0;C to 8&#x000b0;C and torpor bouts vary between 0.1 and 11.8 days, with individual means ranging from 1.3 to 7.4 days [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145702.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Several studies have investigated the changes of gene expression in the brain of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic> in summer active and winter torpid episodes [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145702.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but there has been little effort to characterize changes in the transcriptome profile of the liver during hibernation, despite its critical role in a number of processes that are likely to be crucial for survival of hibernators. In general, there is a paucity of information on changes in the hepatic transcriptome during hibernation in bats: in their genomic study on the physiology and longevity of brandt&#x02019;s bat (<italic>Myotis brandtii</italic>), Seim et al. (2013) present a short description of the gene expression in the liver of hibernating <italic>M</italic>.<italic>brandtii</italic> but detailed reports on the changes in hepatic gene expression in bats are still lacking [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In this study we sought to answer two main questions: 1) Are the changes in the liver transcriptome of hibernating <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic> consistent with previous studies on other mammals? 2) Are the functions of the genes that are differentially expressed in the liver between active and torpid state similar to functions of the genes that are differentially expressed in the brain of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic>? To understand this, we sequenced the transcriptomes of liver tissues of active and hibernating greater horseshoe bats using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform to obtain a comprehensive of changes in hepatic genes expression of bats from active state to torpid state.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>According to the regulations of Wildlife Conservation of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China (Chairman Decree [2004] No.24), permits are required only for species included in the list of state-protected and region-protected wildlife species. <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic> is not an endangered or region-protected animal species, so no specific permission was required.

All individuals were caught in the Ground cave (125&#x000b0;50'25'' E, 41&#x000b0;4'8'' N) in Ji'an city, Jilin Province of Northeast China. Eight bats were captured in September 2011 (active state) and the others were captured in December 2011 (torpid state). The average weight of active bats was 23.44 &#x000b1; 1.30 g, and that of torpid bats was 20.32 &#x000b1; 2.18 g. It is quite difficult to get a time point during an inter-bout arousal, so only the summer active and winter torpid samples were collected in this study. Active individuals were transported to the laboratory and maintained under conditions of 21&#x02013;22&#x000b0;C air temperature and 40% relative humidity, with food and water ad libitum. These animals were sacrificed after a total of 48 hours. Hibernating individuals were transported to the laboratory and placed in an artificial climate cabinet (HPG-280HX, HDL, China), with conditions of constant darkness, an ambient temperature of 5.5&#x02013;5.7&#x000b0;C, 40&#x02013;60% relative humidity and no food provided, and allowed to re-enter the torpid phase of hibernation. After 12 hours the bats were sacrificed, with a body temperature close to the ambient temperature (approximate 8.0&#x000b0;C) and having no response to stimulus (sound, touch and light).</p><p>All animals were euthanized by decapitation to minimize potential pain and suffering. Surgical procedures were promptly performed to protect RNA from degradation.

The first 20 bases of each paired-end read were compared and the best quality reads were reserved when the first 20 bases were identical. After processing the raw reads, trans-ABySS (v 1.3.2), a <italic>de novo</italic> short-read transcriptome assembly and analysis pipeline, was used to assemble reads [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In detail, first we ran multiple ABySS assemblies with k-mer range from 26 to 50 bp by the recommended parameters &#x0201c;abyss-pe E = 0 n = 5 v = -v k = $k OVERLAP_OPTIONS = '&#x02014;no-scaffold' SIMPLEGRAPH_OPTIONS = '&#x02014;no-scaffold' MERGEPATHS_OPTIONS = '&#x02014;greedy'&#x0201d;. Trans-ABySS was then used to merge the different kmer assemblies into a single assembly. The choice of k-mer sizes depends on the read length of an RNAseq library. For reads lengths of 50 bp, we used 26 to 50 as suggested. To obtain a more reliable reference database for downstream analysis, processed reads of both active and torpid libraries were used to produce the assembly.

Messenger RNA samples from livers of 10 individuals (5 active, 5 torpid), which were randomly selected from the previous 16 individuals, were converted to cDNA templates. Quantitive real-time PCR was performed using StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystem) and an automatic threshold calculated by the StepOne software v2.1. For each sample, two technical replicates of each PCR reaction were run. For each target gene, reactions of all biological replicates (i.e., all samples) in the active and torpid state were completed on one plate to eliminate inter-run deviation.

The genes in the lipid metabolic process (GO: 0006629) that were down-regulated during torpor (<italic>AGPAT2</italic> and <italic>ACSF3</italic>) are involved in lipid biosynthesis while the up-regulated genes (<italic>ACOT12</italic>, <italic>ACOX1</italic>, <italic>EHHADH</italic>, and <italic>SLC27A6</italic>) are associated with fatty acid beta-oxidation, and fatty acid transport (<xref rid="pone.0145702.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0145702.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).

However, there were two immune-related pathways that were significantly annotated by down-regulated genes in the torpid liver, including complement and coagulation cascades (ko04610) and antigen processing and presentation (ko04612); however the number of down-regulated genes enriched in the two pathways was obviously lower than that of up-regulated genes in the torpid liver enriched in immune-related pathways (<xref rid="pone.0145702.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). In addition, three KEGG pathways, proteasome (ko03050), ubiquitin mediated proteolysis (ko04120) and DNA replication (ko03030) were found only enriched by up-regulated genes in the torpid state, which indicates an increase in the processes of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and DNA replication during torpor (<xref rid="pone.0145702.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0145702.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). Moreover, enchanced cell activities during torpor were inferred from the increased expression of cell growth and death related genes regulating cell apoptosis (ko04210) and cell motility related genes regulating actin cytoskeleton (ko04810) (<xref rid="pone.0145702.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). Three signal transduction pathways, MAPK (ko04010), ErbB (ko04012) and Notch signaling pathways (ko04330) were also found significantly enriched by up-regulated genes in the torpid state (<xref rid="pone.0145702.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Metabolic changes during torpor</title><p>As an important strategy for energy conservation, metabolic rate depression plays a critical role in many mammalian hibernators surviving harsh winter environments [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The minimum torpor metabolic rate during torpor can be decreased to 4.3% of basal metabolic rate [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], which enables hibernators to save as much as 90% of normal energy usage [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. How can the hibernators adjust their metabolic rate from a normal level to such a low level? In biology, altered patterns of gene expression allow a diversity of phenotypes even with a common genotype [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The physiological changes that occur as an organism shifts between active and torpid states are likely the result of altered gene expression of proteins that serve specific functions. In this study, we found that most of the genes that were down-regulated during torpor were involved in metabolic pathways and the proportion of down-regulated genes in most metabolic processes were greater than that of up-regulated genes during torpor. Moreover, a greater proportion of genes involved in &#x0201c;oxidoreductase activity&#x0201d; were down-regulated in torpid bats than up-regulated. For example, <italic>CYP1A2</italic>, which encodes an important enzyme involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, was down-regulated during torpor. All of these results are consistent with metabolic depression during torpor and may indicate that transcriptional changes lead to metabolic adjustment between states. Supporting our findings, Lei et al. (2014) found co-downregulation of genes involved in glycolytic pathway play a central role in metabolic suppression during torpor in the brain of torpid <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic>, which also suggests a systemic of suppression of metabolism during torpor.</p><p>Although metabolic processes are depressed overall, bats, like other mammals, still undergo critical shifts in their fuel utilization during torpor, specifically switching from carbohydrate- to fat-based metabolism. Hampton et al. (2011) found that the relative abundance of lipogenesis-related genes was higher in the August and October, while the relative abundance of lipolysis-related genes was higher in the hibernation seasons in the white adipose of the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (<italic>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</italic>), which indicates lipids are the primary energy source during hibernation [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In general, torpid animals rely on fatty acids as their main energy source [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In our study, a significant reduction in the weight of torpid bats compared with active ones, with the loss of white adipose during hibernation (observed in the sampling process), confirmed the earlier findings.</p><p>Our finding that genes involved in lipid metabolism are differentially expressed in torpid animals is also consistent with findings from other mammals. In an early study on the golden-mantled ground squirrel (<italic>Spermophilus lateralis</italic>), the genes involved in lipid metabolism had a significant overrepresentation in the genes that were elevated during hibernation [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similarly, studies on gene expression in the livers of bears indicated that genes involved in glycolysis, amino acid catabolism, <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis, the urea cycle and detoxification are down-regulated while gluconeogenesis-, &#x003b2;-oxidation- and ketogenesis-related genes that are involved in lipid metabolism and carbohydrate synthesis are up-regulated during hibernation [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Seim et al. (2013) also found many differentially expressed genes associated with the shift from carbohydrate to lipid metabolism between the livers of active and torpid <italic>M</italic>.<italic>brandtii</italic>.</p><p>We also found that genes encoding several key rate-limited regulated enzymes of glycolysis (<italic>GCK</italic>, <italic>HK1</italic>, <italic>PFKFB3</italic>, <italic>PFKFB1</italic>, and <italic>PFKP</italic>) were expressed at lower levels during torpor, and another gene encoding a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis (<italic>G6PC</italic>) was over-expressed in the torpid bats, suggesting lowered utilization of glucose during torpor. In addition, <italic>PDK4</italic> (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4) was up regulated during torpor with a fold change of 1.56 (&#x0003c;2). Elevated expression of <italic>PDK4</italic> during torpor was also found in the heart, skeletal muscle, and white adipose of the thirteen-lined ground squirrel [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Its increased expression can inhibit carbohydrate metabolism by preventing the flow of glycolytic products into the tricarboxylic acid cycle [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145702.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In our study, more genes involved in lipid and protein transport were over-expressed during torpor, and more genes involved in lipid binding were up regulated than down regulated. Those genes involved in lipid metabolism that were down-regulated in torpid animals were involved in lipid biosynthesis, while up-regulated genes in this GO category were associated with fatty acid beta-oxidation, and fatty acid transport. Moreover, genes having roles in fatty acid binding were also up-regulated during torpor. For example, <italic>FABP1</italic> had its maximum expression in the torpid liver. Similarly, the expression of liver fatty acid-binding protein (<italic>FABPL</italic>) was elevated 1.9-fold in the torpid liver of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>lateralis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The liver isoform of FABP in hibernators is adapted to function at low temperatures [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which can contribute to lipid transport during torpor. These results indicate a shift of primary energy source from carbohydrate to lipid. Moreover, another gene directly involved in lipid &#x003b2;-oxidation and ketogenesis, uncoupling protein 2 (<italic>UCP2</italic>), was up-regulated in the torpid library. This gene functions as a metabolic switch that enables the promotion of fatty acid metabolism over glucose utilization, and was over-expressed in several tissues of other mammals during hibernation, fasting and exposure to cold [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145702.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145702.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Over-expression of <italic>UCP2</italic> in a state of prolonged fasting could increase the concentration of fatty acids in the mitochondrial matrix, thereby preventing fatty acid accumulation and protecting against oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Over-expression of <italic>UCP2</italic> also suggested that fatty acid catabolism is the primary energy source during torpor. Another two genes with fold changes &#x0003c;2, <italic>CPT1A</italic> (fold change = 1.48) and <italic>HMGCS2</italic> (fold change = 1.86), also have over-expression during torpor. CPT1A (hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A), which catalyzes the transfer of the acyl group of long-chain fatty acid-CoA conjugates onto carnitine, an essential step for the mitochondrial uptake of long-chain fatty acids and their subsequent beta-oxidation, plays an important role in lipid metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145702.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Expression of <italic>CPT1A</italic> was also increased during hibernation in ground squirrels [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. HMGCS2 (mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary-CoA synthase 2) is an important controller in the ketogenic pathway and functions as a rate-limiting enzyme [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Over-expression of <italic>HMGCS2</italic> and increased blood concentration of ketone bodies were found in hibernating bears [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Unexpected changes in immune function during hibernation</title><p>In our study, many of the differentially expressed genes in the liver between active and torpid <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic> were associated with immune function. Our GO enrichment analysis revealed that immune related genes were more likely to be up regulated than down regulated during torpor, especially genes related to cytokine binding. Similarly, the KEGG pathway analysis showed that the immune system had the greatest representation in terms of number of genes among pathways significantly associated with genes that are up-regulated during torpor. Further, 10 immune-related pathways were identified, amounting to 20% of pathways significantly annotated by up-regulated genes. Although two immune-related pathways (ko04610 and ko04612) were marked by a significant enrichment of down-regulated genes in the torpid state, the total number of down-regulated genes enriched in these two pathways was obviously lower than that of up-regulated genes enriched in immune-related pathways. At first it may be surprising that so many immune-related genes are differentially expressed in the livers of active and torpid <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic>. However, the liver not only plays an indispensable role in metabolism, but also acts as an important immunological organ [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Eighty percent of blood supplied to the liver is from the gut, which is rich in bacterial products, environmental toxins and food antigens [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The liver plays a key role in innate immunity and acts as an organ barrier or a filter between the digestive tract and the rest of the body [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Our findings seemingly contrast with other studies of hibernation which found that hibernation depressed both the innate and adaptive immune systems, e.g., lower complement levels, reduced phagocytotic capacity, decreased cytokine production, and diminished lymphocyte proliferation and antibody production were observed [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Golden-mantled ground squirrels (<italic>Callospermophilus lateralis</italic>) in the torpid state did not present a febrile response when injected with lipopolysaccharide, while aroused animals did [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In addition, torpid thirteen-lined ground squirrels rejected a skin allograft three to four times slower than summer active animals [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, little is known about the transcriptional expression of genes involved in immune functions of hibernating mammals. Given the fact that our results are inconsistent with previous descriptions of the effect of hibernation on the mammalian immune system, we speculated that immune activity may be organ-specific during hibernation. For example, the numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes and lamina propria leukocytes were increased in the intestine of thirteen-lined ground squirrels during hibernation, and mucosal levels of IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL10 and IL4 were greater in torpid hibernators than in active animals, which may contribute to the preservation of epithelial integrity throughout the winter fast [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, another organ, the thymus, which is vital to the immune system, was surrounded by brown adipose tissue and contains almost no lymphocytes during hibernation [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The enhanced immune activity that we have inferred in the liver may help to resist pathogen invasion. In GO analysis, we found that genes involved in &#x0201c;response to other organism&#x02019;, &#x0201c;response to bacterium&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;response to molecule of bacterial origin&#x0201d; were up-regulated in torpid animals, indicating an enhanced defense response. Our KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that a number of up-regulated genes in the torpid state were significantly enriched in &#x0201c;human diseases&#x0201d; pathways and three &#x0201c;infectious diseases&#x0201d; pathways including epithelial cell signaling in <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic> infection (ko05110), <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection (ko05120) and pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> infection (ko05130) (<xref rid="pone.0145702.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>), suggesting bats are at high risk of pathogens infection during hibernation. A particularly pressing example of the vulnerability of hibernating bats to disease is that of white nose syndrome (WNS), a fungal disease that has decimated bat populations in North America [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and is continuing to spread. Moore et al. (2013) found that little brown bats (<italic>Myotis lucifugus</italic>) hibernating in WNS-affected sites showed immunological changes, specifically elevated circulating leukocytes, which may be evident of attempted defense against <italic>Geomyces destructans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Molecular anti-stress response</title><p>During deep torpor, hypothermia and oxidative stress from ischemia-reperfusion may be highly stressful and may compromise the survival of the hibernator [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A long period of low body temperature has harmful effects on such processes as protein stability, membrane function, ATP synthesis, activity of key regulatory enzymes, and cytoskeletal integrity [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145702.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Blood flow in the splanchnic organs is preferentially decreased during deep torpor. Upon arousal to euthermic body temperature, reperfused oxygenated blood induced by the increased metabolic activity in all cells will be strikingly stressful for splanchnic organs that are typically hypo-perfused [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This is because ischemia-induced oxidative stress during hibernation plays a crucial role in contributing to cell death [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The successful survival from these stresses suggests the existence of anti-stress responses. Genes involving &#x0201c;unfolded protein binding&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;protein folding&#x0201d; were over-expressed during torpor, and many heat shock proteins were differentially expressed in the brain of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic>, which suggests an adaptive response of torpid bats to environmental stress [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this study, we found many up-regulated genes in the torpid liver library involved in response processes to stress and stimulus (e.g. heat, temperature), and the proportion of up-regulated genes involved in &#x0201c;regulation of response to stress&#x0201d; was greater than down-regulated genes. Moreover, genes encoding heat shock proteins (Hsp70, Hsp27, Hsp90, Hsp105, Hsp40) that were identified in the brain of torpid <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic> were also over-expressed in the liver during torpor. Their induction during stress is believed to be important for preventing misfolding and aggregation, as well as for facilitating refolding and removal of damaged proteins [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Another gene, <italic>OXSR1</italic>, encodes an oxidative stress responsive protein, which plays an important role in response to oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Expression of this gene was also up-regulated in the liver of torpid bats. In addition, three KEGG pathways, proteasome (ko03050), ubiquitin mediated proteolysis (ko04120) and DNA replication (ko03030) were only represented by up-regulated genes in the torpid state, which indicates an increase in the processes of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and DNA replication during hibernation. An increase in the level of proteins conjugated to ubiquitin in tissues can be used as an indicator of protein damage induced by stress [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates has been found in the gut and liver of torpid squirrels [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Protein ubiquitination is part of the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis process, which involves the proteasome, so enhanced ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis may be a response to stress that leads to protein damage. Indeed, the over-expression of genes during torpor involved in DNA replication may function as a repair mechanism to reduce this risk. We infer increased expression of cell growth and death related genes regulating cell apoptosis (ko04210) and cell motility related genes regulating actin cytoskeleton (ko04810) to be associated with enchanced cell activies, which may be one of protective mechanisms during hibernation. Three signal transduction pathways, MAPK (ko04010), ErbB (ko04012) and Notch signaling pathways (ko04330) were significantly associated with up-regulated genes in the torpid state. These three pathways play an essential role in many aspects of cell regulation, such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell death [<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145702.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. These enhanced cell regulation activities may help to eliminate damaged cells and replenish new cells to protect the liver from damage.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform was used to sequence the liver transcriptomes of active and torpid <italic>R</italic>. <italic>ferrumequinum</italic> in order to gain insights into changes of gene expression patterns in the liver during hibernation. Differentially expressed genes identified major involved in metabolic depression, shifts in the fuel utilization, immune function and response to stresses. Comparisons with other mammals, such as black bears, ground squirrels, and other bats, revealed some common transcriptional changes: genes involved in carbohydrate catabolism were down-regulated during torpor, while genes responsible for lipid &#x003b2;-oxidation were up-regulated.

The enhanced immune activity that we have inferred in the liver may help to protect bats from pathogen invasion.
