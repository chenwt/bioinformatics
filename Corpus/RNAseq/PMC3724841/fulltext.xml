The structural features of WRI1 important for its function are not well understood. Comparison of WRI1 orthologs across many diverse plant species revealed a conserved 9 bp exon encoding the amino acids &#x0201c;VYL&#x0201d;. Site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids within the &#x02018;VYL&#x02019; exon of <italic>At</italic>WRI1 failed to restore the full oil content of <italic>wri1-1</italic> seeds, providing direct evidence for an essential role of this small exon in <italic>At</italic>WRI1 function. <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> WRI1 is predicted to have three alternative splice forms. To understand expression of these splice forms we performed RNASeq of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> developing seeds and queried other EST and RNASeq databases from several tissues and plant species. In all cases, only one splice form was detected and VYL was observed in transcripts of all WRI1 orthologs investigated. We also characterized a phylogenetically distant WRI1 ortholog (<italic>Eg</italic>WRI1) as an example of a non-seed isoform that is highly expressed in the mesocarp tissue of oil palm. The C-terminal region of <italic>Eg</italic>WRI1 is over 90 amino acids shorter than <italic>At</italic>WRI1 and has surprisingly low sequence conservation. Nevertheless, the <italic>Eg</italic>WRI1 protein can restore multiple phenotypes of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content><italic> wri1-1</italic> loss-of-function mutant, including reduced seed oil, the &#x0201c;wrinkled&#x0201d; seed coat, reduced seed germination, and impaired seedling establishment. Taken together, this study provides an example of combining phylogenetic analysis with mutagenesis, deep-sequencing technology and computational analysis to examine key elements of the structure and function of the WRI1 plant transcription factor.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Department of Energy&#x02013;Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center Cooperative Agreement DE-FC02-07ER6449 (J.B.O. and C.B.).

These oils are also a staple in the human diet and are increasingly important as renewable feed stocks for industry. Currently, a wealth of information supports the pivotal role of WRINKLED1 (WRI1) in the regulation of plant seed oil biosynthesis. Seeds of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content><italic> AtWRI1</italic> (At3g54320) loss-of-function mutant <italic>wri1-1</italic> display an 80% reduction in TAG accumulation compared to wild-type (WT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. WRI1 has been identified as a member of the APETALA2 (AP2) family of transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Comparison of the transcriptome between developing WT and <italic>wri1-1</italic> seeds reveals that the majority of the genes which are expressed at reduced level in the <italic>wri1-1</italic> mutant are fatty acid and glycolytic enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Recent studies have confirmed a number of genes encoding enzymes involved in fatty acids synthesis and late glycolysis that are <italic>WRI1</italic> targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] which is also evidenced by high transcript co-expression for these genes with <italic>WRI1</italic> in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> developing seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species">Zea mays</named-content></italic> (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species">Z. mays</named-content></italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. . Specific motifs in the fatty acids synthesis genes to which the WRI1 protein binds have been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. <italic>WRI1</italic> orthologs from <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species">Z. mays</named-content></italic> and <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species">Brassica napus</named-content></italic> (<italic><named-content content-type="genus-species">B. napus</named-content></italic>) have also been shown to function in plant oil biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Expression of <italic>AtWRI1</italic> and two <italic>WRI1</italic> orthologs identified from <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species">Z. mays</named-content></italic> are also able to restore the phenotypes of <italic>wri1-1</italic> and <italic>wri1-4</italic>, such as reduced seed oil content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. An increase in oil accumulation in transgenic <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content>, <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species">B. napus</named-content></italic> or <italic><named-content content-type="genus-species">Z. mays</named-content></italic> seeds expressing <italic>AtWRI1</italic> or other <italic>WRI1</italic> orthologs has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition to its roles in regulating plant oil biosynthesis, <italic>AtWRI1</italic> is required for optimal seed germination and seedling establishment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p><italic>AtWRI1</italic> and <italic>WRI1</italic> orthologs from other plant species are highly expressed in seed tissue and coordinately expressed with fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Recently, an ortholog of <italic>WRI1</italic> was found to be highly expressed in the mesocarp of oil palm (<italic>EgWRI1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The expressed sequence tag (EST) levels for <italic>EgWRI1</italic> are 50 fold higher than in date palm (which does not accumulate oil) and increase during fruit ripening in close coordination with increases in oil accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These data and the recent characterization of <italic>At</italic>WRI2, 3 and 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] provide a strong indication that WRI1 and its homologs play similar roles in regulating fatty acid synthesis in both seed and non-seed tissues. <italic>AtWRI3</italic> and <italic>AtWRI4</italic>, that are expressed most highly in non-seed tissues, were shown to rescue the wrinkled seed and low oil phenotypes of the <italic>wri1-3</italic> mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Although <italic>EgWRI1</italic> is highly expressed in fruit mesocarp, BlastP analysis of <italic>Eg</italic>WRI1 protein versus the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> proteome indicates its highest similarity is with <italic>At</italic>WRI1, rather than <italic>At</italic>WRI2, 3, or 4.</p><p>Oil palm is a monocotyledonous plant that diverged from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> &#x0003e;120 million years ago. Interestingly, the sequence of <italic>Eg</italic>WRI1 is 93 amino acids shorter than <italic>At</italic>WRI1 and exhibits low sequence identity over the C-terminal half of the proteins. These differences offered an opportunity to determine whether this divergent non-seed expressed <italic>EgWRI1</italic> is a functional <italic>WRI1-</italic>ortholog able to control oil synthesis and other phenotypes in a heterologous system.</p><p>Alternative splicing is an important form of regulation for many genes and contributes to the diversity of the transcriptome and proteome and thereby extends the range of functions exerted by single genes. Based on <italic>in silico</italic> analysis, approximately 6000 genes in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> are predicted to have alternative splice forms, including approximately 340 transcription factor-encoding genes including <italic>WRI1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The application of high-throughput transcript sequencing has provided direct evidence that at least 42% (~10,000) of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> genes are alternatively spliced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], </p><p>Alternative splicing can occur in spatially and developmentally specific patterns, which are sometimes regulated through sensing environmental cues or stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Some <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> genes express different splice variants in different tissues, in response to stress, and can also lead to differential subcellular localization of protein products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Some <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> transcription factors repress their own function through producing alternative splice variants and by forming heterodimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Currently, three alternative splice forms are predicted for <italic>AtWRI1</italic> and it is unknown whether all three <italic>AtWRI1</italic> splice variants can be found in plant cells; or if present, whether these may have different patterns of expression or roles in plant fatty acid biosynthesis. The recent availability of very comprehensive EST and transcriptomic datasets for many <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> tissues provided the opportunity to evaluate the possible occurrence of the predicted alternative <italic>AtWRI1</italic> splice forms.</p><p>Here we show that expression of <italic>EgWRI1</italic> in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content><italic> wri1-1</italic> mutant is able to complement reduced seed oil content and other <italic>wri1-1</italic> impaired phenotypes. In addition, we provide evidence that <italic>WRI1</italic> splice form 3 (<italic>At3g54320</italic>.3) is the only form present in multiple <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> tissues. Furthermore, analysis of transcriptomic data from other species leads to a similar conclusion. The role of a small conserved exon of splice form 3 is further investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Expression of <italic>HA-EgWRI1</italic> rescues the low oil content in <italic>wri1-1</italic> seeds</title><p>A comparison of protein sequences between <italic>At</italic>WRI1 and <italic>Eg</italic>WRI1 indicates that <italic>Eg</italic>WRI1 is 93 amino acids shorter compared to <italic>At</italic>WRI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0068887-g001">Figure 1A)</xref>.

Beyond <italic>EgWRI1&#x02019;s</italic> ability to restore known <italic>wri1-1</italic> phenotypes, we also asked whether its expression might lead to additional phenotypes, such as higher oil accumulation. Such a result might occur if a heterologous protein &#x02018;escapes&#x02019; repression that possibly acts on the C-terminus of the native protein or its mRNA.</p><p>In order to investigate the ability of <italic>EgWRI1</italic> to restore several phenotypes observed in <italic>wri1-1</italic>, we generated transgenic plants expressing <italic>HA-EgWRI1</italic> under the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter.

To evaluate the possible expression of multiple spice forms of <italic>WRI1</italic>, we tested directly by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), performed RNASeq analysis of developing <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> seeds, and also searched publicly available large transcript databases.</p></sec><sec id="s2.5"><title><italic>AtWRI1</italic> splice form 3 is the major form expressed in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> seedlings</title><p>In many cases the presence of alternative splice forms can be detected by the different sizes of RT-PCR products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We therefore performed RT-PCR on RNA extracted from young <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> seedlings (3-to-9-day-old) and with primers targeted at the short 9 bp exon and the last 3&#x02019; intron. Because expression of <italic>AtWRI1</italic> is found to be sugar-inducible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], we grew <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> on medium with or without the addition of sucrose, to determine if different <italic>AtWRI1</italic> splice forms might be expressed differently under these two conditions.

Sequencing of fourteen independent PCR products (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068887.s006">Figure S6B</xref>) indicated in all cases, the presence of <italic>AtWRI1</italic> exon 3.</p><p>The primer set (FW2 + RV2) was designed to amplify a PCR product of 269 bp (in form 2 or 3) or 167 bp (in form 1) respectively.

A PCR product of form 1 (167bp) was not detected. Further sequencing of each PCR product in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068887.s006">Figure S6C</xref> also confirmed this conclusion.

Although large EST and RNASeq databases are available from several <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> tissues, the datasets do not include large numbers of reads from developing seeds, where <italic>WRI</italic>1 is most highly expressed. Therefore, we performed RNASeq analysis on three stages of developing seeds. Approximately 100 million 50 nt Illumina reads were mapped to the TAIR10 genome and analyzed. From these data, <italic>WRI1</italic> was expressed at a level of 165 Fragments per Kilobase per Million fragments (FPKM) (average of three developmental stages). This represents approximately 0.01% of the mRNA population and provides a more quantitative estimate of <italic>WRI1</italic> expression than previously available for <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> developing seeds. Over 500 WRI1 reads mapped to the region of the <italic>WRI1</italic> gene that overlaps the 9 bp exon 3. A section of the reads is presented in GBrowse format (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0068887.s007">Figure S7</xref>). No reads were detected that lacked exon 3. We also examined the 3&#x02019; sequences and found no sequences for splice form 1. Based on the number of reads representing splice form 3 and no reads representing forms 1 or 2, a binomial test indicated high probability (P &#x0003e; 0.999) that splice forms 1 or 2 of <italic>WRI1</italic> are not expressed in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> developing seeds.</p><p>Alternative splice forms of genes are sometimes expressed only in specific tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

Although <italic>WRI1</italic> is expressed at much lower levels in these tissues (13.1 FPKM root, 10.9 FPKM flower), the 9 bp exon 3 was represented by over 80 RNASeq reads from roots and 20 reads from flowers. No RNASeq reads were found that lacked exon 3. Examination of the 3&#x02019; end (represented by 130 RNASeq reads in roots and 60 reads in flowers) revealed that the predicted 3&#x02019; intron was not spliced out in any reads. Thus, splice form 1 was also not detected in either root or flower datasets. Taken together, although expression of the alternative splice forms at very low levels cannot be ruled out, these data indicate that splice forms 1 or 2 are unlikely to play a biological role in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content> flowers and roots grown under standard condition.</p></sec><sec id="s2.6"><title>Analysis of <italic>WRI1</italic> alternative splice form expression in plant species other than <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis</named-content></title><p>The presence/absence of the 9 bp short exon in <italic>WRI1</italic> was also examined for a number of other plant species.
