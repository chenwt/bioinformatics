Most Th cells exist in a naive state and only differentiate into mature, cytokine-secreting effector cells upon activation of the T cell receptor (TCR) by antigen in the presence of cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Each Th cell subtype exhibits distinct functions reflected by the expression of characteristic sets of cytokines. Several Th effector subtypes have been identified. The best characterised are Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells. The Th1 signature cytokine is IFN-&#x003b3;), while Th2 cells mainly secrete IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Th17 cells produce IL- 17A, IL-17&#x000a0;F and IL-22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Regulatory T (Treg) cells are functionally distinct from the other Th subsets as they suppress and possibly re-direct immune responses. Depending on their <italic>in vivo</italic> provenance they are referred to as thymus-derived tTreg cells or peripherally-derived pTreg cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The former commit to the Treg lineage during development in the thymus, whereas the latter differentiate from naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The Th differentiation process is orchestrated by transcription factors (TFs). The first layer of transcriptional regulation is provided by STAT family factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] whilst the maintenance of cell identity appears to be controlled by a second layer of TFs, often referred to as master regulators. Each Th cell subtype is associated with a dominant master regulator whose ectopic expression is sufficient to induce the respective effector cell phenotype. TBX21 (also known as T-bet) is responsible for the Th1 subtype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], GATA-3 determines the Th2 subtype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], ROR&#x003b3;t (encoded by a splice isoform of the <italic>Rorc</italic> gene) drives Th17 differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and Foxp3 is responsible for Treg commitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The master regulators collaborate in combination with other lineage-restricted TFs, such as HLX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], c-MAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and AHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which promote Th1, Th2, and Th17/Treg fates respectively. However, these factors alone are not sufficient to drive differentiation towards a specific Th fate.</p><p>We sought to create a resource to aid investigation of the transcriptional mechanisms underlying Th cell identity. To this end we profiled the transcriptomes of murine naive, Th1, Th2, Th17, splenic Treg, and <italic>in vitro</italic>-induced Treg (iTreg) cells by RNA-sequencing. We used multiple computational analysis tools to quantify gene and transcript isoform expression levels and to analyse differential expression between CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subtypes. We anticipate that the datasets presented here will be a valuable resource for further study and so they were compiled into a publicly available online database, ThExpress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Generation of high quality CD4<sup>+</sup> transcriptome data sets</title><p>We performed mRNA-sequencing on two biological replicates of freshly isolated murine splenic CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup> (naive) T cells and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, as well as CD4<sup>+</sup> cells polarised <italic>in vitro</italic> to Th1, Th2, Th17 and iTreg fates.

This suggests that this expression pattern is a general phenomenon. Several lines of evidence indicate that the HE genes represent the functional transcriptome, while LE genes correspond to transcriptional background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], enabling us to use HE/LE categories in our analyses of the transcriptomes. The bimodality of expression levels is indicative of pure cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and as such increases our confidence in the purity of our starting populations.</p><p>Hierarchical clustering demonstrated that naive cells were distinct from all the differentiated subtypes. Th17 and Treg subtypes clustered together which is interesting since both Treg and Th17 gene expression programs can be simultaneously induced in some cells, and some Treg cells appear to be able to transdifferentiate into Th17 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. We also performed hierarchical clustering of the genes with highest between-subtype variability. Genes near to the master regulator transcription factors provided confidence that the coexpression of genes observed in these datasets can be used to investigate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell gene regulatory networks.</p><p>We determined the subtype upregulated genes that are overexpressed in one cell type compared with all others. Novel SU cytokines, chemokines and cell-surface receptors provide suggestions of previously unknown signalling interactions within the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment and also between these cells and other immune effectors. For example, the TRAIL receptor gene (<italic>Tnfrsf10b</italic>) is upregulated in naive cells. Binding of the TRAIL ligand to its receptor leads to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that this receptor plays a similar role to Fas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] in apoptosis during T cell peripheral negative selection.</p><p>Th1, Th2 and Th17 SU cytokines imply signalling from these cells to influence the differentiation of other immune cells. The Th17 SU gene inhibin A regulates early T cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. <italic>Csf1</italic> is upregulated in Th1 cells along with <italic>Il34,</italic> and both proteins encoded by these genes are ligands for the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) promoting survival, proliferation and differentiation of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Th2 cells express B cell activation factor (BAFF, <italic>Tnfsf13b</italic>) as an SU gene; BAFF is required for maturation and survival of B lymphocytes. These findings suggest that Th1 and Th2 cells are able to affect the survival and development of the cells with which they interact during an immune response. A receptor for BAFF (BAFFR, encoded by <italic>Tnfrsf13c</italic>) is upregulated in iTreg cells and another receptor, TACI (<italic>Tnfrsf13b</italic>) is expressed on all subtypes raising the possibility that BAFF plays a role in signalling within the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment.</p><p>If splenic Tregs are similar to tTregs, whilst iTregs are more pTreg-like, then their SU genes will have application in distinguishing between these two cell types <italic>in vivo</italic>. This supposition is supported by the expression of Helios only in splenic Tregs. The proposed tTreg marker <italic>Nrp1</italic> is expressed in both populations in agreement with previous work, showing that it is upregulated during <italic>in vitro</italic> iTreg polarisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. A novel splenic Treg SU gene is <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, a chemokine associated with recruitment of Treg cells to the liver during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Its expression by Tregs themselves suggests a positive feedback effect whereby Tregs already in the liver are able to recruit more of their subtype. RANK ligand and its receptor, RANK, are iTreg and Treg SU genes respectively. Perhaps this is indicative of signalling between these two subtypes.</p><p>We identified 237 SU genes that encoded potential transcription factors, and these will provide a rich resource for investigation into the transcriptional regulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell fates. Those with notable but low expression within a subtype (such as PAX6 in Th17) may well be a marker for a discrete subset within that population. The highest number (123) of SU transcription factors was found in the naive subtype &#x02013; perhaps this implies a requirement for this number in maintaining a transcriptional programme poised for commitment to one of several possible differentiated fates. A reduced number of TFs may then be required to maintain a more-specialised fate after differentiation.</p><p>Extending comparisons beyond SU genes to find, for example, genes upregulated in two particular subtypes or in all differentiated subtypes compared with naive cells should provide insight into further biologically relevant questions in T cell biology. Examination of gene classes in addition to the TFs, cytokines and receptors described here should also prove fruitful. For example, 49 genes annotated as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were found to be SU genes.</p><p>Estimation of mRNA transcript isoform abundance indicated that hundreds of genes with unaltered between-sample expression levels change their predominant isoform. This demonstrates that regulation of gene function by alternative splicing is a feature of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in addition to erythropoieisis and ESC differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. We also identified an example of a gene (<italic>Skap1</italic>) that undergoes alternative splicing whereby differentiation away from the naive state leads to increased expression of its full-length, functional isoform. Further work will be required to determine the functional relevance of transcript switching and changes in expression of alternative splicing factors during CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation.</p><p>As with all transcriptomic studies, the work presented here does not address the question of protein abundance or activity within the subtypes and so conclusions about the role of specific proteins in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells should be supported by further work. Furthermore, it should be noted that the transcriptional profiles that we determine here are from single time-points during the development of the subtypes and so do not address the dynamic changes in gene expression that occur during CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation; differentiation time-course experiments will provide important avenues for further study. The data presented here do, however, provide multiple insights into the transcriptional landscapes that exist during the maintenance of cell fate once cells have fully differentiated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We anticipate that these datasets will be a valuable resource for further study and that our analyses illustrate their utility.

The term suggests that these genes will be a definitive set of genes that are characteristic of one particular T-cell subset. I would expect that a &#x02018;signature&#x02019; should reoccur in other datasets and be indicative of the presence of a particular T-cell subset, and the authors point to this in their discussion of the signature genes. However the authors haven&#x02019;t run any experiments to assess how stably the expression of these genes might be in terms of temporal expression in culture, <italic>in vivo</italic> or in ex vivo isolated cells, or even in the same subsets taken from different mouse strains or under different or continuous stimulation. There are a number of independent T-cell RNAseq experiments available in GEO that could have been used in some form of cross-validation, but this was not attempted. Quite a few of the genes listed in various signatures - Cxcl10 for example - are inducible genes and may be transiently expressed, not as a signature of a t-cell identity, but rather as a signature of an external stimulus.</p><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; response:</bold><italic>Given this comment and Dr. Wells&#x02019; recommendation below about an &#x02018;edit of nomenclature&#x02019; we have changed our terminology to use &#x02018;subtype upregulated&#x02019; instead of &#x02018;signature&#x02019; throughout the manuscript.</italic></p><p>The observations about the extent of alternate splicing were very much underplayed in this manuscript, but tantalizing, and I would like to have seen a broader description of these events in the different T-cell subclasses.

Right at the outset, I'd like to note that I know very little about the biology of different T cell types, so that I am unable to make informed comments on the plausibility, novelty, and general interest of the particular biological observations made in this manuscript. My review will focus predominantly on the computational analysis methods used, as this is my area of expertise.</p><p>My overall impression is that the computational analysis is very competently performed. There aren't any particularly novel methods introduced as far as I can see, but the analysis seems appropriate and reasonably done. I felt that the identification of &#x02018;signature genes&#x02019; that are over-expressed in a particular cell type relative to all other ones, and the further focus on signature genes within particular functional categories of genes (e.g. receptors, cytokines, TFs), was a particularly nice and useful approach. Its relatively simple but helps focus on those genes that are the best candidates for providing biological insights into what is specific about each subtype.</p><p>My only &#x02018;issues&#x02019; with the manuscript as it is now concern the descriptions of a number of the methods employed, which often seem unnecessarily cryptic and vague. In some cases this leads me to be unable to assess whether the conclusions that the authors present actually follow from the presented data.</p><p>This is partly caused by the fact that the resolution of some of the images is really poor.

In fact, from what I can tell from the figure in its current resolution it appears as if the grey dots fall within narrow vertical stripes in some of the panels, which would be rather strange.

Right now a lot of the Methods are described at the level of 'we used this tool to get this, then that tool to do that', and unless one has specific experience with these tools, it is hard to tell precisely what was done.</p><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; response:</bold><italic>We have extended and clarified the methods to add detail about the tools used.

In particular, I understand that according to the literature, each subtype is characterized by a particular combination of markers. So ideally, each cell would show one of these known combinations of markers and would thus have an unambiguous subtype. But it was hard for me to tell from the reported results what fraction of cells are unambiguous in this way, or whether there are subsets of cells with previously undescribed combinations of markers.</p><p>"Expression levels of genes indicative of contamination.... consistent with pure populations of each CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subtype (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>)." I did not understand this analysis. I presume that 'genes indicative of contamination' are genes that should not be expressed at all in the subtype under consideration (it would be nice to explicitly state this). But if that's what they are, then any expression of these genes should be inconsistent with pure populations. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> does seem to show some expression for some of these genes so I do not understand the claim in the sentence cited above. This is just another example where I think the authors could have easily been much more concrete and specific regarding precisely what analysis was done.</p><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; response:</bold><italic>These data are intended to provide readers the opportunity to assess the purity of our starting cell populations using the expression of well-characterised combinations of markers. The high percentages that we observe are consistent with populations accepted to be pure in previous work.</italic></p><p><italic>Regarding the data in Figure</italic><xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref><italic>the &#x02018;genes indicative of contamination&#x02019; are those that we would expect to see expressed at high levels in populations of other cell types typically found in the spleen. For the most part we see very low expression of these genes within our samples. Very low levels of expression may be due to a small amount of contamination (insufficient to dominate overall gene expression within the sample) or may indicate genuine expression of that gene at low levels within the cell population of interest. To attempt to add clarity to this section we have altered the relevant paragraph and also changed the text to read &#x02018;genes</italic><bold><italic>suggestive</italic></bold><italic>of contamination&#x02019;.</italic></p><p>The authors find that TFs which are know lineage markers always have higher mRNA levels in their cognate subtype than in all other subtypes. This would imply that all lineage marker TFs are regulated transcriptionally (rather than,say, through post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms). I find this striking, i.e. in my experience differences in TF activities are often non-transcriptional in mammals, and wonder if the authors might want to command on this.</p><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; response:</bold><italic>We agree that TF activity regulation by non-transcriptional mechanisms is not unusual and this is certainly the case for the STAT proteins upstream of the master lineage regulators described in this work. However, in the case of the well-characterised master regulators it is known that their mRNA expression is highest in their cognate cell types and that ectopic expression of the genes within naive CD4</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>T cells leads to differentiation to the appropriate subtype</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]<italic>. This suggests that mRNA levels are a suitable proxy for TF activity in these cases. Of course, this does not rule out an additional role for non-transcriptional mechanisms in the modulation of activity of these factors.</italic></p><p>Regarding the Bimodal expression distributions. I know the authors have previously published on this, but it is any issue of which I must frankly say I am a bit skeptical based on my own experiences with analysis of RNA-seq data. In particular, when we analyze RNA-seq data-sets in my lab, we typically cannot robustly identify such bimodal distributions. Also, I have extensively analyized CAGE data, which has the advantage that it quantifies directly the expression of a TSS (i.e. without having the complication of having different transcript lengths) and the distribution of expression levels of TSSs NEVER look bimodal. They almost always look like power laws. Another issue that makes me sceptical is that, depending on precisely how the RNA-seq data is processed, it is quite easy to produce kernel densities that 'look' bimodal, but this bimodality is more an artefact of the data processing than a true underlying biological reality. In particular, RNA-seq data is inherently discrete, i.e. the read count in a given sample for a given gene (or transcript) is either zero, one, two, three, etcetera. To draw a density of (log) gene expression levels, there needs to be a normalization for length, some sort of 'pseudo-count' needs to be added to deal with genes that have zero counts, the numbers need to be log transformed, and then finally the density is typically approximated using some kernel density. Depending on precisely how this is done one can easily produce a 'low expression peak' that simply corresponds to all genes that had zero read counts, but whose 'expression' levels are smeared out in the density because of their differing lengths and the convolution with the kernel. But this low expression peak is then typically not robust to changes in the pseudo-count or normalization procedure.</p><p>Notably, when a gene had a read count of zero, this means its total expression was at most on the order of 1/total_reads_in_sample, but it could be arbitrarily smaller (which is really an infinitely wide range of possibilities in log-scale). Due to this, estimating the density of expression levels in log-scale becomes poorly defined in the region that corresponds to very low read-counts. So to make a convincing case that the distribution is truly bimodal on a logarithmic scale, I feel that quite a bit more needs to be done. One could for example make a cumulative distribution F(x) which shows the expected fraction of all genes that has a log-expression level less than x. To estimate F(x) one would calculate for each gene g, the probability p(&#x0003e;x|g) that its expression is larger than x, given the number of reads it has. F(x) would then be estimated as F(x)&#x02009;=&#x02009;sum_g (1-p(&#x0003e;x|g)). One would then like to see that there is a clear inflection in this curve. There might be other, better, ways to show bimodality. I realize that the authors might feel they have already made a sufficient case for bimodality in previous publications but I thought they might want to be aware that some people, such as myself, have not been convinced that this bimodality is real, and this might be an opportunity to make a case to convince people like me.</p><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; response:</bold><italic>Thank you for the detailed discussion on this point. Firstly we would note that genes with zero counts were not included in the bimodality analyses and so did not contribute to the LE population within the kernel density plots; we have added text to the manuscript to clarify this point. Whilst we would like to be able to convince skeptics as to the reality of this bimodal distribution it is beyond the scope of this manuscript to do so. Our previously published work on this topic includes a plot showing the third mode that occurs if genes with zero counts are included (FigureS4 in</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]<italic>); we see similar results with the data here. We have also published validations of the findings by single-molecule RNA-FISH</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] <italic>and modeling of the distributions that would occur from populations of varying purity</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]<italic>. As such, we continue to feel that this is a useful method for use in assessing purity of populations (in conjunction with the other more cell type-specific approaches used here) as well as for determining genes to exclude from differential expression analyses in a rational manner.</italic></p><p>Reqarding the signature gene expression. It is one thing for a gene to be higher expressed in the specific subtype than in all others, but this does not necessarily imply that a measurement of the gene's expression level would be sufficient to realiably classify the subtype. It would be nice if the authors could show, or at least discuss, to what extent the subtype can be identified from expression measurements of a signature gene.</p><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; response:</bold><italic>Given these comments and those from Dr. Wells above, we have adjusted our nomenclature to change &#x02018;signature genes&#x02019; to &#x02018;subtype upregulated&#x02019; genes. We hope that this will avoid overinterpretation of the lists as being definitive of a particular subtype. We intend them to act as a demonstration of the utility of our datasets whilst providing possible avenues for further work regarding the functional roles of particular gene products in the various subtypes.</italic></p><p>It appears that the naive subtype has by far the largest number of TFs that are signature genes (123 or 237). Can the authors comment on this observation?</p><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; response:</bold><italic>This is an intriguing finding. We added the following text to the discussion to address it.</italic></p><p>&#x0201c;The highest number (123) of SU transcription factors was found in the naive subtype &#x02013; perhaps this implies a requirement for this number in maintaining a transcriptional programme poised for commitment to one of several possible differentiated fates. A reduced number of TFs may then be required to maintain a more-specialised fate after differentiation.&#x0201d;</p><p>Also, are there any examples of signature genes whose expression profiles do not match with what is assumed in the literature, or known &#x02018;markers&#x02019; from the literature that fail to show up as signature genes? This would help to place into context the mentioned examples of signature genes that match what is known in the literature.</p><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; response:</bold><italic>In general, our findings agree well with previously characterized markers and we discuss occasions where our findings are not in complete concordance with previous work &#x02013; this is particularly the case for the expression of some cytokines in resting cells (discussed on page 7). A valuable element of this work is the prediction of novel candidate markers that have not been described previously &#x02013; we discuss this within the manuscript and hope that the online resource at</italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.th-express.org"><italic>www.th-express.org</italic></ext-link><italic>is valuable in further exploration of these genes.</italic></p><p>As a final remark, the authors are inferring the 'activities' of TFs in different subtypes solely from their mRNA expression levels but TFs often vary in activities do to other regulatory mechanisms (I already commented on this above). Such non-transcriptional changes in activity can be inferred from the expression behavior of the targets of the TFs. My group has actually developed a tool to automatically infer such TF activities from raw RNA-seq data (it is available at ismara.unibas.ch and only requires uploading the data). It might be interesting for the authors to compare the mRNA level changes of key TFs with the activity changes inferred from the behavior of the targets of these TFs.</p><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; response:</bold><italic>This would be an interesting use of these data but we feel that it is beyond the scope of the current study. We will certainly use this tool in future explorations of these data and we anticipate that our data will generally be valuable in the inference of TF activities as well as in the creation of regulatory networks.</italic></p><p>Finally, I could not follow the analysis of splice variation. The authors say that the major isoform comprises 80-90% of the total expression FOR EACH protein-coding gene. Are they really saying this is true for ALL genes? The legend of Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> is not really specific about what is shown (this is actually something that can be improved in many of the legends) but my guess is that what it shows is that, for the genes shown, the interquartile range for the frequency of the major isoform is 80&#x02009;=&#x02009;90%. This would mean that the 50% of 'typical' genes have between 80-90% in the major isoform.</p><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; response:</bold><italic>We apologise for the lack of clarity here. Your interpretation is correct. We have altered the text in the results section as follows.
