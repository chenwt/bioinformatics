Transcriptome-wide examination of RNA isoforms, abundance and translation in HuR-deficient B cells, together with direct measurements of HuR-RNA interaction, revealed that HuR-dependent mRNA splicing affects hundreds of transcripts including the dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase (<italic>Dlst</italic>), a subunit of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (&#x003b1;KGDH). In the absence of HuR, defective mitochondrial metabolism results in high amounts of reactive oxygen species and B cell death. Our study shows how post-transcriptional processes control the balance of energy metabolism required for B cell proliferation and differentiation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P5">The generation of antibodies is a hallmark of the fight against infection and is a principal goal in the design of vaccines. B lymphocytes produce distinct antibody isotypes by the process of class switch recombination (CSR). Antibodies arising from extrafollicular differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting cells (ASC) can prevent pathogen spread at early stages of infection, while switched antibodies quickly recruit effector cells during memory responses. Somatic hypermutation (SHM) of the immunoglobulin genes increases antibody affinity. This requires the positive selection of B cells, bearing high-affinity membrane immunoglobulins and by T cells within germinal centers (GC), the specific anatomical structures formed in peripheral lymphoid organs during many immune responses.</p><p id="P6">Resting lymphocytes require glucose and glycolysis to survive, but undergo metabolic reprogramming following antigen encounter to meet the energetic and biosynthetic demands of proliferation<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Unlike T cells, which disproportionately increase glycolysis when activated, B cell activation through membrane immunoglobulin is accompanied by a balanced increase in both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. The molecular mechanisms which control this metabolic reprogramming in lymphocytes have come under intense scrutiny in recent years and have highlighted a link between metabolic flux and cell fate decisions<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">The network of transcription factors required for B cell activation and subsequent differentiation has been elucidated in some detail<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. By contrast, despite the established role of splicing and polyadenylation in the control of immunoglobulin gene expression, relatively little is known about how post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression influences the outcome of antigen encounter in B cells. Post-transcriptional fate of mRNA is mediated by its associated RNA-binding proteins (RBP) and non-coding RNAs, which determine the timing and magnitude of protein expression<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. B cell specific deletion of the RNA-processing enzyme Dicer inhibits the GC reaction<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, individual microRNAs, like miR-155, are regulators of ASC and GC formation<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Less is known about the importance of RBPs. Roquin is required for the restraint of helper T cell function during the GC reaction, but plays a minor role in B cells<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The RBP HNRPD has been implicated in B cell survival<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, but essential functions for sequence specific RBPs have not yet been found in B cells.</p><p id="P8">HuR (gene name <italic>Elavl1</italic>) is an RBP implicated in both nuclear and cytoplasmic regulation of RNA fate. HuR binds to uridine (U)-tracts present mostly within introns and 3&#x02032;UTRs, which correlates with its function as regulator of mRNA splicing and stability<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. HuR null mice are embryonic lethal<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Conditional HuR knockout (HuR cKO) mice have proven a useful tool to understand the role of HuR in myeloid cells where it limits proinflammatory cytokine production during chronic inflammation and cancer<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. HuR is required for maintenance of haematopoietic stem cells<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, and the selection and chemotaxis of T cells<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Here, we show that regulation of the B cell transcriptome by HuR is essential for normal antibody responses. B cell-specific deletion of HuR reveals an obligate role for HuR in the GC reaction. Moreover, the production of class-switched antibodies induced by T-independent antigens is dependent upon HuR. To identify the direct targets of HuR action, we mapped HuR:RNA interactions at single nucleotide level resolution in primary B cells<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Integration of gene expression profiling using RNAseq and identification of translationally regulated mRNA by ribosome profiling established a direct correlation between changes in gene expression and translation of specific mRNAs bound by HuR. Our analysis indicates that HuR regulates the expression of genes related to B cell energy metabolism and prevents the accumulation of fatal levels of reactive oxygen species upon B cell activation.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S2"><title>HuR expression is increased upon B cell activation</title><p id="P10">HuR is the only member of the Elavl family expressed in splenic B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In order to understand the role of HuR during B cell development and activation we generated B cell-specific conditional KO mice (<italic>Elavl1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>
<italic>Mb1</italic>-Cre, hereafter HuR-cKO mice). Analysis of HuR protein expression by flow cytometry showed that it was deleted from the pro-B cell stage in the bone marrow (BM) and was undetectable in transitional and mature B lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-d</xref>). HuR was similarly expressed in all B cell populations present in the spleen. RT-qPCR analysis of GC B cells, formed in the spleen after immunisation, showed a 6-fold increase in HuR mRNA in GC B cells compared to non-GC B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Intracellular flow cytometry indicated that HuR protein was increased by 2-fold in GC B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). B cell activation with LPS or &#x003b1;CD40 + IL-4 + IL-5 increased HuR protein expression by up to 3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that HuR expression is increased during B cell activation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>B cell development following HuR deletion in pro-B cells</title><p id="P11">Normal proportions of B cell subpopulations were present in BM, spleen and lymph nodes of HuR-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-c</xref>). We found a small decrease in the number of pre-B cells in BM and in the number of transitional and FO B cells in spleens of HuR-cKO mice. HuR-cKO mice had reduced numbers of B1 B cells in the peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Analysis of the incorporation of 2-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into the DNA of rapidly proliferating pre-B cells was not different in HuR-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig. 1a and 1b</xref>). Furthermore, B cell turnover in the spleen, inferred from BrdU incorporation over a 7-day period, was not different from control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Thus, with the exception of B1 B cells, there is little requirement for HuR for either B cell development or homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>B cells require HuR for normal antibody responses</title><p id="P12">HuR-cKO mice showed a significant reduction in all immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes present in serum, apart from IgA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). IgG<sub>1</sub> and IgG<sub>2b</sub> titers were reduced by 2.5-fold in HuR-cKO mice, whereas IgG<sub>3</sub> and IgM titers were reduced by 6- and 12-fold, respectively. Decreased IgM titers could result from the reduction of B1 B cells, as these contribute substantially to serum IgM. The biggest difference was found in IgG<sub>2c</sub> titers that were reduced by 200-fold in HuR-cKO mice. The decrease in almost all antibody isotypes likely reflects a requirement for HuR in B cells for a functional response following antigen encounter.</p><p id="P13">To investigate the requirement for HuR during the response of B cells to antigen, we immunised HuR-cKO mice with the thymus (T)-independent antigens, Ficoll or LPS coupled to the hapten 4-hydroxy-3 nitrophenolic acid (NP). NP-reactive IgM titers in serum showed a 5-fold reduction with both antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b and 3c</xref>). By contrast, we were unable to detect NP-reactive IgG<sub>3</sub> antibodies in serum from HuR-cKO mice. Next, we evaluated the ability of HuR-cKO B cells to participate in a thymus-dependent antibody response by assessing the serum antibody responses following primary and secondary immunisation with NP coupled to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Serum NP-reactive IgM titers showed an average 8.5-fold reduction. NP23-reactive IgG<sub>1</sub> titers, which reflect the combination of both low and high affinity antibodies, were 15-times lower in HuR-cKO mice than in control mice. Memory responses evaluated seven days after secondary immunisation were clearly detectable in HuR-cKO mice in the form of IgM antibodies. By contrast, NP2-reactive IgG<sub>1</sub> titers did not increase, suggesting high affinity IgG<sub>1</sub> memory cells did not form, or, if they did, their reactivation failed to generate ASC. As a measure of affinity maturation, we determined the ratio of NP2- and NP23-reactive IgG<sub>1</sub> antibodies, which indicated that NP-reactive antibodies in HuR-cKO mice failed to undergo affinity maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3e</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Affinity maturation takes place in GC, where helper T cells select B cells with the highest affinity for antigen. GC formation after seven days of immunisation with NP-KLH was diminished in HuR-cKO mice. The number of GC B cells was reduced by more than 6-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Similarly, following administration of highly immunogenic sheep red blood cells the GC response was defective over time in HuR-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig. 1c and 1d</xref>). Consistent with reduced titers of serum antibodies, the number of NP-reactive IgM ASC in the spleen of HuR-cKO mice immunised with NP-KLH was reduced by 2-fold, whereas the number of NP-reactive IgG<sub>1</sub> ASC was reduced by 50-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). A similar reduction was found in the number of NP-reactive IgM and IgG<sub>1</sub> ASC in the spleen of HuR-cKO mice seven days after secondary immunisation with NP-KLH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). Further analysis of ASC in the BM showed that HuR-cKO mice contained a similar number of NP-reactive IgM ASC, but NP-reactive IgG<sub>1</sub> ASC were barely detectable (&#x0003e;100-fold reduction) when compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>). These data show that HuR is required for proper B cell activation and/or differentiation following antigen encounter.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Regulation of the B cell transcriptome by HuR</title><p id="P15">To examine whether an early stage of B cell activation was affected by the absence of HuR, we measured changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> following crosslinking of cell surface IgM. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux elicited after activation of <italic>Mb1</italic>-Cre unfloxed controls (defined as &#x0201c;Ctrl.&#x0201d;) and HuR-cKO LN B cells was similar using either a highly crosslinking anti-IgM F(ab&#x02019;)<sub>2</sub> or a monoclonal anti-IgM (mAb B7.6) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Additionally, cell surface expression of CD25, CD40, CD69 and CD86 was increased to a similar extent in response to a variety of stimuli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig. 2b and 2c</xref>), indicating that, by these criteria at least, B cell activation was normal in the absence of HuR.</p><p id="P16">To discover the molecular mechanisms regulated by HuR in resting and activated B cells, we performed an integrated analysis of three high throughput measurements of the B cell transcriptome. Firstly, we searched for differential mRNA expression in HuR-cKO B cells by mRNAseq. Secondly, we determined the differences in mRNA translation between HuR-cKO and control B cells using ribosome footprinting (Ribo-Seq). Thirdly, we characterised HuR-RNA interactions at the single nucleotide level in LPS-activated B cells using iCLIP. Taken together, these measurements have the power to discriminate between changes in RNA isoform and abundance as well as translational regulation, and can relate these changes to HuR binding. Thus detected changes can be ascribed to be direct or indirect effects of HuR:RNA interactions. None of the changes were due to compensatory regulatory mechanisms affecting the abundance or ribosome loading of mRNAs encoding other members of the Elavl-family or of other AU-rich element binding proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Differential expression analysis of mRNAseq and Ribo-Seq followed by pathway enrichment analysis indicated gene signatures related to different aspects of the cell cycle and energy metabolism were enriched in HuR-cKO B cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). HuR deficiency influenced expression of genes related to glycolysis, TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, three pathways increased in GC B cells and after B cell activation with LPS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig. 4a, 4b and 4c</xref>). Blockade of these energy pathways using 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), CPI-613 or Oligomycin A decreased B cell survival, cell growth and cell proliferation after mitogen stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig. 4d and 4e</xref>). Analysis of the global fold-change in mRNA expression and translation of genes related to glycolysis, TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation showed no change when comparing e<italic>x vivo</italic> (unstimulated) control versus HuR-cKO B cells. By contrast, global expression and/or translation of these mRNAs were increased in LPS-activated HuR-cKO B cells, suggesting that HuR is only important for regulating the reprogramming of energy metabolism upon activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig. 4f</xref>). Data correlation between mRNAseq and Ribo-Seq of only those metabolic genes that are differentially translated in LPS-activated HuR-cKO B cells showed that all of them, with the exception of dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase (<italic>Dlst</italic>), were modestly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig. 4g, 4h and 4j</xref>). <italic>Dlst</italic> mRNA was increased in GC B cells when compared to naive B cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig. 4i</xref>), but its mRNA expression and translation was significantly reduced in LPS-activated HuR-cKO B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P18"><italic>Dlst</italic> is one of the three subunits of the &#x003b1;KGDH enzymatic complex, which is essential for maintaining tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux and cell energy supply.

These mRNA splicing profiles showed that a single mRNA transcript was generated after RNA splicing in <italic>ex vivo</italic> and LPS-activated control B cells. In the absence of HuR, <italic>Dlst</italic> mRNA showed two alternative splicing events: intron 10 retention and alternative inclusion of a cryptic exon between exon 10 and 11. iCLIP data showed that HuR binds to several locations along <italic>Dlst</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig. 5a-c</xref>).

Taken together, these data demonstrate that HuR binding to <italic>Dlst</italic> pre-mRNA might promote <italic>Dlst</italic> mRNA expression and translation in HuR-cKO B cells.

Analysis of unique read counts in all three iCLIP experiments showed that 75% of HuR-RNA crosslink sites were mapped to introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig. 5e and 5f</xref>). Visualisation of HuR crosslink sites close to the exon-intron boundaries indicated that HuR preferentially binds to introns, and showed a significant binding enrichment between the branch point and the 3&#x02032; splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). These data suggested that HuR might be a splicing regulator in B cells, thus we studied whether HuR modulates pre-mRNA splicing by further analysis of mRNAseq data from LPS-activated B cells. Differential exon analysis using DEXSeq did not reveal significant changes in exon usage of protein coding transcripts in the absence of HuR, and failed to identify the alternative splicing events associated with <italic>Dlst</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">5</xref>). Thus, we performed an intron-centric analysis of the mRNAseq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>), which showed that 530 introns belonging to 375 genes were differentially used in LPS-activated HuR-cKO B cells compared to control B cells (padj&#x0003c;0.1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>).

When expression of genes in groups 1, 2 and 3 was analysed globally, no changes in mRNA abundance was observed when comparing HuR-cKO versus control B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>). By contrast, global translation of these mRNAs was significantly reduced in HuR-cKO B cells, suggesting that, even though HuR-dependent regulation of alternative splicing might not necessarily affect overall mRNA levels, HuR is required for mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>). Global mRNA expression and translation of the genes in group 4 were both reduced by up to 50%.

In summary, differential intron usage analysis and its correlation with differential expression in mRNAseq and Ribo-Seq allowed us to discover the alternative intron events associated with HuR binding.

Read coverage analysis of the <italic>Dlst</italic> gene locus using mRNAseq data from HuR-cKO B cells identified a novel alternative exon splicing event located after exon 10.

Detection of reads mapped across the exon 10/alternative exon 10b junction suggested that this was an alternative exon inclusion rather than an alternative first exon. RT-PCR validated this observation and indicated that over 50% of <italic>Dlst</italic> transcripts within HuR-cKO B cells included the alternatively spliced exon 10b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). mRNAseq data showed little difference in <italic>Dlst</italic> mRNA expression between <italic>ex vivo</italic> or LPS-activated HuR-cKO and control B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>).

Quality analysis of sequencing data was done using FastQC. Data analysis was done in the iCount pipeline. First, the four unknown bases of the 5&#x02032; barcode were used to remove PCR duplicate reads. 3&#x02032; barcode (AT) was used to define the length of the reads. Both parameters were important to identify unique reads. Then, reads were trimmed to remove 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; barcodes along with any adaptor sequence before mapping to the genome using Bowtie. Data was originally annotated to mm9 genome, but was lifted over to mm10 genome using Galaxy. Once genome annotation was completed, nucleotide &#x02212;1 was located and used for data visualization in UCSC genome viewer. This base is the HuR- crosslink binding site. The number cDNA counts associated to a single HuR- crosslink site was quantified base on read length and unique 5&#x02032; barcode sequence. Peak call analysis was performed to identify unique HuR-crosslink binding sites with a FDR&#x0003c;0.05. Peak call analysis was performed in iCount by genome wide analysis of 30 base windows defined after annotation at single nucleotide resolution of HuR-RNA interactions (15 nucleotides flanking a cross link site). Peak enrichment analysis and FDR calculation was performed allowing 100 permutations and multiple hypothesis testing to correct for multiple comparisons.</p><p id="P47">Raw sequencing data from mRNAseq and Ribo-Seq was demultiplexed, FastQ analysed and mapped to mm10 genome annotation using Tophat. Differential gene expression analysis of mRNAseq and Ribo-Seq datasets was performed using DESeq and DESeq2 packages<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. Briefly, data was adjusted to a negative binomial distribution after correction by library size factor. Differential expression analysis, p value determination and Benjamini-Hochberg multiple test correction of the p values were performed to obtain final padj values. DEXSeq package was used for exon and intron usage analysis<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>. First, we define exons and introns by using the Ensembl exon annotation for protein coding transcripts (GRCm38.72) and we independently counted reads within the exon and intron bins by using HTSeq. Read counting along exon bins was required in order to estimate the library size factors. We then used these size factors to normalise the intron bins and assessed differential intron usage with DEXSeq. A hypergeometric statistical test followed by Benjamini-Hochberg correction of the p- values was performed for pathway enrichment analysis<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup>. UCSC and IGV were used to visualise read coverage (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM">Supplemental Information</xref>). Sequencing data was visualised in UCSC genome viewer. Read coverage of mRNAseq and Ribo-Seq data was visualised in the Integrated Genome Browser (IGV).</p><p id="P48">Unpaired t tests or Mann-Whitney tests were performed for statistical analysis of non-sequencing data.
