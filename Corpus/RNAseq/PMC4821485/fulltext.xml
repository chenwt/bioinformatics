We previously reported that <italic>Rspo2</italic> is a major determinant of susceptibility to <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>-mediated colitis in mice and recent genome-wide association studies have revealed <italic>RSPO3</italic> as a candidate Crohn&#x02019;s disease-specific inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility gene in humans. However, there is little information on the endogenous expression and cellular source of R-spondins in the colon at steady state and during intestinal inflammation. RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR were used to assess the expression of R-spondins at steady state and in two mouse models of colonic inflammation. The cellular source of R-spondins was assessed in specific colonic cell populations isolated by cell sorting. Data mining from publicly available datasets was used to assess the expression of R-spondins in the human colon. At steady state, colonic expression of <italic>R-spondins</italic> was found to be exclusive to non-epithelial CD45<sup>-</sup> lamina propria cells, and <italic>Rspo3/RSPO3</italic> was the most highly expressed R-spondin in both mouse and human colon. R-spondin expression was found to be highly dynamic and differentially regulated during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infection and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis, with notably high levels of <italic>Rspo3</italic> expression during DSS colitis, and high levels of <italic>Rspo2</italic> expression during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infection, specifically in susceptible mice. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that in the colon, R-spondins are expressed by subepithelial stromal cells, and that <italic>Rspo3/RSPO3</italic> is the family member most implicated in colonic homeostasis. The differential regulation of the R-spondins in different models of intestinal inflammation indicate they respond to specific pathogenic and inflammatory signals that differ in the two models and provides further evidence that this family of proteins plays a key role in linking intestinal inflammation and homeostasis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding for this work came from Canadian Institutes of Health Research grant # MOP 133580, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html">http://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html</ext-link>.

All four R-spondin family members likely share similar biological activities as evidenced by structure and functional analyses: R-spondins bind the stem cell receptors Lgr4-6 and the transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases Znrf3/Rnf43 to potentiate Wnt signaling by modulating Wnt receptor turnover [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although they have roles in many tissues, R-spondins are of particular importance in the gastrointestinal tract where they have been shown to be crucial for the maintenance of intestinal stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These stem cells at the base of intestinal crypts mediate the vigorous self-renewal of the intestinal epithelium and give rise to transit amplifying cells which divide before they terminally differentiate into specialized cell types such as enterocytes and goblet cells [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Mature cells then undergo apoptosis a few days after their terminal differentiation and are shed into the gut lumen.</p><p>The canonical Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway plays a major role in regulating epithelial cell fate and represents the first driving force behind the proliferation of intestinal epithelial precursors [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Genetic manipulations have demonstrated the critical role of this pathway in intestinal homeostasis and the fatal consequences of either too much or too little Wnt signaling. Conditional ablation of &#x003b2;-catenin from the intestinal epithelium blocks proliferation of epithelial precursors leading to crypt degeneration and loss, intestinal failure, and death [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Conversely, mutations in <italic>APC</italic>, a component of the &#x003b2;-catenin destruction complex, result in hyperproliferation of intestinal crypts and the loss of fully differentiated cells, also leading to death [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These data highlight the critical need for balanced Wnt signaling to ensure intestinal homeostasis.</p><p>Like Wnt signaling itself, emerging evidence indicates that R-spondin activity must also be kept in a fine balance to maintain intestinal health. Activating translocations of <italic>RSPO2</italic> and <italic>RSPO3</italic> that are mutually exclusive with other Wnt-activating mutations have been shown to drive the development of colon cancer [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and we recently demonstrated through a forward genetics approach that <italic>Rspo2</italic> is a major determinant of susceptibility to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic>-mediated infectious colitis in mice [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Susceptible mice (e.g. C3H/HeOuJ) share a unique genetic haplotype immediately upstream of <italic>Rspo2</italic>, driving high levels of <italic>Rspo2</italic> in susceptible mouse strains during infection and leading to pathological activation of Wnt signaling, loss of intestinal differentiation, and animal death [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Inhibition of R-spondin-mediated pathways by recombinant Dkk1 administration improved outcome in these susceptible mice [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast, C3H/HeOuJ mice carrying a congenic segment encompassing <italic>Rspo2</italic> and its regulatory region from resistant mice (C3Ou.B6-<italic>Cri1</italic>) do not upregulate <italic>Rspo2</italic> during infection, and instead suffer from self-limiting disease with no mortality [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Conversely, studies in mice have shown that exogenous R-spondin1 treatment can promote the recovery of intestinal stem cells after radiation-induced damage [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and be beneficial in several experimental colitis models including DSS-induced colitis by stimulating crypt cell growth and promoting intestinal healing [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) identified a SNP within <italic>RSPO3</italic> as a Crohn&#x02019;s disease-specific susceptibility locus (rs9491697, p = 3.79E-10, OR = 1.08) [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, as with the majority of loci identified in GWAS studies, the causal variant underlying this association has not been identified, and it is not known whether a gain- or loss- of function at <italic>RSPO3</italic> could be implicated in Crohn&#x02019;s disease susceptibility.</p><p>Taken together, these reports indicate that R-spondins may link intestinal inflammation and homeostasis, but also identify an urgent need to better understand the roles of endogenous R-spondins in healthy and inflamed intestinal tissue, for which there is currently little information. While several groups have studied the effects of treating the intestinal epithelium with exogenous R-spondins, few have examined the endogenous expression of R-spondins in the gut. This work focuses on assessing expression levels of <italic>Rspo1-4</italic> in the colon at steady state and during intestinal inflammation using two IBD-relevant mouse models in which R-spondins were shown to be highly regulated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All breeding and experimental procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the Canadian Council of Animal Care and approved by the McGill University Animal Care Committee (permit #5009).

Expression of all R-spondins returned to homeostatic levels by day 9 of recovery from DSS administration, suggesting an acute role for R-spondins in intestinal repair at the time points in which the epithelium is most damaged.

However, since it is not known whether a gain- or loss- of function at <italic>RSPO3</italic> is implicated in Crohn&#x02019;s disease susceptibility, we can only speculate that a gain-of-function would promote Wnt-dependent intestinal proliferation but with the potentially harmful effect of limiting differentiation while a loss-of-function could limit intestinal repair. Taken together, these reports suggest that R-spondins may have a broad relevance in inflammation-associated intestinal diseases and warrant further investigation into the role of endogenous R-spondins in healthy and inflamed intestinal tissue, for which there is currently little information.</p><p>Our RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR analyses combined with publicly available human expression data revealed the <italic>Rspo3</italic>/<italic>RSPO3</italic> gene to be the dominant R-spondin expressed in the normal uninflamed colon, indicating that <italic>Rspo3</italic>/<italic>RSPO3</italic> is a major contributor to the potentiation of canonical Wnt signaling at steady state. However, despite their importance in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis the source of these secreted proteins is still poorly understood.

This prevents the assessment of R-spondin function in the intestine during postnatal development and disease conditions. Consistent with previous work, our gene expression analyses of isolated epithelial cells and sorted CD45<sup>+</sup> and CD45<sup>-</sup> colonic lamina propria cells restricted <italic>Rspo1-3</italic> expression to the CD45<sup>-</sup> population. Future work will need to sort the R-spondin-expressing pool into further sub-populations using various hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic stromal cell markers specific for each of the different populations of mesenchymal cells that are present in the lamina propria. Our progress towards identifying the cell type expressing R-spondins can guide in the development of a conditional knockout mouse line to study the role of R-spondins specifically in the intestine without confounding effects from their roles in other tissues. In addition, it will provide the starting point for <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex-vivo</italic> analyses of which inflammatory mediators including IBD-relevant cytokines are important for R-spondin induction.</p><p>We have previously shown that pathological induction of <italic>Rspo2</italic> during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infection leads to intestinal dysfunction and death in genetically susceptible mice [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We expanded on this study to examine the expression of all four <italic>R-spondin</italic> genes during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium-</italic>mediated colitis and DSS-induced colitis including a post-DSS repair period. R-spondins were found to be highly modulated during inflammation, with notably robust upregulation of <italic>Rspo2</italic> expression during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infection in susceptible mice and upregulation of <italic>Rspo3</italic> expression during DSS colitis. The finding that <italic>Rspo3</italic> was the most highly induced R-spondin during DSS treatment with significantly elevated absolute expression levels of this gene highlights <italic>Rspo3</italic> as a potentially important mediator of Wnt signaling in the gut. In our DSS repair model, R-spondin levels continuously increased until crypt morphology gradually began to recover after several days following DSS withdrawal. This suggests a role for R-spondins in facilitating epithelial repair as a response to mucosal injury, which is consistent with enhancement of Wnt signaling during intestinal regeneration [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and with the observations that genetic reduction or pharmacological inhibition of Dkk1 during DSS colitis has been shown to promote wound repair by increasing proliferation of epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The discovery that R-spondins are differentially regulated during enteric infection and DSS administration provides a novel avenue of investigation into the mechanisms of R-spondin gene regulation. Despite both models inducing intestinal inflammation, the difference in host response to enteric infection and chemical DSS may be responsible for the differential expression of the R-spondins; it may be that they require specific pathogenic and inflammatory signaling necessary for induction. Indeed, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infection induces a robust Th1/Th17 response with increased gene expression of IFN-&#x003b3;, interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-17, and IL-22 [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] while acute DSS colitis activates a predominant Th1 response but with upregulation of several Th2 cytokines including IL-10 [<xref rid="pone.0152859.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Elucidating this difference in host response may provide important insights in the mechanisms governing R-spondin expression in the intestinal tract.</p><p>In summary, our work exploited the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infectious colitis model and the DSS colitis/repair model to explore R-spondin expression at steady state and during inflammation in the colon. We have shown that R-spondins are expressed by sub-epithelial non-hematopoietic stromal cells and that their expression is differentially and strongly regulated during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infection and DSS colitis. Our data suggest that R-spondin-mediated signaling can be modulated by infectious or inflammatory stimuli and provides further evidence that this family of proteins plays a key role in linking intestinal inflammation and homeostasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152859.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Relative expression of <italic>R-spondin</italic> genes in the normal colon of C3Ou.B6-<italic>Cri1</italic> mice R-spondin levels in C3Ou.B6-<italic>Cri1</italic> mice colon at steady state as acquired by RNAseq (n = 3).</title><p>Error bars represent mean &#x000b1;SEM. # = undetected.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152859.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Lei Zhu for technical assistance with the animal experiments and Maryse Dagenais for advice on the DSS experiments.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0152859.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>YR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yoon</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name>. <article-title>The R-spondin family of proteins: emerging regulators of WNT signaling</article-title>. <source>Int J Biochem Cell Biol</source>. <year>2012</year>;<volume>44</volume>:<fpage>2278</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>2287</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2012.09.006">10.1016/j.biocel.2012.09.006</ext-link></comment><?supplied-pmid 22982762?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22982762</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0152859.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>WC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>de Lau</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Madoori</surname><given-names>PK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Forneris</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Granneman</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Clevers</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
