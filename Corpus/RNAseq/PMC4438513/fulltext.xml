In 2008, studies estimated that around 1.5 billion adults had a BMI of 25&#x000a0;kg/m2 or greater, and out of these 205 million men and 297 million women had a BMI of 30&#x000a0;kg/m2 and were classified as obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Secondary major health risks, such as but not limited to hypertension, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases are highly associated with obesity and are seen as well in increasing numbers of adults worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Obesity most commonly results if the energy intake (e.g. through energy-dense food) exceeds energy expenditure, and as a direct consequence the overall energy homeostasis is imbalanced. This excess energy is stored in the body in form of white fat, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] which also acts as an endocrine organ by releasing adipokines and cytokines into the bloodstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin e.g. which regulates energy intake and appetite was reportedly found at elevated levels in the bloodstream of obese subjects and is positively correlated with BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>While some of the functions and implications of white adipose tissue (WAT) have been discovered and are investigated, understanding of the underlying biology is far from comprehensive or complete. In addition to WAT, functional BAT in adults has been discovered through radiological detection by several research groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and has recently become a promising therapeutic target due to its ability to dissipate energy in form of heat, through a process called non-shivering thermogenesis (or uncoupled respiration). Surprisingly, only 50&#x000a0;g of BAT are believed to be sufficient to burn 20% of the overall average energy intake of a healthy adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover, some studies propose that the amount of BAT in humans is inversely associated with BMI, i.e. healthy, normal-weight subjects bear a greater amount than obese or overweight individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the idea of enriching BAT or converting WAT into functional BAT has become attractive and many efforts have been started to investigate the possibilities further. Promoting BAT-like features in white adipocytes, known as &#x0201c;browning&#x0201d;, leads to the remodeling of WAT as energy storage into an energy dissipation site. Experimental protocols have been pursued that interfere either with the PPAR&#x003b3; pathway by SirT1-dependent deacetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], or in the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-related kinase signaling pathways by a hormone called irisin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It has been suggested that this &#x0201c;transdifferentiation&#x0201d; could be an inherent property of white adipocytes and may not be due to a distinct cell type with this predisposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, the identification of brown-in-white/brite/beige adipocytes has led to the assumption that a small proportion of inducible adipocytes is naturally present in some classical WAT depots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These beige cells can be induced by cold or &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation and can be observed as UCP1-positive islets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>SGBS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] are widely used as a model for white adipocytes. However, our data suggest that the cell line harbors an inducible phenotype that changes throughout the differentiation stage. Day 14 displays multiple characteristics of brown fat cells whereas day 28 represents a rather white phenotype. Many reports have recently suggested that the traditional classification of adipocytes is not exclusive and the existence of beige/brite adipocytes has been shown.</p><p>Studies aimed at pinpointing the mechanisms involved in the conversion between white and brown/beige/brite human adipocytes and metabolic characterizations are largely dependent on the use of <italic>in-vitr</italic>o cell systems given the limited access to human subjects and range of human procedures that can be performed for obvious ethical reasons.</p><p>Thus, we were aiming to elucidate the unique nature of SGBS cells characterized by displaying transient features of brown adipocytes and eventually progressing to a white phenotype. In depth functional and phenotypic analysis of differentiated SGBS cells at both distinct stages and comparison with brown PAZ6 and white SW872 adipocytes allowed the study of molecular gene expression patterns and pathways involved in the conversion between white and brown adipocytes. This knowledge will be of importance for studies aiming to increase brown fat depots in order to increase energy expenditure in obese subjects with the ultimate goal of weight reduction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell lines/cell culturing</title><p>The brown pre-adipocyte cell line PAZ6 was kindly gifted by Dr. D.

The in-depth understanding of the biology of adipose tissues is a critical piece to solving this obesity puzzle. Beyond its originally defined fat storage function, adipose tissue exhibits endocrine gland-like functions, secreting mediators that exert behavioral, metabolic and inflammatory actions at distant organs. Its non-parenchymal cells contribute to the synthesis of immune mediators with pro-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

Due to its substantial caloric cost, NST has begun to be explored therapeutically in the past seven years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

The LiSa-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], LS-14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and AML-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] cell lines have originated from spontaneous tumors and the Chub-S7 line was immortalized by means of telomerase reverse transcriptase and papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. With regards to brown pre- or adipocyte cell lines, there are no other immortalized human cell lines to our knowledge. However, human multipotent adipose-derived stem cells (MADS) that have the potential to differentiate in either white or brown fat adipocytes have been established in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Additionally, SVF from supra-clavicular fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and primary stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] have also been utilized in studies of human brown adipose in vitro. A comparison between the PAZ6 features and those of MADS should be informative in the future.</p><p>By extensively comparing and characterizing three human adipocyte cell lines we noticed that the SGBS cell line harbors a versatile phenotype, which changes throughout its mature stage and questions the characterization of SGBS as a true white adipocyte cell line model. D14 displays multiple characteristics of brown fat cells such as UCP1 and PPAR&#x003b3; overexpression whereas D28 represents a rather white phenotype.</p><p>Jo et al. previously reported the existence of a temporary increase of PPAR&#x003b3; and transient expression of UCP1 in the stromal-vascular fraction of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), which were induced to differentiate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. We also considered the possibility that the induction of brown-adipocyte-like features upon differentiation in cell line settings was induced artificially since some studies reported that chronic treatment of white adipocytes with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3; agonist rosiglitazone promotes PGC1&#x003b1; and UCP1 expression along with an increase in mitochondriogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In our study, PAZ6 and SGBS differentiation media were also enriched with rosiglitazone, as this is a standard formulation and widely used. We therefore depleted rosiglitazone from the SGBS medium to investigate whether our observation was mainly attributed to its presence. Nevertheless, even in absence of rosiglitazone we noticed up-regulation of BAT markers such as UCP1 and PPAR&#x003b3; in SGBS cells at D14, which then declined up to D28 (data not shown). We therefore conclude that we are not promoting the phenotype observed in maturating SGBS cells by drug treatment, but rather are seeing an intrinsic property of the SGBS adipocyte cell line itself.</p><p>The third cell line, which we characterized, was SW872. Even though SW872 cells are widely used as a human pre-adipocyte model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] some features are not fully characteristic for WAT. We noticed that the differentiation of SW872 cells could be initiated at confluency levels less than 100% which was indeed required for PAZ6 and SGBS cells. Similarly, we observed that 100% of SW872 cells were fully differentiated at D7 by applying the above described culture conditions. Additionally, SW872 cells continued to proliferate even during the differentiation process and did not undergo contact inhibition and growth arrest (data not shown). Of special note, we observed that differentiated SW872 adipocytes displayed many characteristics of WAT, however especially lipid droplet size and numbers were not characteristic for the white adipocyte phenotype.</p><p>In addition to the up-regulation of characteristic BAT markers in SGBS and PAZ6 cells, we noticed high levels of adiponectin in mature PAZ6 and SGBS cells at D14. Notably in line with the transient phenotype, adiponectin levels in SGBS cells decrease up to D28 by 50% as opposed to leptin levels. Interestingly, adiponectin is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and inverse correlation to insulin resistance and its levels in humans rise in response to weight loss and exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Next generation sequencing revealed that 5 out of the top 10 pathways, which are differentially expressed between SGBS cells at D14 and D28, are involved in adipogenesis and/or metabolism. Among them the PPAR&#x003b3; pathway followed by the adipocytokine signaling pathway are most significantly affected. PPAR&#x003b3; is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors which control the expression of genes mainly involved in adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, inflammation and maintenance of metabolic homeostasis. Interestingly, PPAR&#x003b3; signaling was significantly and exclusively up-regulated in PAZ6 and SGBS cells at Day 14, but underwent inhibition in SGBS cells cultured to D28. Furthermore, many downstream molecules such as UCP1 were down-regulated in SGBS cells at D28, which indicates the shift from the brown to the white phenotype. Interestingly, Perilipin 1 (PLIN1) was also among the genes down-regulated in SGBS cells at D28. A recent study from Sawada et al. revealed that overexpression on PLIN1 lead to an induction of a brown-like or beige phenotype in the WAT of transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], which we noticed in our study in SGBS at D14 when PLIN1 expression peaked.</p><p>Furthermore, our delineation of the expression of mitochondrial complexes and metabolism in these three adipocyte cell lines corroborates our genomics and proteomics results and fulfills the demand for functional assessments in metabolic cell models. The generally increased levels of respiratory complexes were expectedly matched by improved respiratory capacity in adipocytes relative to their undifferentiated counterparts. We believe this is an interesting finding and the reason is two-fold: firstly, the differentiation process of all three cell lines was effective in launching their oxidative capacity. This is significant in the <italic>in vitro</italic> context because cells in culture normally shift their metabolism towards anaerobic glycolysis, which was indeed predominant in the pre-adipocyte but not in the differentiated adipocyte state. Secondly, adipose tissue is generally regarded as metabolically slow. However, both differentiated PAZ6 and D14 SGBS cells are shown to dispose of spare respiratory capacities several fold greater than their undifferentiated counterparts. Whether this is an intrinsic property of the differentiated cells, an effect exclusively dependent on the differentiation cocktail or both, remains to be defined. It would be extremely informative to address how the metabolic capacity of PAZ6 and SGBS compares to that of other human tissues on a per mg of protein basis.</p><p>As for drug effects, previously reported effects of RA, T3 and forskolin/IBMX in promoting a brown adipose-like phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] were observed in PAZ6 and SW872 adipocytes in this study by means of induction of respiratory complexes and oxidative capacity. The effect of the RA, T3 and adrenergic signaling mimetics (IBMX/forskolin) upon glycolysis is an interesting finding. At this point we cannot dissociate the individual effects of each compound or their interactions with the differentiation cocktail. However, it seems plausible that in addition to boosting lipid oxidation, brown adipose tissue may also utilize glycolysis to support its metabolic demands. Recently, Hao et al. described the global expression changes is interscapular BAT (iBAT) of cold exposed C57 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This <italic>in-vivo</italic> experiment was complemented with the <italic>in-vitro</italic> treatment of primary brown adipocytes with isoproterenol for 6&#x000a0;hours. In both cases, an increase in several glycolytic enzymes was detected, supporting the notion that glycolysis may be a relevant component in BAT cold adaptation. In line with this, human imaging studies employing F-DG as a BAT activity marker consistently describe increased F-DG uptake in cold-exposed individuals. Whether the incoming glucose is utilized anaerobically or shunted to supply uncoupled respiration needs to be determined. Whatever the case, this improved capacity for glucose utilization observed in treated PAZ6 adipocytes, provides a means whereby brown adipocytes could scavenge excess circulating glucose, which could be explored to improve glucose homeostasis in diabetic states.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, our study investigates intrinsic properties of the unique human brown adipose cell line PAZ6, human white SW872 adipocytes and human SGBS cells that display a transient brown phenotype which can be further induced by &#x003b2;-adrenergic stimulation through cold exposure. Even though this behavior was shown in only one cell line and cannot be generalized at this point, our unique study contributes to the discovery of molecular gene expression patterns and pathways, which are involved in the conversion from white and brown adipocytes. This knowledge will be of importance for translational studies aimed at increasing brown fat depots in order to increase energy expenditure in obese subjects with the ultimate goal of weight reduction.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec28"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12967_2015_480_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>List of primers and their sequences used in quantitative RT-PCR.</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BAT</term><def><p>Brown adipose tissue</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IBMX</term><def><p>3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UCP1</term><def><p>Uncoupling protein 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WAT</term><def><p>White adipose tissue</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SGBS</term><def><p>Simpson-Golabi-Behmel gigantism</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPAR&#x003b3;</term><def><p>Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T2D</term><def><p>Type 2 diabetes</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SirT1</term><def><p>Sirtuin 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PGC1&#x003b1;</term><def><p>Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRDM16</term><def><p>PR domain zinc finger protein 16</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>b3AR</term><def><p>Beta3-adrenergic receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NNT</term><def><p>Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ATCC</term><def><p>American Type Culture Collection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OCR</term><def><p>Oxygen consumption rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECAR</term><def><p>Extracellular acidification rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NST</term><def><p>Non-shivering thermogenesis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MADS</term><def><p>Multipotent adipose-derived stem cells</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ADSC</term><def><p>Adipose-derived stem cells</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PLIN1</term><def><p>Perilipin 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Tcf21</term><def><p>Human Transcription factor 21</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT</term><def><p>room temperature</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GO</term><def><p>Gene ontology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DEGs</term><def><p>Differentially expressed genes</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GEO</term><def><p>Gene Expression Omnibus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NCBI</term><def><p>National Center for Biotechnical Information</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FU</term><def><p>Fluorescent units</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Vladimir Zilberfarb and Arthur Donny Strosberg Deceased</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>AG designed and performed the experiments, analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript.
