The two form a complex with C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger transcription factor ZBRK1 on an intronic binding site in the growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible &#x003b1; (<italic>GADD45A</italic>) gene and a novel site in the fibroblast growth factor 2 (<italic>FGF2</italic>) gene. Chromatin at both sites is enriched for histone methyltransferase SETDB1 and histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation, a repressive epigenetic mark. Depletion of ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR led to elevated <italic>GADD45A</italic> and <italic>FGF2</italic> expression in malignant and non-malignant breast epithelial cells, and caused apoptotic death. Loss of viability could be rescued by simultaneous knockdowns of <italic>FGF2</italic> and transcriptional coregulators or by blocking FGF2 function. FGF2 was not concurrently expressed with any of the transcriptional coregulators in breast malignancies, suggesting an inverse correlation between their expression patterns. We propose that ZBRK1, KAP-1 and LCoR form a transcriptional complex that silences gene expression, in particular <italic>FGF2</italic>, which maintains breast cell viability. Given the broad expression patterns of both LCoR and KAP-1 during development and in the adult, this complex may have several regulatory functions that extend beyond cell survival, mediated by interactions with ZBRK1 or other C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger proteins.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Eukaryotic gene transcription is controlled by epigenetic changes and chromatin reorganization, which are mediated by sequence-specific transcription factor (TF) binding to proximal or distal regulatory elements (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). While TFs bind deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) directly, they do not possess the catalytic activities required to modify the amino acid residues of N-terminal histone tails, and hence cannot affect the structure of chromatin. However, they provide a platform on to which coactivators or corepressors bind, and either directly modify histone tails or recruit additional proteins that do so (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The result of these interactions is the formation of transcriptional complexes on DNA that can number up to 50 proteins (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), which dictate a specific transcriptional outcome, ultimately altering cell function (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>The coregulator ligand-dependent corepressor (LCoR) binds directly to ligand-bound nuclear receptors through an N-terminal NR-box (LxxLL motif) and represses hormone-stimulated transactivation via recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs), C-terminal binding proteins (CtBPs) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>) and indirect association with CtBP-interacting protein (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). It also binds to Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) to repress KLF6 target genes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), indicating that it can associate with multiple classes of TFs. LCoR is expressed very early in embryonic development and widely in the adult (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Another broadly expressed corepressor is Kr&#x000fc;ppel-associated box (KRAB)-associated protein 1 (KAP-1; also known as TRIM28). KAP-1 is predominantly associated with intronic regions of specific genes where it mediates transcriptional repression by recruitment of the histone methyltransferase SET domain, bifurcated 1 (SETDB1), which catalyzes histone 3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;12</xref>). The N-terminal region of KAP-1 contains an RBCC (Really Interesting New Gene finger, two B-box zinc fingers and a coiled-coil) domain which mediates its recruitment to chromatin through associations with the KRAB domain of a variety of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger TFs (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the results of a yeast two-hybrid screen using LCoR as bait, which identified KAP-1 (also known as tripartite motif 28; TRIM28) as an LCoR-binding partner, potentially linking LCoR to transcriptional repression by an array of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> TFs. We investigated the putative roles of LCoR in repression of transcription by C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> TFs using zinc finger and BRCA1-interacting protein with a KRAB domain [ZBRK1; also known as zinc-finger protein (ZNF) 350], as a model, as ZBRK1 binds KAP-1 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref>) and has a variety of defined targets including growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible &#x003b1; (<italic>GADD45A</italic>) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), high motility group A-T hook 2 (<italic>HMGA2</italic>) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (<italic>MMP9</italic>) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and angiopoietin 1 (<italic>ANG1</italic>) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). ZBRK1 binds to both promoter and intragenic regions. Moreover, depending on the context, ZBRK1 may promote or hinder the development of certain types of cancer (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;20</xref>). We find that a complex composed of LCoR, KAP-1 and ZBRK1 binds to an intronic motif and represses expression of <italic>GADD45A</italic> across all cell lines investigated. In addition, we found a novel ZBRK1 target gene, <italic>FGF2</italic> (fibroblast growth factor-2), repressed by the transcriptional complex in MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma and MCF10A breast epithelial cells through binding to a nearly identical 3&#x02032; intronic motif and establishing the H3K9me3 repressive mark with which the histone methyltransferase SETDB1 is associated. FGF2 has been shown to inhibit MCF-7 cell growth (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and downregulate levels of Bcl-2, promoting apoptosis (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Similarly, in T47D ductal carcinoma cells (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), forced FGF2 expression conferred a less malignant phenotype. Remarkably, ablation of ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR markedly increased MCF-7 and MCF10A cell apoptosis, an effect inhibited by blocking FGF2 expression or function. Expression patterns of FGF2 and the three transcriptional regulators were mutually exclusive in a variety of malignant breast tissues, offering a potential molecular mechanism for low FGF2 expression in certain types of breast cancer (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;28</xref>). In conclusion, we propose that a complex composed of LCoR, KAP-1 and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger TF ZBRK1 promotes a transcriptional program that silences gene expression which, among other potential outcomes, suppresses FGF2-induced apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Note that at least three independent biological replicates of all experiments were performed and one representative set of experiments was chosen for presentation in figures unless otherwise indicated below.

Gating on breast cancer cells that have a low or high expression of FGF2, we can see that the distribution of KAP-1 and ZBRK-1 expression, but not LCoR, is inversely correlated with the expression of FGF2 in the samples of breast invasive carcinoma (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).

Given its high expression in human fetal brain (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), we screened a human fetal brain yeast 2-hybrid cDNA library with a construct containing the Gal4 DNA binding domain (147 amino acids) and full-length LCoR (Supplementary Figure S1A), and identified two independent &#x0223c;650&#x02013;850-bp-long clones encoding the C-terminal region of KAP-1, a widely expressed transcriptional coregulator (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). These clones encompass amino acids 453-670 and 453-737, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, top). To confirm the association of LCoR with KAP-1 we analyzed their interactions in MCF-7 cells, which express both proteins (Supplementary Figure S1B). MCF-7 cells were transfected with either HA-tagged KAP-1 or FLAG-tagged LCoR, checked for expression of the tagged proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, upper panels), immunoprecipitated with either anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody and then probed for LCoR or KAP-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, middle panels). An interaction between endogenous proteins was also detected by immunoprecipitating KAP-1 and then probing for LCoR in MCF-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lower panel). The association was further validated by pull-downs using GST fusions of KAP-1 or the estrogen receptor &#x003b1; (ER&#x003b1;) ligand binding domain as a positive control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Additional pull-downs with GST fusions of full-length or truncated LCoR revealed that KAP-1-bound to the C-terminal domain (a.a. 302 to 433) of LCoR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>; note that the GST fusions of truncated LCoR mutants were produced in bacteria at far higher levels than GST fused to full-length LCoR). The 302-433 region of LCoR identified is distinct from the central domain required for interaction with HDACs (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and the tandem N-terminal P<italic>X</italic>DLS consensus motifs required for binding of CtBP corepressors (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Finally, as KAP-1 interacts with C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger TF ZBRK1, which functions as a transcriptional repressor in MCF-7 cells (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), we were interested in determining whether LCoR was a component of a KAP-1/ZBRK1 complex. HA-tagged KAP-1 co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous ZBRK1 in MCF-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, left panel), as previously reported (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref>). Similarly, immunoprecipitation of transiently expressed FLAG-LCoR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, right panel) revealed that LCoR and ZBRK1 also co-immunoprecipitate.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>ZBRK1, KAP-1 and LCoR repress <italic>FGF2</italic> and <italic>GADD45A</italic> gene expression in breast cancer cells</title><p>Previous microarray analysis in non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells provided evidence that ZBRK1 targets <italic>ANG1</italic> and potentially <italic>FGF2</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), while other experimental work established targets <italic>GADD45A</italic> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), <italic>HMGA2</italic> (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and <italic>MMP9</italic> (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). To determine if these genes are regulated by a transcriptional complex containing ZBRK1-KAP1-LCoR, we performed knockdowns of each protein in MCF10A and MCF-7 cells, which express all three proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, Supplementary Figures S1B and 2A, top). RT-qPCR analysis revealed that ablation of any of the components enhanced expression of <italic>GADD45A, HMGA2, MMP9 and FGF2</italic> in MCF10A cells, but did not affect <italic>ANG1</italic> expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In MCF-7 cells, none of the knockdowns affected expression of <italic>ANG1</italic> or <italic>HMGA2</italic>, whereas expression of <italic>GADD45A</italic> and <italic>MMP9</italic> was enhanced, although the effect of LCoR depletion on <italic>MMP9</italic> expression was not significant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Note that <italic>HMGA2</italic> expression in MCF-7 cells was at the limit of detection. Notably, knockdowns also led to strongly enhanced <italic>FGF2</italic> expression in MCF-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). We confirmed the effects of knockdowns on <italic>FGF2</italic> and <italic>GADD45A</italic> expression in MCF-7 cells with a second independent set of siRNAs (Supplementary Figure S2B). As a control, we also knocked down the expression of another TF, Forkhead box O3A (FoxO3A), chosen because FoxO3A enhances <italic>GADD45A</italic> expression (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Ablation of FoxO3A led to a nearly 60% decrease in <italic>GADD45A</italic> mRNA but no change in <italic>FGF2</italic> expression (Supplementary Figure S2C). To further explore the role of LCoR, KAP-1 and ZBRK1, we performed knockdowns in T47D breast ductal carcinoma cells, which express all three proteins (Supplementary Figures S1B and S2A). <italic>GADD45A</italic> was expressed in T47D cells, and ablation of any of the transcriptional regulators enhanced its expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). In contrast, <italic>FGF2</italic> transcripts were not detected, consistent with other findings (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and none of the siRNA knockdowns lead to detectable expression (data not shown). Similarly, no induction of <italic>MMP9</italic> expression was observed under any conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).

ChIP assays on the intronic <italic>GADD45A</italic> sequence in MCF-7 cells revealed that ZBRK1, KAP-1 and LCoR bind to this region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, left panel). Moreover, re-ChIPs, consisting of an immunoprecipitation (IP) for ZBRK1 followed by a second IP for either KAP-1 or LCoR, revealed that LCoR and KAP-1 co-associate with ZBRK1 at this location (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, right panel). Scanning the promoter (&#x0223c;10 kb upstream) and intragenic region of the <italic>FGF2</italic> gene (&#x0223c;70 kb) with the &#x02018;DNA pattern&#x02019; tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rsat.eu/">http://www.rsat.eu/</ext-link>) revealed essentially identical putative ZBRK1 sequence motifs between exons 1 and 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, top) and between exons 2 and 3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, top). Similar ChIP and re-ChIP experiments confirmed that ZBRK1, KAP-1 and LCoR bound together to the first region (exons 1 and 2; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), but not the second (exons 2 and 3; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). To establish specificity of enrichment observed in ChIP and re-ChIP experiments, we performed qPCR analyses with primers encompassing an NS sequence (NS; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and B), which failed to detect binding (Supplementary Figure S3A and B).</p><p>To further analyze the function of these repressor complexes, we tested for the presence of histone methyltransferase SETDB1, which catalyzes the establishment of the epigenetic silencing mark H3K9me3 and is associated with KAP-1 function (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). ChIP assays revealed that SETDB1 was associated with both intronic regions bound by ZBRK1/KAP-1/LCoR in MCF-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Moreover, the H3K9me3 mark was modestly enriched in <italic>GADD45A</italic> and <italic>FGF2</italic> intronic regions bound by ZBRK1/KAP-1/LCoR in MCF-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Notably, strong enrichment of H3K9me3 was observed at the ZBRK1 motif in the <italic>GADD45A</italic> gene in T47D cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), but not at the motif in the <italic>FGF2</italic> gene, whose expression was not detected and not induced upon ablation of ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR in T47D cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In control experiments, qPCR analyses targeting a genomic region with no evidence of H3K9me3 failed to detect enrichment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). As their ablation compromises MCF-7 cell viability (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR expression was knocked down in T47D cells. This depleted H3K9 tri-methylation on <italic>GADD45A</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>), consistent with the role of KAP-1-containing complexes recruiting histone methyltransferase activity. Taken together, these data show that binding of the ZBRK1/KAP-1/LCoR complex to cognate motifs is associated with H3K9 tri-methylation and the presence of methyltransferase SETDB1.</p><p>To further substantiate the regulatory role of the novel ZBRK1 motif identified between exons 1 and 2 in the <italic>FGF2</italic> gene, we analyzed the <italic>FGF2</italic> genomic region in the H3K9me3 ChIPseq MCF-7 data set from the Encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). This revealed a series of H3K9me3 peaks in the exon 1&#x02013;2 region, one of which encompasses the element that binds ZBRK1, KAP-1 and LCoR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>, Region 1 box). Notably, no peaks were found in the exon 2&#x02013;3 region containing the putative but non-functional ZBRK1 element examined above (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>, Region 2 box). This provides independent verification that the exon 1&#x02013;2 motif is associated with elevated H3K9 methylation.</p><p>We also generated luciferase reporter gene constructs containing &#x0223c;500-bp intronic fragments of <italic>FGF2</italic> or <italic>GADD45A</italic> encompassing the ZBRK1 binding motifs, inserted upstream of a minimal herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (TK) promoter that was not repressed by the three proteins (Supplementary Figure S4A and B). Transient transfection of ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR expression vectors revealed a dose-dependent reduction in expression of reporter constructs containing either the <italic>FGF2</italic> (Supplementary Figure S4C) or <italic>GADD45A</italic> (Supplementary Figure S4D) intron fragments. These results confirm that ZBRK1, KAP-1 and LCoR are capable of reporter gene repression through a region containing the ZBRK1 recognition sequence. Both LCoR and KAP-1 can repress transcription through associations with HDACs (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (Supplementary Figure S4E) did not abrogate repression, consistent with the transcriptional silencing by these regions being HDAC independent.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-4"><title>Ablation of ZBRK1, KAP-1 and LCoR increases apoptosis in specific breast cancer cells</title><p>SiRNA-mediated knockdowns of ZBRK1 or KAP-1 consistently reduced the number of adherent MCF-7 or MCF10A cells after 48 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>; data not shown). While not statistically significant at 48 h, the reduction in adherent MCF-7 cells after LCoR ablation was visible 72 h after knockdown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and Supplementary Figure S5A). Note that during knockdowns, loss of ZBRK1 or KAP-1 is observed as early as 24 h after siRNA transfection (Supplementary Figure S5B), whereas depletion of LCoR does not appear before 48&#x02013;72 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>; data not shown) possibly explaining the delay in response. FoxO3A expression was also ablated as a control for potential transfection reagent cytotoxicity, and had no significant effect on adherent cell numbers at either time point (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and Supplementary Figure S5A).</p><p>To determine whether ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR ablation was causing cell death, we measured release of LDH into the media, which occurs due to loss of membrane integrity. Disruption of membrane integrity of mock transfected cells (transfection reagent without siRNA) with 1% Triton X-100 was used as a control for maximal LDH release. These experiments revealed that the cytotoxicity caused by loss of ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR expression in MCF-7 and MCF10A cells reached around 50% of the positive control, whereas ablation of FoxO3A expression had no effect on LDH release (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). In contrast, similar knockdowns in T47D cells (Supplementary Figure S2A) did not change either cell numbers (data not shown) or cell viability (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). To better characterize the mechanism causing cell death, we used a Cell Death ELISA kit, which measures apoptosis and necrosis. Results from these experiments show that 26 h after ZBRK1 or KAP-1 knockdown there was an increase in apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, and 63 h after knockdown, LCoR caused an increase in apoptosis as well, whereas ablation of FoxO3A had no effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>Regulation of <italic>FGF2</italic> expression by ZBRK1, KAP-1 and LCoR controls MCF-7 cell viability</title><p>Previous studies revealed that increased levels of the secreted form of FGF2 reduce MCF-7 cell viability (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref>). As presented above, ablation of LCoR, KAP-1 or ZBRK1 did not lead to an apoptotic response in T47D cells, which do not express <italic>FGF2</italic>. To determine if increased FGF2 secretion resulted from ablation of ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR in MCF-7 cells, we performed an ELISA for FGF2 in media supernatants. FGF2 secretion was enhanced about 4-fold 48 h after ablation of ZBRK1 or KAP-1, whereas another 24 h were necessary to further elevate (3-fold) FGF2 secretion after LCoR ablation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), consistent with delayed loss of LCoR expression (Supplementary Figure S5B).</p><p>Elevated expression of FGF2 in MCF-7 cells has also been associated with reduced Bcl-2 activity and increased apoptosis (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).

Using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, we observed an increase in caspase activity 24 h after ZBRK1 or KAP-1 ablation, whereas a 2-fold increase in caspase activity was detected 65 h after LCoR depletion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), further confirming apoptosis in MCF-7 cells after gene knockdowns. Ablation of FoxO3A was used as a control for an NS increase in caspase activity, and revealed no change at either time point (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Thus, the apoptosis observed after gene knockdowns correlates with an increase in caspase activity.</p><p>To determine if loss of cell viability could be reversed by blocking the enhanced <italic>FGF2</italic> expression resulting from knockdowns, we cotransfected siRNA targeting <italic>FGF2</italic>. The <italic>FGF2</italic> siRNA effectively inhibited the increase in <italic>FGF2</italic> mRNA observed after gene knockdowns and did not interfere with the reduction of transcripts encoding ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Concurrent knockdown of FGF2 significantly reduced the cytotoxic effect of ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR ablation, but had no effect on cell viability in FoxO3A-deficient cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). To further investigate whether enhanced secretion of FGF2 decreases MCF-7 cell viability, we treated cells transfected with siRNAs targeting <italic>ZBRK1</italic>, <italic>KAP1</italic> or <italic>LCOR</italic> with suramin sodium, which inhibits cell surface binding of FGF2 with its receptor. The inhibitor significantly reduced the cytotoxic effects of ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR ablation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>), providing further evidence that enhanced FGF2 expression and secretion contributes to the cell death observed after ablation of ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR.</p><p>As mentioned above, knockdowns of <italic>ZBRK1</italic> and <italic>KAP1</italic> in MCF-7 or MCF10A cells led to increased <italic>MMP9</italic> expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and C), although depletion of LCoR had a non-significant effect in MCF-7 cells. Overexpression of <italic>MMP9</italic> in cervical cancer has been shown to enhance tumor growth and progression (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), raising the possibility that its elevated expression in knockdown experiments may partially counteract the effects of FGF2 overexpression caused by <italic>ZBRK1</italic>, <italic>KAP1</italic> or <italic>LCOR</italic> ablation in breast cell lines. Concurrent knockdown of <italic>MMP9</italic> with <italic>ZBRK1</italic>, <italic>KAP1</italic> or <italic>LCOR</italic> in MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Figure S6A) led to modest but significant increases in cytotoxicity as measured with an LDH assay (Supplementary Figure S6B). This suggests that enhanced expression of MMP9 occurring upon ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR ablation attenuates the effect of elevated FGF2 expression.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-6"><title>FGF2 is not coexpressed with ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR in malignant breast tissue</title><p content-type="F7 F8">In order to compare the expression patterns of ZBRK1, KAP-1, LCoR and FGF2 in breast cancer tissue, we analyzed tissue microarrays containing a variety of breast tissues, normal and malignant, for expression of all four proteins. Tissue samples were scored as previously described (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), where the score is determined as staining intensity x PP (percentage of positive cells); staining intensity of 0 is negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3, strong. PP was defined as 0 if negative; 1, 10% positive cells; 2, 11&#x02013;50% positive cells; 3, 51&#x02013;80% positive cells; and 4, more than 80% positive cells (score limits 1: minimum; 12: maximum). Although FGF2 was readily detected in melanoma (Supplementary Figure S7A), which served as a positive control, we failed to detect its expression in nearly all malignant breast tissues. Expression of modest levels was observed in within fibroadenoma samples but was confined to normal ductal epithelia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> and Supplementary Figure S7B), consistent with previous observations (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). These cells, which are in close proximity to luminal structures, may be undergoing apoptosis (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Normal ductal epithelial cells did express appreciable levels of KAP-1, ZBRK1 and LCoR, although LCoR expression was variable and mostly cytoplasmic (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Expression of ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR was detected in a majority of malignancies probed (Supplementary Figure S7B). For example, breast medullary carcinoma, a type of invasive ductal carcinoma that accounts for 5% of all breast cancers (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), widely expressed KAP-1, whereas no FGF2 was detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Although individual carcinoma cells did not appear to express higher levels of the protein than normal cells, LCoR expression was more widely distributed and nuclear in medullary carcinoma than in normal ductal epithelial cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> and B). Out of 100 tissue samples probed (50 cases each in duplicate: eight invasive ductal carcinoma, eight mucinous carcinoma, six medullary carcinoma, four malignant Paget's disease, two carcinosarcoma, eight cystosarcoma phyllodes, eight fibroadenoma and six cancer adjacent normal breast tissue) with each antibody, we found no example of coexpression in malignant tissue of FGF2 with any of the transcriptional regulators studied here (Supplementary Figure S7B).</p><p>Analysis of normal versus cancer tissue did not provide evidence for overexpression of any of the coregulators in malignant tissue, whereas a significant reduction in expression of FGF2 was detected (Supplementary Figure S7C; compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> to Supplementary Figure S7A), consistent with previous reports (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;28</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In order to further explore the relationships between expression of FGF2 and ZBRK1 (ZNF350) and KAP-1 (TRIM28) and LCoR, we expanded our analysis to the larger data set of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/">https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/</ext-link>). Using the TCGA IlluminaHiSeq breast invasive carcinoma RNAseq database (<italic>N</italic> = 1106) and separating tumors based on high or low <italic>FGF2</italic> expression, statistically significant inverse relationships were observed between the expression of <italic>ZBRK1</italic> or <italic>KAP1</italic> and <italic>FGF2</italic> mRNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Collectively, the above data suggest that the expression of the coregulators and FGF2 is mutually exclusive in malignant breast tissue and that an inverse relationship exists between the expression of <italic>ZBRK1</italic> and <italic>KAP1</italic> mRNA and that of <italic>FGF2</italic> in breast invasive carcinoma.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have identified a novel and direct association of the corepressor LCoR with the coregulator KAP-1 in a C-terminal region of LCoR that is distinct from the domains recognized by CtBPs and HDACs. These findings link LCoR function to regulation of transcription by C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger proteins. The C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger-containing gene family is one of the largest families in metazoan genomes (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and over half of the zinc-finger genes in the human genome also contain an N-terminal KRAB domain (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). KAP-1 binds directly through its RBCC domain to several KRAB-containing C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger TFs (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and ChIPseq studies revealed numerous KAP-1 recruitment sites in the human genome (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). KAP-1 is also widely expressed during embryonic development and in the adult, and its disruption in mice is embryonic lethal (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Similarly, LCoR is expressed as early as the 2-cell stage of embryonic development (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), suggesting a potential early link of LCoR function to coregulation of transcription by C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger proteins during development. Using ZBRK1 as a model C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger protein, we confirmed coassociation of LCoR, KAP-1 and ZBRK1 by ChIP and reChIP assays at a previously characterized intronic motif in the <italic>GADD45A</italic> gene and at a novel almost identical motif in the <italic>FGF2</italic> gene. We also detected the binding of the histone methyltransferase SETDB1 and enrichment of the repressive mark H3K9Me3 associated with KAP-1 function (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) at both ZBRK1 motifs under conditions where ZBRK1, KAP-1 and LCoR repressed gene transcription. The association of the novel <italic>FGF2</italic> motif with SETDB1 and H3K9 methylation was supported by ENCODE ChIPseq data, which revealed elevated H3K9Me3 levels in a region encompassing the motif. Ablation of ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR expression led to enhanced <italic>GADD45A</italic> and <italic>FGF2</italic> expression in MCF10A and MCF-7 cells. ENCODE data confirmed our results with <italic>FGF2</italic>.</p><p>Little is known about transcriptional silencing of the <italic>FGF2</italic> gene (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) or the exact cause of reduced FGF2 expression in breast malignancies. Its silencing is of significance, however, because elevated or forced expression of FGF2 in breast cells stunts growth or induces apoptosis (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;24</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Significantly, we found that <italic>FGF2</italic> repression by ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR contributed to both tumorigenic (MCF-7) and non-tumorigenic (MCF10A) cell survival, indicating that these transcriptional regulators can silence <italic>FGF2</italic> in malignant and non-malignant cells. As the region in which FGF2 expression was detected in breast tissue microarrays (normal ductal epithelial cells) may be undergoing apoptosis which would maintain luminal space (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), it suggests that apoptosis caused by active regulation of the <italic>FGF2</italic> gene might contribute to shape these structures. Moreover, although gene knockdowns of the transcriptional regulators revealed an increase in <italic>MMP9</italic> that promotes cell growth (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), the increase was insufficient to prevent cell death and was only slightly protective, indicating a predominant effect of induced FGF2 expression in these cells. While <italic>FGF2</italic> was detected in MCF-7 and MCF10A cells, its expression was undetectable in T47D cells under any conditions tested and its profound silencing appeared to be independent of function of the ZBRK1/KAP-1/LCoR complex, suggesting that <italic>FGF2</italic> gene expression can be inhibited by multiple mechanisms in breast cancer. Notably, in this regard, one report found an <italic>FGF2</italic> gene deletion in a breast tumor sample (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p><p>Probing breast cancer tissue microarrays did not reveal any evidence for overexpression of any of the complex components in the breast cancer samples analyzed. Importantly, however, the microarrays did not reveal any evidence for coexpression of ZBRK1, KAP-1 or LCoR and FGF2. We also analyzed the much larger TCGA breast invasive carcinoma RNAseq database (<italic>N</italic> = 1106), which revealed a significant inverse relationship between <italic>ZBRK1</italic> or <italic>KAP1</italic> and <italic>FGF2</italic> transcripts. No inverse relationship was found between <italic>FGF2</italic> and <italic>LCOR</italic> mRNAs, although it is important to note that LCoR function may be controlled largely at the protein level. While the analysis of the TCGA data suggests that elevated expression of <italic>ZBRK1</italic> and <italic>KAP1</italic> transcripts contributes to silencing of <italic>FGF2</italic> expression, other mechanisms may lead to increased repressor activity of the complex. For example, function of the ZBRK1/KAP-1/LCoR may be controlled by upstream signal transduction pathways acting through complex subunits in addition to effects of altered expression levels of the components. Notably in this regard, association of KAP-1 with cofactors can be regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and sumoylation, affecting its function (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47&#x02013;50</xref>). On the other hand, nothing is known about potential post-translational mechanisms controlling LCoR or ZBRK1 function, although there is evidence that sumoylation status can alter C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger protein associations with coregulators (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). FGF2 has also been shown to induce apoptosis in the early primary culture of rat cortical neurons (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), and a hippocampal cell line and primary cell cultures derived from the hippocampus (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), raising the possibility that FGF2-mediated apoptosis regulated by this transcriptional complex may not be limited to breast tissue, as both KAP-1 and LCoR are highly expressed in neuronal tissues (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Many examples exist in the literature of other types of cells in which an association between LCoR and KAP-1 might be relevant in terms of regulation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger protein-mediated transcription. The most obvious candidates would be cells in which an interaction between ZBRK1 and KAP-1 has already been established such as hybrid Burkitt lymphoblastoid cells (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) or human embryonic kidney cells (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, if the LCoR&#x02013;KAP-1 complex was recruited to additional C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger proteins, it may regulate numerous other genes under a wide variety of conditions. Notably, KAP-1 interacts with zinc-finger protein 274 in human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), zinc-finger protein 57 in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) and zinc-finger protein 809 in mouse embryonic carcinoma cells (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), to name just a few. The complex would then function to regulate processes that would range from embryogenesis to retroviral silencing (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), which is entirely plausible given the early and widespread expression of both LCoR and KAP-1 (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified a novel interaction between the corepressors of transcription LCoR and KAP-1, which are recruited to ZBRK1 binding sites to silence gene expression and promote breast cell survival. Given the broad expression of LCoR and KAP-1, it is possible that a complex containing LCoR and KAP-1 might have functions that extend beyond cell survival, which would be mediated by interactions with different C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger proteins expressed in a variety of tissues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SEC5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gku413/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p>
