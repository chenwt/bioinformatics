In adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>, gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) perceive chemical stimuli of one specific gustatory modality associated with a stereotyped behavioural response, such as aversion or attraction. We show that GRNs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae employ a surprisingly different mode of gustatory information coding. Using a novel method for calcium imaging in the larval gustatory system, we identify a multimodal GRN that responds to chemicals of different taste modalities with opposing valence, such as sweet sucrose and bitter denatonium, reliant on different sensory receptors. This multimodal neuron is essential for bitter compound avoidance, and its artificial activation is sufficient to mediate aversion. However, the neuron is also essential for the integration of taste blends. Our findings support a model for taste coding in larvae, in which distinct receptor proteins mediate different responses within the same, multimodal GRN.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms10687-i1.jpg"/>While gustatory systems have been extensively studied in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>, not much is known about taste coding at the larval stage.

Current research supports a labelled line model for taste coding in mammals and in the adult fruit fly, in which each peripheral gustatory cell is tuned to perceive cues of one specific modality such as sweet or bitter. In the mouse, specialized taste-receptor cells (TRCs) are localized in the taste buds on the tongue and the palate epithelium. These TRCs are narrowly tuned and express receptors that are only detecting one of the five basic taste modalities: sweet; bitter; salty; sour; or umami (savoury)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.</p><p>The taste system of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> is composed by distinct functional types of GRNs that detect either bitter/high salt, sweet or osmolarity depending on the receptors that they express<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Compared with the adult fly the larva has a simple peripheral nervous system with a comparably small number of sensory neurons to assess the properties of its chemical environment. How larvae manage to sample and integrate a wide range of chemicals with few neurons and which of the functional subtypes of GRNs are present remains unknown.</p><p>The two main external chemosensory organs are the dorsal organ (DO) and the terminal organ (TO) located at the tip of the head. These contain dendrites of sensory neurons localized in the respective ganglia (DO ganglion (DOG) and TO ganglion (TOG)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Each ganglion contains &#x0223c;30 neurons, which have been suggested to function in gustation, olfaction, thermosensation, hygrosensation and mechanosensation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The DOG functions as olfactory organ containing 21 well-described olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) indicated by the expression of olfactory receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Taste coding is primarily occurring in the TOG. Expression analysis of <italic>Gustatory receptor</italic> genes (<italic>GRs</italic>) in the DOG and TOG identified 10 gustatory sensory neurons (GRNs) by the specific combinatorial expression of 28 <italic>GRs</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Coexpression of <italic>Gr66a</italic> and <italic>Gr33a</italic> in six of these neurons indicates that most larval GRNs might mediate a bitter perception. Other sensory receptor genes in the chemosensory organs include <italic>IRs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) and receptors of the Pickpocket <italic>(PPK)</italic> family with <italic>ppk11</italic> and <italic>ppk19</italic> playing a substantial role in low salt sensing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. However details of gustation coding such as a precise number and molecular function of GRNs remain sparse. Functional studies suggest that external GRNs have an essential role in bitter and salt perception, while internal, pharyngeal GRNs appear to function for sweet-dependent ingestion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. However, the functional organization of the larval taste system or detailed properties of particular GRNs remain unknown. Here we analyse the properties of individual GRNs in the larva and we show that some sensory neurons are tuned more broadly to different taste modalities, suggesting that the larval taste system is organized different compared with the adult or mammalian system.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Larval taste neurons respond to multiple stimuli</title><p>Electrophysiological recordings of the TO have been proven to be challenging, and the numerous uncharacterized neurons that are housed in these sensilla makes interpretation difficult. To analyse the sensory properties of larval GRNs, we engineered a microfluidic device that enabled us to stimulate sensory neurons in a highly controlled and stereotypic manner, while imaging in a semi-intact preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> right panel and Fig. 1b, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). This device allows repeated stimulation and application of multiple stimuli for the same animal, thereby facilitating detailed analysis of neuronal responses. We assessed response profiles of individual GRNs by recording neuronal activity using the genetically encoded calcium sensor UAS-<italic>GCaMP5</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Labelling and recording of individual sensory neurons provides us with a tool to access physiological properties of GRNs. Lack of a Gal4 driver that labels exclusively all GRNs makes it reasonable to start analysis of the larval taste system based on function of individual neurons. To identify additional single GRNs, we screened the FlyLight collection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> for Gal4 lines showing sparse expression patterns in the sub-oesophageal zone, the primary taste centre in the larval brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Stainings of the peripheral tissues of the larva were performed to examine expression in peripheral sensory organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c,e</xref>, full stack in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). We identified a line (GMR57B04) labelling a previously uncharacterized, individual sensory neuron in the TOG. We named this newly identified neuron C7 according to previous nomenclature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p>We tested a selection of chemical cues, which previously were shown to play an important role in taste discrimination for the adult fly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. These chemicals fall into categories that according to the human taste sensation have been classified into salty, sweet, bitter, umami (savoury) and sour. Neuronal activity was recorded for high salt, bitter chemicals like denatonium and quinine, sucrose and glycerol, as well as some amino acids and pH. Unexpectedly, the C7 neuron responded to tastants from all different taste modalities in a highly specific, stereotypic and consistent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). To exclude unspecific responses because of pH or osmolarity, we determined both values for all solutions. By testing substances (glucose, arabinose, sucrose and NaCl) with the same osmolarity we determined that responses for substances with concentrations under 1,000&#x02009;mOsm&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> are specific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), while at higher concentrations a response due to osmotic pressure may not be excluded. By testing the same substance (sucrose) with different pH (pH 4, 6 and 9) we find that the response of C7 remains stable, therefore excluding pH-dependent effects.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Aversive response upon artificial activation of C7</title><p>Since C7 responds to tastants of different valence we wondered whether the artificial activation of this neuron is sufficient to trigger an aversive or attractive response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. To address this question we used an optogenetic reverse-correlation assay, which allows us to assess if activation of C7 mediates navigational behavioural transitions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Larval navigation makes use of two distinct behavioural states: runs, during which the animals uses peristalsis to move forward; and turns, during which the animal sweeps its head to sample the environment and to reorient itself. Depending on the sensory experience larvae modulate the probability to switch between runs and turns. When animals sense an attractive cue during runs, they decrease the probability to start a turn. Conversely if the animal perceives a negative stimulus they are more likely to initiate a turn. Similarly if the larva experiences an attractive cue during a turn, it is more likely to initiate a run, while it will decrease the probability to switch from turn to run if an aversive neuron is activated. We stimulated animals expressing the red-shifted channelrhodopsin <italic>CsChrimson</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) in the C7 neuron (<italic>C7</italic>-Gal4/UAS-<italic>CsChrimson</italic>). Animals were exposed to a random flickering of red-light and navigation was simultaneously recorded to determine whether navigational decisions depend on C7 activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. We found that before a reorientation movement (run to turn transition) was initiated, on an average an increase in the optogenetic activation of C7 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). During reorientation (turn to run transition) events C7 receives decreased optogenetic activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Both these trends are consistent with an aversive response. To confirm this result, we subjected <italic>C7</italic>&#x0003e;<italic>CsChrimson</italic> larvae to a step increase of optogenetic stimulation (light OFF to light ON) and calculated the probability of initiating a reorientation. After an optogenetic activation step larvae showed a strong increase in reorientation probability, consistent with aversive behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Therefore artificial activation of C7 suggests, that this neuron can provide information about an aversive cue for directed navigation. Since the C7-Gal4 driver shows in some cases expression in a single ventral pharyngeal organ (VPS) neuron a contribution of this cell to artificial activation experiments using <italic>CsChrimson</italic> cannot be excluded.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>C7 is involved in sensing denatonium/denatonium-containing mixtures</title><p>A surprising feature of C7 is that it responded to stimuli that elicit opposing behaviours in the larvae, such as attraction for sucrose and aversion to denatonium or quinine. To test whether the physiological response of C7 to these chemical cues has an impact on the larval behaviour, we performed simple behavioural two choice assays, ablating C7 by specific expression of the pro-apoptotic genes <italic>hid</italic> and <italic>reaper</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). As expected, control larvae showed an aversive behaviour towards denatonium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>) and quinine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>), while they were attracted to sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Interestingly, animals lacking the C7 neuron did no longer show an aversive response towards denatonium or quinine, but rather displayed a weak attraction towards these chemicals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). This observation is consistent with the fact, that in the reverse-correlation assay artificial activation of C7 elicits a highly aversive behavioural response compared with other GRNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Sucrose attraction was not changed by the absence of C7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>) (<italic>C7</italic>-Gal4&#x0003e;&#x0002b;/<italic>hid;rpr</italic>&#x0003e;&#x0002b; <italic>P</italic>=0.852 (NS); <italic>C7</italic>-Gal4&#x0003e;&#x0002b;/<italic>C7</italic>-Gal4&#x0003e;<italic>hid;rpr P</italic>=0.339 (NS); <italic>hid;rpr</italic>&#x0003e;&#x0002b;/<italic>C7</italic>-Gal4&#x0003e;<italic>hid;rpr P</italic>=0.213 (NS)). The change from an aversion to an attraction towards bitter chemicals cannot be correlated to osmolarity, as different concentrations of denatonium displayed the same level of attraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g</xref>).</p><p>Since C7 is necessary for aversive behaviour to bitter stimuli but additionally reacts to sweet cues, we wondered whether it might function in the integration of information about tastants with different valence. We therefore tested if the exposure to a blend of sweet and bitter substances elicits different responses as compared with the pure substances. First, we monitored the <italic>GCaMP5</italic> response to sucrose supplemented with 5&#x02009;mM denatonium in the C7 neuron. Intriguingly denatonium showed a strong inhibition of the sucrose response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2h</xref>). Thus, even though C7 responded strongly to sucrose and denatonium when presented alone, the sensory responses were not additive but rather cross-inhibitory.</p><p>We therefore next tested whether the genetic ablation of C7 affected sucrose preference when supplementing with denatonium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Control animals showed a lower attraction to sucrose containing 5&#x02009;mM denatonium. Animals lacking C7 displayed a stronger preference for the blend than control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2i</xref>). Even though C7 has no impact on the preference when sucrose is presented alone, the discrimination of a sucrose denatonium blend requires functional physiological repression of sucrose by denatonium in this neuron, as animals lacking C7 fail to appropriately evaluate this blend. Overall these results show, that C7 is required to maintain an appropriate perception of pure substances or substance mixtures with different valence. The lack of C7 results in an elevated attraction towards tested chemicals.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>IR25a is involved in denatonium sensing</title><p>Since C7 is involved in mediating different behaviours, this neuron might serve the animal as a broadly tuned sensor, integrating taste information and setting context dependent valence already at the sensory level. Different families of chemoreceptors have been shown to be involved in sensing tastants including <italic>GRs</italic>, <italic>IRs</italic> and <italic>PPKs</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying such a coding, we performed transcriptomic analysis using RNAseq on the two main chemosensory organs to yield a set of candidate receptor genes for gustatory cue detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). We tested highly expressed receptor genes (<italic>Ir25a</italic>, <italic>Gr68a</italic>, <italic>Gr47b</italic>, <italic>Gr36b</italic> and <italic>ppk6</italic>) specifically in C7 by cell-type specific transgenic RNAi while analysing calcium responses to denatonium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). We found that C7 showed a significant decreased denatonium response when knocking down <italic>IR25a</italic> using two independent RNAi lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), while RNAi against <italic>Gr68a</italic>, <italic>Gr47b, Gr36b</italic> or <italic>ppk6</italic> did not alter the response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). This result was confirmed by recording the calcium response to denatonium in C7 in the <italic>IR25a</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> mutant background. Interestingly RNAi <italic>IR25a</italic> had no impact on the sucrose response (<italic>P</italic>=0.797) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). In C7, <italic>Ir25a</italic> seems to have a specific role in the detection of denatonium, since in <italic>Ir25a</italic><sup><italic>RNAi</italic></sup> the physiological sucrose response remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). We next tested <italic>IR25a</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> mutant larvae in denatonium avoidance behaviour. We indeed found that <italic>IR25a</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> mutants showed decreased denatonium avoidance. This defect in denatonium avoidance can be restored by introducing expression of <italic>IR25a</italic> with a BAC rescue construct 138.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). These results suggest that different tastants within the same neuron might use different receptor molecules and or signal transduction pathways as appearing in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In addition, we tested the role of <italic>IR25a</italic> in the denatonium-mediated inhibition of the sucrose response in C7. Intriguingly, this process seems to be mediated by <italic>IR25a</italic>, as mutant animals fail to discriminate a sucrose denatonium mixture and show a preference similar to sucrose only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). The physiological inhibition in C7 of the sucrose response by denatonium is not occurring in animals with a cell-specific knockdown of <italic>IR25a</italic> using RNAi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of this interaction remain elusive. In the adult olfactory system, <italic>IR25a</italic> functions as co-receptor for other <italic>IRs</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Similarly, in C7 <italic>IR25a</italic> seems to be a part of a receptor complex, as the calcium response to denatonium is not fully abolished in the mutant background.</p><p>To test if multimodality is a general principle of the larval gustatory system, we examined the response profiles of other recently described GRNs: C2, C3, the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive C6 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) and B2, which has its cell body in the DOG but receives information from the TO (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). These GRNs had different types of responses: the B2 neuron exhibited a classical narrowly tuned response profile towards bitter chemicals; C2 and C6 were more broadly tuned, similar to the C7 neuron. C3 did not respond to any chemical in our panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Since C6 shows particularly strong responses when exposed to tastants at high concentrations it appears possible that C6 might sense osmotic pressure. Interestingly even though B2 shows a physiological response to denatonium, when tested in a two choice assay, animals lacking B2 performed indistinguishable from the genetic controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>). This experiment indicates, that different GRNs might play a role in different behaviours, as C7 is necessary for denatonium avoidance in a two choice situation. The larval taste system seems, therefore, to be highly complex and different sets of GRNs must be involved in the detection of different mixtures of gustatory chemicals.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the adult fly, taste perception is mediated by specialized GRNs that are narrowly tuned to specific taste modalities: sweet; bitter; water; and osmolarity.

The existence of multimodal GRNs in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae raises two questions: first, is this a more widely used principle of taste coding; and second, under which conditions is multimodal gustatory coding beneficial.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva contains a comparably simple nervous system with an astonishing repertoire of behaviours related to chemical signals that span from simple repulsive/attractive responses to complex computation including learning and the formation of memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Our findings support gustatory coding with one neuron covering the perception of different tastants of unequal valence. Bitter substances are perceived by C7 and the neuron has a major impact on the aversive response towards quinine and denatonium. This result shows, that the weight of a substance is defined at the sensory level. Animals lacking C7 can still sense these chemicals but are now instead attracted to them, indicating that other GRNs are also involved in sensing these stimuli. Compared with unimodular sensory neurons, the C7 neuron responds additionally to sweet tastants. We showed that denatonium is suppressing the sucrose answer and that this suppression is necessary for the appropriate preference towards a sucrose denatonium blend. These results suggest, that this multimodal neuron plays different roles depending on the combination of tastans. This could enable <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae to perceive a complex environment with a small number of GRNs.</p><p>A similar type of coding has been described in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which also has a small number of sensory neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. However, in this case, multimodal neurons mediate directed behaviours, either attraction or repulsion: these neurons respond to different signals of the same valence of different sensory modalities, including temperature and chemical compounds. Here, transduction of different noxious stimuli has been shown to involve different signal molecules. For example <italic>OSM-10</italic> (a cytosolic protein) is involved in avoiding hyperosmolarity, <italic>qui-1</italic> (a protein with WD-40 repeats) was connected for quinine avoidance but not hyperosmolarity. Thus artificial activation for example of the ASH neuron elicits a repulsion behaviour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>Similarly, artificial activation of the multimodal gustatory C7 neuron results in a strong aversion behaviour, compared with other multi- or unimodal GRNs. However in contrast to the ASH neuron of <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, C7 is activated by chemical cues of different valence. Our data suggest that depending on the exact composition of chemicals in the environment, different subsets of neurons might be recruited. Therefore, the impact of C7 on behaviour depends on the population of sensory neurons that is activated but is restricted to a negative influence of the perception of individual substances or blends. Calcium imaging recordings are not sufficient to explore properties of the neuronal response fully. Compared with electrophysiological recordings, it is not possible to extract detailed properties such as depolarizing or hyperpolarizing changes of the membrane potential or the action potential frequency. If modulations through gap junctions or other cell&#x02013;cell interactions between GRNs exist in the larvae or if chemicals interact at the receptor level, like shown for the adult chemosensory system remains to be explored<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The specific role of <italic>IR25a</italic> in denatonium sensing suggests that the larva enlarges the ability to sense a broad spectrum of tastants in two steps: by using different receptor molecules for individual responses in the same neuron and through a combinatorial activation of different subsets of GRNs. It will be highly interesting to analyse further receptor candidates involved in the mechanisms discovered here. Our receptor list provides a list of candidates and a more extensive screen will be necessary to determine the full complement of receptor subunits for denatonium and sucrose detection. In this paper we show the existence of a new type of GRN. However, further studies will be necessary in order to dissect the detailed molecular properties of multimodal taste coding.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Immunofluorescent stainings</title><p>The mouthparts of the third instar larvae were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and subsequently fixed in a solution of PBS with paraformaldehyde (4&#x00025;) for 20&#x02009;min.

(<bold>b</bold>) During reorientations of <italic>C7</italic>-Gal4&#x0003e;UAS-<italic>CsChrimson</italic>, increased optogenetic stimulation is present and the reorientation finishes (and a new run is initiated=turn-to-run-transition) when the optogenetic stimulus returns to baseline. (<bold>c</bold>) Stimulating <italic>C7</italic>-Gal4&#x0003e;UAS-<italic>CsChrimson</italic> larvae with a red light step generated an increase in the likelihood of finishing a run and initiating a turn, consistent with avoidance behaviour. (<bold>d</bold>) When expressing <italic>hid;rpr</italic> in the C7 neuron, larvae do not longer avoid denatonium (<bold>e</bold>) or quinine (<bold>f</bold>) while sucrose attraction is not affected (<italic>n</italic>=15) (<italic>C7</italic>-Gal4&#x0003e;&#x0002b; and <italic>hid;rpr</italic>&#x0003e;&#x0002b; <italic>P</italic>=0.852 (NS); <italic>C7</italic>-Gal4&#x0003e;&#x0002b; and <italic>C7</italic>-Gal4&#x0003e;<italic>hid;rpr P</italic>=0.339 (NS); <italic>hid;rpr</italic>&#x0003e;&#x0002b; and <italic>C7</italic>-Gal4&#x0003e;<italic>hid;rpr P</italic>=0.213 (NS)). (<bold>g</bold>) This phenotype is independent of concentration for 1, 5 and 10&#x02009;mM denatonium. (<bold>h</bold>) The calcium response in C7 to 500&#x02009;mM sucrose is inhibited by the concomitant application of 5&#x02009;mM denatonium (<italic>n</italic>=6&#x02013;9) and (<bold>i</bold>) C7 is necessary for the reduced preference towards a blend of sucrose and denatonium (<italic>n</italic>=15).
