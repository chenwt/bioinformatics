Since then, empirical determinations of the complexity of the transcriptomes found in yeast to human has blurred the definition and physical boundaries of genes. Using multiple analysis approaches we have characterized individual gene boundaries mapping on human chromosomes 21 and 22. Analyses of the locations of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; transcriptional termini of 492 protein coding genes revealed that for 85&#x00025; of these genes the boundaries extend beyond the current annotated termini, most often connecting with exons of transcripts from other well annotated genes. The biological and evolutionary importance of these chimeric transcripts is underscored by (1) the non-random interconnections of genes involved, (2) the greater phylogenetic depth of the genes involved in many chimeric interactions, (3) the coordination of the expression of connected genes and (4) the close <italic>in vivo</italic> and three dimensional proximity of the genomic regions being transcribed and contributing to parts of the chimeric RNAs. The non-random nature of the connection of the genes involved suggest that chimeric transcripts should not be studied in isolation, but together, as an RNA network.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="22"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The complex repertoire of RNAs found in cells from yeast to human is unexpected and at times seemingly daunting. In part, this complexity is composed of transcripts whose sequences are chimeras formed from sequences found in separate genes. The origins of such chimeric RNAs are derived from multiple biological mechanisms as well as technical artifacts. The biological sources of chimeric RNAs have been seen to stem from both DNA and RNA mediated events. DNA mediated event include such mechanisms as chromosomal rearrangements, gene duplications, retrotransposition and retrotransduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Kaessmann1">[1]</xref>. Each of these mechanisms provide for the construction of novel chimeric transcriptional units that are composed of sequences that are distally separated within a genome of a cell type. Reciprocally, the detection of chimeric RNAs has recently proven to provide an informative means of identifying potentially novel structural variations (SV) in genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Wu1">[2]</xref>. In several specific cases, the detection of chimeric transcripts has been shown to be unrelated to the presence of SV such as the formation of the JAZF1-JJAZ1 found in normal endometrial stromma cells and made from 5&#x02032; exons of transcripts from the <italic>JAZF1</italic> gene on chromosome 7p15 and the 3&#x02032; exons of <italic>JJAZ1</italic> (also known as <italic>SUZ12</italic>) located on chromosome 17q11. In this case no SV could be detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Li1">[3]</xref>. This RNA has been observed to be translated into a chimeric anti-apoptotic protein. This and other identified chimeric transcripts expand the coding potential encoded in genomes by joining together non-contiguous and non-linear regions of genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Gingeras1">[4]</xref>. The apparent absence of genomic SVs and the highly specific and reproducible occurrence of the junction sites joining the chimeric sequences suggest a RNA-mediated mechanism for the creation of these transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Li1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Denoeud1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Djebali1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Kapranov1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Li2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Maher1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Parra1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Unneberg1">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Complicating the identification of chimeric RNAs is the clear possibility of technical artifacts caused by the template switching capabilities of reverse trancriptase (RT) in both <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Houseley1">[12]</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Bowman1">[13]</xref> conditions. First observed in the replication of retroviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Gilboa1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Temin1">[15]</xref>, this property was suggested to be the basis for a copy choice mechanism of recombination in retroviruses and has been seen to be operational during <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments leading to RT-mediated chimeric products (RT). With the development of high throughput RNA sequencing (RNAseq) methods that are reliant on RT for conversion of RNA into double stranded cDNAs, the template switching activity of RT has been observed in these sequencing methods by two Drosophila species mixture experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-McManus1">[16]</xref>. These observations prompt a careful verification of any observed chimeric transcripts.</p><p>The focus of the studies presented here was to systematically analyze the diversity of transcripts found within and extending from the annotated boundaries of genic loci in the human genome. These studies follow in the footsteps of a set of earlier works performed with a limited number of human genes that were located in the 1&#x00025; of the human genome selected by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Denoeud1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Birney1">[17]</xref>. In these earlier studies two main observations were reported. First was the pervasive transcription across the analyzed 1&#x00025; of the genome (93&#x00025; coverage) and the second was that many of the genic loci were connected to other genic loci resulting in the formation of chimeric transcripts. In these current studies we extended our analyses to genes on chromosomes 21 and 22 and sought to determine if chimeric transcripts can be detected among the genes analyzed, if their detection originates because of technical artifacts and to determine if evidence can be collected that supports the biological importance of any detected chimeric transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Discovery of novel chimeric transcripts through RACE reactions and tiling arrays</title><p>Protein coding genes encoded on human chromosomes 21 and 22 were interrogated using a combination of methods including rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and tiling arrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Djebali1">[6]</xref>, and deep RNA sequencing (RNAseq). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028213-g001">Figure 1</xref> describes the overall experimental design used for the RACE and tiling array experiments. In summary, we first selected 1,193 exons from 492 annotated gene loci present on chromosomes 21 and 22 for which we could select highly specific 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; RACE primers. We designed 844 5&#x02032;-RACE and 824 3&#x02032;-RACE primers, and carried out the corresponding RACE reactions using polyadenylated (poly A&#x0002b;) selected RNA isolated from 11 normal human tissues and five transformed cell lines In total, 26,688 RACE reactions were performed (see Material and Methods).</p><fig id="pone-0028213-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0028213.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>RACEarray experiment flowchart.</title><p>The successive steps of the RACEarray experiments are represented as a flowchart for both chromosomes 21 and 22.

RACE reactions were pooled prior to hybridization to the tiling arrays. First, RACE reactions for a given primer originating from different tissues were pooled together (pairing: prostate and testis; ovary and placenta; brain frontal lobe, brain hippocampus and brain hypothalamus; and fetal kidney, fetal spleen and fetal thymus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028213-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Second, within a given sample or mixture, RACE reactions originating from different primers were pooled together. A pooling strategy was designed to maximize the genomic distance between primers pooled together, while minimizing the number of pools required (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The minimum genomic distance between RACE primers was set to 1.8 Mb when primers were in head to head orientation, 180 Kb when they were in tail to tail orientation, and 990 Kb when they were in head to tail orientation. A total of 102 primer pools were required (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028213.s002">Figure S1</xref> for the actual distribution of genomic distances between primers). Each one of the primer pool-tissue pool combinations was hybridized separately into a tiling array. A total of 1,020 array hybridizations were conducted.</p><p>Intensities from the arrays were processed using specially developed software to determine continuous sites of transcription (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This software discarded unspecific probes (that is, array probes that appear more than once in the genome, 7&#x00025; in total) and builds sites of transcription with parameters optimized to mirror the features of known exons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028213.s003">Figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028213.s004">S3</xref>). These sites of transcription are referred to as RACEfrags. In total, 306,368 RACEfrags were initially obtained. To eliminate RACEfrags coming from unspecific priming and/or unspecific cross-hybridization, an <italic>in silico</italic> RACEarray simulator was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Djebali1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028213.s005">Figure S4</xref>). Furthermore, to eliminate products originating in very highly abundant transcripts not targeted by our RACE reactions, negative controls were utilized in which the RNA samples or mixtures were hybridized into the arrays without RACE amplification (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). In total, 262,472 RACEfrags remained after applying these filters.</p><p>RACEfrags typically correspond to detection of exon expression of the interrogated genes or to unspliced transcripts. The pooling of primers however does challenge the correct assignment of RACEfrags to the originating primer. To meet this challenge a heuristic method was developed that assigns RACEfrags to the corresponding primers. The heuristic attempts to satisfy several constraints: genomic proximity (in compatible orientation) to the primer, consistency of connectivity across multiple samples, and support of connectivity by multiple primers (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028213.s006">Figure S5</xref>). After this analysis a total of 195,982 RACEfrags were assigned to the original RACE primers</p><p>The identified and assigned RACEfrags displayed a length ranging from 47 to 4,493 base pairs, and a median length of 133 base pairs. As expected this is similar to the median length of exons (128 nt) in the Gencode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Harrow1">[18]</xref> annotated human transcriptome. The proportion of annotated exons covered by at least one RACEfrag is 85.7&#x00025;. While internal exons and introns of a gene are equally covered by 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; RACEfrags assigned to this gene, most 5&#x02032; exons/3&#x02032; exons are covered by 5&#x02032; RACEfrags/3&#x02032; RACEfrags respectively, as we expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028213-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We evaluate the sensitivity of the RACEarray map in terms of number of annotated exon connections that could be detected given the primer configuration (called detectable exon connections), and that are indeed detected by the (RACEfrag, primer) pairs. Of the total 19,578 exon connections that could be detected, 15,296 were, representing a sensitivity of about 78&#x00025;.</p><fig id="pone-0028213-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0028213.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>RACEfrag transcription map statistics.</title><p><bold>A- Distribution of RACEfrags among annotated genomic domains.</bold> The proportion of RACEfrags overlapping different annotated genic features is represented in this histogram.

Starting from the RNA pools from which they were detected, a total of 200 RACEfrags were selected for RT-PCR amplification, full-length cloning and sequencing. These RACEfrags were comprised of 67 reciprocal gene to gene connections and 133 additional chimeric cases stratified according to increasing distances from the index gene to the RACEfrag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028213-g006">Figure 6A&#x02013;C</xref>).

These sequences were then analyzed by the HAVANA manual annotation pipeline (Material and Methods) and two features of note were noticed. First, while the majority of the transcripts sequences corresponding to relatively short extensions (less than 150 Kb) mapped to the genome with introns exhibiting canonical splicing sequences at the junction sites forming the chimeric regions (57&#x00025;), the trend was the opposite for extensions beyond this distance.

Second, a proportion of the non-canonical junction regions (51&#x00025;) contain small genomic duplications (between 5 bp and 10 bp) at the genomic sequences flanking the junction sites of the chimeric RNAs. The duplicated sequence appears only once within the sequence of the RT-PCR product (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028213-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).

These experiments are based on the analysis of RNAseq libraries prepared from mixtures of human GM12878 cell and Drosophila melanogaster adult female RNAs. This strategy allowed us to analyze in isolation a control population of chimeric reads consisting exclusively of technical artifacts (inter-genomic reads), and to compare its properties to that of our populations of interest (intra-genomic chimeras).</p><p>We first analyzed two libraries prepared from pure total RNA from either human or fly, and one library prepared from a 1&#x02236;1 mix of RNA from both sources. We obtained about 10 M reads per library that could map uniquely to either of the two reference genomes. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028213.s018">Figure S17</xref> summarizes the results. The values are normalized for each library, and expressed in reads per 10 million uniquely mapped reads. Based on at least 25 bases mapping on each side of a chimeric junction, a very small number of inter-genomic reads in the pure human library (9 reads), and a somewhat greater number in the pure fly library (350) were detected. These populations consist exclusively of sequencing and mapping artifacts &#x02013; an interpretation supported by the fact that their size shrinks dramatically as we increase the stringency of our mapping criteria, requiring larger portions of the reads to map on either side of the junctions. In the mixed library, the number of inter-genomic reads (831) is about 4.6 times the mean of these two numbers (180), which indicates that roughly 20&#x00025; of the inter-genomic reads in this dataset are explained by sequencing/mapping errors, the other 80&#x00025; being contributed by library preparation artifacts. Under a null model that all chimeric reads are artifactual, the number of intra-genomic chimeric reads for each species in the 1&#x02236;1 mix library should be half the number of inter-genomic reads. The fly population conforms roughly to this expectation, and therefore seems largely accounted for by technical factors. The human population, on the other hand, exceeds the expectations by a factor of 5 (e.g., 2,050 reads instead of an expected 831/2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;415) &#x02013; suggesting that a number of chimeric sequences may be present in the human transcriptome. More stringent mapping leads to identical conclusions.</p><p>Considering that this simple null model may not accurately describe the generation of artifactual chimeric reads, and that some factors &#x02013; such as sequence similarity, for instance &#x02013; may favor the formation of intra-genomic artifacts, we had also sequenced additional libraries designed specifically to distinguish between molecules of technical versus biological origin within the population of human chimeric reads. All were prepared from a mix of human and fly total RNA, keeping the total amount of RNA constant but varying the human-to-fly ratio from 1&#x02236;1 down to 1&#x02236;100. In this type of dilution series, molecules of biological origin and library preparation artifacts are expected to have drastically different behaviors. The number of the former should decrease linearly with the dilution factor, whereas that of the latter should decrease linearly with the square of the dilution factor. Using the most stringent mapping criteria (min 2&#x000d7;25 bases) the decrease is very close to linear (i.e. 2,050 expected, 2,050/5&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;410 &#x00026; 2,050/50&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;41 reads, and observed 2,050, 317 &#x00026; 51. The most stringent mapping policy shows a slightly faster-than-linear decay, revealing a minor artifactual component. These results further support the notion that the human transcriptome does naturally include some chimeric molecules.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Chimeric RNAs form non-random interconnections between genes suggesting they should be collectively studied as RNA networks</title><p>The detection of chimeric transcripts connecting distal gene loci poses a question of whether these gene to gene interactions are random.

No enrichment of potentially cross-hybridized RACEfrags in hubs versus non hubs was identified (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028213.s001">Materials S1</xref> section 5 d.iv).</p><p>Interestingly, the identified hubs appear to be more highly expressed than other genes. To measure gene and transcript expression we performed hybridizations of the 16 RNA samples onto chromosomes 21 and 22 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). From the hybridization signal, we computed the average expression of the gene's coding exons. The expression of an exon is the average over all intensities of the tiling array probes overlapping the exon.

To rule out the possibility that the deeper phylogenetic depth observed for hub genes is an indirect consequence of their higher expression level (and of older genes being more highly expressed), a randomization test was performed in which hub genes were partitioned in four expression classes. The same number of non-hub genes was randomly picked in each expression class. The results indicated that hub genes have greater number of orthologous genes in each of the six species as measured in each of the expression classes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028213.s001">Materials S1</xref> section 5 d.iv and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028213.s025">Table S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Connected genes tend to exhibit coordination of expression</title><p>We have found that transcriptional connected genes tend to have coordinated expression.

While a definitive answer to these questions is not available as yet, the significant enrichment of exonic sequences derived from coordinately expressed genes, which often are part of multigenic networks, seems striking and suggestive of an underlying biological function. However, it is important to emphasize the limitations of this primer pooling approach. Because the chimeric RNAs cover very large distances in genome space, unequivocal assignment of a RACEfrag to a primer/gene is problematic. Thus this approach should contain a non-negligible number of false positive assignments&#x02014;artificially favoring proximal ones. This fact strongly mandates and emphasizes that after additional filtration (e.g. using reciprocal RACE reactions) and biochemical validation (non-RT dependent experiments) is carried out on the candidate chimeric RNAs, the resulting observed chimeric transcripts should possess non-random and biologically meaningful characteristics.</p><p>Additional experiments such as capturing the chimeric RNAs by hybridization to junction oligonucleotides followed by high throughput sequencing could be done, but this approach does not avoid the problem of RT template switch. The direct, RT-independent sequencing of RNA molecules, as recently described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Ozsolak1">[27]</xref>, is an attractive alternative, but currently this approach is plagued by the inconvenience and mapping uncertainty of very short reads from the existing instruments.</p><p>The functional attributes of the chimeric transcripts could be in theory evaluated by disruption or silencing of these RNAs. However, the phenotypic readouts of these experiments are largely unknown and unpredicted, and one could use a litany of cellular assays in order to identify a potential phenotypic signature.</p><p>The statistically significant interconnections of genes involved, the greater phylogenetic depth of the genes involved in many chimeric interactions, the coordination of the expression of connected genes and the close <italic>in vivo</italic> and three dimensional proximity of the genomic regions being transcribed and contributing to parts of the chimeric RNAs all point to candidates that are likely not to be caused by technical artifacts and biologically important.</p><p>Importantly, the synthesis of chimeric RNAs can be envisioned to provide a molecular record of transcribed regions. Speculatively, functions of such an accounting system or the cellular processes could be myriad. One such function could be to provide a means to feedback information to regulate transcription or post-transcriptional levels of the transcripts involved in chimeric RNA production. Evidence from the 5C experiments pointing to co-localization of the genomic regions giving rise to chimeric RNAs suggests the opportunity that the origin of these RNAs may be associated with transcription factories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Jackson1">[28]</xref> and the mechanism of their formation may play a part in the establishment or maintenance of these sub-nuclear compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Pombo1">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Several features of the characterized chimeric RNAs suggest that the mechanism(s) involved in their formation is (are) likely not to be limited to the canonical splicing processes. These features include: 1) the very long genomic distances separating some of the exons found in the chimeric transcripts; 2) the presence of chimeric transcripts containing sequences from different chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0028213-g006">Figure 6D</xref>); 3) the decrease in the utilization of canonical splicing signals in transcripts with large genomic distances separating exons; and 4) the occurrence of short repeat sequences bracketing the junction sites of chimeric transcripts. Additional information concerning the mechanism(s) underlying the formation of these RNAs could potentially come from analysis of the proteins found associated with them in immunoprecipitation experiments.</p><p>Finally, observations of the existence of chimeric RNAs in not novel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Denoeud1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Maher1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Unneberg1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Akiva1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Kannan1">[31]</xref>.

These confounding issues are real and serious. However, considerable effort has been taken to evaluate and estimate the level of the false positive occurrences present in the data presented. Overall, the presence of chimeric RNAs as molecular events present in normal tissues and cell lines is strongly supported and while their biological importance is uncertain, a number of characteristics of the observed RNAs argue for them to be functional.

In practice, this is not feasible in large-scale projects (for instance, in the project here it would have required more than 25,000 tiling array hybridizations). A cost effective strategy is to pool together RACE products prior to hybridization. This compounds, however, the assignment of RACEfrags to the originating primers. To facilitate the assignment, it is desirable to maximize the genomic distance between the primed regions of the RACE experiments that are pooled together, so that each resulting signal from the array can be assigned to its corresponding primer as unambiguously as possible. The composition of each pool in terms of RACE primers is thus designed with the aim of simultaneously achieving two goals: Minimizing the number of pools (and consequently the cost of the experiment), and maximizing the genomic distance between the genomic positions of the primers that are pooled together.</p><p>In order to address this optimization problem, the pooling strategy is organized in two steps. First, i/Given the genomic positions of the primers, compute the minimum number of pools required in order to guarantee a minimum distance between two consecutive primers from the same pool. The longer the distance, the more the pools. ii/Given this total number of pools, distribute the primers within pools, in order to maximize the distance between each two consecutive primers. The constraint is the minimum distance between primers. This depends on the orientation of the primers. Indeed, as primers should only allow amplification from their 3&#x02032; ends, the minimum distance from their 5&#x02032; end can be lower than from the 3&#x02032;. Two minimum distances can thus be defined: distance L in 3&#x02032; of the primers, and distance l in 5&#x02032; of the primers. In practice, primers boundaries are initially extended accordingly (i.e., by L base pairs in 3&#x02032; and by l base pairs in 5&#x02032;) before being input to the pooling process. The values that we employed were L&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;minimum distance from 3&#x02032;: 900,000 bp, and l&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;minimum distance from 5&#x02032;: 90,000 bp.</p><p>The two steps of the algorithm are described in more details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028213.s001">Materials S1</xref> section 1.a.

Given this threshold, the set of positive probes can be defined for a given experiment, (2) the maximum number nucleotides that is allowed between two consecutive positive probes to be included in the same RACEfrag, (3) the minimum number of probes that are needed to call a RACEfrag, and (4), a binary flag that determines whether RACEfrags are called from the middle of the first probe to the middle of the last probe, or from the start of the first probe to the end of the last probe.</p><p>The RACEfrag caller is described in detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028213.s001">Materials S1</xref> section 2.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>RACEfrag filtering</title><p>In order to eliminate RACEfrags coming from unspecific priming and/or unspecific cross-hybridization, we used our in-house <italic>in silico</italic> RACEarray simulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Djebali1">[6]</xref>.

On the 302,699 RACEfrags remaining from the USPP filter, 40,227 were eliminated by the negative control filter (14&#x00025;), and we kept the remaining 262,472.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>RACEfrag assignment</title><p>As a given experiment (pool) corresponds to the hybridization onto a tiling array of a mixture of products obtained from RACE reactions performed with several different RACE primers, the information as to which RACEfrag comes from which primer of its pool is not known a priori. Still, it is crucial to be able to assign an originating RACE primer to each RACEfrag, in a pool-by-pool fashion.</p><p>RACEfrag assignment is an optimization problem; however we lack a proper underlying model to solve it as such. We instead use heuristic rules based on the three following remarks or definitions: i) a given pool includes primers of different chromosomes and pointing in different directions (5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; RACE primers located on genes on the forward and the reverse strands); ii) within a pool, a primer is said to be compatible with a RACEfrag if it is located on the same chromosome as the RACEfrag and is pointing in its direction; iii) a primer is said to be active in pool p and tissue t, if it is overlapped by a RACEfrag that appears in p and t.</p><p>Given a RACEfrag r of pool p and tissue t, if the closest compatible primer of pool p is active in p and t, then we assign it to r, else no primer is assigned to r and r is eliminated from the rest of the study.</p><p>The fact that several tissues or/and several primers per gene are used in the RACEarray strategy can be utilized to attribute a confidence score to the assignments (i.e., RACEfrag/locus pairs).

Raising R to the power of one plus the number of times RACEfrag r is not assigned to l greatly penalizes &#x0201c;ubiquitous&#x0201d; (unspecific) RACEfrags, while taking into account the number of times r appears.

These experiments are based on the analysis of RNAseq libraries prepared from mixes of RNA from different sources &#x02013;namely, human GM12878 cells and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> adult females. This strategy allowed us to analyze in isolation a control population of chimeric reads consisting exclusively of technical artifacts (inter-genomic reads), and to compare its properties to that of our populations of interest (intra-genomic chimeras).</p><p>We first analyzed two libraries prepared from pure total RNA from either human or fly, and one library prepared from a 1&#x02236;1 mix of RNA from both sources. We obtained about 10 M reads per library that our alignment algorithm (STAR, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gingeraslab.cshl.edu/STAR/">http://gingeraslab.cshl.edu/STAR/</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0028213-Dobin1">[44]</xref>) could map uniquely to either of the two reference genomes. We scored the numbers of intra- and inter-genomic chimeric reads identified in each dataset, under different mapping policies. The numbers reported in the table below are normalized for each library, and expressed in reads per 10 million uniquely mapped reads. If we required a minimum of 20 bases to be mapped on each side of a chimeric junction, we identified a very small number of inter-genomic reads in the pure human library (183 reads), and a slightly greater number in the pure fly library (1,660). These populations consist exclusively of sequencing and mapping artifacts &#x02013; an interpretation supported by the fact that their size shrinks dramatically as we increase the stringency of our mapping policy, requiring larger portions of the reads to map on either side of the junctions. In the mixed library, the number of inter-genomic reads (1,809) is about twice the mean of these two numbers (922), which shows that roughly half of the inter-genomic reads in this dataset are explained by sequencing/mapping errors, the other half being contributed by library preparation artifacts. Under the null model that all chimeric reads are artifactual, the number of intra-genomic chimeric reads for each species in the 1&#x02236;1 mix library should be half the number of inter-genomic reads. The fly population conforms roughly to this expectation, and therefore seems largely accounted for by technical factors. The human population, on the other hand, exceeds the expectations by a factor of 5 (e.g., central row: 2,050 reads instead of an expected 831/2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;415) &#x02013; suggesting that a number of chimeric sequences may be present in the human transcriptome. More stringent mapping leads to identical conclusions.</p><p>Bearing in mind that this simple null model may not accurately describe the generation of artifactual chimeric reads, and that some factors &#x02013; such a sequence similarity, for instance &#x02013; may favor the formation of intra-genomic artifacts, we had also sequenced additional libraries designed specifically to distinguish between molecules of technical versus biological origin within the population of human chimeric reads. All were prepared from a mix of human and fly total RNA, keeping the overall amount of RNA constant but varying the human-to-fly ratio from 1&#x02236;1 down to 1&#x02236;100. In this type of dilution series, molecules of biological origin and library preparation artifacts are expected to have drastically different behaviors. The number of the former should decrease linearly with the dilution factor, whereas that of the latter should decrease linearly with the square of the dilution factor (as does the probability of independently picking 2 human transcripts by random sampling). With our least stringent mapping policy (minimum mapped length of 2&#x000d7;20 bases) the decrease is less than linear, suggesting that the analysis is confounded by sequencing/mapping artifacts &#x02013; which we know not to be filtered efficiently by this policy, as explained above. With more stringent mapping (min 2&#x000d7;25 bases) the decrease is very close to linear: we expected 2,050, 2,050/5&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;410 &#x00026; 2,050/50&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;41 reads, and observed 2,050, 317 &#x00026; 51. The most stringent mapping policy shows a slightly faster-than-linear decay, revealing a minor artifactual component. These results further support the notion that the human transcriptome does naturally include some chimeric molecules.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0028213.s001"><label>Materials S1</label><caption><p><bold>Supplementary text.</bold></p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0028213.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0028213.s002"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Distance between consecutive pooled primers.</bold> This figure represents the distribution of distances between consecutive primers of the same pool for each chromosome and each relative position of primer pairs: head to head (&#x02192; &#x02190;), head to tail (&#x02192;&#x02192;) and tail to tail (&#x02190;&#x02192;), as a box plot.

The exonic accuracy assesses the RACEfrag set with respect to a reference set: the projected internal exons. More precisely for each projected internal exon, considered as a reference, the exonic accuracy assesses the accuracy with which the RACEfrags overlapping this reference mimics this reference. This accuracy is measured in terms of intersection over union of the projected internal exons and the RACEfrags, i.e., for each projected internal exon with overlapping RACEfrags, the number of nucleotides in common between the two sets is divided by the number of nucleotides in either of the two sets. The exonic accuracy of a RACEfrag set is then the median of the exonic accuracy of projected internal exons with overlapping RACEfrags. Unlike the exonic accuracy the splice site score of a RACEfrag set does not depend on any reference but is rather intrinsic to the RACEfrag set. More precisely, the spice site score is divided into two sub-measures: the acceptor score and the donor score. Both scores involve the scanning of two windows around the RACEfrag boundaries, W1 around the left boundary and W2 around the right boundary, where both acceptor and donor sites have previously been found by the geneid program. The RACEfrag acceptor score is then defined as the score of the best acceptor site on the 2 windows, and the RACEfrag donor score as the one of the best donor site on the 2 windows.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0028213.s003.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0028213.s004"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p><bold>RACEfrag calling.</bold> This figure represents the exonic accuracy of 10 RACEfrag sets coming from 10 randomly chosen experiments, as a function of the intensity threshold (I) and the maxgap (M), for 3 different minrun values (m): 3, 4 and 5.

Here the (RACEfrag, locus) pair we are the most confident in is (3,C) since RACEfrag 3 appears 4 times in total and each time it appears it is assigned to locus C. Also, the fact that it is assigned to two different primers of locus C, primers C1 and C2, strengthens the confidence we have in this pair. The pair (4,C) is similar to the pair (3,C) except that RACEfrag 4 appears in 2 experiments instead of 4. It thus also has a good score, although less than the one of (3,C). The pair (2,C) is like the pair (3,C) except that RACEfrag 2 also appears in pool 3, tissue 1 where it is assigned to locus A. This makes it more uncertain we should assign RACEfrags 2 to locus C, as compared to RACEfrag 3, and this is why the score of (2,C) is lower than the one of (3,C). The pair (5,C) is similar to the pair (4,C) except that RACEfrag 5 is only assigned to 1 primer of locus C (primer C1), compared to two primers of locus C for RACEfrag 4 (primers C1 and C2). This explains the lower score of (5,C) with respect to the one of (4,C). Finally the pair (2,A) is given a very bad score since RACEfrag 2 appears 5 times but is assigned only once to locus A.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0028213.s006.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0028213.s007"><label>Figure S6</label><caption><p><bold>Chromosome 21 transcriptional networks.</bold> RACE connection networks in all 10 assayed cell types are represented.
