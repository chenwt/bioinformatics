It is the most life-threatening neoplasm of the skin and is considered a major health problem due to rising incidence and mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Melanoma is a tumor with a high degree of heterogeneity and this phenotypic heterogeneity is reversible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition to being a challenge for basic research, melanoma plasticity is a major hurdle for successful treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Investigating the molecular basis of phenotypic heterogeneity is crucial to better understand melanoma progression and should provide useful insights for the development of more effective therapies.</p><p>In an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of melanoma progression, significant differences have been detected between melanoma cells from the same lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We and others have found that melanoma cells generally express two distinct gene expression signatures, that these signatures correlate with <italic>in vitro</italic> characteristics and these phenotypes are reversible depending on their cellular microenvironments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. One signature is characterized by the upregulation of several melanocytic genes like <italic>MITF</italic>, <italic>TYR</italic>, and <italic>DCT</italic>. These melanoma cells are highly proliferative and weakly invasive <italic>in vitro</italic> and so are named the proliferative phenotype. The other signature is characterized by the upregulation of many mesenchymal genes such as <italic>WNT5A</italic>, <italic>TGF</italic>&#x003b2;, and <italic>FGF2</italic>. In contrast to the proliferative cells, these cells are highly invasive but have a low proliferative capacity <italic>in vitro</italic> and are thus named the invasive phenotype. Meta-analysis of all available melanoma microarray datasets available on the NCBI GEO database confirmed these two gene signatures in 86% of the 536 melanomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Immunohistochemical analyses of MITF and WNT5A, markers of the proliferative and invasive phenotype, respectively, of human primary and metastatic melanomas displayed an anti-correlative staining pattern confirming that these phenotypes exist <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Together these findings culminated in the phenotype switching model for melanoma progression, in which melanoma cells respond to changing micro-environmental signals, such as hypoxia, by reprogramming their gene expression patterns to switch between states of proliferation and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Thus, phenotype switching has important implications in melanoma progression. Invasive phenotype cells characterized by low MITF expression, have stem-like properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], including the ability to initiate tumors with high efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Consequently, tumors comprise a mix of MITF positive and negative melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>DNA methylation provides a stable and heritable gene regulatory mechanism for which melanoma cells could alter the expression of many genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Aberrant DNA methylation is a mechanism known to cause tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Tumor suppressor genes become silenced by hypermethylation of their promoter region, thus promoting tumorigenesis. Global hypomethylation has been observed in many cancers, including melanoma, to decrease with progression of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. DNMT3a and DNMT3b, the <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferases, were shown to have increased expression in metastatic melanomas compared to primary melanomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Another group showed that DNMT3a is required for melanoma development and metastasis in a melanoma mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Several signaling pathways have been shown to be deregulated as a result of aberrant DNMT-dependent methylation in melanoma, which include MAPK, WNT, PI3K, pRB, and pathways in cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Progressive global DNA hypomethylation has been observed in malignant melanocyte transformation, and surprisingly transformation was blocked in the presence of 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine (decitabine, Aza), a DNMT inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It would suggest that targeted hypomethylation is required for malignant transformation and not overall global hypomethylation caused by Aza treatment. This is supported by our observation that treating proliferative melanoma cells with Aza had no measureable effect on their invasive abilities (data not shown). 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine treatment of various melanoma cell lines was shown to increase SOX9 expression and induce expression of p27 and p21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. SOX9 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and SOX9 overexpression in melanoma cell lines have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest in a p21 dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Taken together, it would suggest that DNA methylation has a crucial role in malignant transformation and progression by altering the landscape of the methylome to promote tumor progression, and SOX9 is one of the targets of DNA methylation that induces cell cycle arrest.</p><p>In this study, we examine the expression of the DNMTs between the proliferative and invasive melanoma cell cultures and describe the differential melanoma methylome by MeDIP-chip. We confirm that SOX9 expression is regulated by DNA methylation and has a role in cell cycle regulation, invasion <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and could be a prognostic marker for overall survival in metastatic melanoma patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Proliferative melanoma cells have higher levels of global DNA-methylation</title><p>We have previously established melanocytic markers like MLANA to distinguish between the proliferative and invasive phenotype on a cohort of primary melanoma cell cultures (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. To investigate if methylation differences exist between the proliferative and invasive melanoma phenotypes, we compared five proliferative (M000921, M010817, M080423, M980513, and M050829) and five invasive (M990115, M010119, M080201, M080307, and M080310) melanoma cell cultures for expression of <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, 3a, and 3b (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). We observed that the invasive phenotype melanoma cell cultures had about 51.1% less expression of DNMT1 as compared to the proliferative phenotype melanoma cell cultures (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). DNMT3b had about 50% less protein expression in the proliferative melanoma cell cultures compared to the invasive melanoma cell cultures (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). However, DNMT3a was not differentially expressed between the proliferative and invasive phenotype (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Global methylation analysis by methyl-cytosine ELISA showed that the invasive phenotype cells have significantly less DNA methylation in their genome compared to the proliferative phenotype cells, 13.0% to 20.9%, respectively (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). This raises the possibility that differential methylation exists between the proliferative and invasive phenotype.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Phenotype specific expression of DNMTs and DNA methylation patterns.

To determine which CpG islands were differentially methylated between the proliferative and invasive phenotypes, we immunoprecipitated methylated DNA from five proliferative and five invasive melanoma cell cultures by MeDIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] followed by hybridization to Nimblegen Human DNA Methylation 3x720K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter Arrays. This array contains 720,000 probes for 22,532 promoter regions and 27,728 CpG islands. We calculated the differential methylation levels between the five proliferative and five invasive melanoma cells with a sliding window ANOVA test with the R package DMR supplied from Nimblegen. We found 406 gene promoters to be significantly and differentially methylated between the proliferative and invasive phenotypes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). A total of 320 promoter regions were hypermethylated in the proliferative phenotype and 86 promoter regions were hypermethylated in the invasive phenotype. The greater number of hypermethylated regions in the proliferative phenotype would be consistent with the global methylation data.</p><p>Gene expression data for the 10 melanoma cell cultures previously generated by us [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] were reanalyzed for differential gene expression between the proliferative and invasive phenotypes using the R package limma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A total of 1,750 genes were differentially expressed between the proliferative and invasive phenotype (fold change &#x0003e;2, FDR corrected <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). We then analyzed the relationship between the promoter methylation status and mRNA expression levels for all genes in both datasets. Genes were filtered for a peak score &#x0003e;2 for methylation, fold change &#x0003e;2 for gene expression and an FDR-corrected <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.05. A total of 73 genes showed both significant differential DNA methylation and significant differential expression between the proliferative and invasive phenotype (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1). Sixty-two genes from the proliferative phenotype had hypermethylated promoters and low RNA expression and 11 genes in the invasive phenotype had hypermethylated promoters and low RNA expression as compared to the proliferative phenotype. This suggests that methylation has a role in regulating a portion of the genes differentially expressed between the proliferative and invasive phenotype. We hypothesized that the 73 genes with both differential DNA methylation and mRNA expression between the proliferative and invasive melanoma cells were likely to be true targets of epigenetic regulation in melanoma. To determine which groups of genes were functionally important, we performed pathway analysis of the 73 genes on MetaCore. We looked for enrichment of pathways under GO processes, process networks, and Pathway maps (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). Interestingly, we observed significant enrichment in pathways involved in EMT, melanoma, and cell differentiation. We decided to focus on <italic>SOX9</italic> for validation due to its known function in melanocyte differentiation and melanoma progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sox9 expression is silenced in proliferative melanoma cells through promoter DNA methylation</title><p>From the methylation array, the area that had the most enrichment for methylation was about 2&#x000a0;kb upstream of the <italic>SOX9</italic> transcriptional start site thus we validated the CpG island located there via sequencing of bisulfite-treated genomic DNA in the 10 melanoma cell cultures (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A).

We analyzed the DNA methylation status of a cluster of 17 CpGs across a 283-bp region and 15 CpGs across a 256-bp region of a CpG island, located approximately &#x02212;2,500&#x000a0;bp to &#x02212;2,000&#x000a0;bp upstream of the <italic>SOX9</italic> transcriptional start site. The majority of CpGs in both regions of the <italic>SOX9</italic> promoter were consistently methylated in the proliferative phenotype melanoma cell cultures and consistently unmethylated in the invasive phenotype melanoma cell cultures.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

We have previously described two subpopulations in melanoma, the proliferative phenotype and the invasive phenotype, which are defined by specific gene signatures, <italic>in vitro</italic> characteristics, and response to drug treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Briefly, proliferative phenotype melanoma cells are distinguished by a high proliferative capacity and low invasive capacity and the invasive phenotype melanoma cells are distinguished by a low proliferative capacity and high invasive capacity. In this study, we found specific DNA methylation signatures for the proliferative and invasive melanoma phenotypes. We observed the invasive phenotype melanoma cell cultures had modest decrease of 5% in global methylation compared to the proliferative phenotype melanoma cell cultures. This may be due to decreased DNMT1 protein expression in the invasive phenotype melanoma cells. Global methylation levels have been observed to decrease as a cancerous lesion progresses from a benign tumor to metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and we observed our invasive phenotype melanoma cell cultures had decreased DNA methylation levels and were more invasive than the proliferative phenotype melanoma cell cultures, suggesting the invasive cell cultures have progressed further in malignancy. Differential expression of the <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferase DNMT3b was also seen between the proliferative and invasive phenotype. These data are consistent with a model in which DNMT1 and DNMT3b have phenotype specificity and contribute to transcriptional heterogeneity by altering the methylation landscape of a melanoma cell in the context of melanoma phenotype switching. Pathway analysis of the 73 gene signature from the DNA methylation and gene expression array lead to the discovery of many transcription networks involved in development. These transcription factors were found to be hypomethylated and highly expressed in the invasive phenotype, which would suggest the invasive melanoma cell cultures may revert to a dedifferentiated state.</p><p>A number of other studies that have looked at genome-wide DNA methylation in melanoma have indicated that several tumor suppressors are silenced by DNA methylation compared to normal melanocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and compared to benign nevi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Also, a recent study investigating 5-hydroxymethylation (5-hmC) in melanoma found a global decrease of 5-hmC was necessary for melanoma formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The results from these studies indicate aberrant DNA methylation is an important process in melanoma development and progression. In our work, we looked at the differences in DNA methylation landscape between 10 primary melanoma cell cultures and uncovered two distinct populations, as previously demonstrated by gene expression microarray analysis from our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Surprisingly, the targets we found to be differentially methylated between the two phenotypes do not overlap with the targets found to be differentially methylated between normal melanocytes and melanoma, and benign nevi and melanoma. We did not detect any differential methylation in validated methylation gene sets such as <italic>COL1A2</italic>, <italic>NPM2</italic>, <italic>HSPB6</italic>, <italic>DDIT4L</italic>, and <italic>MTIG</italic> from Koga <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] or <italic>UCHL1</italic>, <italic>COL1A2</italic>, <italic>THBS1</italic>, and <italic>TNFRSF10D</italic> from Bonazzi <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. As those studies were comparing the methylation state of normal melanocytes to melanoma and in this study we compare within melanoma phenotypes, this might indicate that a different set of pathways are activated or silenced by DNA methylation in melanoma progression compared to melanoma initiation. In either case, it is clear that epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation play an important role in melanoma initiation as well as progression, and embryonic developmental program reactivation may be one of the critical outcomes of this modulatory activity.</p><p>In our study, a subset of our melanoma cell cultures had lower SOX9 expression due to a hypermethylated promoter and the other subset with high SOX9 expression had a hypomethylated promoter. We confirmed that SOX9 is regulated by DNA methylation by treating low SOX9 expressing cells with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine treatment and saw re-expression of SOX9. To determine if the regulation of SOX9 by DNA methylation is a common mechanism in melanoma or just seen within our melanoma cell cultures, we interrogated the melanoma TCGA dataset for SOX9 and found that SOX9 gene expression and DNA methylation are anti-correlated at three consecutive methylation probes in 293 samples. This provides strong evidence that specific DNA methylation is the molecular mechanism that regulates SOX9 expression in melanoma. Alcazar <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that after decitabine treatment of A375 and B16 melanoma cells, the promoter of SOX9 becomes hypomethylated and SOX9 is re-expressed with induction of p27 and p21 for cell cycle arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Passeron <italic>et al.</italic> also observed that SOX9 was downregulated in some melanoma cell lines and induction of SOX9 expression in these melanoma cell lines resulted in lower proliferation due to upregulation of p21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We also overexpressed SOX9 in low SOX9 melanoma cell cultures and observed G1/S cell arrest, which is consistent with the study from Passeron <italic>et al</italic>. Although the proliferation rate is reduced, the invasive capacity of these SOX9 overexpressing cells is increased, which phenocopies the endogenous SOX9 expressing cells. Conversely, knockdown of SOX9 in the invasive phenotype melanoma cells reduced the invasive capacity of the cells. Microarray analysis of SOX9 overexpression revealed an EMT-like transcriptional signature and had 10% overlap with invasive phenotype gene signature which supports the notion that SOX9 is a factor that contributes to the invasive phenotype. <italic>In vivo</italic>, sox9 expression in B16F1 cells increases their metastatic potential causing more tumor lung nodules in the tail vein injection assay. Taken together, SOX9 is a gene that is regulated by DNA methylation and functionally, SOX9 mediates cell cycle progression, invasion, and metastasis in melanoma.</p><p>TCGA is a great resource for clinical and next-generation sequencing data on human tumors. We took advantage of the melanoma dataset and demonstrated that <italic>SOX9</italic> expression levels have a significant impact on survival of metastatic melanoma patients but <italic>SOX9</italic> did not have a significant impact on survival in patients with primary melanomas. This could suggest that <italic>SOX9</italic> is required for progression of primary melanoma into metastasis and metastatic tumors with high SOX9 are more aggressive to the patient. There were no clinical metrics that could distinguish SOX9 high or low in primary melanoma. Only T1 and N0 stage in metastatic melanomas were significant between SOX9 high and low. Survival analysis of metastatic patients with high SOX9 expression versus low SOX9 expression revealed a significant difference in the overall 10-year survival rates. Patients with high-SOX9 expressing tumors had a 2.3 times increased risk of death compared to patients with low SOX9 expressing tumors. Based on these findings and the invasive properties of high SOX9 expressing melanomas, it would suggest that SOX9 expression in melanomas could push the tumor toward more aggressive metastasis. Thus, SOX9 could potentially be a prognostic marker for metastatic melanoma.</p><p>We performed differential gene expression analysis on the RNAseq dataset where we defined the SOX9 high group as having a minimum of three-fold greater expression than the SOX9 low group. We only saw an overlap of 31 genes between both datasets; however, the overlap was significant as determined by hypergeometric distribution. The contribution of heterogeneity in the melanoma TCGA patient population would be one of the largest factors for the difference in gene signatures between our SOX9 microarray and TCGA RNAseq data. Nonetheless, the significant overlap of genes narrow down the potential targets of SOX9. To confirm that the targets of SOX9 have prognostic value for the patients, we performed survival analysis on all 31 genes. Surprisingly, 58% (11/19) of the genes downregulated by SOX9 were associated with improved survival, which strongly suggests SOX9 represses a set of genes that decrease tumor malignancy. Genes that were upregulated by SOX9 expression had little impact on patient survival which implies that SOX9 expression alone is sufficient to drive disease progression. From this list of 31 genes, 19 of them had a potential SOX9 binding site in its promoter. We could validate TMEM158, TBX3, and FYB as direct targets of SOX9 binding by chromatin immunoprecipitation. FYB is downregulated when SOX9 levels are high suggesting a repressive effect of SOX9 on this gene. FYB is required for inflammatory cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] but no known link has been established with melanoma. TMEM158 is upregulated by SOX9 but no clear role has been established for the gene in melanoma. TBX3 is also upregulated by SOX9 and TBX3 is known to cause increased invasiveness in melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], suggesting TBX3 could be an effector gene that drives the invasive phenotype we see in SOX9 high cells and in patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we found SOX9 to be regulated by DNA methylation, and high SOX9 expression leads to poor survival in melanoma patients due to the activation of EMT-like genes and the downregulation of potential tumor suppressor genes in melanoma cells. This was confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic>, and new direct targets of SOX9 that may mediate its function in tumor progression were identified by transcriptional profiling and chromatin-immunoprecipitation. Future therapies targeting SOX9 could be beneficial for patients to prevent progression and especially when combined with therapies targeting cells of the proliferative phenotype. Further investigation would be required to determine if SOX9 would have early prognostic value for tumor malignancy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Melanoma cell cultures were established from surplus material from primary cutaneous melanoma and melanoma metastases removed by surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].
