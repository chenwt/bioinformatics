The goal of this study was to characterize the ecological processes that mediate host-specificity of the vertebrate gut symbiont <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic>, and to systematically identify the bacterial factors that are involved. Experiments with monoassociated mice revealed that the ability of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> to form epithelial biofilms in the mouse forestomach is strictly dependent on the strain's host origin. To unravel the molecular basis for this host-specific biofilm formation, we applied a combination of transcriptome analysis and comparative genomics and identified eleven genes of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23 that were predicted to play a role. We then determined expression and importance of these genes during <italic>in vivo</italic> biofilm formation in monoassociated mice. This analysis revealed that six of the genes were upregulated <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that genes encoding for proteins involved in epithelial adherence, specialized protein transport, cell aggregation, environmental sensing, and cell lysis contributed to biofilm formation. Inactivation of a serine-rich surface adhesin with a devoted transport system (the SecA2-SecY2 pathway) completely abrogated biofilm formation, indicating that initial adhesion represented the most significant step in biofilm formation, likely conferring host specificity. In summary, this study established that the epithelial selection of bacterial symbionts in the vertebrate gut can be both specific and highly efficient, resulting in biofilms that are exclusively formed by the coevolved strains, and it allowed insight into the bacterial effectors of this process.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The bacterial communities found in the vertebrate gastrointestinal tract are remarkably stable and host-specific. However, the ecological and molecular processes that facilitate the selection of microbial symbionts and the exclusion of detrimental bacteria are not well understood. Here, we explore the mechanisms that underlie colonization and biofilm formation in specific strains of the gut symbiont <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic>. When previously germ-free mice are colonized by individual strains of <italic>L. reuteri</italic>, only strains originating from rodents formed biofilms on the forestomach epithelium. Genomic, proteomic, and molecular analysis provide a detailed look into the host-specific molecular processes, such as adhesion, that contribute to colonization and biofilm formation. Our findings demonstrate high fidelity in the epithelial selection of a bacterial gut inhabitant, which can differentiate even between strains of the same species, strengthening the notion that some relationships between vertebrates and their microbial symbionts are highly coevolved and exclusive.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was partly funded by BioGaia AB (Stockholm, Sweden) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) Institute Strategic Programme BB/J004529/1: The Gut Health and Food Safety ISP.

These symbioses vary in terms of their effects on the host and the evolutionary and ecological processes that maintain the partnership. To date, host-microbial symbiosis is best understood in invertebrates such as insects, nematodes, and the Hawaiian squid <italic>Euprymna scolopes</italic>

These symbioses are often mutualistic, coevolved, and remarkably specific, with the host being able to select for the correct symbiotic partners and stably maintain them over ecological and evolutionary time-scales <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Dale1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Host specificity is considered one of the factors that support the evolution and maintenance of mutualistic interactions <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Herre1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and scientists have begun to use model systems to identify the molecular mechanisms by which exclusive symbiotic alliances become established <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Mandel1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Vertebrates also form relationships with microbial populations that play important roles in their biology and development, and therefore qualify as symbioses <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Backhed1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Walter1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Microbial communities associated with vertebrates are generally more diverse than those found with invertebrates, comprising hundreds of microbial species, most of which are bacteria. The densest bacterial population associated with vertebrates is found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (the gut microbiota), and as a whole, this community makes important contributions to the host in the form of nutrient provision, resistance to infections, and development of immune system functions <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Moran1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Walter1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Despite the importance of the gut microbiota, there is still little known on how bacterial populations become acquired, are stably maintained by the host. 16S rRNA surveys revealed that the fecal microbiota of mammals is to a large degree specific for their particular host species <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Ley1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Ochman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and remarkably stable <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Martinez1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Schloss1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, indicating that mechanisms are in place to recruit and maintain selected bacterial populations. However, in contrast to microbial symbioses in invertebrates, virtually nothing is known about the molecular processes by which recognition, selection, and capture of bacterial lineages are conferred in vertebrates.</p><p>
<italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> is a gut symbiont present in a variety of vertebrate species, likely benefiting its host <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Walter1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. We have recently demonstrated, by using a combination of population genetics and comparative genomics, that the species is composed of host-specific clades <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Oh1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> with lineage-specific genomic differences that reflect the niche characteristics in the GI tract of respective hosts <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Experiments in <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-free mice to measure the ecological fitness of strains originating from different hosts supported host adaptation, as only rodent strains colonized mice efficiently <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Overall, the findings indicated that <italic>L. reuteri</italic> is a host specific symbiont, and the separate lineages within the species suggest that host restriction was maintained over evolutionary time spans, allowing host-driven diversification <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Oh1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. We have demonstrated the ecological significance of a subset of rodent-specific <italic>L. reuteri</italic> genes in the context of the murine gut <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, but the mechanisms by which these genes influence host colonization and the molecular processes that mediate host specificity have not been systematically investigated.</p><p>In rodents, pigs, chickens, and horses, lactobacilli form large populations in proximal regions of the GI tract, and they adhere directly to the stratified squamous epithelium present at these sites <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Savage1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Yuki1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In mice and rats, adherence occurs in the forestomach <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Suegara1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and this process appears to be important with regards to the ecological fitness of the bacteria <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Walter2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The epithelial associations formed can be considered biofilms as the bacteria are arranged in multiple layers and are encased in a polysaccharide matrix <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Tannock1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Walter3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

However, even within mature biofilms, colonization was patchy, with some areas being densely populated by various layers of cells, while others showed few adherent cells. These patterns are likely caused by the continuous shedding of epithelial cells, resulting in vacant areas that have to be recolonized.</p><fig id="pgen-1004057-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004057.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Biofilms of <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> 100-23 on the keratinized squamous stratified epithelium of the mouse forestomach.</title><p>(A) Scanning electron microscopy micrograph of forestomach epithelium of ex germ-free mice two days after a single gavage of 10<sup>7</sup> CFU <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23.

Although our previous studies were in <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-free mice which approximate a microbiota functionally equivalent to conventional animals <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, we specifically chose monoassociated mice here as they allow the specific study of biofilms and the underlying bacterial factors in the absence of competitive interactions. Competitive interactions that affect colonization unrelated to biofilms (e.g. interference through bacteriocins, competition for substrates, bacteriophages) would confound our ability to first interpret the exact ecological role of biofilms, and second, to identify bacterial factors that specifically contribute to their formation. In our case, the monoassociated mouse model was necessary to exclusively compare biofilm formation of rodent and non-rodent strains as the latter are poor colonizers of mice with a competitive microbiota <xref rid="pgen.1004057-Frese1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Using this mouse model, biofilm formation of nine wild-type strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1004057-t001">Table 1</xref>) originating from different hosts (mouse, rat, human, pig, and chicken) was evaluated.

Samples of concentrated spent media and cell surface extracts were electrophoresed through 4&#x02013;12% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Novex Invitrogen) with MOPS-SDS buffer for 50 min at 200V constant voltage, followed by fixing and staining with Colloidal Blue (Novex Invitrogen). HiMark Unstained High Molecular Weight Protein Standard (Invitrogen) was electrophoresed for comparison. Individual protein bands or larger regions of each gel lane were excised from the gel, gel pieces were cut into &#x0223c;1 mm cubes and washed with 2&#x000d7;15 min incubations in 500 &#x000b5;l of 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN; Fisher) to equilibrate the gel to pH 8.0 and remove the stain, followed by a 10 min incubation with 500 &#x000b5;l ACN. Cysteine thiol side chains were reduced by incubation with 500 &#x000b5;l of 10 mM dithiothreitol in 50 mM ABC for 30 min at 60&#x000b0;C before being alkylated with 500 &#x000b5;l of 100 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM ABC for 30 min at room temperature.

Proteins were digested by the addition of 100 ng trypsin (modified porcine trypsin; Promega) in 10 &#x000b5;l of 10 mM ABC, or a mixture of 100 ng trypsin and 100 ng endoproteinase GluC (Roche) in 10 &#x000b5;l of 10 mM ABC before incubation overnight at 37&#x000b0;C. Following digestion, the samples were acidified by incubating with 10 &#x000b5;l of 1% (v/v) formic acid for 10 min. The digest solution was removed from the tube into an Eppendorf tube and the gel pieces were then washed with 20 &#x000b5;l of 50% ACN for 10 min to recover more digest peptides from the gel. The combined extracted digest samples were dried down at the low drying setting on a Speed Vac SC110 (Savant) fitted with a refrigerated condensation trap and a Vac V-500 (Buchi). Samples were stored frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C prior to LC-MS/MS analysis in a nanoflow-HPLC system (nanoACQUITY: Waters) and a LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo). Peptides were trapped on line to a Symmetry C18 Trap (5 &#x000b5;m, 180 &#x000b5;m&#x000d7;20 mm) which was then switched in-line to a UPLC BEH C18 Column, (1.7 &#x000b5;m, 75 &#x000b5;m&#x000d7;250 mm) held at 45&#x000b0;C. Peptides were eluted by a gradient of 0&#x02013;80% ACN in 0.1% formic acid over 50 min at a flow rate of 250 nl min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode with a nano-spray source at a capillary temperature of 200&#x000b0;C. The Orbitrap was run with a resolution of 60,000 over the mass range m/z 300&#x02013;2,000 and an MS target of 10<sup>6</sup> and 1 s maximum scan time. The MS/MS was triggered by a minimal signal of 2000 with an Automatic Gain Control target of 30,000 ions and maximum scan time of 150 ms. For MS/MS events selection of 2+ and 3+ charge states selection were used. Dynamic exclusion was set to 1 count and 30 s exclusion time with an exclusion mass window of &#x000b1;20 ppm.
