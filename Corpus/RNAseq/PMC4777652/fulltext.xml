The etiology and molecular basis for these &#x0201c;alternative&#x0201d; treatment-resistant cell states remain incompletely understood. Here, by analyzing whole exome sequencing data of metastatic biopsies from patients, we observed significant genomic overlap between castration resistant adenocarcinoma (CRPC-Adeno) and neuroendocrine histologies (CRPC-NE); analysis of serial progression samples points to a model most consistent with divergent clonal evolution. Genome-wide DNA methylation revealed marked epigenetic differences between CRPC-NE and CRPC-Adeno that also designated cases of CRPC-Adeno with clinical features of AR-independence as CRPC-NE, suggesting that epigenetic modifiers may play a role in the induction and/or maintenance of this treatment-resistant state. This study supports the emergence of an alternative, &#x0201c;AR-indifferent&#x0201d; cell state through divergent clonal evolution as a mechanism of treatment resistance in advanced prostate cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P4">Prostate cancer remains a leading cause of male cancer death worldwide<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The mainstay of therapy for patients with metastatic spread, including castration resistant disease, is hormonal therapy targeting the AR<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Enzalutamide and abiraterone are potent AR-targeted therapies approved for the treatment of men with CRPC<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. While significantly improving survival and quality of life, most patients ultimately develop resistance to these agents<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Thus, predictive biomarkers to help distinguish responders from non-responders prior to starting the next line of hormonal therapy are urgently needed. We and others have observed that a subset of resistant tumors show small cell carcinoma or neuroendocrine features on metastatic biopsy (CRPC-NE)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. This phenomenon may therefore reflect an epithelial plasticity that enables tumor adaptation in response to AR-targeted therapies<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Prognosis of CRPC-NE is poor due to late recognition, heterogeneous clinical features, and lack of effective systemic therapies<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">One major hurdle in the diagnosis and treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer including CRPC-NE is our lack of understanding of the genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of this aggressive subset. To address this, we interrogated 114 metastatic tumor specimens from 81 individuals including 51 with clinical and histologic features of castration resistant adenocarcinoma (CRPC-Adeno), and 30 with CRPC-NE as confirmed by pathologic consensus criteria<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>; we studied matched normal cells from all patients, multiple tumor biopsies from 17 patients and a single tumor biopsy from 64 patients. We hypothesized that CRPC-NE could be distinguished from CRPC-Adeno based on distinct molecular alterations and that this information could improve upon and supplement the current often challenging diagnostic features reliant on morphology<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. We also hypothesized that CRPC-NE that develops after therapy arises clonally from a CRPC-Adeno precursor, rather than from selection of pre-existing neuroendocrine clones. Lastly, we hypothesized that AR-independent prostate adenocarcinomas that share CRPC-NE-specific molecular alterations may represent tumors at high risk for progression or in transition towards CRPC-NE.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>Results</title><p id="P6">We evaluated biopsies from a wide range of metastatic sites, with a predominance of bone biopsies in CRPC-Adeno compared to CRPC-NE (31% CRPC-Adeno vs. 2% CRPC-NE, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, binomial test) <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>)</bold>. Clinical and pathologic features are summarized in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.1</xref></bold>. As expected, CRPC-NE demonstrated on average lower protein expression of the AR by immunohistochemistry <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>)</bold>. We also quantified AR signaling status by measuring expression of mRNAs included in a previously defined AR signature<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>
<bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>)</bold> and observed overall lower abundance in CRPC-NE compared to CRPC-Adeno <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>)</bold>; however, there was significant overlap with a wide range of values observed within each subtype, suggesting that there is a spectrum of AR signaling in advanced prostate cancer that spans pathologic subtypes.</p><p id="P7">To deepen our understanding of AR independence in general &#x02014;and of the CRPC-NE phenotype in particular&#x02014; we first performed whole exome sequencing (WES) of 114 metastatic tumor-normal pairs. The mutational landscape of CRPC-NE was similar to CRPC-Adeno, but also consistent with published studies of CRPC-NE <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>)</bold> including enrichment of <italic>RB1</italic> loss <italic>(</italic>deleted in 70% of CRPC-NE and 32% of CRPC-Adeno, <italic>P</italic> = 0.003, proportion test) and mutation or deletion of <italic>TP53</italic> (66.7% CRPC-NE versus 31.4% CRPC-Adeno, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0043, proportion test). Loss of <italic>RB1</italic> is common in primary small cell prostate and lung carcinomas, and promotes small cell carcinoma pathogenesis when concurrent with <italic>TP53</italic> mutation<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>; in our series, concurrent <italic>RB1</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic> loss was present in 53.3% of CRPC-NE vs.13.7% of CRPC-Adeno (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0004, proportion test).</p><p id="P8">Another feature distinguishing CRPC-NE from CRPC-Adeno was a paucity of somatic alterations involving the AR gene in the former (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001, Wilcoxon test, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-e</xref></bold>). Genomic amplification, activating point mutations, and splice variants involving the AR are commonly observed in CRPC-Adeno and associated with treatment resistance to AR-directed therapies<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. This observation was confirmed in our cohort; 29 cases showed <italic>AR</italic> focal amplification or point mutation and 21 cases had alterations in known AR co-activators (<italic>FOXA1, NCOR1/2, ZBTB16</italic>). In contrast, AR point mutations were notably absent in CRPC-NE and gains when present were of low level and explained by tumor polyploidy. Although potentially affected by differences in prior therapies, we speculate that the absence of AR genomic alterations in CRPC-NE may be due to clonal selection of non-amplified CRPC-Adeno tumor subpopulations through selective pressure (in the context of AR-directed therapies). The ARv7 splice variant was observed in both CRPC-Adeno and CRPC-NE tumors, and although overall AR expression was lower in CRPC-NE, the ARv7 to wild type AR ratio was significantly decreased in CRPC-NE compared to CRPC-Adeno (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0025, Wilcoxon test) <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>)</bold>. These data suggested that AR signaling is attenuated in CRPC-NE. Together with the frequent loss of <italic>RB1</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic> in this subtype, these genetic findings imply distinct biological properties associated with CRPC-NE. The overall spectrum of genomic alterations, however, was similar between the two castration resistant subtypes <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>)</bold> and maintained after controlling for site of metastasis and prior chemotherapy <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>)</bold>. There were no significant differences in rate of non-silent point mutations, polyploidy or copy number genomic burden between CRPC-Adeno and CRPC-NE (on average more than 30% of the genome was aberrant), and both subtypes showed a significantly higher number of clonal point mutations compared with clinically localized prostate cancer<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. The median number of non-silent SNVs in metastatic samples was 41 (range: 2-729) <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 3-4</xref>)</bold>. Five of the six samples with the highest number of SNVs (115-663) showed genetic and/or protein expression alterations involving DNA mismatch repair genes <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>)</bold> consistent with prior studies<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.

<bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>)</bold>. After correcting for admixture of non-tumor cells and for ploidy<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, we sought to identify regions of the genome differentially altered and noted deletions that are enriched in CRPC-NE and conversely preferential regions of gain in CRPC-Adeno <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 6-7</xref>)</bold>. Putative cancer genes<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> within differentially deleted regions and concordant down regulation at the mRNA level (FDR&#x0003c;10% both for DNA and mRNA) are highlighted in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref></bold> with the most significant gene being <italic>CYLD</italic> (verified by fluorescence in situ hybridization, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref></bold>). The <italic>CYLD</italic> gene, deleted in 51% of CRPC-NE samples, encodes cylindromatosis, a deubiquinating enzyme reported as a tumor suppressor involved in negative regulation of multiple signaling pathways including nuclear factor kB (NF-kB)<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, TGF-&#x003b2;<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and Notch<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. We found that genomic loss of <italic>CYLD</italic> is associated with decreased mRNA expression and a modest decrease in expression of AR signaling genes in this study as well as the CRPC SU2C/PCF cohort and in cell lines <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>)</bold>, suggesting that <italic>CYLD</italic> loss alone may be insufficient but might cooperate with other alterations to promote AR- indifference. Extending the computational framework of CLONET<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> to assess allele specific copy number clonality (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Notes</xref></bold>), we found both focal and broad copy-neutral or copy-aberrant loss of heterozygosity across our cohort <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>)</bold> including focal allelic imbalance of the <italic>DEK</italic> gene in CRPC-NE compared to CRPC-Adeno (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04, binomial test). <italic>DEK</italic> belongs to a class of DNA topology modulators; we and others recently described an oncogenic role in prostate cancer, including in CRPC-NE<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">In principle, several possible models could explain tumor evolution from a prostate adenocarcinoma to CRPC-NE <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>)</bold>. This process may rely on linear expansion of subclonal tumor cell populations originating from the primary tumor with sequential acquisition of genomic alterations (linear)<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Alternatively, independent subclones within the primary or metastasis could give rise to parallel and distinct resistant tumor populations (independent)<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Finally, there may be genetic diversification in the primary or in the metastatic lesion as a mechanism of adaptation leading to selective pressure and divergent clonal evolution (divergent). While prior studies had demonstrated concordance of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and other single gene alterations<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> between adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine foci in mixed tumors suggesting a common cell of origin, these complex patterns of genetic evolution have not been more rigorously evaluated. To address this and infer clonal expansion dynamics, we studied serial tumor samples from individual subjects during the course of their disease. Patient WCMC7520 underwent prostatectomy for clinically localized Gleason 9 prostate adenocarcinoma with local lymph node involvement treated initially with adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) followed by chemotherapy at the time of metastatic disease and castration resistance <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>)</bold>. 29 months after starting ADT, he developed CRPC-NE diagnosed by pelvic soft tissue biopsy. Primary, lymph node, and CRPC-NE metastases from two time-points were evaluated. Homozygous deletion of <italic>BRCA2</italic> and mutation of <italic>TP53</italic> were present in all sites suggesting a common ancestor, while DNA allele specific analysis highlighted diverse genomic states of other key genes such as <italic>MYCN</italic>
<bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>)</bold>. <italic>MYCN</italic>, which encodes the N-myc oncogene, has been previously described as oncogenic in CRPC-NE<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. When sites were compared, the patient's primary prostate harbored lesions that suggested divergent but clonal paths towards lymph node and both distant metastases. However, from these data we cannot definitively rule out metastasis&#x02013;to&#x02013;metastasis seeding as recently proposed as a mechanism of tumor progression<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Patient WCMC161 progressed after multiple lines of therapy for CRPC-Adeno including the development of new visceral metastases while on abiraterone and liver biopsy showing small cell carcinoma <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>)</bold>. Comparison of metastases from three different time points: CRPC-Adeno (adenocarcinoma, lymph node metastasis), CRPC-Adeno (adenocarcinoma, bone metastasis), and CRPC-NE (small cell carcinoma, liver metastasis at progression on abiraterone therapy) suggested divergent clonal evolution as exemplified by the allelic state of the aberrant gene <italic>SBDS (</italic><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>) supporting that the bone and liver metastases did not arise from the earlier lymph node. Phylogenetic trees from additional multi-tumor cases outlining disease evolution from adenocarcinoma to a neuroendocrine phenotype in individual patients are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref></bold>, which collectively rule against a parallel evolutionary model. Based on these temporal case series, the high degree of clonality in CRPC, and the overall similarity between CRPC-Adeno and CRPC-NE genomic profiles<bold>,</bold> the most parsimonious model that explains the data is divergent clonal evolution of metastatic CRPC towards either an AR-driven or AR-indifferent state <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref></bold>, model V<bold>)</bold>. In other words, CRPC-NE tumors appear clonal in origin with a clonal ancestry traceable back to a CRPC-Adeno precursor.</p><p id="P11">While informative, the observed DNA changes did not appear to fully explain the clinical aggressiveness of CRPC-NE. We therefore posited that this phenotype may also be mediated by epigenetic changes. Towards this end, we generated data to evaluate CpG-rich methylation genome wide by single cytosine resolution DNA methylation (eRRBS). In contrast to the largely similar genomic data, the CRPC-NE and CRPC-Adeno subtypes showed strong epigenetic segregation by unsupervised analysis using unselected methylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 8, Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). In addition, methylation of first exons and gene promoters was associated with significant changes in gene expression (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref></bold>). Overall, a greater fraction of concordant epigenetic and transcriptomic events were observed with increasing significance by differential expression analysis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref></bold>) and 22% of the top dysregulated transcripts in CRPC-NE demonstrated concordant changes in DNA methylation (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0002). This raised the possibility that the transition to, or advent of, the CRPC-NE subtype is associated with epigenetic dysregulation. In fact, the epigenetic signal identified three cases with clinical features of AR-independence that were binned as adenocarcinoma based on standard pathology but segregated with CRPC-NE on unsupervised analysis <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>)</bold>. All three of these patients demonstrated radiographic progression in the setting of a stable or low serum level of the androgen-regulated protein prostate specific antigen (PSA).

In a 100% pure tumor sample, the empirical distribution of the AFs within a genomic segment reflects the aggregated signal from multiple cell populations. If a segment <italic>S</italic> is copy number neutral and both alleles are represented, sequenced DNA fragments equally sample the reference and the alternative bases, i.e., the AF around 0.5. If a segment <italic>S</italic> represents a 100% clonal mono-allelic deletion, the AF is either 0 or 1 depending on which allele is lost. Combinations of diverse representations of the two alleles of a diploid genome and subclonality lead to AFs in between. Low DNA purity further dilutes the signal from the expected values. CLONET uses a variable <italic>beta</italic> that represents the disproportion in the AF of informative SNPs within a segment <italic>S; beta</italic> values can be computed from the empirical distribution of the AFs. Importantly, the beta value of a genomic segment is independent from its log2 ratio and the two measures can be used to infer the allele specific copy number and the clonality state of each segment of a tumor genome.

The gene set stems from the integration of differentially deleted/amplified and/or expressed and/or methylated genes in CRPC-NE and CRPC-Adeno. Specifically, 16 differentially deleted genes were selected among putative cancer genes<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> (see <bold>Differential copy number analysis</bold>). The following strategy was used to identify both differentially expressed genes that better distinguish CRPC-NE and CRPC-Adeno samples. We selected differentially expressed protein coding genes with FDR &#x02264; 1e-2, resulting in a total of 2425 genes, corresponding to 1301 over- and 1124 under-expressed. For each gene, we performed a Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) analysis using the normalized FPKMs as threshold parameter and calculated the Area Under the Curve (AUC). ROCs were built by considering only samples sequenced excluding two samples (7520 and 4240) that were previously published<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.leaving 34 CRPC-Adeno and 13 CRPC-NE. Only those differentially expressed genes with AUC &#x02265; 0.95 and with a fold-change greater than 2 or lower than 0.5 were included in the classifier, resulting in a list of 49 genes (25 over- and 24 under- expressed in CRPC-NE vs. CRPC-Adeno), 21 of which found as differentially methylated between CRPC-NE and CRPC-Adeno. Concordant information between RNA and Methylation was found for 11 genes (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 9</xref></bold>).
