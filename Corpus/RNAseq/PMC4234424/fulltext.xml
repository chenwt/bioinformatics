The high-coverage approach allowed us to analyze over 398 million reads, revealing that microbial communities are individual-specific and no bacterial species was detected as key player at any time during biofilm formation. We could identify some gene expression patterns characteristic for early and mature oral biofilms. The transcriptomic profile of several adhesion genes was confirmed through qPCR by measuring expression of fimbriae-associated genes. In addition to the specific set of gene functions overexpressed in early and mature oral biofilms, as detected through the short-reads dataset, the long-reads approach detected specific changes when comparing the metatranscriptome of the same individual before and after a meal, which can narrow down the list of organisms responsible for acid production and therefore potentially involved in dental caries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The bacteria changing activity during biofilm formation and after meal ingestion were person-specific.

One of these complex communities is that found in the human oral dental plaque (hereinafter, human oral biofilm). Although some studies, using NGS methods and 16S rRNA-based analysis, estimate that microbial diversity of the oral cavity is composed by thousands of species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], more recent data have limited these estimates to a few hundreds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Contrary to Koch's postulates, dental caries is not considered etiologically the outcome of a single-agent but is associated to an unbalance of microbial species that synergistically cause enamel demineralization by their acidogenic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Thus, characterizing the composition of whole bacterial communities that actively engage in biofilm formation and sugar fermentation after the ingestion of food is vital for understanding community dynamics under health and disease conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Although the set of species present in the human oral biofilm is almost fully depicted, new efforts have to be conducted to establish microbial agonistic or antagonistic associations, to distinguish actively-growing bacteria from inactive or transient species, as well as to outline the role of individual species during biofilm formation on tooth surfaces. The co-aggregation detected to occur between streptococci and <italic>Actinomyces</italic> species has been proposed to be a major promoter of human oral biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Like most biofilms, the dental plaque is built in a continued process characterized by succession of different bacterial species, each one with relevant roles in every step of biofilm construction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Formation of the oral biofilm could be dissected in three major stages, namely: i) attachment; ii) colonization; and iii) biofilm development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, species participating of the entire process are traditionally characterized as &#x0201c;early&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;late&#x0201d; colonizers, where early colonizers would be responsible of the two first stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Among early colonizers the viridans streptococci group is considered as a cornerstone of the oral biofilm puzzle given its ability to bind saliva proteins through Antigens I and II. In this manner, streptococci species become the first colonizers able to bind tooth surfaces and promoting arrival of secondary colonizers by intergeneric coaggregation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). <italic>Actinomyces naeslundii</italic> is one of the secondary colonizers and a well known coaggregation partner of streptococci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> is considered a key player given its capability to coaggregate both with early and late colonizers of the oral biofilm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the latter group characterized by species belonging to Bacteroidetes and Spirochaetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is noteworthy to highlight that intergeneric coaggregation not only contributes to bacterial growth and colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], but it is thought to facilitate the genetic and metabolic exchange among species, and even to create the adequate environment for arrival of some obligate anaerobic bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Therefore, any disruption in the development of the oral biofilm caused by impairing of early colonizers tooth attachment or inability to recruit other key players during biofilm formation, would affect the entire process avoiding presence of pathogens responsible for periodontal disease or caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Although few attempts to link specific gene expression profiles in oral bacteria with the establishment and maturation of oral biofilm have been done [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], further studies are needed to understand global gene dynamics and intracellular signalling which are the basis for cell-to-cell communication among oral bacteria and to promote biofilm formation on tooth surfaces. There are important limitations to study gene expression from <italic>in vivo</italic> oral samples, including RNA instability and amounts of sampling material, but a sequencing approach of total cDNA from an <italic>in vitro</italic> oral biofilm model has recently been performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Because gene transcripts typically occupy a small fraction of total bacterial RNA, even after mRNA-enriching protocols, a massive coverage is normally required to quantify gene expression by RNAseq technologies. On the other hand, high-coverage sequencing technologies are normally coupled to short read lengths, which jeopardize accurate taxonomic assignment of the sequences. The latter can be achieved through the use of longer reads, at the expense of a lower coverage of mRNA transcripts. In the present manuscript we present the first metatranscriptome analysis of <italic>in vivo</italic> human oral biofilm samples through two approaches: A short read-length, high coverage Illumina&#x000ae; approach to study oral biofilm formation through time, and a long read-length, lower coverage pyrosequencing strategy to study changes in community composition before and after a meal. For the first approach, a total of 16 samples of supragingival plaque from 4 healthy individuals were collected at four different time points (6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after a professional ultrasound cleaning) to disclose the microbiota and gene expression dynamics during oral biofilm formation. For the second experiment, the metatranscriptome of dental plaque from five individuals was studied 30 minutes before and after a controlled meal, in order to characterize the potential shifts in the active bacterial community when dietary nutrients are available for growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results &#x00026; discussion</title><sec><title>Metagenome vs metatranscriptome</title><p>A preliminary test was performed by direct pyrosequencing of DNA (sequence data obtained from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]) and cDNA from a 24-hour dental plaque sample from the same individual (NoCa1). The results show a very different pattern of bacterial genera in the metagenome and the metatranscriptome (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). <italic>Actinomyces</italic>, <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> and <italic>Neisseria</italic> were the three most abundant genera in the RNA-based community whereas <italic>Veillonella</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Leptotrichia</italic> were the most commonly found in the total DNA-based metagenome. In addition, a long tail of low-proportion genera is observed in the metagenome but absent in the metatranscriptome, suggesting they could correspond to transient or inactive bacteria. This shows the importance of obtaining both kind of data to understand the composition and dynamics of human-associated microbial populations.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Total (DNA-based) and active (RNA-based) microbiota composition in the human oral biofilm from individual NoCa-01.</bold> Microbial diversity is inferred from 16S rDNA and 16S cDNA taxonomic assignment, respectively, from reads obtained by direct pyrosequencing of the DNA and cDNA of a 24 h dental plaque sample.

An average of 38.9% corresponded to SSU rRNA sequences, 59.9% to LSU rRNA and 1.2% to other sequences, including mRNA.

A different bacterial composition was found for each individual. In some cases, over 80% of active bacteria corresponded to only three genera (for instance <italic>Actinomyces</italic>, <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> and <italic>Rothia</italic> for individuals NoCa1 and Ca2) whereas other individuals did not show any dominant genera in their active microbial community (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S3). Some individuals were very resilient to changes after the meal (e.g. individual NoCa1), whereas others had more apparent changes in the proportions of some bacteria, but no specific pattern was common to all individuals (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Figure S2). Thus, the changes in active bacteria after a meal were not universal and depended on the original microbial population associated to each human host.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Meal-uptake-dependent active microbiota and association with health and disease.

Potential errors in taxonomic assignment were minimized by 1) assigning reads at the family and genus taxonomic level only; 2) selecting matches against 16S rRNA database of 100% sequence identity; and 3) eliminating hits to conserved regions of the 16S rRNA gene, keeping only hypervariable, informative regions.</p><p>When we tried to compare samples according to maturation time we found that samples from early biofilm (6 and 12 h) showed significantly (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.0118) less genera than samples from mature biofilm (24 and 48 h). In average, 171 genera were found at a frequency above 0.01%, accounting for 99.4% of the global diversity. The 40 most predominant genera found in all analyzed samples are depicted in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. These 40 genera account for 68% of gene expression according to their frequency in the metatranscriptomic reads. The heat-map in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows the genus-level clustering according to frequency within each sample. Among predominant genera we could observe <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (found at relative abundances between 12 to 19% in different samples) and <italic>Actinomyces</italic> (in a range of 3-12%), both being well known partners for coaggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Interestingly, <italic>Actinomyces</italic> showed higher frequencies in early biofilm samples, in agreement with its known role as early colonizer.

Consequently, we could detect no clear association between bacterial composition and biofilm development stage. These results would globally fit within the concept that individual-specific microbial communities are a consequence of host-bacterial co-evolution to maintain host health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Consequently, the host-specific microbiota could be considered as a genetic fingerprint almost unique for every person ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and references therein), and even preserved throughout the years in a very stable fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Clustering of oral biofilm samples according to the estimated microbial diversity.</bold> Log2 transformed frequencies of top 40 genera found in the dental plaque metatranscriptome through time are shown.

In order to detect monotonic functions associated to genera frequency fluctuation through time, we calculated the Spearman's rho parameter (<italic>&#x003c1;</italic>) for the top 40 more predominant genera listed in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> for all patients. Thus, we could obtain a map of significant positive and negative correlations that can indicate either pairwise interactions between genera or adaptation to similar environmental conditions (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). Interestingly, most genera belonging to the same phylum showed positive correlations. In this way, Actinobacteria members (<italic>&#x003c1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7346 in average) appeared to show the same growth pattern during biofilm formation as well as Fusobacteria and Bacteroidetes (<italic>&#x003c1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7833 and 0.7450 on average, respectively). In contrast, genera assigned to Proteobacteria and Firmicutes showed lower correlation values (<italic>&#x003c1;</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.34) because some species within these groups had different patterns of occurrence.

A quasi-mirror distribution is observed between these two genera suggesting that arrival and/or growth of <italic>Actinomyces</italic> could be outcompeted by <italic>Aggregatibacter</italic> presence in biofilm. In contrast, a multiple positive correlation is exemplified by the distribution of <italic>Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas</italic> and <italic>Leptotrichia</italic> (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B, right panel) in full agreement with the coaggregation partners established for <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> and the classical view of species succession during oral biofilm formation and the establishment of late colonizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Indeed, Fusobacteria species seem to have the same distribution pattern than Bacteroidetes given the multiple significant positive correlations observed among their genera (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). The presence of potential periodontal pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] in these multiple correlation patterns could be indicative of their synergy for arrival to the oral biofilm and probably for development of periodontal disease.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Positive and negative interactions in the oral biofilm active microbiota.

Translation functions were also overrepresented because several ribosome proteins showed higher expression during early biofilm as well as the Elongation Factors Tu (EF-Tu, K02358) and G (EF-G, K02355). Central role of Translation in early steps of oral biofilm formation was also evidenced by over-expression of K00566 category corresponding to the MnmA tRNA-modifying protein. MnmA is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme and incorporates the posttranscriptional modification s<sup>2</sup>U at the wobble position of several tRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] which reads A/G ending codons during translation. The tRNA modifications are largely associated to control the fine-tuning of protein synthesis, thus improving ribosome accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. As a consequence, they appear to be involved in controlling a wide range of bacterial phenotypic traits including biofilm formation by multi-drug resistant human pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and could be important for oral biofilm formation as well. Our results are in agreement with previous reports where amino acid metabolism is critical for growth of early colonizers such as <italic>Streptococcus gordonii,</italic> which needs coaggregation to stabilize expression of genes involved in amino acid synthesis and membrane transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Over-expression in mature biofilm</title><p>On the other hand, genes over-expressed at the late biofilm stage had a more variable functional profile. New functional categories over-expressed in late oral biofilms included the ABC transporters, the Cell motility represented by the orthology groups K03407 associated to bacterial chemotaxis, K02676 and K02390 involved in pilus and flagella assembly, respectively, and finally genes involved in Base Excision Repair, Mismatch Repair, and Homologous Recombination systems; and some putative transposases. The group of tRNA-modifying enzymes was also present in late oral biofilm with a larger set of genes over-expressed such as <italic>mnmC</italic>, <italic>yfiC, cmoA, tadA, queE</italic>, <italic>trmK</italic>, and the hydrouridine synthase gene <italic>dusC.</italic> Consequently, this molecular pathway seems to be involved in controlling the expression of proteins along the full oral biofilm process. Strikingly, a set of genes involved in competition between bacterial species also showed over-expression during this late stage of oral biofilm formation. The <italic>comFC, comFA, comGB, comGC,</italic> and <italic>comGA</italic> orthology groups are members of the Type II secretion system of which other members appear to be annotated as Competence-related DNA transformation transporters. These genes have been reported to be involved in quorum sensing response to produce mutacins; these are non-lantibiotic bacteriocins able to induce lysis and consequently DNA liberation in related species possibly supporting DNA horizontal transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Likewise, <italic>tfoX</italic> orthologues were also found to be over-expressed in late oral biofilm, thus strengthening the idea of natural genetic transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] occurring among close species in the mature oral biofilm. Globally, over-expression of these competence-related genes, permitting DNA transformations <italic>in vivo,</italic> could support the specific low ratio between functional diversity of genes and operational taxonomic units detected in supragingival plaque, thus indicating high functional redundancy and microbial population homogenization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Other important functional categories over-expressed in late oral biofilm included those involved in Environmental Information Processing and membrane transporters, such as those belonging to the Phosphotransferase System (PTS) as well as MFS membrane receptors specialized in the importing/exporting of small molecules. Both major families of membrane transporters were found to be preferentially expressed from <italic>Actinomyces</italic> species indicating a high level of metabolic exchange between this genus and its environment. However, subfamilies such a <italic>salX</italic>-like ABC transporters associated to bacteriocin export and defense were detected to be predominantly active in streptococci species. Over-expression of some KEGG orthology categories belonging to Two-Component family of proteins indicate an active role of cells in perceiving external signals of nutrient availability in the environment. An over-expression was found of the PTS-Ntr-EIIA enzyme and the GlnB protein, both involved in nitrogen regulation, and the sigma factor 54 of the RNA polymerase involved in expression of genes for nitrogen metabolism. Therefore, processes related to nitrogen uptake/metabolism appear to be very relevant in the mature stage of oral biofilm probably indicating that nitrogen is a limiting factor for oral biofilm progression. In recent studies of cDNA massive sequencing from an <italic>in vitro</italic> five-species oral biofilm microbial community, similar results were obtained in terms of overrepresented functions in mature biofilms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Finally, <italic>luxS</italic> homologue in <italic>Neisseria</italic> spp. was found to be significantly over-expressed in early biofilm. The <italic>luxS</italic> genes are responsible of Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) synthesis, a molecule considered as a major interspecies signal for cell-cell communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Evidence for AI-2 role to control biofilm formation was previously observed when a <italic>luxS</italic> null strain of <italic>S. gordonii</italic> was unable to form a mixed-species biofilm with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Gene expression by qPCR</title><p>We selected adhesion genes involved in cell-to-matrix and cell-to-cell interactions to corroborate by qPCR the expression pattern inferred from Illumina sequencing. Among the adhesins we could find several molecules such as SspA and SspB proteins from <italic>S. gordonii</italic> and homologues present in several species of <italic>Streptococcus,</italic> all being very relevant for attachment to tooth surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Type 1 and Type 2 Fimbriae molecules found in <italic>Actinomyces</italic> species are described to mediate coaggregation with streptococci species.

The Illumina- and qPCR-derived expression patterns during the oral biofilm formation for <italic>fimA</italic> and <italic>srtA</italic> homologue from <italic>A. naeslundii</italic> are showed in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A. qPCR data showed that these two genes had similar expression patterns, thus suggesting a co-expression pattern and quite probably dependent on their clustered localization in the <italic>Actinomyces naeslundii</italic> chromosome. We found that expression patterns were similar at all time points of oral biofilm formation from all patients with high correlation coefficients. In addition to the high degree of correlation between Illumina and qPCR expression data, all expression patterns of these genes present a common feature, namely a high level of expression at very early stage of oral biofilm formation and then decaying in a slight or noticeable manner. Once we showed gene expression dynamics of adhesins from <italic>A. naeslundii</italic> and <italic>S. gordonii</italic> during oral biofilm formation, we observed our data is in agreement with other <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis performed by immunodetection of surface molecules by fluorescence labelling and co-localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. SspA protein is involved in attachment of <italic>Streptococcus gordonii</italic> to the tooth surface by recognizing salivary agglutinins and it also mediates interaction with <italic>Actinomyces</italic> sp<italic>.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The expression profile from <italic>sspA</italic> from <italic>S. gordonii</italic> is presented in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B (top panel). The correlation coefficient between qPCR and Illumina data is&#x02009;~&#x02009;0.91. Its expression pattern is similar to that found for Type 2 Fimbriae genes from <italic>A. naeslundii</italic>, which is in agreement with the role of streptococci as first colonizers and the requirement of SspA for attaching to the tooth surface and promote arrival of other early colonizers such as <italic>Actinomyces</italic> sp<italic>.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Finally, we studied the expression patterns of <italic>cshA</italic> and <italic>cshB</italic> genes coding for two cell surface antigens in <italic>S. gordonii</italic> that increase hydrophobicity of cell surface and mediate interactions with <italic>A. naeslundii</italic> and human fibronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Expression profiles for <italic>cshA</italic> and <italic>cshB</italic> obtained by qPCR (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B) are fairly similar to that observed for <italic>sspA</italic> gene and correlation with Illumina sequencing data is notable, at least for <italic>cshA</italic>. Expression patterns of different adhesion proteins analyzed showed a similar pattern, with higher expression in very early stages of oral biofilm. In addition, most of the adhesion genes studied here showed an increased level of expression at the end point of study (48 h). We hypothesize that such level of expression would reflect the last stage of the biofilm cycle where biofilm detachment occurs, thus releasing bacterial cells to colonize new niches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Gene expression comparison between Illumina sequencing and qPCR during biofilm formation.

We could follow oral biofilm formation and determine proportions of active microbiota through time, including before and after a carbohydrate-rich meal, when the process of acid production, responsible of enamel demineralization, takes place. We present a large set of correlations among bacterial groups and genera being in agreement with biological and classical interactions reported to be central for biofilm installation and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In the functional exploration of genes expressed during human oral biofilm formation, we present a quantitative analysis, further supported by results obtained by qPCR, demonstrating several functional categories of prevalence at different oral biofilm stages. Among them we showed that translation machinery is predominantly expressed in early biofilm stages whereas more specialized genes are required in mature biofilm. Some genes involved in competence, and reported to be involved in quorum sensing response and functionally related to mutacin production and DNA uptake, were over-expressed in late biofilm supporting the intricate level of cell-to-cell interactions in mature biofilm and suggesting strong competition for colonization. More than 70% of the genetic information compiled from this oral metatranscriptome has no functional assignment; therefore, further efforts must be conducted for classification and characterization of genes and their involvement in biofilm development and/or cell-to-cell communication. From an applied point of view, the identification of active bacterial species after food uptake can be considered a first step to narrow down the list of potential etiological agents of dental caries from the large set of micro-organisms found in the metagenome of dental plaque and cavities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The striking homeostasis found in one of the individuals who had never suffered from dental caries, and where virtually no changes were found in the active microbiota before and after a meal, could indicate that the microbiota of some individuals is not affected by food ingestion, potentially reducing the risk of acidic pH and promoting dental health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sample collection and RNA processing</title><p>The sampling procedure was approved by the Ethical Committee for Clinical Research from the DGSP-CSISP (Valencian Health Authority, Spain) and all donors signed an informed consent. The oral health status of each individual was evaluated before sampling and following recommendations and nomenclature from the WHO. Donors were 20-30 years of age, had all 28 teeth present (excluding third molars) had not suffered from any systemic disease and had not taken systemic antimicrobials in the previous 6 months. Dental plaque samples were taken with autoclaved spoon excavators from vestibular and lingual surfaces of teeth excluding a 1 mm region on the edges.</p><p>For the biofilm formation experiments, 16 supragingival dental plaque samples were obtained from 4 caries-free volunteers (DMFT&#x02009;=&#x02009;0 [decayed, Missing, Filling Teeth], OHI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1 [oral Hygiene Index]. GI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1 [gingival Index]). The volunteers were subjected to professional teeth ultrasound cleaning. Oral biofilm (supragingival plaque) from all teeth surfaces was pooled and collected from each volunteer at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h of biofilm formation. After every sampling a professional brushing was performed to reset biofilm formation for next sampling. Total RNA was extracted using the MasterPure<sup>TM</sup> RNA Purification Kit (Epicentre&#x000ae;). Samples were collected and processed for elimination of 5S rRNA and tRNAs through ion exchange chromatography with KCl gradient in Nucleobond AX 20 columns (Macherey-Nagel). Pre- and post-processed RNA were loaded in RNA chip (Agilent Technologies) and analyzed for integrity using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). The first strand of cDNA from processed RNA was synthesized using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). For this aim, two cDNA reactions were prepared for each RNA sample and modifying some manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions to obtain best performance during synthesis. Specifically, each cDNA reaction had 100U of Multiscribe Reverse transcriptase and synthesis was completed at 48&#x000b0;C during 210 min using 5-10 ug of RNA as template. Doubled stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) was achieved in 100 uL of reaction containing 35U <italic>E.coli</italic> DNA Polymerase I (New England Biolabs), 5U <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs), 5U RNase H (Epicentre&#x000ae;), 300 uM dNTP's, and two reactions of first strand cDNA synthesis. The ds-cDNA synthesis was initiated by incubation during 150 min at 16&#x000b0;C and completed by adding 4.5U of T4 DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs), and 1X BSA (New England Biolabs) followed by incubation during additional 30 min at 16&#x000b0;C. Purified ds-cDNAs were obtained using High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche&#x000ae;) and sent to GATC Biotech AG (Konstanz, Germany) for parallel single-end sequencing using HiSeq2000 system (Illumina&#x000ae;).</p><p>The five donors for the before/after meal transcriptome were asked not to brush their teeth for 16 hours.

All donors ingested the same meal, whose nutritional characteristics are indicated in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Table S1. Supragingival dental plaque was obtained from the right maxillary and left mandibular quadrant free teeth surfaces for the sample 30 minutes before eating and from the left maxillary and right mandibular quadrant 30 minutes after food intake, without touching caries lesions, if they were present. Opposite quadrants were sampled because, when analysing PCR-amplified 16S rRNA from cDNA, an equivalence in terms of taxonomic composition was found when sampling opposite mandibular and maxillary quadrants (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>: Figure S3). The obtained total ds-cDNA (as described above) was purified and enriched in fragments longer than 400 bp using AMPure beads (Agencourt).

For the high-coverage biofilm samples, microbial diversity was established by taxonomic assignment using reads matching 16S rRNA sequences. For this aim we constructed a RDP-based (Release 10, Update 29) database containing almost 10,000 reference sequences of 16S rDNA annotated according to NCBI taxonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].

Then, using MegaBlast v2.2.21 algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and selecting alignments for 48 nt in length and 100% identity we could assign taxonomy at genus level using only hypervariable regions of 16S rDNA sequences, thus determining predominant microbiota. Heat maps of taxonomic composition were generated using the gplots library of R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], frequencies were log<sub>2</sub> transformed and clustered with Euclidean distance. In the case of samples before/after a meal, microbial diversity was established using the 16S and 23S rRNA gene. 16S and 23S sequences were binned using META-RNA 1.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. 16S sequences were assigned using the online RDP assigner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. 23S sequences were assigned using the SILVA database and SINA assigner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. All statistical analyses were conducted on R v2.15. Non-parametric Spearman rank correlation was calculated among top 40 most frequent genera to associate frequency fluctuations during biofilm formation between genera.
