Understanding their origin and evolution requires knowledge about the phylogenetic relationships from both source and recipient organisms. We used RNASeq data and respective assembled transcript libraries to trace the evolutionary history of polygalacturonase (pectinase) genes in stick insects (Phasmatodea). By mapping the distribution of pectinase genes on a Polyneoptera phylogeny, we identified the transfer of pectinase genes from known phasmatodean gut microbes into the genome of an early euphasmatodean ancestor that took place between 60 and 100 million years ago. This transfer preceded the rapid diversification of the suborder, enabling symbiont-free pectinase production that would increase the insects&#x02019; digestive efficiency and reduce dependence on microbes. Bacteria-to-insect gene transfer was thought to be uncommon, however the increasing availability of large-scale genomic data may change this prevailing notion.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Herbivores depend on plant cell wall degrading enzymes, such as cellulases and pectinases, to break down ingested matter.

While pectinase enzymes [endo- and exo-polygalacturonases] appear to rarely occur in animals, fungal and bacterial pectinase genes have been found as part of the genome of leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) and weevils (Curculionidae), suggesting horizontal gene transfer events.

This confirms that these pectinases and their eukaryote-specific signal peptides are endogenously transcribed by the insects and do not represent microbial contamination. This fact is further corroborated by their presence in multiple species reared on different diets and the fact that the phasmatodean digestive tract is unsuited for microbial fermentation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Additionally, the reproductive physiology and behavior of Phasmatodea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> preclude vertical transmission of obligate symbionts due to the absence of egg-smearing, coprophagy, or adult-nymph trophyllaxis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and both culturing and metagenomics assays have demonstrated an absence of symbiotic microbes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, it was assumed that these genes were acquired via horizontal gene transfer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, but definite evidence for this hypothesis was lacking and unanswered associated questions remained: What was the source of these genes? What was/is its ecological relationship to Phasmatodea? What are these enzymes&#x02019; activities? How did this gene family evolve after the transfer? Additionally, the timing of this putative horizontal gene transfer is undetermined. This is largely due to the paucity of molecular data for Phasmatodea&#x02014;including the suborder Timematodea, which is the sister group of all remaining stick and leaf insects or Euphasmatodea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02014;and for closely related insect orders such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), webspinners (Embioptera), or roaches (Blattodea)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p><p>Identifying a horizontal gene transfer requires data from the source and the recipient and/or its descendants. Additionally, outgroup taxa are needed to ensure the absence of the target gene, to determine that the horizontal gene transfer occurred within the group of interest or its common ancestor. Therefore, such findings are limited by the diversity of published sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. To address the questions outlined above, we combined biochemical analyses of these individual phasmatodean enzymes along with identification of these molecules within potential, microbial sources and potential insect hosts. To this end, we used assembled RNASeq data of phasmatodean and other polyneopteran insects sampled by the 1KITE consortium, (1K Insect Transcriptome Evolution Project, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.1kite.org">http://www.1kite.org</ext-link>).</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Activity of Individual Phasmatodea Pectinases</title><p>Gut extracts from all six species with published transcriptomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> could degrade citrus pectin and polygalacturonic acid (PGA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). From these six species we obtained full length ORFs for 93 pectinase enzymes, including some pectinase genes the original six transcriptomes missed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>).

Enzyme activity as tested with thin layer chromatography (TLC) (Figures S2&#x02013;S6) and agarose diffusion assays (Figures S7 and S8) mostly correlated with the gene clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>): enzymes with the same activity profiles formed monophyletic clades, such that the activity of an enzyme could be predicted by its position in the tree. Several enzymes could degrade citrus pectin and/or PGA to dimers and bigger oligomers, meaning they are endo-active polygalacturonases. Most enzymes in one monophyletic group could degrade PGA and the oligomers into galacturonic acid. This implies that they are exo-active enzymes. Enzymes in this clade were also active on xylogalacturonan. Other enzymes showed no detectable activity on any substrate, including enzymes known to be highly expressed such as PSC3, which is the most highly expressed pectinase and 10<sup>th</sup> most highly expressed enzyme in the <italic>Peruphasma schultei</italic> anterior midgut<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Evidence for Horizontal Gene Transfer</title><p>The Bayesian analysis for insect, nematode, and microbial GH28 pectinases converged after 300,000 generations with an average standard deviation of split frequencies of 0.014.

It was long assumed that any enzymes not provided by symbionts are ancestral in insects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. This had been confirmed for GH9 cellulase, which is endogenously produced in various insect lineages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> including Phasmatodea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and has even been hypothesized to be ancestral to all Metazoa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In contrast, endogenous pectinase genes are only found in a few, distantly related insect lineages such as several groups of beetles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, leafhoppers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, aphids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, and phasmids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In the present study, we identified, isolated, and successfully expressed multiple, endogenous, phasmatodean pectinase genes. They are found in representatives of all major phasmatodean lineages with the exception of Timematodea, which is the sister group to Euphasmatodea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The pectinase genes are also absent in closely related groups such as grasshoppers, termites, and roaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>; for a detailed discussion of the phylogeny of this lineage, see Beutel <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). The presence of endogenous pectinase is thus an evolutionary novelty for Euphasmatodea (i.e. all phasmids except Timematodea). Based on this finding and the fact that the most similar homologues to the phasmatodean pectinase genes are found in gamma-proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), we conclude that the phasmatodean genes have been acquired from bacteria by horizontal gene transfer. A similar origin was assumed in beetles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> and nematodes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. However, our analysis indicates that phasmatodean pectinase genes are not closely related to those found in beetles or nematodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). This implies several independent horizontal transfers for these genes in insects and in Ecdysozoa. Gamma-proteobacteria are the predominant microbes in the phasmatodean digestive tract<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, which could suggest a symbiotic relationship, except that representatives of this group such as <italic>Enterobacter</italic> were also isolated from the rearing environment of Phasmatodea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and were most likely transients obtained with the food. We therefore cannot clarify whether the genes identified in Euphasmatodea had been acquired from true symbionts or from microbes that occasionally occurred in the ancestral euphasmatodean digestive system. The alternative scenario, that all ecdysozoan or insect pectinase genes were inherited from a common ancestor and have been lost or are unexpressed in all other clades, is considerably less parsimonious. Furthermore, this alternative hypothesis would imply monophyly of ecdysozoan pectinases, which is not the case as they form at least three distinct clusters interspersed by bacterial homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>The phylogeny of the euphasmatodean pectinase genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>) suggests that originally only one or two genes or gene copies were transferred from bacteria. Prior to a later diversification of Euphasmatodea, these genes underwent further duplication and subfunctionalization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Some copies retained the ancestral endo- and/or exo-acting activities, respectively capable of breaking down the polymers or smaller oligomers of galacturonic acid. Other gene copies most likely lost the ancestral pectinolytic functions, since we did not observe any activity on the substrates tested. Nevertheless, the high expression levels for these enzymes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> suggests they still have a (yet unknown) function. All active enzymes examined retained their canonical active sites, which are common to polygalacturonases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Moreover, some inactive enzymes also retained active sites, so their inability to degrade the substrates provided remains to be explored (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>). For example, surrounding amino acid substitutions may modify the structure of the protein and prevent the active sites from being accessible to the substrate.</p><p>Phasmid pectinase enzyme activities were susceptible to the degree of methylation of the polygalacturonic acid substrate, raising the question of whether or not some need a pectin methylesterase enzyme (PME) to efficiently break down pectin. Bacterial pectinases in particular cannot degrade highly methylated pectins and depend on synergistic PME activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, so finding these patterns in horizontally acquired pectinases in Phasmatodea is logical. However, a search for transcripts homologous to known PMEs (GenBank Accession No&#x02019;s: AAM39440.1, ADO57389.1, AAK81304.1, AEE33008.1) was negative for all phasmatodean lineages. The same was observed for nematodes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The possibility remains in Phasmatodea that other genes, perhaps even some of the otherwise inactive pectinases, have developed PME activity as a neofunctionalization. Alternatively, either symbiotic microbes in the phasmatodean gut are producing PMEs or the ingested plants&#x02019; own PMEs are still active in the stick insect gut. These hypotheses are presently being tested.</p><p>Timematodea contain only a single genus, <italic>Timema</italic>, with 21 described species found in the western United States<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Euphasmatodea split from Timematodea, which lack pectinase genes, between 125 (&#x000b1;60) and 103 (&#x000b1;19) million years ago<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The more than 3,000 described euphasmatodean species started to rapidly diversify from a common ancestor around 61 (&#x000b1;14) million years ago<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Thus, the horizontal gene transfer most likely took place within this range of ~40 million years between the split of Phasmatodea and the diversification of Euphasmatodea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). It remains an intriguing question whether the acquisition of endogenous pectinase genes may have influenced or even enabled this strong and rapid diversification of Euphasmatodea. This hypothesis was also proposed by Kirsch <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, who assumed that the acquisition of pectinase genes was a key event in the evolution of various herbivorous beetle groups. The alternative hypothesis&#x02014;that the pectinase transfer occurred in an ancestor of all Phasmatodea and was subsequently lost in Timematodea&#x02014;is less parsimonious but otherwise cannot be ruled out.</p><p>It is noteworthy that all insect clades for which pectinases have been identified are associated with a strictly plant-based diet. In sucking insects such as aphids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and leafhoppers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, pectinases enzymes are involved in plant penetration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> and softening of the plant before oviposition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Chewing insects like beetles and most likely phasmids use the enzymes for digestion of ingested plant matter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.

These GH28 sequences were aligned using MAFFT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> with the L-INS-i option optimized for alignment of protein sequences with one conserved domain and allowing for long gaps whenever necessary. The alignment was pruned using trimAL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> to remove all positions containing more than 70% of gaps. The pruned alignment was used to infer gene trees with both, Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods. For the Bayesian tree we used MrBayes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> 3.2.6 with an estimated gamma distribution among site rate variation (ASRV), along with a mixture of evolutionary models. A total of 300,000 generations were performed on 8 Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC). We discarded a burn-in of 25% of sampled generations for inference of a consensus tree and calculation of posterior probabilities. The ML phylogeny was obtained using RAxML<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> 8.1.24 using the automated selection (AUTO) of the best fitting evolutionary model and an estimated gamma distribution of ASRV. The autoMRE option (default 0.03) was used to automatically conduct bootstopping, indicating that enough bootstrap replicates had been sampled to obtain bootstrap value convergence among the tree topologies. In both cases, the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> GH28 sequence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> was used as outgroup to root the trees.
