Serum triglyceride (TG) levels have been implicated as a well known risk factor for CHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying common variants and candidate genes influencing serum TG levels. A recent metaGWAS found, however, that the sum of their observed variants only explains 9.6% of the variation in TG levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], leaving a large portion of predicted genetic heritability of TGs (35%-48%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] undiscovered. Additionally, GWAS often have association signals spanning many genes, which results in several potential gene candidates that cannot be narrowed down using GWAS alone. The Mexican population has a high risk of dyslipidemia, with 31.5% of the population suffering from hypertriglyceridemia (TGs&#x0003e;1.7 mmol/l) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Additionally, no genome-wide transcriptome analysis for lipids to date has been performed in Mexicans. Thus, exploring adipose tissue gene co-expression networks in Mexicans is necessary to better understand lipid regulation in this underinvestigated population. The Finnish population represents a genetically relatively homogeneous population which may help reduce genetic heterogeneity in the statistical analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Adipose tissue is a key player in CHD progression through influencing systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and serum TG levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In this study, we investigated whether serum fasting TG levels are related to adipose co-expression networks in human. Although synthesis of TGs occurs not only in adipose tissue but also in other tissues such as liver, hydrolysis of TGs, lipolysis, occurs predominantly in adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. During fasting, adipose tissue hydrolyzes stored TGs and releases glycerol and fatty acids into the bloodstream. Previous studies have shown that excess TG hydrolysis in adipose tissue is associated with insulin resistance and can cause ectopic TG storage and high serum fatty acid levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Another relevant tissue for lipid metabolism is liver. However, obtaining liver biopsies from living study subjects for research purposes is complicated by the risks related to the procedure, making the adipose tissue a more accessible tissue than liver in humans. Previous studies have analyzed gene expression data from subcutaneous adipose tissue to search for genes involved in one of adipose tissue&#x02019;s several functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior study has focused on discovering underlying lipid co-expression networks in adipose tissue shared across multiple populations. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) is a well-established tool that identifies novel gene co-expression networks and searches for associations between a network and a phenotypic trait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Determining novel genes and adipose networks correlated with serum TG levels consistently across populations helps lay the foundation for future functional studies to uncover the underlying mechanisms. We hypothesized that searching for TG-associated adipose networks preserved across populations may reveal novel genes involved in TG regulation. Comparing TG-associated gene expression networks from WGCNA in three independent sets of samples from adipose tissue of two different populations is a unique approach to discovering novel TG genes. The fact that the genes we discovered were members of TG modules in all three independent sets of samples and replicated across two populations provides strong evidence that the TG genes identified are genuine signals of biological importance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)</title><p>To search for novel gene co-expression networks involved in adipose TG regulation, we performed a gene co-expression network analysis using WGCNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] in 53 adipose RNAs from Finnish twins. The clinical characteristics of the twin study sample, including mean lipid values are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. To correct for the relatedness of the monozygotic twins, gene expression values were corrected for kinship (see methods). WGCNA identifies gene co-expression networks (modules), summarizing the main patterns of variation. Modules can be related to traits and sequence variants. The first principal component represents the summary of the module and is referred to as the module eigengene (ME) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. ME is the average module expression value for an individual. Relating MEs instead of genes to a clinical trait is a major advantage of WGCNA as it diminishes the multiple testing from thousands of transcripts to the number of modules. Thus, instead of testing correlation between every transcript and a trait, we only test the correlation between the ME value and the trait. We used two key metabolic traits to search for module-trait correlations in human adipose tissue: serum TGs and BMI. The two traits were tested as quantitative traits (by adjusting and not adjusting for covariates, see methods). We observed seven modules in the Finnish twins of which the blue module was positively correlated with serum TGs (<italic>P</italic>=5x10<sup>-4</sup>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), indicating that TGs are higher in individuals with high ME values. The adjusted TG levels provided similar results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows that the most significant TG modules were also implicated for BMI. It is worth noting that in WGCNA the grey module always represents background genes outside of modules, i.e. genes that cannot be clustered into one of the modules are assigned to the grey module. Thus, the grey module may contain genes that are associated with TGs but are not part of a WGCNA module.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Finnish twin WGCNA results indicate that the blue module is associated with serum TG levels.</bold> Each row represents a module (labeled by color), and each column represents a trait. The value at the top of each square represents the correlation coefficient between the module eigengene and the trait with the correlation p-value in parentheses. The red color represents a positive correlation between the module eigengene and trait, and the green color represents a negative correlation. The number of gene expression probes present in each module and the percent of probes correlated with TGs (p&#x0003c;0.05, Pearson correlation) are listed in parenthesis next to the module color. To prevent potential confounding factors influencing expression values, gene expression values were corrected for age, sex, and twin relatedness using the Microarray Quality Control Pipeline as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. TG values were log transformed and corrected for age, sex, disconcordant BMI status, and BMI using stepwise linear regression. BMI values were corrected for age, sex, disconcordant BMI status, and TG using stepwise linear regression. Genes that could not be clustered into one of the modules were assigned to the grey module, thus grey denotes background genes outside of modules. The blue module associated with TGs passed the Bonferroni correction for the 16 statistical tests performed (8 modules, 2 traits); the Bonferroni p-value cut-off = 3.1 x 10<sup>-3</sup>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1755-8794-5-61-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>WGCNA TG modules preserved across populations</title><p>To test whether the TG-associated co-expression networks observed in a European origin population can be replicated in another population, we investigated whether the Finnish twin TG module is preserved in 70 Mexican TG case/control fat biopsy samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The clinical characteristics of the Mexican study sample, including mean lipid values are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. Mexican population represents an admixed population of European, Amerindian and African origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> illustrates that the Finnish twin TG module is highly preserved in the Mexicans (Z score ~ 30). A preservation Z score &#x0003e;10 is considered significant preservation (see methods). Furthermore, the entire structure of adipose gene expression networks observed in the Finns was preserved in Mexicans, as all Finnish network modules had Z scores&#x0003e;10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Given the observed significant module preservation between the Finns and Mexicans, we hypothesized that many of the genes detected in the Finnish TG network module could be replicated in Mexicans. In the WGCNA analysis of the Mexican TG case/control samples, we found eight modules of which the yellow module was significantly associated with serum TGs (<italic>P</italic>=1.0 x 10<sup>-4</sup>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). It is worth noting that as the color labels for WGCNA are given based on the number of probes found in the given module, module colors in different sets of samples are not comparable and thus, comparing the color labels observed between the sets of samples does not indicate whether the modules are related. Importantly, 115 of the 123 genes in the yellow Mexican TG module were shared between the Finnish and Mexican TG modules, and thus 93.5% of the TG module genes in Mexicans overlapped with the Finns (<italic>P</italic>=1.98 x 10<sup>-160</sup> for the overlap, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). We also investigated the module membership of the genes shared between the Mexican and Finnish TG modules. The module membership of a gene is defined as the correlation coefficient of its expression profile and the corresponding module eigengene across samples (see methods). We observed that the module memberships of the genes shared between the Mexican and Finnish TG modules are highly correlated (r=0.67, p=1.56x10<sup>-16</sup>), providing additional evidence that the relevant TG genes and network modules are strongly conserved between the Mexican and Finnish sets of samples, because in both populations the genes have similar degrees of relatedness to the TG module.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Finnish twin WGCNA blue TG module is preserved in Mexican TG cases/controls.</bold> Each data point represents a Finnish twin WGCNA module.

We observed five significantly enriched (Bonferroni corrected <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) gene ontology (GO) biological process terms present in both the Finnish and Mexican modules, all including immunity and inflammation categories (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Taken together, these data provide novel evidence that the gene expression signatures in human adipose tissue are correlated with serum TG levels in a highly similar way across different populations. To further establish the robustness of the gene sets found in the Finnish and Mexican TG modules, we performed WGCNA in a third sample, adipose RNAs from 20 Finnish METSIM TG cases/controls that were analyzed using a different gene expression approach, RNAseq. The clinical characteristics of the METSIM study sample, including mean lipid values are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. This comparison of the Affymetrix microarray and RNAseq data should decrease the well-known variability and errors in the measurement methods of gene expression. We observed that the brown module in the METSIM TG case/control sample was significantly associated with TG levels (<italic>P</italic>=2.0 x 10<sup>-4</sup>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Furthermore, the Finnish twin TG module was the most preserved module in the METSIM TG case/controls (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Importantly, 34 of the 115 genes shared between the Finnish twins and Mexicans overlapped with the Finnish METSIM TG module (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;10<sup>-10</sup> for the overlap). We focused our subsequent studies on these 34 genes as they represent the significant overlap robustly observed across populations and different gene expression approaches. It is also worth noting that the TG trait provided a significantly associated network module passing Bonferroni correction for the two tested traits and the number of modules in all three sets of samples whereas no such consistent network was observed for BMI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Furthermore, when we looked into the percentages of genes correlated versus not correlated with TGs in all network modules throughout the three sets of samples, we observed that the TG-associated network modules in each of the three sets of samples (i.e. the blue module in the Finnish twins, the yellow module in the Mexicans and the brown module in the METSIM TG case/control sample) contain the highest percentages of genes correlated with TGs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). All of the WGCNA network analyses identifying the 34 genes were performed using quantitative TG values. To investigate whether the across populations overlap was robust to the analytical approach, we also investigated TGs as a binary trait by classifying the subjects to high and low TG groups (see methods) in the conventional differential gene expression analysis. Using this qualitative TG approach, we discovered that the sets of samples also show a significant overlap in the genes that are differentially expressed between the high and low TG groups. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> illustrates that the genes that are most differentially expressed between the TG extremes are shared between the sets of samples. Of the 37 genes common to all 3 top 500 differentially expressed gene lists, nine are also part of all three TG modules (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;10<sup>-7</sup> for the overlap).

To identify hub genes that may be driving the three TG network modules, we searched for genes with high module membership (i.e. high correlation between gene expression and the module eigengene [the average module expression value for an individual]) in all three TG modules. We found seven genes (<italic>ARHGAP30, CCR1, CXCL16, FERMT3, HCST, RNASET2, SELPG</italic>) among the 34 shared genes that had significantly high module membership values in the top 50% in all three TG modules (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;10<sup>-7</sup> for the overlap, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), and that are thus driving the three TG modules.

To determine whether any of the known genes of adipose TG regulation are correlated with the three TG modules, we investigated correlations of these positive control genes/gene families (<italic>MGAT</italic> family, <italic>DGAT</italic> family, and <italic>LPL</italic>), and observed that expression of all 4 <italic>MGAT</italic> genes tested (<italic>MGAT1</italic>, <italic>MGAT2</italic>, <italic>MGAT4A</italic>, <italic>MGAT4B</italic>) were significantly correlated (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) with TG module kME (i.e. the correlation between a gene expression value and the module eigengene [the average module expression value for an individual], see methods) in two or more of the sets of samples, although they were not placed into the module using WGCNA. It is worth noting that modules are formed based on similar gene expression patterns across multiple samples, so TG-associated genes that do not exhibit highly correlated gene expression will be found in different modules, and the grey module will contain genes associated with TGs not belonging to a WGCNA module. <italic>MGAT2</italic> and <italic>MGAT4B</italic> were also correlated (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) with serum TG values in at least two of the sets of samples.

To determine whether the significant TG GWAS SNPs or SNPs in high LD with them in the <italic>ARHGAP9</italic> and <italic>LST1</italic> regions influence the observed TG modules, we tested the GWAS SNPs in the METSIM sample for correlation with the TG modules. We did not observe a significant correlation between rs11614506 in LD (r<sup>2</sup>=1) with the lead TG signal (rs11613352) in the <italic>ARHGAP9</italic> region (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>) and the METSIM TG case/control brown module. However, in the <italic>LST1</italic> region (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>), a SNP rs486416 that represents an independent signal from the lead TG GWAS signal, rs2247056, was significantly associated with the brown TG module (<italic>P</italic>=0.005), while the lead TG GWAS signal rs2247056 was not significantly associated with the brown TG module (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). Additionally, rs486416 is correlated with <italic>LST1</italic> expression (r=0.52, <italic>P</italic>=0.02), providing a possible mechanism underlying the SNP/TG module and TG module/serum TG level associations. SNP rs486416 exhibited a p-value of 1.99x10<sup>-15</sup> for TGs in the previous metaGWAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], thus further suggesting <italic>LST1</italic> as one of the underlining genes for this region.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We investigated whether human adipose transcript networks are correlated with serum TG levels across populations to identify novel TG-associated genes for future targeted sequencing and functional studies. Using WGCNA, we discovered that there are gene co-expression networks in human adipose tissue significantly correlated with serum TGs and highly conserved across populations. The vast majority (93.5%) of the genes in the Mexican TG network module overlapped with the genes in the Finnish twin TG network module. Furthermore, the module membership of the genes shared between the Finnish and Mexican TG modules significantly correlate with each other (r=0.67, <italic>P</italic>=1.56x10<sup>-16</sup>). We also observed a significant overlap with 34 genes shared across the TG modules of all three sets of samples robust enough to be detected using two different gene expression approaches, microarrays and RNAseq. These 34 TG-associated genes identified in WGCNA also significantly overlap with the top 500 most differentially expressed genes in all three sets of samples (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;10<sup>-7</sup> for the overlap), further validating the WGCNA approach. The gene co-expression network data of three independent sets of samples from Finnish and Mexican populations provide strong evidence that the 34 shared genes are involved in TG regulation in both Finns and Mexicans, and probably other populations as well. Furthermore, the fact that the TG associations remain when BMI is used as a covariate in stepwise regression provides evidence that the TG module associations are not due to differences in adiposity between the subjects. However, inferences about causation based on the WGCNA method must be supported by both biological arguments and statistically significant associations. We also recognize that some of the 34 genes may be reactive rather than causal. Taking into account these limitations, future targeted sequencing and functional studies are warranted.</p><p>The strength of module membership also significantly overlaps in all three TG modules. Seven of the 34 genes with high module membership were observed as hub genes, acting as key drivers of three TG modules (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;10<sup>-7</sup> for the overlap, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), spanning three sets of samples and two gene expression platforms. This finding implicates these seven genes in TG regulation, although additional experimentation is necessary to search for a specific molecular role they play in regulating TGs. Further studies are also warranted to determine whether the same 34 genes implicated are associated with TGs stored in adipose tissue, because adipose TG values were not available for our sets of samples. Two of the 34 genes (<italic>ARHGAP9</italic> and <italic>LST1</italic>) are located within 500 kb of a significant TG metaGWAS signal, while seven other genes lie near a suggestive TG GWAS signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Teslovich and coworkers, however, suggest different regional gene candidates associated with each of these two TG GWAS signals (i.e. <italic>HLA-B</italic> and <italic>LRP1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the <italic>LRP1</italic> region, <italic>ARHGAP9</italic> identified in our study is located nearer the actual GWAS SNP than <italic>LRP1</italic>, and in the <italic>HLA</italic> region there were several non-redundant, significantly associated SNPs not in LD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], one of which is located next to <italic>LST1</italic>, making <italic>LST1</italic> a likely second hit for the region.</p><p>Determining whether <italic>ARHGAP9</italic> or <italic>LST1</italic> expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are driving the TG-associated WGCNA modules may reveal a novel mechanism of TG regulation. The recent metaGWAS study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] reports that none of the lead TG-associated GWAS SNPs near HLA and <italic>LRP1</italic> were <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs in adipose tissue. However, significant non-redundant regional SNPs that are not in LD with the lead SNP were not tested in this previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Therefore, untested significant regional TG-associated GWAS SNPs may act as <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs in adipose tissue, and they should thus be further explored. Our analysis demonstrate that a significant TG GWAS SNP rs486416 in the <italic>HLA/LST1</italic> region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] is driving the adipose co-expression network associated with TGs in the METSIM TG case/control study sample by influencing <italic>LST1</italic> expression, thus providing a novel mechanism underlying the TG metaGWAS signal in the <italic>HLA/LST1</italic> region. The <italic>ARHGAP9</italic> region (&#x000b1;500kb) had only one significant TG GWAS signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] that was not significantly correlated with the brown TG module in METSIM TG cases/controls, in accordance with the previous cis-eQTL study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. We also discovered that 11 of the 34 genes found in all three TG modules show prior evidence of involvement in obesity, type 2 diabetes, or CHD (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>).

Single-end, 50bp reads were produced using Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing platform. Reads passing Illumina&#x02019;s default quality control were aligned to the ENSEMBL v62 reference genome using the default options of TopHat v1.3.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], a package for aligning RNAseq data to a reference genome. The expression level of a gene was determined with the Cufflinks software package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] using the TopHat output to compute gene expression values as FPKM (Fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads). FPKM is calculated by counting the number of reads spanning a gene and dividing by the length of the gene (in kilobases) and the number of reads in a lane that map to the genome (in millions). FPKM accounts for the variability in mapped reads seen across sequencing lanes and gene length to improve the accuracy of the gene expression value. On average, 100,225,314 reads mapped to 14,223 RefSeq genes after the QC was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)</title><p>We used WGCNA, which is a systems biology analysis method, to identify TG-associated co-expression modules and their key constituents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. WGCNA starts from the level of thousands of genes, identifies modules of co-expressed genes, and relates these modules to clinical variables and gene ontology information. Because gene modules may correspond to biological pathways, focusing the analysis on modules (and their highly connected intramodular hub genes) amounts to a biologically meaningful data reduction scheme. WGCNA is implemented in the R software package. Briefly, WGCNA uses a network distance coupled with hierarchical clustering and dynamic tree cutting to define modules as branches of a cluster tree. Modules (clusters) are defined in an unbiased fashion and initially denoted by colors. Grey denotes background genes outside of modules. The highly correlated module genes of a given module are represented and summarized by their first principal component (which is referred to as the module eigengene). The module eigengenes are used to define measures of module membership which quantify how close a gene is to a given module. Specifically, module membership (aka kME) is defined as the correlation between a gene expression value and the module eigengene (the average module expression value for an individual). Module membership measures allow one to annotate all genes on the array and to screen for disease related intramodular hub genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. As described below, we use functional enrichment analysis with regard to known gene ontologies to understand the biological significance of module genes and to identify intramodular hub genes as candidate driver genes. WGCNA was applied separately to each of the three gene expression datasets: Finnish twins, Mexican TG case/control and METSIM. UCSC genes expressed in METSIM samples (n= 13,822 genes) were inputted into WGCNA, while all expressed probes in the Mexican samples (14,942 probes) and Finnish twin samples (16,048 probes) were used to form the WGCNA networks. We utilized the blockwiseModules R function of WGCNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] to determine co-expression networks formed in adipose tissue in each of the three populations. This approach has been used in several previous systems genetic applications, e.g. in Plaisier at al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The module colors are determined by the number of genes/probes within the module. Therefore, comparing the color labels observed between the 3 sets of samples does not indicate whether the modules are related (i.e. the yellow module in the Mexican study sample is not comparable to the yellow module in the Finnish Twin study sample). When evaluating the significance of the module correlations of WGCNA, we corrected the p-values for the number of modules and the number of tested phenotypic traits.</p></sec><sec><title>Module preservation</title><p>Our module preservation analysis is based on a permutation test implemented in the modulePreservation R function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The modulePreservation function implements a permutation test involving several powerful network based statistics for evaluating module preservation. These statistics are summarized into the composite preservation called Zsummary. For each module in the first data set (referred to as reference data), the function calculates the Zsummary statistic in the second data set (referred to as test data). For a given module, Zsummary&#x0003e;10 indicates strong evidence for preservation in the test data set. Zsummary &#x0003c; 2 indicates no evidence of module preservation. An advantage of the preservation Z statistic is that it makes few assumptions regarding module definition and module properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Cross-tabulation based tests of module overlap</title><p>To merge expression data sets measured on different platforms, we used the collapseRows R function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Briefly, this method first collapses multiple probes by gene symbol which allows one to merge the data by gene symbol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The microarray probe with the greatest variance between samples was used to represent a given gene in the Mexican and Finnish twin samples.</p><p>To determine the relationship between two module assignments in two different data sets, we used standard cross-tabulation based methods (Fisher&#x02019;s Exact test). We placed each expressed gene into a 2x2 categorical contingency table based on whether the gene was part of a TG-associated module in the two study samples tested. To determine the likelihood of overlapping modules, genes were randomly selected using the criteria specified in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and an empirical p-value was calculated after 10 million trials to accurately model the likelihood of these results occurring by chance. For the empirical p-value of the overlap between the three modules, we considered 10 billion trials sufficient as it would allow us to reach a p-value level of 10<sup>-10</sup>. We utilized the GO BP FAT function of DAVID to determine gene ontology biological processes enriched in the genes overlapping in all 3 TG modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

Six of 53 Finnish twins had TG values &#x0003e; 1.5 mmol/L, 10 of 20 METSIM samples had TG values &#x0003e; 1.5 mmol/L, and 44 of the Mexican TG case/controls had TG values &#x0003e; 1.5 mmol/L.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene expression - TG correlations</title><p>In the three sets of samples we compared the percentages of genes that were correlated with TGs in each module.
