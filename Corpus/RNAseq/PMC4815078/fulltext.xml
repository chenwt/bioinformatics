The pathogen is the cause of severe yield losses and can render infested fields unsuitable for Brassica crop growth due to the persistence of resting spores in the soil for up to 20&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To provide insight into the biology of the pathogen and its interaction with its primary host <italic>B. napus</italic>, we produced a draft genome of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> pathotypes 3 and 6 (Pb3 and Pb6) that differ in their host range. Pb3 is highly virulent on <italic>B. napus</italic> (but also infects other Brassica species) while Pb6 infects only vegetable Brassica crops. Both the Pb3 and Pb6 genomes are highly compact, each with a total size of 24.2&#x000a0;Mb, and contain less than 2&#x000a0;% repetitive DNA. Clustering of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of Pb3, Pb6 and three additional re-sequenced pathotypes (Pb2, Pb5 and Pb8) shows a high degree of correlation of cluster grouping with host range. The Pb3 genome features significant reduction of intergenic space with multiple examples of overlapping untranslated regions (UTRs). Dependency on the host for essential nutrients is evident from the loss of genes for the biosynthesis of thiamine and some amino acids and the presence of a wide range of transport proteins, including some unique to <italic>P. brassicae</italic>. The annotated genes of Pb3 include those with a potential role in the regulation of the plant growth hormones cytokinin and auxin. The expression profile of Pb3 genes, including putative effectors, during infection and their potential role in manipulation of host defence is discussed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The <italic>P. brassicae</italic> genome sequence reveals a compact genome, a dependency of the pathogen on its host for some essential nutrients and a potential role in the regulation of host plant cytokinin and auxin.

Protists, and in particular Rhizaria, are among the least studied and poorly understood subgroups of the eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The main characteristic shared by all plasmodiophorids is cruciform nuclear division in which a persistent nucleolus elongates perpendicular to the condensed metaphase chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Other common features are biflagellate zoospores, multinucleate protoplasts (plasmodia) and long-lasting resting spores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Plasmodiophorids are parasites of flowering plants, brown algae, diatoms and oomycetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Some plasmodiophorids cause additional damage to their host by serving as vectors for viruses. Two examples include the potato mop-top virus (PMTV) and beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV causing rhizomania of sugar beet), which are transmitted by <italic>Spongospora subterranea</italic> (powdery scab of potato) and <italic>Polymyxa betae</italic>, respectively.</p><p>One of the most economically important plasmodiophorid pathogens is <italic>Plasmodiophora brassicae</italic> Woronin, the causal agent of clubroot disease of cruciferous plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This disease is associated with the formation of clubs or galls on the roots of infected plants, which interfere with water and nutrient uptake leading to severe losses in crop yield and quality. Infection begins with germination of resting spores to release biflagellate primary zoospores. Motile primary zoospores swim in a film of water in the soil, attach to the root hairs and encyst. Microscopic observations by Aist and Williams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] revealed that after formation of the cyst, the penetration of the root hair cell wall occurs through a specialized projectile-like structure (Stachel) that is formed within a tubular cavity (Rohr). About 15&#x000a0;min prior to penetration, the cyst vacuole enlarges, the Rohr is oriented towards the host cell wall and the end of the Rohr swells to create a structure called an Adhesorium. The Stachel then passes down the Rohr and penetrates the cell wall, which is followed by the injection of an amoeboid unit into the root hair. After entering the cell, this amoeboid unit goes through a synchronized cruciform nuclear division and forms a multinucleate primary plasmodium. Primary plasmodia cleave into secondary zoospores that are released into the soil to initiate secondary infection by penetrating the epidermis and invading the cortical tissues of the main roots. Secondary infections lead to the formation of secondary plasmodia that cause hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the infected host cells, ultimately resulting in the club-shaped malformation of the roots typical of clubroot. The secondary plasmodia cleave into resting spores, which are eventually released back into the soil when the galls decompose. The resting spores can survive in the soil for up to 20&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], serving as primary inoculum to initiate new infections in subsequent years.</p><p>In common with many gall-forming diseases, alterations in the concentrations of plant growth hormones, particularly cytokinin and auxin, have been proposed to play an important role in the progress of infection and development of symptoms (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). Altered cytokinin and auxin concentrations are associated with the stimulation of host cell division, cell expansion and loss of differentiation in <italic>P. brassicae-</italic>infected tissues leading to the growth of galls. The galls are a strong metabolic sink and provide this obligate biotrophic pathogen with nutrients such as carbohydrates and amino acids. Using <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> as a host, Siemens and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] reported an alteration in host cytokinin response at early stages of gall formation and a higher auxin response at later stages of infection. This was supported by monitoring the concentration of hormones and expression of phytohormone-responsive genes in roots of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants infected with <italic>P. brassicae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Recent work has shown that <italic>P. brassicae</italic>-induced gall formation in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> results from a reprogramming of host vascular cambium activity leading to increased cell proliferation, a maintenance of phloem production but a strong reduction in xylogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>All crucifers including Brassica crops and wild species such as <italic>A. thaliana</italic> are potential hosts of <italic>P. brassicae</italic>. The disease occurs in more than 60 countries and is more prevalent in areas where Brassica crops are intensively produced such as Europe, Australia and North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Clubroot was first detected in the Canadian rapeseed or canola (<italic>Brassica napus</italic>) crop in 2003, with the number of <italic>P. brassicae</italic>-infested fields increasing significantly over the past decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Given the economic value of the canola industry to the Canadian economy (~$15 billion per annum), the spread of this disease represents a major challenge. The predominant pathotype of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> in Canada is pathotype 3, as classified on the differentials of Williams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], although pathotypes 2, 5, 6 and 8 have also been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Most of the research on the interaction of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> with its host has been limited to the plant response during infection. The soil-borne nature and biotrophic lifestyle of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> have hampered research on the biology of the pathogen.</p><p>To obtain insights into the biology of <italic>P. brassicae</italic>, we have sequenced, using a whole genome shotgun approach, the genomes of pathotypes 3 and 6 that differ in their host range and virulence, and re-sequenced pathotypes 2, 5 and 8. Comparisons were made among these novel genome sequences, and also with the recently published data from a European pathotype, e3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We combined these data with a transcriptomic approach in two host species, <italic>B. napus</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> to gain insights into the processes that underlie pathogenicity, the manipulation of host development and mechanisms of nutrient acquisition by this pathogen.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Genome sequencing and assembly</title><p><italic>P. brassicae</italic> pathotype 3 (hereafter referred to as Pb3) is the predominant strain of the clubroot pathogen in the province of Alberta in western Canada, and is highly virulent on <italic>B. napus</italic> but also infects other <italic>Brassica</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. By contrast, pathotype 6 (Pb6) is the predominant strain of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> in British Columbia and Ontario, and has a host range limited to vegetable Brassicas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1 shows a comparison of the formation of galls upon infection of Brassica by Pb3 and Pb6.</p><p>To gain insight into the genome of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> and genome diversity of various pathotypes, we generated <italic>de novo</italic> assembled genomes of Pb3 and Pb6 and re-sequenced three additional pathotypes: Pb2, Pb5 and Pb8. Pb3 is the most virulent strain of these pathotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Single-spore isolates of Pb3 and Pb6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] were propagated in the roots of their respective hosts, <italic>B. napus</italic> cv. DH12075 and <italic>B. rapa</italic> var. <italic>pekinensis</italic> cv. Granaat. DNA from partially purified spores was used for whole genome shotgun sequencing using a Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium platform. In addition, an 8&#x000a0;kb mate-paired library was sequenced for each pathotype (using a Roche GS-FLX+ platform). After removal of the host plant DNA sequences, the remaining sequence reads were assembled into 109 scaffolds for Pb3 and 356 scaffolds for Pb6 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1). Two Pb3 scaffolds (5 (2.522 kbp) and 38 (4.049 kbp)) were considered as potential host contamination based on 99&#x000a0;% identity to Brassica ribosomal RNA sequence (NCBI blastn search, E-value 0) and were excluded. The size of the assembled genome for both pathotypes was similar and approximately 24.2 Mbp, which is close to pre-existing estimates for the genome size for <italic>P. brassicae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and to the genome sequence of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> isolate e3 reported recently by Schwelm et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The estimated repeat content for Pb3 and Pb6 was less than 2&#x000a0;%, characteristic of a small genome with few repetitive elements. The average GC content of the genome was 59&#x000a0;% for both Pb3 and Pb6.</p><p>The total number of predicted genes for Pb3 and Pb6 was 10,851 and 10,070, respectively. Analysis of the single-copy Core Eukaryotic Genes (CEGs) via CEGMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] revealed that the Pb3 genome contained 92&#x000a0;% complete CEGs and 93&#x000a0;% as partial sequences. The assembly of Pb6 yielded lower results, with 85&#x000a0;% of the CEGs being identified as complete and 86&#x000a0;% as partial.</p><p>Close examination of predicted genes and RNA sequences (from infected <italic>B. napus</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> tissue sampled at different time points after infection) mapped to the Pb3 genome revealed that the majority of the genes were located in close proximity to each other along the compact genome of <italic>P. brassicae</italic>. The intergenic distance for the majority of the genes was less than 800&#x000a0;bp (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2). Analysis of predicted ORFs supported by RNASeq data revealed examples of highly reduced intergenic regions with overlapping UTRs indicating shared regulatory elements for at least some of the <italic>P. brassicae</italic> genes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S3). Compact genomes and reduced intergenic space have been reported for several other eukaryotes including two unicellular algal species <italic>Bigelowiella natans</italic> and <italic>Guillardia theta</italic>, as well as the microsporidian <italic>Antonospora locustae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>The overall features reported here for the Pb3 genome are similar to the recently published genome of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> isolate e3 by Schwelm et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, the genome assembly of Pb3 was less fragmented than that of e3 (107 against 165 scaffolds) and a higher number of genes were predicted in Pb3 (10851) than in e3 (9730). A comparison of the two proteomes identified 1070 Pb3 predicted proteins that did not have an orthologue among those reported for e3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A search of Pb3 RNA sequences expressed at various stages of infection supported the presence of transcripts for 943 of these 1070 predicted genes. In addition, only five of the 1070 Pb3 genes did not have a match in the e3 genome sequence, confirming that almost all of the additional 1070 genes were present as unannotated sequences in the e3 genome assembly. Due to the importance of Pb3 as a highly prevalent and virulent pathotype infecting various Brassica crops, and also because of a more complete genome assembly (compared with Pb6 and e3), Pb3 was selected as the reference genome for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Genome comparison of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> pathotypes</title><p>Alignment of the Pb3 and Pb6 genomes revealed a close to perfect synteny with rare examples of inversion of small segments of the Pb6 genome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S4). The majority of predicted Pb6 genes had an orthologue in the Pb3 genome except for 14 genes that were unique to Pb6, with six of these having no homologue in the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database and eight that matched hypothetical proteins (E value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). To gain insight into genome variation and its correlation with host specificity we re-sequenced the genomes of Pb2, Pb5 and Pb8. A total of 173,134 SNPs were discovered by alignment of the genome sequence of Pb6 and the re-sequenced pathotypes against the Pb3 reference. Paired-end Illumina reads generated for Pb3 were also aligned to the Pb3 genome. After filtering (on allele frequency, SNP positions with heterozygous genotypes and indels) 132,429 SNPs remained and were clustered into 90 haplotype blocks. One haplotype block was found to result from a single SNP between the reference genome and Pb3 Illumina reads; investigation of this SNP indicated that it resulted from a sequencing error and this haplotype (hap19) was therefore excluded (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Of the remaining 89 haplotype blocks, 86.5&#x000a0;% contained more than one SNP. Comparison of whole genome SNP profiles revealed that Pb2, 3, 5, 8 were highly similar and clustered as one group, while the SNP profile of Pb6 was more divergent (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S2). The haplotypes correlate with the host range and geographical distribution of these pathotypes, with Pb2, 3, 5, 8 being virulent on <italic>B. napus</italic> and present in the prairie provinces and Pb6 failing to cause disease on <italic>B. napus</italic> and being prevalent in British Columbia and Eastern provinces of Canada (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S3). Without access to read data, analyses of the e3 genome could not be completed as with the other pathotypes. However, by direct sequence comparison 48,578 out of the identified 132,429 SNPs were found to differentiate the genome of e3 reported by Schwelm et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and Pb3. These SNPs were grouped into 58 haplotypes and showed that e3 clustered with Pb6 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Figure S5 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S2).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Graphical representation of the 89 SNP haplotypes discovered across four re-sequenced pathotypes.

A search for orthologous proteins identified <italic>P. ramorum</italic> as the organism with the highest number of orthologues matching Pb3 proteins (755 Pb3 proteins). Among these were genes involved in protein and nucleic acid binding, ATP and metal ion binding, oxidoreductases, kinases and ATPase activity.</p><p>We searched the genome of Pb3 for potential secreted proteins, which might act as effectors, using the criteria described in the <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>. The total number of predicted secreted proteins was 590 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Table S4), with 431 of these proteins having a probability score (D-score) of greater than 0.7. From this list, 221 proteins were defined as small (less than 300 aa) secreted proteins (SSPs). Nearly 60&#x000a0;% of the Pb3 SSPs (132 out of 221) had no homology with any protein in the NCBI nr database. Sixty-three of the 590 Pb3 SSPs did not have any homologue among the e3 predicted proteins (<italic>E</italic> value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>). A blastn search confirmed the presence of all but one (PbPT3Sc00048_Am_3.106_1) of these genes in the e3 genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Comparing Pb3 SSPs with those predicted for Pb6 revealed that 119 of the Pb3 SSPs did not have a homologue in the Pb6 genome. Further study is required to validate the uniqueness of these 119 SPs for Pb3 and to reveal their possible role in determining host specificity. We searched the SSPs of Pb3 for the presence of RXLR motifs. RXLR motifs identified in the effectors of oomycete pathogens are believed to function in translocation of effector proteins into the plant host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. RXLR type effectors are highly prevalent in <italic>Phytophthora</italic> and downy mildew species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A potential RXLR motif was found in only 13 of the 221 predicted SSPs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Table S5) indicating that this motif is not prevalent among the effectors of <italic>P. brassicae</italic>. The clubroot pathogen is evolutionary distinct from oomycetes and the lack or under-representation of RXLR like motifs might be expected; however, this pathogen resides within the host cell and in this regard it resembles malaria parasites (plasmodium species).

This model was confirmed by the expression profile of genes, related to plant hormone pathways, during the course of infection of <italic>B. napus</italic> with Pb3 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>: Figure S7). The picture, however, remains complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Many gall-forming pathogens have the ability to synthesize plant growth regulators, or related substances and modulate the phytohormone response of the host.

Common isoprenoid CKs in plants are trans-zeatin (tZ), cis-zeatin (cZ) and isopentenyl adenine (iP). CK biosynthesis in plants occurs via two routes. The synthesis of iP and tZ is catalyzed by an isopentenyl transferase (IPT) that preferentially uses ADP or ATP as the isoprenoid acceptor from dimethylallylpyrophosphate (DMAPP). Alternatively, IPTs that preferentially use tRNA as a substrate lead to the synthesis of cZ. In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, adenine IPTs are the most important with iP and tZ the dominant active CKs &#x02013; the cZ content is low (and cZ has much lower CK activity).

Two genes were identified with close homology to IPT, PbPT3Sc00024_Sm_2.181_1 and PbPT3Sc00040_Am_6.202_1.

The draft genome sequences presented here, along with the re-sequencing data of multiple pathotypes, adds to the previously published genome sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] to provide a set of foundational resources that will partly overcome these limitations. <italic>P. brassicae</italic> shares many features previously reported for other biotrophic pathogens, namely a reduction in plant cell wall degrading enzymes, a loss of genes for uptake and assimilation of inorganic nitrogen and sulfate, and a loss of enzymes for thiamine biosynthesis and reduction of genes encoding for the production of toxins. These are common features identified in several biotrophic fungal and oomycete plant pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. What distinguishes the <italic>P. brassicae</italic> genome is the small size and scarcity of repeats in comparison with most of other obligate biotrophs such as rust and powdery mildew fungi and the downy mildew oomycete <italic>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Transposable and other repetitive elements are factors that contribute to genome expansion, evolution and possible diversification of effector genes in biotrophic fungi. Another unique feature of the <italic>P. brassicae</italic> genome is the reduction (and in some occasions overlapping UTRs) of intergenic distances. This resembles the reduction of intergenic intervals in microsporidia, another group of obligate intracellular parasites in which the reduction of gene space has forced promoters and terminators into adjacent genes and consequently the presence of mRNAs that encode sequences from more than one gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Comparison of the SNP profile of Pb3 with four other Canadian pathotypes showed a clear difference between Pb3 and Pb6 while the SNP profile for Pb2, Pb5 and Pb8 were very similar. Interestingly this SNP-based grouping correlated with host specificity of these isolates. Despite the marked difference between the genome wide SNP profile of Pb3 and Pb6, these two pathotypes were very similar with respect to genome structure and their effector profile.</p><p>As a biotrophic pathogen <italic>P. brassicae</italic> relies on host plant carbon sources for growth. Among the Pb3 predicted transporters were a monosaccharide, a sucrose and several major facilitator superfamily (MSF) transporters that transport different compounds including simple sugars. We identified a novel group of transporters among the predicted proteins of Pb3 with substrate binding motifs only found in prokaryotic ABC transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Seven proteins with these bacterial transporter motifs had 7 transmembrane sweet-taste receptor of 3 GCPR (7tm3) joined with either a bacterial extracellular solute-binding protein (SBP) or a bacterial periplasmic-binding (PBP) domain. Bacterial SBP motifs are essential for transmembrane transport irrespective of solute concentration, as they restrict substrate diffusion away from the cell and improve transporter affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The evolutionary origin of these transporters remains to be established but they are likely to represent examples of horizontal gene transfer from prokaryotes to eukaryotes which, whilst relatively rare, has been documented in other protist genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Schwelm et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] also reported that a number of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> GH18 chitinases were closely related to bacterial chitinases which have not been reported in other eukaryotes before.</p><p>Plant biotrophic pathogens are efficient in evading host recognition and suppressing plant defence through secretion of effector proteins. We identified 221 small secreted proteins among the predicted Pb3 proteins of which 60&#x000a0;% (132 SSPs) showed no homology to the NCBI nr database. Twenty-eight SSPs that were differentially expressed during infection consisted of proteins with chitin binding domains, proteinase activity and peptidase inhibitors. Salicylic acid (SA) is the main plant hormone for activating defence against biotroph pathogens. We identified a putative Pb3 effector with homology to plant protein BSMT that function as SA methyl transferase. <italic>In planta</italic> BSMT generates MeSA at the site of pathogen infection. MeSA acts as a SAR signal in distal leaves of infected plants. A BSMT from <italic>P. brassicae</italic> was recently reported by Ludwig-M&#x000fc;ller and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Here we also showed the function of this gene in induction of SAR and that it was differentially expressed during infection. One possible role for <italic>P. brassicae</italic> BSMT is to dampen the effect of SA in local tissue by converting it to MeSA with the potential benefit of protecting above-ground parts of the plant from other pathogens, and thus sustaining the life of the host plant that is required for obligate biotrophic pathogens. SA mediated plant defence is mainly described for foliar plant pathogens and there is little information about involvement of the SA dependent defence pathway in roots. An example of the possible involvement of SA against root colonising pathogens is the induction of a SA marker gene encoding pathogenesis related protein 1 (PR-1) in barley roots during challenge with <italic>Bipolaris sorokiniana</italic>, a root pathogen of barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].

For each pathotype, a Binary Alignment Map (BAM) file was exported from the CLC Genomics Workbench. SNPs in all genotypes were called using the Mpileup command from Samtools (v. 0.1.18) to produce a Variant Call Format (VCF) file. The VCF file was filtered to remove positions where the variant allele frequency was 100&#x000a0;%. Additionally, if a single pathotype had a heterozygous genotype call, the position was removed. Due to the presence of homopolymer repeat errors in the 454 genome sequence, indels were found to be unreliable and were excluded from further analysis. The filtered VCF file was then processed using a custom Perl script to determine the number of haplotypes based on identical SNP patterns. Since the scaffolds of the reference genome are unordered, haplotype blocks were stopped when the end of a scaffold was reached. The recently published <italic>P. brassicae</italic> e3 isolate genome sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] was aligned to the reference genome Pb3 using the Nucmer application within MUMmer (v 3.23) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].
