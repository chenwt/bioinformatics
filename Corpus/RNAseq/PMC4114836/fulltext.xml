It is therefore hard to distinguish those molecular events which prepare cells for, or engage them in, mitosis from those that are required specifically for transcriptional reprogramming. The relationship between the cell cycle and cell fate decisions has for a long time attracted interest <xref rid="pbio.1001914-Holtzer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Transition through mitosis is a time when many transcription factors are displaced from chromatin, potentially permitting new transcription factors to occupy chromatin sites on mitotic exit and so direct a postmitotic cell fate change <xref rid="pbio.1001914-MartnezBalbs1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1001914-Egli3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Mitotic remodelling has been shown to be of great importance for the efficient replication of erythrocyte nuclei by <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts <xref rid="pbio.1001914-Lemaitre1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001914-Ganier1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. For new transcription, cell division seems to be needed in some cases <xref rid="pbio.1001914-Tsubouchi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001914-Foshay1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> but not in others <xref rid="pbio.1001914-Chiu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001914-Vierbuchen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Here we have used nuclear transfer to amphibian oocytes to compare directly the ability of mitotic chromatin or interphase nuclei to be reprogrammed in the absence of cell division.</p><p>Germinal vesicle (GV) stage oocytes do not replicate or divide. They therefore provide an opportunity to test whether the cell cycle phase of donor nuclei affects the efficiency of nuclear reprogramming as judged by active transcription of previously silenced genes <xref rid="pbio.1001914-HalleyStott1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. To our surprise, we found that a mitotic state of donor nuclei dramatically increases the efficiency of activating certain quiescent pluripotency genes in these nuclei. Our results support an idea that a brief period during mitosis facilitates an exchange of gene regulatory factors on chromatin and that this could be an important mechanism to help cells embarking on new cell lineages during normal development.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mitotic Chromatin Is Reprogrammed Much More Rapidly Than Interphase Nuclei</title><p>Permeabilized mouse C2C12 cells, a cultured myoblast cell line which we have used extensively in our oocyte nuclear transfer experiments, were arrested at specific stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001914.s002">Figure S1a</xref>) and were injected into the GV of oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001914-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). The DNA content of these donor cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001914-g001">Figure 1b</xref>) confirmed cell cycle arrest in each of the cell cycle stages. The transcriptional reactivation of three silent genes quiescent in C2C12 cells (Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2) was assessed by RT-qPCR 38 h after nuclear transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001914-g001">Figure 1c</xref>). Nuclei at a late stage of the cell cycle (M) show greatly enhanced transcription of each of the genes when compared to unsynchronized nuclei (predominantly G1 and S), whereas an already active gene (c-jun) shows little increase in transcript level. Particularly impressive is the 100-fold enhancement in Sox 2 expression from mitotic donor nuclei when compared to interphase donor nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001914-g001">Figure 1c</xref>). In over 50 experiments, donor cells arrested in mitosis or in late G2 always generated more Sox2 transcripts from reactivated genes at 25&#x02013;48 h after injection to oocytes than unsynchronized donor cells. This difference ranged from a few fold to over 100-fold and is much affected by the exact duration of nocodazole treatment. Sox2 is a gene that is more widely expressed than most others, notably in early embryos, in most stem cells, and in the nervous system <xref rid="pbio.1001914-Driessens1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><fig id="pbio-1001914-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1001914.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Mitotic nuclei are reprogrammed much more efficiently than interphase nuclei.</title><p>(a) Nuclear transplantation procedure used in this and the following experiments.

In both cases, enhanced transcription from mitotic donors was observed, although the magnitude of mitotic advantage was lower (particularly in the case of the shake-off samples, many cells of which appeared to be apoptotic by visual inspection). Mitotic donor nuclei were also prepared using another cell synchronization agent (Taxol), and the mitotic advantage was again seen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001914.s002">Figure S1d</xref>). When G1/G0 cells were exposed to nocodazole for the same period of time as used to prepare mitotic cells, no enhancement of transcription of the genes was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001914.s002">Figure S1e</xref>). These results indicate that the observed mitotic advantage is not due to a nonspecific activity of nocodazole nor to a peculiarity of one line of cells (C2C12).</p><p>To ask if this mitotic advantage applies more widely in the genome than to the pluripotency genes so far tested, we compared by RNAseq the genes transcribed in injected oocytes by interphase nuclei or mitotic chromatin. We focussed our analysis on genes that were found to be consistently expressed by interphase nuclei after nuclear transfer. One experiment indicated that 617 genes were transcribed in oocytes at least 2-fold more in mitotic nuclei compared to interphase nuclei. Of these mitotically up-regulated genes, Sox2 was 4-fold more transcribed than in interphase nuclear transfers, and over half of the 617 genes were more strongly transcribed than Sox2.

To distinguish these ideas and to measure the rate of reprogramming, we measured the incorporation of GFP-tagged histone B4 (an early marker of oocyte reprogramming) <xref rid="pbio.1001914-Jullien1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and the association of Cherry-labelled histone H2B by live imaging of mixed populations of mitotic and interphase donor cells after injection into oocytes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001914.s003">Figure S2a</xref> for design). Mitotic donor material becomes very rapidly marked with both histone B4 and histone H2B, whereas interphase donor nuclei show a lag in the association of both and particularly of H2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001914-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). In support of a difference in the rate of reprogramming, we find that oocyte-derived TBP2 marks the transplanted mitotic cells more strongly than interphase donor cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001914.s003">Figure S2b</xref>; compare white mitotic with yellow interphase arrows). We then asked if there is a more rapid association and activation of RNA polymerase II with mitotic chromatin. We used immunostaining for the elongating form of RNA polymerase II on a mixed population of mitotic and interphase nuclei injected into oocyte GVs. Mitotic donor material is clearly marked with elongating Pol II before interphase donor material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001914-g002">Figure 2b</xref>, compare panels ii and iv for pol II). In view of this difference between the two nuclear types in the onset of global pol II transcription after nuclear transfer, we asked whether reprogrammed genes are activated at a different rate in mitotic donor cells compared to interphase cells or if the magnitude of activation is greater. A time course of reprogramming from oocytes injected with either interphase or mitotic donor cells was assessed by RT-qPCR and revealed that genes from mitotic donor cells are activated more rapidly than the same genes from interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001914-g002">Figure 2c</xref>); the accumulation of transcripts reached by 63 h is similar.</p><fig id="pbio-1001914-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1001914.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Mitotic advantage is due to an increased rate of reprogramming.</title><p>(a) Live imaging of mixed mitotic and interphase nuclei injected into the GVs of oocytes expressing fluorescently labelled histone B4 or histone H2B.

It is clear that the difference in the rate of gene reactivation from interphase and mitotic nuclei is maintained when the injected material is sonicated chromatin as opposed to whole nuclei. This suggests that the &#x0201c;mitotic advantage&#x0201d; is present in the chromatin of mitotic cells. This result also confirms that the difference between interphase and mitotic donor cells is not due to the interphase nuclear membrane, nor to any other aspect of nuclear organization that is eliminated by sonication.</p><fig id="pbio-1001914-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1001914.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Sonication does not eliminate mitotic advantage.</title><p>(a) Interphase and mitotic donor nuclei were mildly sonicated to fragment the chromatin as shown by DAPI staining of the four kinds of donor nuclei.

We thereby tested whether a loss of chromatin binding factors at mitotic entry could remove the mitotic advantage. We also largely depleted chromatin binding factors from permeabilized mitotic cells and thus removed many chromatin factors that may be gained by cells entering mitosis. The depletion of chromatin binding factors was achieved with 300 mM salt and Triton, which removed most nonhistone DNA binding factors.

It can be seen that the great majority of the nonhistone chromosomal proteins that have been tested and that normally exist in interphase nuclei have been removed from mitotic chromatin by 300 mM salt and Triton. Nevertheless interphase nuclei depleted of salt soluble nuclear protein (300 mM sample) do not acquire the same reprogramming responsiveness as mitotic donor material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001914-g005">Figure 5b</xref>).

Treatment of interphase nuclei with Ubp-M removes histone ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001914-g007">Figure 7g</xref>). However, unexpectedly, we see that the removal of histone ubiquitination by Ubp-M does not significantly enhance the reprogramming of interphase nuclei, so that they behave the same, in this respect, as mitotic chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001914-g007">Figure 7h</xref>). This suggested that deubiquitination itself is not sufficient to confer mitotic advantage. We hypothesized that H2A deubiquitination is a required step in a series of chromatin remodelling events that eventually lead to mitotic advantage. We therefore chose to reduce the ubiquitinated state of interphase nuclei in living cells in order to allow events downstream of ubiquitin-depleted chromatin to take place. The inhibitor MG-132 is thought to lower histone ubiquitination by reducing the pool of free ubiquitin through inhibition of the proteasome. MG-132 treatment of interphase nuclei before injection to oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001914-g007">Figure 7a</xref>) gave a partial but significant reduction in H2A ubiquitination on Sox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001914-g007">Figure 7e</xref> compared to 7b); it also resulted in a substantial enhancement of oocyte-induced transcription from interphase, but not mitotic chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001914-g007">Figure 7f</xref>).</p><p>The increase in ubiquitination of transplanted mitotic nuclei, coupled with the removal of the mitotic advantage, shows that chromatin ubiquitination contributes to the mitotic advantage. It may, however, not be sufficient to explain the whole phenomenon, because we do not achieve a complete mitotic advantage in interphase nuclei by deubiquitination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results show a substantial effect of the cell cycle stage of donor nuclei in nuclear transfer experiments. The reason why this has not been seen before in some of the older nuclear transfer experiments with eggs is probably for several reasons. One is that the somatic nuclei used as donors were not able to be well synchronized <xref rid="pbio.1001914-McAvoy1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1001914-Beroldingenvon1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Another is that tests have involved the normality of development, rather than gene activity. Third, and most importantly, tests have been carried out on cell dividing eggs, whereas our work has tested gene transcription in the complete absence of DNA replication or cell division. The more recent results of <xref rid="pbio.1001914-Lemaitre1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> are in agreement with the work described here. The success of the first mammal cloning work was attributed in part to the use of donor cells in G0 <xref rid="pbio.1001914-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1001914-Campbell2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>; this result was not, however, found by others <xref rid="pbio.1001914-Wakayama1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.1001914-Oback1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Lemaitre et al. <xref rid="pbio.1001914-Lemaitre1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> have described a dramatic effect of mitosis on the efficiency of DNA replication by egg cytoplasm, but transcription could not be tested in their extract experiments. Egli et al. <xref rid="pbio.1001914-Egli1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> have proposed an important role for mitosis in permitting chromosomal protein exchange in mouse nuclear transfer experiments but not necessarily on gene transcription. Our results are therefore in accord with previous work, but reveal a specific effect of mitosis on gene transcription.</p><p>An important component responsible for the acquisition of mitotic advantage appears to be the removal of ubiquitin from histone H2A or H2B in mitotic chromatin. Ubiquitination of histones is primarily monoubiquitination, and we assume that this is the modification involved in mitotic advantage. H2A ubiquitination on lysine 119 is associated with transcriptional repression, particularly of lineage-specifying genes in ES cells <xref rid="pbio.1001914-Endoh1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, possibly through its association with members of the polycomb repressive proteins <xref rid="pbio.1001914-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. It could be envisaged that the deubiquitination of chromatin seen at mitotic entry permits this mitotic advantage by removing this inhibitory mark or the associated binding proteins <xref rid="pbio.1001914-Joo1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In keeping with this idea, we have been able to partly simulate the mitotic effect by biochemically removing histone ubiquitination in interphase donor cells.</p><p>What could be the significance of the mitotic advantage identified here? In our experiments, the mitotic advantage takes place during the early stages of transcriptional activation, and is no longer seen after 2 d. In normal dividing cells, mitosis lasts for only a few hours. We therefore think that mitosis is a time when cells can most easily change their chromatin state, exchange transcription factors, and embark on a new lineage. When a cell has adopted a new fate, its daughter cells will usually follow the same lineage, unless an exchange of nuclear components takes place. The acceleration of postmitotic transcriptional activation <xref rid="pbio.1001914-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> may be an associated phenomenon.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>Cells were cultured in DMEM (D5796, Sigma; E15-810, PAA; 41965-062, Invitrogen) with 10% FCS (10270106, Invitrogen), 100 units/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin (15140-122, Invitrogen), and 0.25 &#x000b5;g/ml Fungizone (15240-096, Invitrogen).
