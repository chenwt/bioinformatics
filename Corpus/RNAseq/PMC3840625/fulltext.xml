Given that evolutionary adaptation has led to finely tuned traits with narrow physiological limits in these organisms, this system provides a unique opportunity to examine physiological trade-offs and limits of adaptive responses to environmental perturbation. As such, notothenioids have a rich history with respect to studies attempting to understand the vulnerability of polar ecosystems to the negative impacts associated with global climate change. Unfortunately, despite being a model system for understanding physiological adaptations to extreme environments, we still lack fundamental molecular tools for much of the Nototheniidae family.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Specimens of the emerald notothen, <italic>Trematomus bernacchii,</italic> were acclimated for 28&#x000a0;days in flow-through seawater tanks maintained near ambient seawater temperatures (&#x02212;1.5&#x000b0;C) or at +4&#x000b0;C. Following acclimation, tissue specific cDNA libraries for liver, gill and brain were created by pooling RNA from n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5 individuals per temperature treatment. The tissue specific libraries were bar-coded and used for 454 pyrosequencing, which yielded over 700 thousand sequencing reads. A <italic>de novo</italic> assembly and annotation of these reads produced a functional transcriptome library of <italic>T. bernacchii</italic> containing 30,107 unigenes, 13,003 of which possessed significant homology to a known protein product. Digital gene expression analysis of these extremely cold adapted fish reinforced the loss of an inducible heat shock response and allowed the preliminary exploration into other elements of the cellular stress response.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Preliminary exploration of the transcriptome of <italic>T. bernacchii</italic> under elevated temperatures enabled a semi-quantitative comparison to prior studies aimed at characterizing the thermal response of this endemic fish whose size, abundance and distribution has established it as a pivotal species in polar research spanning several decades.</p><p>The comparison of these findings to previous studies demonstrates the efficacy of transcriptomics and digital gene expression analysis as tools in future studies of polar organisms and has greatly increased the available genomic resources for the suborder Notothenioidei, particularly in the Trematominae subfamily.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Perciform fishes of the suborder Notothenioidei comprise a major portion of the Southern Ocean fauna [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. They began to radiate into Antarctic waters in the early Tertiary, gradually adapting to the progressive cooling, which set in after the opening of the Drake passage and the formation of the circumpolar current some 14&#x02013;25 million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Isolation of the Antarctic continental shelf by the Polar Front has produced arguably the coldest, most oceanographically stable environment on the planet. However, in direct opposition to this highly stenothermic environment are the profound environmental extremes produced by the transition from 24&#x000a0;hours of sunlight to complete darkness over the winter months, resulting in significant variation in primary productivity. As a result, Antarctic marine organisms inhabiting these ice-laden waters have faced unique metabolic and physiological challenges for survival and persistence. The impacts of low temperatures and seasonally limited food availability have long been recognized as primary selective forces driving the evolution of the many endemic species found in Antarctica today [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition to the high degree of endemism produced by these evolutionary processes, a wide-array of functional adaptations have been fixed among protein families of several Antarctic fish, including chaperonins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], heat shock proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], heme proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], tubulin kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and anti-freeze proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This rigid oceanographic stability however, may have resulted in an ecosystem filled with endemic fauna that are poorly poised to deal with rapid climate variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For instance, cold specialization has resulted in increased mitochondrial densities at uncompensated capacities in some notothenioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These increased densities have also been combined with reductions in hematocrit and cardiovascular output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Although a significant amount of sequencing work has been done to elucidate the evolutionary history and phylogenetic relationships among these unique fishes, much of the available sequence information is constrained to a few highly conserved genes such as ribosomal and mitochondrial genes, or highly specified genes such as the antifreeze glycoprotein genes. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have lead to a significant increase in the availability of molecular tools to ecologists and physiologists. A particular research niche that is poised to benefit greatly from this rapid increase in sequence data is the field of polar biology. The availability of well-annotated transcriptomes from a variety of polar species will provide the groundwork for future functional genomics studies aimed at elucidating the impact of global climate change on polar ecosystems. With the application of next generation sequencing tools in an ecological setting, we can begin to investigate organismal responses at a level of complexity that was not approachable in years past. To date, only two large-scale sequencing studies of transcribed genes have been published for any Antarctic notothen, including an EST library for <italic>Dissostichus mawsoni</italic> in the subfamily Pleuragramminae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and a comparative study of the transcriptomes from a member of the Nototheniinae and Pleuragramminae sub-families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To date, relatively little sequence information is available for any member of the Trematominae subfamily despite the ecological importance of these fish in coastal Antarctic environments. Due to its circumpolar distribution, abundance and relative ease of collection, <italic>Trematomus bernacchii</italic> has long been a target species for physiological and biochemical studies assessing the plasticity of this highly stenothermic family of fishes and the cost of adaptation to such a cold stable environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. While earlier attempts at using heterologous hybridizations to a cDNA array of a temperate goby provided insight into the transcriptional response of highly conserved genes in this species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], we still lack a robust approach to functional genomics in these unique fish. Here we describe the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly and annotation of the transcriptome of the emerald notothen, <italic>T. bernacchii</italic>. In addition, we provide a glimpse into the tissue specific response to thermal stress at the level of the transcript that highlights the sensitivity and utility of these applications in polar fish.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Sequence data and de novo assembly</title><p>Roche 454 sequencing generated a total of 738,379 unpaired reads across six samples with an average length of 335.80&#x000a0;bp.

Due to the high degree of specificity to the visual process, it is unlikely that this product would be found in the liver, gill or brain tissues that were sequenced in this effort. Another unmatched query represented a partial of E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2; however, six different unigenes (1260, 4958, 15902, 18843, 22152, and 27842) matched E3 ubiquitin ligase-like proteins during annotation. It is likely that this partial query sequence did not overlap with the available assembled sequence of the unigenes, which themselves are not complete representations of the entire coding region of E3 ubiquitin ligases. The last query that failed to align was that of a putative voltage-activated sodium channel alpha subunit (SCNA), which are functionally conserved and have lengths ranging between 3300-3500&#x000a0;bp in teleost fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].

Enzyme code distributions for each tissue calculated by the main enzyme classes: oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lysases, isomerases, demonstrated a similar pattern of enzyme activity across tissues. The distribution being: liver (359, 542, 559, 74, 71, 127), gill (252, 269, 308, 39, 44, 72) and brain (245, 355, 377, 52, 59, 93) respectively (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>: Figure S1).

It should be noted, that this study was not designed to explicitly test the effects of temperature on gene expression, since RNA from individuals within a thermal acclimation treatment was pooled prior to library construction. However, an initial qualitative comparison can be performed, and the results compared to previous studies that have performed more quantitative gene expression analyses. To simplify the expression analysis for comparison of tissue specific changes in gene expression across treatments, we limited our consideration to only those unigenes annotated with either a BLAST result, functional mapping, or full GO annotation. We then characterized the relative changes in tissue specific expression patterns in &#x02212;1.5&#x000b0;C (control) and +4&#x000b0;C acclimated fish. After screening to remove data pairs that did not exhibit expression in either treatment, we achieved our final expression datasets for each tissue. In all, the expression levels of 6,656 unigene pairs were compared in the liver in which we found 1,685 unigenes were down-regulated 2-fold or greater while 3,862 were found to be up-regulated 2-fold or greater (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Table S7).

For expression analysis of the brain tissue we compared the expression levels of 9,044 unigene pairs, of which 3,347 were down-regulated and 3,965 were up-regulated at least 2-fold (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Table S7).</p><p>Below we discuss the general gene expression trends that emerged from our preliminary RNAseq analyses with respect to the most highly expressed gene families under ambient conditions. In addition, in order to more fully interpret the effects of long-term acclimation to elevated temperatures on <italic>T. bernacchii</italic>, we extended our analysis beyond that of the most highly represented gene families, and in doing so, focused on three particular areas that encompass the cellular response to elevated temperature observed in <italic>T. bernacchii</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue specific gene expression profiles under ambient conditions</title><p>Prior studies characterizing the gene expression profiles of nothothenioid fishes held under ambient conditions found tissue specific transcriptomes that were dominated by a few highly expressed transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We found a similar pattern among our tissues sampled from <italic>T. bernacchii</italic>, albeit to a lesser degree with the 10 most highly expressed annotated unigenes in the liver, gill and brain tissues representing ~8.2%, ~3.2% and ~2.67% of total transcripts respectively (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Table S7). Similar to results reported for the liver transcriptome of <italic>D. mawsoni</italic>, we found apolipoproteins and fibrogen chains were among the most highly expressed genes in the liver of <italic>T. bernacchii</italic> under ambient conditions (14 kda apolipoprotein&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.19%, apolipoprotein A-I&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.66%, apolipoprotein b-like protein&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.57%, and fibrogen &#x003b1; chain-like&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.70% of total transcripts) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This over-representation appears to be further exaggerated by long-term acclimation to elevated temperatures. Analysis of the liver transcriptome of fish acclimated to +4&#x000b0;C for 28&#x000a0;days showed apolipoproteins were considerably up-regulated with the 14 kda apoliprotein undergoing a 7.1-fold increase to represent 5.10% of all transcripts and apolipoprotein A-I undergoing a 11.5-fold increase to represent 4.65% of all transcripts (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Table S7). Given their role in lipid mobilization and transport, it seems plausible this significant increase in apolopiproteins is playing an important role in offsetting the rapid increase in metabolic demands previously associated with the acclimatory response of <italic>T. bernacchii</italic> to elevated temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>In addition, we found similar patterns of gene expression in the brain tissue of <italic>T. bernacchii</italic> as those found in <italic>D. mawsoni.</italic> Chen and colleagues report a number of transcripts that are involved in the protection, maintenance and repair of neural tissue, including S100&#x003b2; and ependymin-1, which are highly represented in the transcriptome of <italic>D. mawsoni</italic> brain tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Under ambient temperature conditions, S100&#x003b2; and ependymin-1 comprise 0.30% and 0.18% respectively of the expressed genes in <italic>T. bernacchii</italic> brain tissue, and when exposed to a thermal stress, the expression of these two transcripts increased significantly. In fish acclimated to +4&#x000b0;C, S100&#x003b2; increase over 13-fold, representing 2.21% of all expressed transcripts and ependymin-1 increased by greater than 7-fold to represent ~2% of all expressed transcripts in the brain (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Table S7). Although only semi-quantitative at this point, these data suggest <italic>T. bernacchii</italic> maintain a strong capacity to respond to environmental conditions perturbing to neural function.</p><p>The gill tissue displayed a somewhat different trend with respect to the highly expressed transcripts found in the ambient and +4&#x000b0;C acclimated fish. In the gill tissue from fish acclimated to +4&#x000b0;C, we saw an overall down-regulation of many of the most highly expressed transcripts found in ambient fish including, 60s ribosomal proteins (8.8-fold), zinc finger proteins (14.3-fold), MAPKs (4.7-fold) and translation initiation factor eif2b (3.4-fold) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Table S7). Interestingly, many of these genes were reported to show a moderate up-regulation (&#x0003c;1.5-fold) after an acute heat shock event (4&#x000a0;h at +4&#x000b0;C) in a previous study employing a transcriptome wide analysis of <italic>T. bernacchii</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The differences in gene expression profiles between these two studies likely capture the transition that occurs between immediate response to stress and the long-term physiological adjustments that follow. The general down-regulation of gene families involved in transcription and translation in our long-term treatment may indicate a diminished capacity for protein turnover at elevated temperatures. However, despite a general down-regulation of one of the cells major energy consuming pathways in the gill tissue, we see a 2.5-fold up-regulation of cytochrome c oxidase I and a 1.5-fold up-regulation of cytochrome b (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Table S7) which mirrors the increased capacity for aerobic metabolism found under conditions of acute thermal stress in <italic>T. bernacchii</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These findings, along with the strong up-regulation of apolipoproteins in the liver, suggest that mobilization of energy stores and ATP production continue to play a central role in the capacity of <italic>T. bernacchii</italic> to mitigate the effects of elevated temperatures long-after cellular restructuring has likely occurred.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein homeostasis and the heat shock response (HSR)</title><p>Heat shock proteins (HSPs) have long been known to play a significant role in folding of nascent polypeptides as well as the rescue and refolding of proteins under conditions of cellular stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Despite the functional roles for these protein families being highly conserved across all taxa, Antarctic notothenioids display divergent expression patterns that might be related to environmental constraints. Previous studies have observed that inducible HSP isoforms and protein-specific chaperones are continuously up-regulated in several notothenioid species, potentially indicating a persistent system-wide requirement for mitigating the denaturing effect of the constant cold of the Southern Ocean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. As a result of this persistent elevation of the heat shock response (HSR), it is believed that the extremely cold adapted notothenioids, including <italic>T. bernacchii,</italic> are no longer capable of further up-regulating inducible isoforms of HSPs when exposed to thermal stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To see if similar trends were identified in our long-term acclimations of <italic>T. bernacchii</italic>, we compared the level of expression for several molecular chaperones involved in the HSR. Two particular HSPs previously found to be up-regulated in fish exposed to chronic high temperature are Hsp70 and Hsp90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Consistent with previous findings for acute thermal stresses, we found that Hsp70 expression was generally insensitive to long-term acclimation at elevated temperature with only moderate changes detected (&#x02264; 1.5-fold in all tissues, Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Similarly, the inducible isoform of Hsp90 (Hsp90&#x003b1;) also showed only small variations in expression in all three tissues (liver 1-fold, gill 1.7-fold, brain 1.4-fold) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Also seen with the Hsp70 molecular chaperone, gill tissue appeared to be the most responsive, which may be attributable to the direct contact of these cells to the water and thus environmental variations. Overall, our findings for the expression patterns of HSPs in <italic>T. bernacchii</italic> reflect previous findings and further substantiate the belief that much of its ability to mount a HSR has been lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Intriguingly, although no significant changes were seen in the inducible HSP isoforms, we did observe a significant decrease in expression levels of the constitutive isoform, Hsc71, in liver and gill (2.7 &#x00026; 3.7-fold respectively). This down-regulation of Hsc71 was also accompanied by moderate decreases in the constitutively expressed Hsp90&#x003b2; (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Differential expression of Heat Shock Protein families in </bold><bold><italic>T. bernacchii.</italic></bold> Relative fold-change in expression of annotated HSPs in +4&#x000b0;C acclimated fish compared to control fish were obtained from the RNAseq analysis and directly compared across liver (grey), gill (blue) and brain (red).

Although sHSPs are known have similar cytoprotective effects as those found with larger size class molecular chaperones, they are often found expressed in lower abundances and in some instances their function may be non-essential for cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In our study, we found the sHPSs showed tissue specific responses with sHSPs in the liver displaying the greatest magnitude change. After acclimation to +4&#x000b0;C, transcript levels for Hsp27/B1, Hsp30/B11 and &#x003b1;-crystallin all showed a 2-fold or greater up-regulation in liver tissue. However, in gill and brain tissue expression of these sHSPs were either not detected or down-regulated, except in the case of &#x003b1;-crystallin in the brain tissue which displayed a 3-fold increase (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>: Table S7).</p><p>As this is only a preliminary characterization of the transcriptome of <italic>T. bernacchii</italic> under chronic thermal stress, we are unable to elucidate the importance of the trends identified with respect to the expression of HSPs. However, in combination with the expression patterns of the transcriptional machinery mentioned above, we speculate this could be related to an overall decrease in transcription with long-term acclimation to elevated temperatures, potentially as a means to conserve energy. We have previously shown metabolic rates in <italic>T. bernacchii</italic> are initially elevated when acclimated to +4&#x000b0;C but gradually return to baseline levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. A general reduction in transcription rates could represent physiological trade-offs associated with long-term physiological adjustments necessary to reduce the cellular demand for oxygen. Alternatively, these reductions in capacity for protein synthesis and chaperoning may represent hallmarks of temperature compensation at the cellular level in these fish. These results represent potentially novel insight into the thermal acclimation of these fish and highlight the sensitivity and utility of these approaches for understanding physiological responses in this system.</p></sec><sec><title>Cellular stress response (CSR)</title><p>The cellular stress response (CSR) is a conserved defense reaction activated at the cellular level when exterior forces cause strain on an organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The heat shock proteins that serve as molecular chaperones and the HSR described above are probably the most well-known constituents of the CSR, but there are a number of additional cellular pathways involved in the cell&#x02019;s response to stress that are likely co-regulated, including: redox regulation proteins, DNA damage sensing/repair proteins, protein degradation proteins, fatty acid/lipid metabolism proteins and energy metabolism proteins [see 49]. Notothenioid fishes are known to significantly elevate their resting metabolic rates at these temperatures, which could in turn lead to a significant increase in the potential for oxidative damage to macro molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus, in organisms adapted to extreme environments such as the notothenioids where the HSR has largely been lost, these additional CSR mechanisms could play a more significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis.</p><p>The alteration of cellular redox potential due to stress is a major trigger of the CSR and the expression of certain reductases, redoxins and dehydrogenases signify a robust CSR to changing conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. We analyzed these redox regulators using our dataset to provide preliminary insight into the broader CSR of <italic>T. bernacchii</italic>. Each tissue demonstrated a general trend of up-regulation of redox regulators with all but three of the annotated redox regulators being up-regulated in at least two tissues (aldehyde reductase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase), and 4 of 8 up-regulated in all three tissues (thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin, superoxide dismutase, succinate dehydrogenase) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The brain tissue displayed the greatest magnitude of response for redox regulators, with 7 of 8 redox regulators up-regulated 2-fold or greater compared to the liver in which only 5 were found up-regulated and only 1 redox regulator up-regulated 2-fold or more (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

When subjecting the killifish (<italic>Austrofundulus limneaus</italic>) to heat shock conditions, the killifish responded by reducing its expression of HMGB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The expression levels of HMGB1 in <italic>T. bernacchii</italic> support the idea that HMGB1 is highly responsive to temperature and may serve as a gene expression temperature sensor in fish. However, HMGB1 expression patterns in <italic>T. bernacchii</italic> dramatically differ with those reported for <italic>A. limneaus</italic>. We found HMGB1 undergoes substantial up-regulation when exposed to chronic thermal stress, not down-regulation as seen in the killifish. In all three tissues characterized in this study, HMGB1 showed a 2-fold or greater increase in expressed transcripts when acclimated to elevated temperatures. If we consider the functional role of HMGB1 we might be able to draft some potential insight into these contradictory results.</p><p>HMGB1 has two functional roles, an intra-nuclear function where it positively regulates transcription by affecting chromatin structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], and an intracellular role (demonstrated in human models) where it can stimulate the inflammatory process by stimulating cytokines from endothelial cells, monocytes and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. <italic>T. bernacchii</italic> may be increasing intracellular levels of HMGB1 during exposure to elevated temperatures to increase transcription rates, restructure membrane components and increase aerobic capacity in an effort to meet an elevated demand for oxygen associated with acclimation to these temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Alternatively, it is possible that the increased expression of HMGB1 is a result of inflammation due to cellular damage sustained from the +4&#x000b0;C acclimation temperature. While it is unclear if the differences in HMGB1 regulation in <italic>T. bernacchii</italic> and <italic>A. limneaus</italic> are representative of the adaptive differences between the species, or potentially related to the difference in acclimation times used within the two studies, these data further supports the case for HMGB1 as an important regulator of thermal stress response in fish.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>To our knowledge this is the first large-scale effort aimed at sequencing and assembling the transcriptome of a species from the ecologically important subfamily Trematominae.

Lastly, the tissue specific libraries from each thermal acclimation treatment were barcoded with MID-tags and pyrosequencing was carried out using Titanium FLX chemistry on a Roche GS-FLX 454 sequencer by the engencore facility at the University of South Carolina.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence filtering, <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, and assembly validation</title><p>To maximize the relatively high accuracy of Roche GS-FLX 454 sequencing and to ensure a more accurate <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly we accepted sequences for assembly only after a stringent quality control and trimming process. The 454 sequence primers for the plus strand (CGTATCGCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAG) and for the minus strand (CTATGCGCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAG) were removed. Sequences were then screened for ambiguity and quality; all sequences of low quality (limit&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) or with more than three consecutive ambiguous nucleotides were trimmed or removed if no untrimmed sequence remained.</p><p><italic>De novo</italic> assembly was conducted using the CLC Genomics Workbench <italic>de novo</italic> assembly tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. A word size of 21 and bubble size of 320 were selected as parameters because of the relatively high accuracy of 454 sequencing and the moderate coverage depth (roughly 8X based upon the expectation of 30,000 genes within the transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], an average gene length of 1,350 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], and ~250,000,000 total bases sequenced) to maximize accuracy and unigene length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].

The distribution of the <italic>e</italic>-value and greatest percent identity between unigene query and protein result was gathered and greatest percent identity charted to demonstrate the quality and accuracy of the resulting <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly. A BLAST comparison was also conducted against 9 previously sequenced teleost fish including <italic>Notothenia coriiceps, Chaenocephalus aceratus, Pleuragramma antarcticum, Gasterosteus aculeatus, Takifugu rubripes, Oryzias latipes, Tetraodon nigroviridis, Oreochromis niloticus</italic> and <italic>Danio rerio</italic> to further validate the transcriptome assembly.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptome annotation and analysis</title><p>The resulting unigenes were loaded in the B2GO software package for further analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Using the unigenes as query sequences, BLASTx searches were conducted against the non-redundant protein sequences (nr) database and BLASTn searches were conducted against nucleotide collection (nr/nt) database at NCBI, the acceptance cutoff was an <italic>e</italic>-value of 10<sup>-3</sup>. Unigenes with BLAST results were mapped and annotated using the mapping and annotation functions of B2GO. InterProScan searches were conducted for each unigene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] and all annotation information was merged into the B2GO interface generating our final gene ontology (GO) annotations. GO annotations were exported from B2GO in Web Gene Ontology (WEGO) format and input into the BGI WEGO Annotation Plotting tool to provide the gene ontology distribution of the <italic>T. bernacchii</italic> transcriptome at GO level 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Pathway assignments were determined using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database (KEGG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] using a BLASTx threshold cutoff of 10<sup>-5</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue specific gene expression</title><p>Reads from each tissue (liver, gill and brain) and treatment (&#x02212;1.5&#x000b0;C control and +4&#x000b0;C acclimated fish) were individually analyzed to characterize the functional representation of expressed genes. The CLC Genomics Workbench RNAseq analysis tool was employed to calculate read expression for each sample using the unigene library as the reference transcriptome. The sequencing reads from each tissue were mapped back to the reference unigenes based upon a minimum similarity of 0.9 and length fraction of 0.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Any unigene with at least one successfully mapped sequencing read from either treatment was deemed expressed in that tissue sample. Expressed unigene subsets were created for each tissue type in B2GO to provide tissue specific gene ontology and used to generate a graphical comparison of the transcriptome and tissue specific gene ontology. Furthermore, the enzyme code distribution for each tissue was generated using B2GO and compared between tissues. Lastly, the pathway assignments of the expressed unigenes in each tissue were determined using the KEGG database with a BLASTx <italic>e</italic>-value cutoff of 10<sup>-5</sup> and compared between the full transcriptome and specific tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Digital gene expression analysis</title><p>The results obtained from the RNAseq analysis of the control and heat shock groups of each tissue were input into the Transcriptomics Experimental Design Tool within the CLC Genomics Workbench to generate a paired samples expression analysis for each tissue.

Experimental pairs were annotated using the annotated unigene transcriptome library.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contribution</title><p>SP conceived the study, conducted the temperature acclimation experiments, procured the sequencing data, advised in the assembly, annotation, classification of the data, and the digital gene expression analysis.
