Here, we take advantage of a unique opportunity to examine the population diversity of thousands of ORFans, based on a collection of 35 complete genomes of isolates of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic> (which is included phylogenetically within <italic>E. coli</italic>). As expected from previous studies, ORFans are shorter and AT-richer in sequence than non-ORFans. We find that ORFans often are very narrowly distributed: the most common pattern is for an ORFan to be found in only one genome. We compared within-species population diversity of ORFan genes with those of two control groups of non-ORFan genes. Patterns of population variation suggest that most ORFans are not artifacts, but encode real genes whose protein-coding capacity is conserved, reflecting selection against nonsynonymous mutations. Nevertheless, nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity is higher than for non-ORFans, whereas synonymous diversity is roughly the same. In particular, there is a several-fold excess of ORFans in the highest decile of diversity relative to controls, which might be due to weaker purifying selection, positive selection, or a subclass of ORFans that are decaying.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ORFan</kwd><kwd>lineage-specific genes</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>population genetics</kwd><kwd>positive selection</kwd><kwd>negative selection</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Two decades ago, protein biochemists supposed that the universe of proteins would be limited to a modest number of distinctive types, for example, a thousand different folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B7">Chothia 1992</xref>). However, new kinds of proteins continued to appear, often in the form of &#x0201c;orphans&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;singletons&#x0201d; that could not be matched to any known proteins. In the past decade, sequencing of bacterial genomes led to the discovery of huge numbers of so-called ORFans or ORFan genes, open reading frames (ORFs) encoding orphan proteins, that is, proteins with no known relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B38">Wilson et al. 2005</xref>). The high frequency of ORFans in newly determined bacterial genomes originally was attributed to limited sampling of genomes. Indeed, as more genomes are sequenced, the fraction of genes in a given genome that are designated as ORFans can never increase, but only decrease when a relative is discovered. However, a comparative analysis of 122 bacterial genomes indicated that the total number of different kinds of ORFans was increasing linearly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B38">Wilson et al. 2005</xref>).</p><p>Some descriptive generalities about these ORFans emerge from previous studies. ORFans are found in almost all the bacterial genomes, except some small genomes of intracellular parasites or endosymbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B38">Wilson et al. 2005</xref>). ORFans tend to be more AT-rich than sequences with a broader phylogenetic distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B5">Charlebois et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B10">Daubin and Ochman 2004</xref>). On average, ORFans tend to be shorter than genes with a broader phylogenetic distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B10">Daubin and Ochman 2004</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies have addressed the possible origins of ORFans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B31">Ohno 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B23">Logsdon and Doolittle 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B30">Ochman et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B24">Long 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B25">Long et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B10">Daubin and Ochman 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B36">Wang et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B14">Hahn and Lee 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B40">Yin and Fischer 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B41">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B32">Rancurel et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B34">Toll-Riera et al. 2009</xref>). One type of explanation is that ORFans are not real genes, but artifacts of annotation, resulting from the algorithms used to detect coding sequences in genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B10">Daubin and Ochman 2004</xref>). Another possibility is that ORFan genes, although real, are not true orphans, but have evolved so rapidly that their family affinity cannot be discerned. Although rapid evolution by amino acid replacements alone seems unlikely to explain the status of ORFans, they may have undergone more radical evolutionary changes, such as frameshifts or rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B14">Hahn and Lee 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B3">Cai and Petrov 2010</xref>). Finally, it may be that ORFans represent newly acquired genes, having arisen either de novo from noncoding sequences or having been acquired by lateral gene transfer from an uncharacterized source, for example, unknown prokaryotes or bacteriophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B30">Ochman et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B40">Yin and Fischer 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B19">Knowles and McLysaght 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B34">Toll-Riera et al. 2009</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies suggest that a small proportion of human-specific genes or primate-specific genes originated from noncoding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B19">Knowles and McLysaght 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B34">Toll-Riera et al. 2009</xref>). Recent studies in archaeal, bacterial, and viral genomes suggest that a proportion of ORFans likely originated via horizontal gene transfer from distant cellular sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B41">Yin and Fischer 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B8">Cortez et al. 2009</xref>). It has been argued that the AT-richness of ORFans reflects lateral transfer from AT-rich bacteriophage genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B9">Daubin et al. 2003</xref>), or that it reflects misannotation of intergenic regions, on the grounds that such regions often are AT-rich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B5">Charlebois et al. 2003</xref>). The shortness of ORFans also suggests the possibility of misannotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B29">Ochman 2002</xref>).</p><p>The emerging consensus seems to be that ORFans largely represent an influx of relatively impermanent sequences from bacteriophages and other mobile elements. Whether this consensus will prove correct, it leaves open the question of how ORFans are evolving within a species. On the one hand, they might be undergoing slow regression if their similarity to real genes is merely accidental (if they are annotation artifacts) or merely historical (e.g., if they are nonfunctional remnants of past bacteriophage infections). On the other hand, they might be rapidly evolving genes responsible for lineage-specific adaptation; or they might be conserved genes responsible for lineage-specific features of morphology or physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B17">Khalturin et al. 2008</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we begin to address the evolution of ORFans, as distinct from the origins of ORFans, by taking advantage of the fact that there are thousands of ORFans available in several dozens of complete <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> genomes. Although conventional taxonomy associates a number of these genomes with the genus <italic>Shigella</italic>, known <italic>Shigella</italic> genomes cluster phylogenetically within a much larger set of known set of <italic>E. coli</italic> genomes, with other <italic>Escherichia</italic> species as outgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B35">Touchon et al. 2009</xref>). For this reason, when we refer to <italic>E. coli</italic> later, we mean to include isolates designated conventionally as <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>Shigella</italic> while excluding other <italic>Escherichia</italic> species (e.g., <italic>E. fergusoni</italic>).</p><p>Here, we examine the population diversity of ORFans in <italic>E. coli</italic> (i.e., <italic>E. coli</italic> plus <italic>Shigella</italic>) as compared with that of two sets of progressively older and more widely distributed non-ORFan genes. This approach allows us to control for the idiosyncratic ages and distributions of ORFans by comparing them only with clusters pruned to have a matching set of strains. As expected, we find that ORFans are shorter and more AT-rich than non-ORFans. ORFans tend to have a very narrow distribution among <italic>E. coli</italic> genomes, with most of them being found in only a single genome. The majority of ORFan genes appear to be conserved, at least in the short term, as judged by the overall tendency toward lower nonsynonymous diversity than synonymous diversity among those ORFans present in more than one genome. However, nonsynonymous diversity is higher than for non-ORFans, and in particular shows an excess of high-diversity clusters of ORFan genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Sequences, Clusters, Alignments, and Function Annotations</title><p>Clusters of homologous sequences used in this study ultimately derive from the Protein Clusters database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B18">Klimke et al. 2009</xref>), a collection of automatically clustered Reference Sequence proteins from complete genomes (of prokaryotes, plasmids, viruses, organelles, and complete and incomplete genomes of protozoa and plants).

As a result, every ORFan gene cluster has its own matching sets of t1 and t2 clusters pruned to have precisely the same strain composition, for example, if a particular ORFan cluster has the four sequences from genomes A, B, C, and D, then all of its non-ORFan control clusters are pruned to contain only the four sequences from A, B, C, and D. If a control cluster could not be pruned due to the absence of a matching strain, it was discarded.

Instead, the distribution of values for ORFans was compared with those of non-ORFans in two ways. One mode of comparison uses Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test or the Wilcoxon test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B26">Moore and McCabe 2002</xref>), with a significance level of 5%. Each ORFan has a (typically different) number of control clusters, and thus the number of compared values is unequal, with ORFans being compared with a larger number of non-ORFan controls that are hierarchically structured (one set of t1 or t2 control clusters for each ORFan cluster). Thus, when comparing ORFan clusters to non-ORFan controls, we randomly pick a single control cluster for each ORFan to compute a mean and variance, so that the <italic>t</italic>-test or Wilcoxon test is carried out on a nonstructured sample. Then, this calculation is repeated 1,000 times. If the majority of replicates indicate a significant difference, then the expected value of the test statistic is significant, and thus we treat the difference as significant.</p><p>The second mode of comparison is by ranking the statistics of each ORFan gene in its customized non-ORFan control group. The number of control clusters is not large enough in many cases to create smooth distributions for purposes of percentile ranking; therefore, we divide the control distribution into 10 bins, that is, deciles rather than percentiles. In order not to sacrifice statistical power, decile-based ranking is performed only for ORFans that have a customized non-ORFan control group with more than 99 clusters. Note that the first decile bin is the top 10% of the non-ORFan control distribution. An ORFan value ranked in the first decile bin of the t1 or t2 reference distribution is in the highest 10% of values, whereas an ORFan value ranked in the 10th decile bin is in the lowest 10% of values.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>ORFans as a Feature of Genome Composition</title><p>A summary of the composition of 35 genomes is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="evs081-T1">table 1</xref>.

This reveals a clear relationship. The number of proteins for which functions have been inferred [in the original Protein Clusters database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B18">Klimke et al. 2009</xref>)] remains relatively constant despite a 40% increase in size from the smallest to the largest genomes. Instead, the increase in genome size is attributable to genes (or putative genes) that lack functional annotations. Thus, differences in the complement of genes carried by an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain are not due primarily to duplication of long-established genes that are widely distributed and well annotated, but are overwhelmingly due to gain of genes that are poorly known. A minority of these genes are ORFans, found only in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<italic>Shigella</italic>).

The solid squares show the counts of ORFans, the vast majority of which are noncurated (see text). As genome size increases, the number of proteins with assigned functions remains nearly constant.

Specifically, the distribution of numbers of nonsynonymous polymorphisms in ORFan clusters is as follows: 0 (polymorphisms): 792 (clusters); 1: 264; 2: 187; 3: 128; 4: 86; 5: 83; 6: 68; 7: 59; 8: 44; 9: 37; and &#x0003e;9: 472. The counts for synonymous polymorphisms are 0: 938; 1: 271; 2: 133; 3: 76; 4: 76; 5: 51; 6: 52; 7: 33; 8: 27; 9: 31; &#x0003e;9: 532.</p><p>Given that some clusters have a d<italic>S</italic> value of zero, the difference between d<italic>N</italic> and d<italic>S</italic> was calculated, instead of the more conventional d<italic>N</italic>/d<italic>S</italic> ratio. ORFans that represent real protein-coding genes typically would be expected to show the pattern typical of real protein-coding genes, which is that d<italic>S</italic> exceeds d<italic>N</italic>; for ORFans that represent pseudogenes or misannotated regions, the expected values of d<italic>N</italic> and d<italic>S</italic> are the same; ORFans undergoing adaptive evolution are expected to have higher d<italic>N</italic> value than d<italic>S</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B16">Hurst 2002</xref>).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="evs081-T3">table 3</xref>, most ORFan, t1 and t2 clusters have d<italic>N</italic> less than d<italic>S</italic>.

This is shown by the fact that approximately 23% of ORFan clusters and 17% of t1 clusters have equal d<italic>N</italic> and d<italic>S</italic>. These clusters are nonpolymorphic in <italic>E. coli</italic> and have d<italic>N</italic> = d<italic>S</italic> = 0, presumably because the clusters are very small. Most ORFan clusters have fewer than five sequences, while clusters of such small size are vanishingly rare in the t2 group of genes that have been present for millions of years in the lineage leading to <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>To correct for these differences in cluster size, we created matched comparison clusters as described (earlier, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evs081-F2">fig. 2</xref>). The results of the cluster-size-corrected comparisons of diversity statistics are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evs081-F6">figure 6</xref>, and with more detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evs081-F7">figure 7</xref>. ORFans show a higher mean value of Pi than genes in the t1 and t2 groups, though only the difference with t2 is significant. Both Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test and the Wilcoxon test indicate that the average d<italic>S</italic> value of ORFan gene group is significantly lower than t1 group and not significantly different from t2 group. Average d<italic>N</italic> value of ORFan gene group is higher than t1 and t2 group. According to the Wilcoxon test, the difference between ORFans and t1 group, ORFans and t2 group is significant. According to Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test, the difference between ORFans and t1 group is not significant; the difference between ORFans and t2 group is significant. The result suggests that ORFan gene group show similar or lower d<italic>S</italic> value, but higher d<italic>N</italic> value than t1 or t2 gene group.

The three rows show the distributions for pi (upper), dS (middle) and dN (lower), for both t1 (left column) and t2 (right column) control sets. To understand the shape of the distribution of population statistics for ORFans, values for ORFans were gathered into decile bins defined by the non-ORFan control clusters, that is, each bin comprises 10% of the distribution of non-ORFan values. The value on the <italic>Y</italic> axis for the first decile bin in (<italic>A</italic>), for instance, represents the frequency with which the Pi value for an ORFan ranks in the top 10% of the values in its customized t1 control group. (<italic>C</italic>, <italic>E</italic>) The same comparison for d<italic>N</italic> and d<italic>S</italic>; (<italic>B</italic>, <italic>D</italic>, and <italic>F</italic>) the distribution of Pi, d<italic>N</italic>, and d<italic>S</italic> (respectively) relative to the t2 comparison group. The null expectation is a straight line at a value of 10%, with a slight anomaly at the low (right) end of the distribution due to zero values (in cases where zero values exceed 10% of the control distribution, zero values in the ORFan distribution will be placed in whichever bin is counted first, which in this case tends to leave a shortage in the last bin). The symmetric but slightly U-shaped distribution of d<italic>S</italic> values indicates that ORFans exhibit greater variance, but otherwise have the same distribution of synonymous differences as non-ORFans. However, the deviation from the distribution of d<italic>N</italic> (and Pi) values is asymmetric, with a 2-fold or more excess of ORFan clusters with diversity in the top 10% or 20% of the distribution relative to non-ORFan controls.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="evs081f7p"/></fig></p><p>To dissect these differences in more detail, we ranked ORFan values relative to their matched controls, using deciles (rather than percentiles, due to the limited number of control clusters for each ORFan). This allows the data from all ORFans to be combined via rankings, even though each ORFan has a different control distribution. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evs081-F7">figure 7</xref>. The symmetric but slightly U-shaped distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evs081-F7">figure 7</xref><italic>E</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evs081-F7">7</xref><italic>F</italic> suggest that synonymous variation in ORFs is distributed very similarly to that in non-ORFans, and differs only in having somewhat greater stochastic variance, as expected given that ORFans are approximately three-fourth the size of non-ORFans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evs081-F4">fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>). The difference between ORFans and non-ORFans for d<italic>N</italic> (and Pi) is much more marked and asymmetric, being skewed to the left, toward higher values. The ORFan distribution has a substantial excess of values in the top one or two deciles, relative to the distribution expected from examining non-ORFans. For the comparison of d<italic>N</italic> values with the t2 comparison group, there is approximately a 5-fold excess of ORFans in the first decile. That is, the most unusual feature of ORFans, considered as a class of probable genes, is the presence of a large subclass of ORFans with high nonsynonymous diversity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results given above on the genic features of ORFans, and the composition of genomes with respect to ORFans, are largely confirmatory. Our results show that approximately 19% of genes per genome are <italic>E. coli</italic> lineage-specific genes. As expected from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B5">Charlebois et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B10">Daubin and Ochman 2004</xref>), ORFans, as a class, are slightly shorter and more AT-rich than older and more widely distributed genes.</p><p>What is more distinctive about the present study is the use of a population sample to study within-species diversity in ORFans. The set of available genomes, of course, is not in any sense a random sample of the <italic>E. coli</italic> population, but instead is heavily biased toward strains of relevance to technology (i.e., laboratory strains) and medicine (i.e., pathogenic strains). Nevertheless, the set of available genomes is a subset of the population that includes considerable diversity, and is worthy of study. Our analysis has some bearing on two issues, the origins of ORFans, and their subsequent evolution in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><sec><title>Origins of ORFans</title><p>A few tentative conclusions are possible regarding the possible origins of ORFans, which might emerge as annotation artifacts, horizontally acquired genes, de novo genes, or highly diverged homologs of much older genes. The distribution of ORFans among genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evs081-F3">fig. 3</xref>) argues against the idea that ORFans may represent members of well known protein families whose affinities remain undetected due to rapid divergence. Specifically, the number of curated proteins remains roughly constant as the number of ORFans increases, whereas if ORFans frequently represent highly diverged genes, we would expect this number to decrease (if old genes diverge in situ into unrecognizable ORFans) or to increase (if old genes frequently spawn duplicates that eventually diverge unrecognizably into ORFans, we would expect to see a contingent of rapidly diverging duplicates that are not yet unrecognizably diverged).</p><p>The distribution of sequence diversity statistics holds other clues that we would interpret as follows. The t2 group consists (presumably) entirely of real genes, and nearly all clusters have d<italic>N</italic> &#x0003c; d<italic>S</italic>. Most ORFan clusters also have d<italic>N</italic> &#x0003c; d<italic>S</italic>. Specifically, approximately two-thirds of the time, the d<italic>N</italic> &#x02013; d<italic>S</italic> value is negative (<xref ref-type="table" rid="evs081-T3">table 3</xref>). This might suggest that at least two-third of the ORFans are legitimate genes. However, no such simple conclusion is possible given the potential for statistical noise in d<italic>N</italic> &#x02013; d<italic>S</italic>. For the ORFan group, most clusters have fewer than six sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evs081-F5">fig. 5</xref>), and the resulting small chance of finding polymorphisms results in many cases of d<italic>N</italic> = d<italic>S</italic> = 0, whereas for the t2 group, most clusters have over two dozen sequences, and there are no cases of d<italic>N</italic> = d<italic>S</italic> = 0. If there is some fraction of ORFans that are pseudogenes for which the expected values of d<italic>N</italic> and d<italic>S</italic> are equal, then due to the low frequency of polymorphisms, there will be some cases of d<italic>N</italic> = d<italic>S</italic> = 0, along with cases in which the d<italic>N</italic> &#x02013; d<italic>S</italic> value deviates stochastically in the positive or negative direction. For instance, if we look at the ORFan and t2 rows in <xref ref-type="table" rid="evs081-T3">table 3</xref>, one interpretation is that one-fourth of the ORFans are real genes (like t2 genes) with negative d<italic>N</italic> &#x02013; d<italic>S</italic>, while the other three-fourths are misannotated genes with d<italic>N</italic> &#x02013; d<italic>S</italic> values distributed equally among positive, negative, and zero values.</p><p>This interpretation is difficult to sustain if one considers the t1 group. The t1 group includes genes that, albeit young compared with t2 genes, have been around for tens of millions of years, and thus the t1 group presumably includes no artifacts. Yet, t1 clusters do not have the same size distribution as t2 clusters, but instead are intermediate, with most t1 clusters being in only a minority of the <italic>E. coli</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evs081-F5">fig. 5</xref>). This suggests that genes in the t1 group are more frequently lost than those in the t2 group. That the t1 clusters are different in character from the t2 clusters is clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evs081-F6">figure 6</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evs081-F6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evs081-F7">7</xref> show that, when we correct for the sizes of clusters, ORFan clusters are very much like t1 clusters, and are rather unlike t2 clusters, in their distribution of d<italic>N</italic> and Pi.</p><p>Whatever the reason for the narrower distributions of t1 clusters, the d<italic>N</italic> &#x02013; d<italic>S</italic> value is negative only four-fifths of the time, whereas for t2 genes it is nearly always negative. If ORFans are composed of a fraction <bold>f</bold> of artifacts for which the distribution of positive and negative d<italic>N</italic> &#x02013; d<italic>S</italic> values is 1:1 (i.e., assuming for the sake of approximation that random deviations from 0 are symmetric), and some fraction <bold>1 &#x02212; </bold><bold>f</bold> of genes with a 1:4 ratio like t1 genes, <bold>f</bold> could not be greater than one-half, otherwise the ratio of positive to negative values would be more than the observed 1:2 ratio (i.e., it would be more like the 1:1 ratio expected for pseudogenes).</p><p>Thus, although the interpretation is not straightforward, the results presented here suggest that most ORFans are functional genes rather than artifacts of misannotation, and that they do not arise by radical divergence from well-known sequence families. This suggestion that most ORFans encode functional proteins, if correct, is corroborated by evidence from some other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B2">Benson et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B1">Awano et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B4">Cai et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B6">Chen et al. 2010</xref>). For instance, gene BSC4 in <italic>Sacch</italic><italic>a</italic><italic>romyces cerevisiae</italic>, which is found de novo created from noncoding sequence, is found to be involved in the DNA repair pathway during the stationary phase of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and contribute to the robustness of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, when shifted to a nutrient-poor environment.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Diversification of ORFans in</italic> E. coli</title><p>Both in bacteria and eukaryotes, lineage-specific genes are seen to evolve at a faster rate than broadly distributed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B11">Domazet-Loso and Tautz 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B10">Daubin and Ochman 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B37">Wang et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B21">Kuo et al. 2008</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B10">Daubin and Ochman (2004)</xref> found that genes that are restricted to <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> evolve faster than more widely distributed genes. Similar results were found in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, parasitic protozoa, and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B11">Domazet-Loso and Tautz 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B37">Wang et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B21">Kuo et al. 2008</xref>). This pattern of the relationship between evolutionary rate and apparent age (phylogenetic breadth of a gene) could be due to the variation in strength of purifying selection or due to the variation in the rate of adaptive evolution. Weaker purifying selection in young genes would imply that these genes have less effect on fitness and therefore are less selectively constrained. The alternative explanation, not mutually exclusive, is that lineage-specific genes participate more in lineage-specific adaptation, and therefore evolve faster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B3">Cai and Petrov 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our results show that ORFans have a distribution of synonymous diversity similar to non-ORFans. The main difference between ORFans and non-ORFans is an excess of clusters with high d<italic>N</italic> values. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evs081-F7">figure 7</xref><italic>D</italic>, about one-half of the ORFan d<italic>N</italic> values fall into the top 10% of the t1 control distribution, and the remainder are distributed with slightly decreasing frequency throughout the remainder of the distribution. It might be argued that the more recent the evolutionary acquisition of a gene sampled from within a population, the greater the extent to which observed differences will reflect short-term population dynamics, dominated by mutation, rather than the longer time-scale over which the effects of selective filtering accumulate. By this argument, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B20">Kryazhimskiy and Plotkin (2008)</xref>, one expects the ratio d<italic>N</italic>/d<italic>S</italic> to converge on 1 for the youngest genes. However, if we may assume vertical inheritance, this argument does not apply to the interpretation of our results, because every comparison between an ORFan cluster and a non-ORFan cluster is based on a matched set of strains.</p><p>Several other factors might account for the higher distribution of d<italic>N</italic> values in ORFans. Although we argued above that most ORFans are not artifacts, nevertheless, this conclusion still allows for a substantial minority of ORFans to be artifacts, for example, misannotated noncoding regions, or former genes that no longer contribute to fitness (e.g., acquired bacteriophage genes). This fraction of ORFans would be diversifying at the rate of maximal neutral change for a noncoding DNA sequence in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>Another possibility is that ORFans, as a class of functional protein-coding genes, have a higher rate of change due to stochastic acceptance of mutations, that is, reduced selective &#x0201c;constraint.&#x0201d; As noted earlier, t1 genes of (apparent) intermediate age also have a higher rate of nonsynonymous change than the older t2 genes; ORFan genes are much like t1 genes in their diversity statistics. A higher rate of evolution might be argued on various empirical or logical grounds. ORFans are shorter, thus the encoded proteins have a higher surface-to-volume ratio, which entails a higher rate of evolution (given the higher rate of evolution of surface sites in proteins). ORFan genes may be expressed at low levels (or infrequently), which may make them more tolerant of changes relative to genes expressed at high (and consistent) levels. ORFans are not acquired gradualistically, one codon at a time, but arrive in large pieces, and&#x02014;even without presuming anything about how these new pieces fit into the economy of the cell&#x02014;it stands to reason that they do not fit as precisely as pieces that have been around for many millions of years, which again suggests that ORFans will be more tolerant of arbitrary changes. A previous study in humans showed that older genes carry fewer and less frequent nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms than younger primate-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B3">Cai and Petrov 2010</xref>).</p><p>A third possibility would be that relative to non-ORFans, there is an excess of ORFans experiencing rapid evolution via beneficial mutations. A previous study showed an excess of primate-specific genes with a signal of positive selection, relative to genes with a broader distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="evs081-B3">Cai and Petrov 2010</xref>). Currently, these possibilities cannot be distinguished without a deeper examination of ORFan diversity.</p></sec><sec><title>Further Questions</title><p>In this study, we have applied relatively conventional methods of analysis to a difficult set of data, to obtain preliminary interpretations. Much more could be done to evaluate the evolution of ORFans in <italic>E. coli</italic> with additional data or specialized methods. For instance, a more integrated analysis that includes expression data (e.g., RNASeq data) and proteomics data might clarify the picture of ORFan genomics. Unfortunately such data are not available systematically for the whole set of <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. A further type of analysis that is possible and that represents an obvious next step would be to analyze in more detail the likelihood that the map locations of ORFans will reveal clues about their origin. Specifically, a variety of studies cited earlier have suggested that ORFan genes are frequently acquired via bacteriophage infections, which implies that the ORFans should arrive in clusters (representing inserted prophages) and will tend to be found at prophage insertion sites in the genome.</p><p>If most ORFans are showing a conservative pattern of evolution (i.e., d<italic>N</italic> &#x0003c; d<italic>S</italic>, as argued earlier), the results presented here have an interesting implication with respect to the above view that ORFans are mainly acquired from phage genomes. Specifically, the conservative pattern of divergence would indicate that the ORFans are not merely silent prophage genes. To the extent that horizontal propagation of phage kills the host cell, but ORFans are propagated vertically (after acquisition) and show a conservative pattern of divergence, this conservation cannot reflect selection for phage propagation, but only for host (lysogen) propagation, indicating a role for these genes in host propagation. Thus, the biological significance of these results ultimately will depend on distinguishing the contributions of 1) vertical inheritance of an ORFan acquired in an ancestral strain, 2) within-population events of chromosome recombination that may transfer genes between strains, and 3) repeated introgression of the ORFan from sources outside the <italic>E. coli</italic> population.
