Hibernating ground squirrels undergo rapid and extreme physiological changes in body temperature, oxygen consumption, and heart rate without suffering neurological damage from ischemia and reperfusion injury. Different brain regions show markedly different activity during the torpor/arousal cycle: the cerebral cortex shows activity only during the periodic returns to normothermia, while the hypothalamus is active over the entire temperature range. Therefore, region-specific neuroprotective strategies must exist to permit this compartmentalized spectrum of activity. In this study, we use the Illumina HiSeq platform to compare the transcriptomes of these two brain regions at four collection points across the hibernation season: April Active, October Active, Torpor, and IBA. In the cerebral cortex, 1,085 genes were found to be differentially expressed across collection points, while 1,063 genes were differentially expressed in the hypothalamus. Comparison of these transcripts indicates that the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus implement very different strategies during hibernation, showing less than 20% of these differentially expressed genes in common. The cerebral cortex transcriptome shows evidence of remodeling and plasticity during hibernation, including transcripts for the presynaptic cytomatrix proteins bassoon and piccolo, and extracellular matrix components, including laminins and collagens. Conversely, the hypothalamic transcriptome displays upregulation of transcripts involved in damage response signaling and protein turnover during hibernation, including the DNA damage repair gene <italic>RAD50</italic> and ubiquitin E3 ligases <italic>UBR1</italic> and <italic>UBR5</italic>. Additionally, the hypothalamus transcriptome also provides evidence of potential mechanisms underlying the hibernation phenotype, including feeding and satiety signaling, seasonal timing mechanisms, and fuel utilization. This study provides insight into potential neuroprotective strategies and hibernation control mechanisms, and also specifically shows that the hibernator brain exhibits both seasonal and regional differences in mRNA expression.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health (1RC2HL101625-01 to M.T.A).

During hibernation, mammals enter a period of heterothermy, characterized by lengthy periods of low body temperature, metabolism, and heart rate called torpor bouts, interspersed with short periodic interbout arousals (IBAs) to normothermia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058427-g001">Figure 1</xref>). During torpor, thirteen-lined ground squirrels (<italic>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</italic>) show a heart rate less than 5% of their normothermic rate, use only 2&#x02013;3% of their normal oxygen levels, and maintain a body temperature of 2&#x02013;10&#x000b0;C, physiological characteristics that would result in death for most mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Andrews1">[1]</xref>. Consequently, the brain is exposed to extreme fluctuations in temperature and blood flow during hibernation. Specifically, cerebral blood flow in thirteen-lined ground squirrels is reduced by 90% during torpor, levels that are normally ischemic in non-hibernators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Frerichs1">[2]</xref>. However, no histological abnormalities are seen in any brain region after arousal from torpor in this ground squirrel species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Frerichs1">[2]</xref>. Identifying the molecular mechanisms orchestrating the extreme changes in physiology during hibernation, and the accompanying natural neuroprotection, could be an important contribution to the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment and prevention of brain injury.</p><fig id="pone-0058427-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0058427.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Animal appearance and physiological characteristics at experimental collection points.</title><p><italic>A</italic>.

Analysis of electroencephalography, immediate early gene expression, and 2-deoxyglucose uptake indicate that the cerebral cortex is the first area of the brain to lose activity as the animal goes into torpor and the last area to regain activity upon arousal to IBA, while parts of the hypothalamus remain active throughout the hibernation season, even in torpor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Bratincsak1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Heller1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Kilduff1">[5]</xref>.

However, this synaptic plasticity has not been examined in the continuously active hypothalamus. The hypothalamus functions to maintain homeostasis, and is involved in many processes potentially important for hibernation and preparation for hibernation, including food intake/satiety signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Mrosovsky1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Torke1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Davis1">[10]</xref>, circadian rhythms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Ruby1">[11]</xref>, sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Daan1">[12]</xref>, body temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Heller2">[13]</xref>, and hormone production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Stanton1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Hermes1">[15]</xref>. Thus, the hypothalamus could play a major role in both the seasonal initiation of hibernation and the orchestration and maintenance of torpor/IBA cycles. The region-specific regulation of activity in the brain during hibernation suggests that there could be substantial differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying the control of hibernation in different areas of the brain. To our knowledge, no one has examined hibernation-specific changes in overall gene expression across different brain regions.</p><p>Here, we used next generation sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2000) to sequence the transcriptome of the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex at four collection points: pre-hibernation (October Active), Torpor, IBA, and post-hibernation (April Active) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058427-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The transcriptome provides a comprehensive summary of all the genes expressed at each collection point. The widespread appearance of the hibernator phenotype in Class Mammalia suggests that hibernators do not have a specific set of genes dedicated to hibernation, but rather they use differential expression of genes that exist in most mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Srere1">[16]</xref>. Therefore, the hibernator brain provides an excellent and unique opportunity to uncover genes both relevant and potentially targeted to human health, particularly in relation to neuroprotective therapies. Because these two areas of the brain are so distinctly different both in function and activity during hibernation, we predict that comparing mRNA levels between both regions and across collection points will reveal genes involved in region-specific survival strategies, along with providing insight into how hibernation is seasonally controlled and regulated on the transcriptional level in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overview</title><p>This study examined the transcriptome of the ground squirrel cerebral cortex and hypothalamus over the course of the hibernation season.

A comparison of pre- and postsynaptic protein expression in the hibernator brain revealed that proteins on both sides of the synapse dissociate during torpor, but reconnect during IBA, with no overall loss of protein levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-vonderOhe2">[7]</xref>. However, examination of the breakdown products of one synaptic protein in the synaptosomal fraction of torpid ground squirrel brains revealed that proteolysis is occurring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-vonderOhe2">[7]</xref>. Because there is no net loss of total protein, there must be protein synthesis to replace the lost proteins, underscoring the importance of gene expression during this time. We propose that synaptic plasticity during hibernation is a method of neuroprotection, preventing damage to the neurons of the cerebral cortex as the animal cycles through physiological extremes during hibernation. The cerebral cortex transcriptome reveals gene products potentially involved in this synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058427-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><sec id="s3b1"><title>Cytoskeletal morphogenesis</title><p>Physical separation of the pre- and postsynaptic components of neurons could provide neuroprotection by removing the potential for signal transmission and thus eliminating the possibility of excitotoxicity upon arousal from torpor. Evidence for cytoskeleton morphogenesis is present in the cerebral cortex transcriptome, including synapse-specific transcriptional changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058427-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The transcripts for the presynaptic cytomatrix proteins Piccolo (<italic>PCLO</italic>) and Bassoon (<italic>BSN</italic>) are elevated during the hibernation (torpor and IBA) and pre-hibernation periods. These proteins organize the active zones of presynaptic neurons, where synaptic vesicle machinery is organized and the vesicles are released <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Mukherjee1">[24]</xref>. Normally, the presynaptic active zone clusters with the postsynaptic density of the receiving neuron, forming a functional synapse. Piccolo has been shown to dissociate from postsynaptic density proteins during torpor, but returns during IBA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-vonderOhe2">[7]</xref>. This suggests that the entire active zone is unorganized and/or retracted during torpor and reorganized upon arousal to IBA, eliminating the neuron&#x02019;s ability to release synaptic vesicles and effectively propagate a signal. There is also upregulation of transcripts involved in vesicle transport and release during hibernation, including synaptotagmin 1, which is important for vesicle fusion and exocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Martens1">[25]</xref>. This could be important to reestablish a functional synapse during IBA.</p><p>Additionally, two transcripts associated with postsynaptic cytoskeleton morphology are also elevated during hibernation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058427-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). <italic>MAP1B</italic> promotes dendrite outgrowth and maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Tortosa1">[26]</xref>. Tetratricopeptide repeat, ankyrin repeat and coiled-coil containing 1 (<italic>TANC1</italic>) has also been shown to regulate dendritic spines and excitatory synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Han1">[27]</xref>. Both <italic>MAP1B</italic> and <italic>TANC1</italic> are elevated in the pre-hibernation and hibernation collection points compared to April. These transcripts could be orchestrating a similar dissociation and reconnection of the postsynaptic density during hibernation, and thus preventing signal reception, particularly through modification of available receptors. Synaptic plasticity through receptor modulation is a key component of the neuronal plasticity mechanisms long term potentiation (LTP), where signal transmission is enhanced, and long term depression (LTD), where the efficacy of transmission is reduced. There is evidence of a similar modification of receptor availability in hibernation. Spectrin repeat containing, nuclear envelope 1 (<italic>SYNE1</italic>) is highest during torpor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058427-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) and is involved in endocytosis of membrane proteins, including NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Cottrell1">[28]</xref>.

This is because if one component of the synapse fails to exhibit appropriate plasticity, the other component would still provide protective dissociation. During the low body temperatures of torpor, both transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-VanBreukelen1">[30]</xref> and translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Frerichs2">[31]</xref> are suppressed to low levels, but as the animal begins an arousal from torpor and body temperature begins to rise, rates of transcription and translation presumably increase. While there was no net protein loss observed in the cerebral cortex synapses from torpor to IBA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-vonderOhe2">[7]</xref>, the observed presence of proteolysis suggests that protein synthesis is occurring to replace the lost proteins, requiring transcripts that are either already present from the previous IBA or transcribed upon arousal. An analysis of synaptic cytoskeletal gene and protein expression over the course of an arousal from torpor could provide a valuable illustration of mechanisms of rapid plasticity and remodeling, specifically how synapses reform and whether maturation of one side of the synapse precedes the other.</p></sec><sec id="s3b2"><title>Extracellular Matrix Modification</title><p>The cerebral cortex transcriptome also reveals some modulation outside of the cells that could contribute to synaptic plasticity and morphogenesis, possibly creating a scaffold for motile neurites, stabilizing the synapse, or serving as a physical barrier of signal transduction.

Interestingly, the transcriptomes from both brain regions indicate that some genes elevated during hibernation are also elevated during the pre-hibernation October collection point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0058427.s001">Table S1</xref>). In the cerebral cortex, this includes upregulation of transcripts needed in remodeling and plasticity, while in the hypothalamus, this includes transcripts involved in the DNA damage response and proteolysis, along with some shared transcripts like <italic>SLC16A1</italic> and <italic>RBM3</italic>. This indicates that preparation for hibernation in the brain occurs on the molecular level prior to hibernation onset, or in this case, prior to exposure to torpor-inducing conditions, such as removal of food, cold temperatures, and constant darkness. This also indicates that genes involved in the hibernation phenotype are not expressed as a reaction to hibernation conditions, but instead are most likely expressed due to an internal seasonal timing mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Region-specific mRNA Abundance and Gene Expression Specificity</title><p>Comparison of overall mRNA diversity reveals that the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus are over 90% similar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0058427-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0058427.s001">S1</xref>). Additionally, examination of the most abundant genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058427-g003">Figure 3</xref>) indicates that the majority of the highly expressed genes are the same in both brain regions, and possibly globally throughout the brain. The most abundant transcripts presented here support a previous examination of transcript abundance in mouse parietal cortex and hypothalamus, where glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>GAPDH</italic>) was found in the top ten most abundant transcripts in both tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Nishida1">[59]</xref>. Additionally, <italic>CKB</italic> was previously reported to be abundant in mouse parietal cortex and <italic>SPARC</italic> in mouse hypothalamus as well. <italic>PTGDS</italic> and <italic>GNAS</italic> were previously reported as abundant in mouse hypothalamus, but not parietal cortex, whereas we report both transcripts as abundant in the ground squirrel cerebral cortex sample, which includes parietal cortex. This could be because only the top ten most abundant transcripts in each region were reported previously, which included mitochondrially encoded transcripts that were excluded from our analysis.</p><p>Although the most abundant transcripts and overall mRNA diversity are very similar between hypothalamus and cerebral cortex, these regions do differ in gene expression specificity. In our analysis, the hypothalamus exhibits six times as many mRNAs that are region-specific compared to the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058427-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Some of the hypothalamus-specific mRNAs reported here support a previous examination of gene expression specificity in specific regions within the hypothalamus in mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Kasukawa1">[60]</xref>. For example, <italic>HCRT</italic> was so highly specific to the dorsomedial nucleus, that it is considered a marker of this region. Similarly, <italic>CGA</italic> is a marker for the median eminence. <italic>OXT</italic> and <italic>AVP</italic> were highly expressed in several hypothalamic nuclei, but in no other brain region. Kasukawa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Kasukawa1">[60]</xref> also examined gene expression specificity in many other regions throughout the brain, including sub-regions of the cerebral cortex. However, the mRNAs that show the highest specificity for cerebral cortex reported here do not match the region-specific markers reported earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Kasukawa1">[60]</xref>. This is possibly because we examined global changes in cerebral cortex gene expression, rather than individual regions. Also, we only examined the transcriptomes of two brain regions, instead of regions throughout the brain, so our comparison did not take as many different parts of the brain into account. However, this does support the idea that the hypothalamus exhibits greater gene expression specificity than cerebral cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Analysis of the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus transcriptomes reveals that while these two brain regions are very similar in terms of mRNA diversity, they are regulated very differently during hibernation. Transcriptomic evidence indicates that the cerebral cortex undergoes plasticity and remodeling during torpor and IBA, which is not evident in the hypothalamus. Several plasticity-related transcripts elevated during hibernation in the cerebral cortex are upregulated before or after the hibernation season in the hypothalamus, suggesting that remodeling in this brain region occurs either as a preparatory or recovery mechanism. Evidence from the hypothalamic transcriptome suggests that this brain region implements a DNA damage response protective strategy, along with protein turnover through ubiquitination. Several DNA damage and proteolysis genes show the opposite pattern of expression in the cerebral cortex, with higher levels outside of hibernation. This could be because the cerebral cortex undergoes extensive plasticity and therefore does not need the upregulated defense responses during hibernation. Additionally, this analysis reveals that the brain prepares for hibernation on a molecular level prior to the onset of the season and provides some clues about how hibernation could be induced and maintained.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>A total of 12 male and 12 female thirteen-lined ground squirrels (<italic>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</italic>) were used in these experiments. All animals were housed individually in the AAALAC-accredited Animal Care Facility located in the University of Minnesota Duluth School of Medicine. The squirrels were kept at room temperature in a 12&#x02236;12 light/dark (LD) cycle and fed standard rodent chow and water <italic>ad libitum</italic> from April through October. During the hibernation season (November-March), the squirrels were moved into an environmental chamber and kept in constant darkness at 5&#x02013;7&#x000b0;C with no food provided. All experimental procedures were approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #1103A97712).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Experimental Collection Points</title><p>The collection points for these experiments were chosen to uncover the most meaningful comparisons in the ground squirrel brain across the hibernation season. Four collection points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0058427-g001">Figure 1</xref>) were used: pre-hibernation (October active), Torpor, IBA, and post-hibernation (April active). Three males and three females were sacrificed at each collection point. Animal state at each collection point was verified by rectal body temperature and animal behavior (Torpor: 6&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C/inactive; Active/IBA: 35&#x02013;37&#x000b0;C/active). All animals were sacrificed between 10 am and 3 pm.</p><p>The October collection point provides a time when the animals are already physically prepared for hibernation, having doubled or even tripled their body weights in the preceding months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Carey1">[54]</xref>. This collection point represents an opportunity to examine how the brain prepares for the oncoming hibernation season. Ground squirrels can potentially have begun torpor bouts in October <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Russell1">[61]</xref>, and because body temperature was not continuously monitored during this time, it is possible that some or all of the animals had already undergone torpor bouts. However, all the animals used for this collection point were held on a 12&#x02236;12 LD cycle at 23&#x000b0;C, had access to food, and were active at the time of collection. Pre-hibernation animals were sacrificed in the first two weeks of October.</p><p>The torpor and IBA collection points provide the two extremes of the hibernation cycle. In torpor, the ground squirrels exhibit near freezing body temperatures, low heart rates, and low oxygen consumption, while all of these physiological parameters return to normothermic levels at IBA. The transition from torpor to IBA takes an average of 2.8 hours in the thirteen-lined ground squirrel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Hampton1">[23]</xref>, meaning that the molecular mechanisms orchestrating the transition to normothermia and activating the underlying neuroprotective strategies are rapidly implemented and/or sustained during this process. In an effort to keep transitions between torpor and IBA as natural as possible, the animals were not handled and body temperature was not rectally assessed prior to sacrifice, as this could affect arousal parameters or trigger a premature and/or unnatural arousal. Therefore, the exact timing of sacrifice within the torpor bout and IBA is not known. However, all animals were monitored daily using the sawdust method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Pengelley1">[62]</xref>, and the animals used for the torpor collection point were at least three days into a torpor bout and had shown no signs of arousal. Torpid state was verified at sacrifice by rectal body temperature (6&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C). All animals used for the IBA collection point aroused naturally and spontaneously, were observed as awake and active (eyes open and exhibiting coordinated movements), and were torpid the previous day. All IBA collection point animals had a normothermic body temperature (35&#x02013;37&#x000b0;C), verified by rectal measurement at the time of sacrifice. The hibernation collection point animals (Torpor and IBA) were sacrificed during January and February when average torpor bout length is longest.</p><p>Finally, the post-hibernation collection point in April provides an opportunity to examine the period of recovery after the completion of an entire hibernation season, and also represents the point of time when the ground squirrels are farthest from entering the next hibernation season. Post-hibernation animals were sacrificed in the second and third weeks of April. These animals had been removed from the hibernation chambers at the end of March and were held in the 12&#x02236;12 LD cycle at 23&#x000b0;C with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Brain Dissection</title><p>All animals were fully anesthetized with Isoflurane and then sacrificed by decapitation. The brain was removed from the skull and the meninges and blood vessels surrounding the brain were removed. The hypothalamus, located on the ventral side of the brain caudal to the optic chiasm, was removed first, avoiding the pituitary gland. The cerebral cortex was then removed using previous dissection methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Heffner1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Chiu1">[64]</xref> and a rodent brain atlas as guides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Franklin1">[65]</xref>. First, the olfactory bulbs, brainstem, and cerebellum were removed. The two cortical hemispheres were then separated by cutting through the corpus callosum. The hippocampus is layered directly under the cerebral cortex, separated by the lateral ventricle, so this was carefully extracted, along with the underlying thalamus. In an effort to remove all of the hippocampus, parts of the piriform cortex and portions of the most caudal regions of the entorhinal, ectorhinal, perirhinal, retrosplenial, and visual cortex could have been removed as well. The basal ganglia were then removed from below the frontal cortex. Finally, the white matter layer directly under the cerebral cortex, including the external capsule and cingulum, was removed, but it is likely that small portions of these structures were included in the dissected samples. All dissections were performed on ice and the dissected brain regions were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The two cortical hemispheres were frozen and stored separately. The time from decapitation to sample freezing was less than 10 minutes. Tissues were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until RNA purification.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>RNA Preparation</title><p>RNA was purified from hypothalamus and cerebral cortex samples using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit and any remaining genomic DNA was removed with a DNase kit (Ambion). In an effort to determine global transcriptomic changes in the cerebral cortex rather than focusing on one specific region, one entire hemisphere from each animal was used for RNA purification. The other hemisphere was saved for future experiments. The entire bilateral hypothalamus sample from each animal was used for RNA purification. RNA samples from individual animals were quantified on a nanodrop and run on a gel to ensure good quality. RNA from one male and one female from each collection point were combined together into a single sample, so that each of the four collection points had 3 pooled samples. This pooling was done to control for any influence of sex. Because hibernation is a survival adaptation used by both sexes, we chose to eliminate sex as a possible variable in our data. Samples were then sent to the University of Minnesota Biomedical Genomics Center (St Paul, MN) for Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>cDNA Synthesis and Illumina HiSeq 2000 Procedure</title><sec id="s4e1"><title>Sample Quality Assessment</title><p>Total RNA isolates were quantified using a fluorimetric RiboGreen assay.

Trinity was used to predict coding domain subsequences within the contigs in order to specifically select for protein-coding transcripts. Any contig containing a predicted coding domain was selected and trimmed to include only that domain plus up to 100 bases on both ends. Additionally, mitochondrially-encoded reads were screened out using the thirteen-lined ground squirrel mitochondrial sequence assembled previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Hampton2">[67]</xref> and NCBI megablast. The selected contigs were then identified by comparison to the human RefSeq nucleotide database (NCBI) using Blastn (E-value of 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>).

Thus, comparing to the human RefSeq nucleotide database directly eliminates extra steps. However, the ground squirrel genome was used to supplement this identification for any contigs that needed species-specific sequence verification.

The mean of each collection point was divided into the April mean to calculate the fold change. April expression is equal to 1. For purposes of clarity, fold changes that were less than one (expression is lower in April) were converted for presentation in the figures by taking the negative inverse. Each mRNA was also given a specificity value for each brain region, calculated as the percentage of counts in that region divided by the total number of counts in all other transcriptomic samples. The specificity value takes into account expression values from hypothalamus and cerebral cortex, along with white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and heart, which were obtained from additional transcriptomic experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0058427-Hampton2">[67]</xref> and unpublished data.
