We investigated the cell specific gene and protein expression variation controlled by the CD40 genetic variant(s) associated with MS, i.e. the T-allele at rs1883832. Previously we had shown that the risk allele is expressed at a lower level in whole blood, especially in people with MS. Here, we have defined the immune cell subsets responsible for genotype and disease effects on CD40 expression at the mRNA and protein level. In cell subsets in which CD40 is most highly expressed, B lymphocytes and dendritic cells, the MS-associated risk variant is associated with reduced CD40 cell-surface protein expression. In monocytes and dendritic cells, the risk allele additionally reduces the ratio of expression of full-length versus truncated CD40 mRNA, the latter encoding secreted CD40. We additionally show that MS patients, regardless of genotype, express significantly lower levels of CD40 cell-surface protein compared to unaffected controls in B lymphocytes. Thus, both genotype-dependent and independent down-regulation of cell-surface CD40 is a feature of MS. Lower expression of a co-stimulator of T cell activation, CD40, is therefore associated with increased MS risk despite the same CD40 variant being associated with reduced risk of other inflammatory autoimmune diseases. Our results highlight the complexity and likely individuality of autoimmune pathogenesis, and could be consistent with antiviral and/or immunoregulatory functions of CD40 playing an important role in protection from MS.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC) (grant numbers 633275 and 1065157).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The CD40 gene has been previously identified as a risk gene for multiple sclerosis (MS) [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and other autoimmune diseases, including Graves&#x02019; disease (GD) [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Crohn&#x02019;s disease (CD) [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CD40 is an important co-stimulatory molecule expressed on the surface of a variety of antigen presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells (DCs) and B-lymphocytes, as well as cells of the innate immune system such as macrophages and microglia. CD40 has previously been shown to play a role in the development of animal models of autoimmune demyelinating disease. Depletion by antagonistic antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or ablation (gene knock-out) [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] of CD40 expression results in amelioration of disease, highlighting the importance of the secondary activation signal in these inflammatory models. More recently, over-expression of CD40 in the thyroid has been shown to lead to spontaneous induction of hyperthyroidism in a murine model [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>While GD and RA are associated with the major allele at rs1883832 (C) associated with increased CD40 expression [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and therefore might be predicted to enhance a pro-inflammatory environment/response [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the risk allele for MS at rs1883832 (T, minor allele) is associated with reduced CD40 expression [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although there are many SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs1883832, it is possible that rs1883832 itself mediates the functional effects of this LD block. It is located at -1bp of the transcription start site (TSS) within the Kozak consensus sequence, in which the major C allele has been shown to lead to enhanced efficiency of translation of the corresponding gene transcript [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However it is entirely possible that other SNPs in the LD block may be contributing to or causing the functional effect driving association with disease susceptibility. In addition, the effects of individual SNPs on expression of CD40 may, as for other immune cell genes, be highly dependent on context (i.e. inflammation) and cell subset.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that CD40 expression is increased at the mRNA level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in MS compared to healthy/non-MS controls [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but is not different in cultured B lymphocytes or monocytes at the protein level [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, these studies involved small cohorts of varying disease duration and disease course (including secondary progressive MS and primary progressive MS), and/or subjects concurrently treated with disease-modifying therapies, all of which could potentially effect CD40 expression.</p><p>In this study, we used a relatively large cohort of untreated MS patients and unaffected controls to investigate the effect of genotype on expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cell types that produce the highest levels of CD40: B lymphocytes and monocytes. As other antigen presenting cells (APCs) are rare in blood, but the APCs from secondary lymphoid organs and tissues have the highest expression of CD40 of all subsets analysed in published databases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.immgen.org">www.immgen.org</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biogps.org">www.biogps.org</ext-link>), we also used <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of monocytes to produce dendritic cells representative of these cell types. Further, we examined the effect of disease on CD40 expression in B-lymphocytes and monocytes freshly isolated from the peripheral blood of MS patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Our findings implicate lowered cell-surface CD40 levels in the development of MS, and should lead to further mechanistic investigations with potential therapeutic implications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Subject recruitment and demographics</title><p>Whole blood samples were collected between 8am and 1pm and processed within 3 hours for the isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; EDTA tubes); or stored at -20 degrees for whole-blood RNA (PAXgene tubes).</p><p>MS patients were recruited according to the following criteria:&#x02014;definite relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) according to McDonald criteria or Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS), aged between and inclusive of 18&#x02013;65 years, not currently on immunomodulatory therapy for MS, or none within in the last three months and no other concurrent autoimmune disease.

This is paralleled by lower levels of CD40 mRNA production from the risk genotype in these cells, and an increased relative proportion of isoforms encoding the secreted form of CD40. In addition, and for the first time, we show that the level of CD40 protein expression is significantly reduced in B-lymphocytes isolated from MS patients compared to healthy controls, independent of risk genotype. This is consistent with our previous findings that whole blood CD40 mRNA was reduced in carriers of the risk genotype, and that the effect of genotype on expression was enhanced in MS [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These results also point towards additional factors leading to the down-regulation of CD40 protein expression in MS patients besides CD40 genotype, and thus implicate lower cell surface CD40 protein expression in the complex pathogenesis of MS.</p><p>However, our findings are in contrast to previous studies that have shown no difference in either the mRNA or protein levels of CD40 expression between MS patients and controls [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These previous cohorts were of varying disease phenotype, including patients in the progressive phase of disease, varying relapse status and with a wider range of disease duration [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] possibly capturing, at least for those with relapse, a more inflammatory state with concomitantly higher CD40 expression, thus masking the reduced CD40 expression we observed in our cohort of patients with stable relapsing-remitting disease.</p><p>The opposite genetic association of CD40 rs1883832 with increased susceptibility to MS, but with protection from RA and GD are intriguing and point to distinct roles for CD40 in the pathogenic processes in these autoimmune diseases. Our studies here and previously [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], as well as studies in RA and GD [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have consistently demonstrated an association of the T allele with reduced CD40 expression. The association of protection from RA and GD with lower expression of a T cell activation gene fits with a primarily costimulatory role of CD40 supporting the autoimmune inflammatory process, and supported by animal models in which CD40 inhibition reduces inflammation. In contrast, the association of protection from MS with higher expression of CD40 may suggest that these inflammatory processes are protective in MS, and/or that thymic tolerogenic processes mediated by CD40 are of greater importance in protection from MS than CD40-mediated autoimmune inflammatory processes are in disease initiation or propagation.</p><p>It is intriguing that Epstein Bar virus (EBV), long implicated in MS pathogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], encodes a homologue of human CD40, This protein is expressed in infected B cells, and constitutively signals, promoting B cell proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Relative susceptibility to EBV may be dependent on competition between human and EBV CD40/CD40L signaling. Notably though, a genome wide association study of SNPs with EBNA-1 antibody levels did not implicate CD40 [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This would suggest any CD40 genotype associations with EBV susceptibility, or EBV contribution to MS, may be independent of EBNA-1 antibody levels.</p><p>Tolerogenic responses mediated by CD40 stimulation include na&#x000ef;ve B lymphocyte- mediated stimulation of T cells leading to the expansion of regulatory T cells [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition, na&#x000ef;ve B lymphocytes (and regulatory B cells found within the na&#x000ef;ve B lymphocyte pool) have been shown to produce regulatory cytokines such as IL-10 upon stimulation with CD40L [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In addition to these peripheral immunoregulatory mechanisms, cortical and medullary thymic epithelial cells (cTECS and mTECs) express functional CD40 [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which has been shown to be essential for the establishment of the mTEC microenvironment leading to tolerance to self-antigens [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The role of Vitamin D/UVR driven immunomodulation [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], mediated by APCs, may also provide an additional link between reduced CD40 expression and increased MS risk, with under-expression of CD40 by DCs leading to the failure of the protective effects of increased Vitamin D/UVR.</p><p>A decrease in CD40 expression by these cell types could plausibly lead to a failure of tolerance/immunomodulatory mechanisms mediated by CD40 stimulation, and by extension, a failure of protection from the development of MS in subsequent years.</p><p>While CD40 expression is known to be increased in thyroid tissue in GD [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], no examination has been made of either the genotype-dependent effects of CD40 expression in GD patients, or CD40 expression by peripheral immune cells in the context of disease. In SLE, a risk-genotype dependent correlation in CD40 expression level in B lymphocytes has been identified, present in both patients and healthy controls [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], however there is no apparent genotype-independent effect in CD40 expression levels between SLE patients and healthy controls. Certainly, the genotype-independent decrease in CD40 expression by peripheral immune cells in MS is a unique and novel finding, and leads to many questions as to the reasons for this decrease, as well as the subsequent effects. Is this decrease a result of &#x0201c;exhaustion&#x0201d; of CD40 expression in MS similar to that of CD8 &#x0201c;exhaustion&#x0201d; in chronic viral infection [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], or is it a result of homeostatic down-regulation in the context of inflammation?</p><p>The absence of a known genetic variant in the exon 4 to 8 region that would drive the observed risk genotype dependent splicing differences could indicate that either a novel variant exists which has yet to be included in the 1000genome and ensemble databases, or that mRNA splicing is regulated from outside this region, as has been described for other genes [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Although increased production of soluble isoforms could be expected to reduce signaling through reducing both cell surface expression and offering alternative ligand binding, soluble receptors have also been shown to potentially increase signaling through increasing the half-life of ligands (e.g. potentially for soluble CD40L) [<xref rid="pone.0127080.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and further work is required to ascertain if soluble CD40 levels are indeed relatively increased in MS patients, as these data suggest. The net effect of the risk haplotype on expression may actually a be gain of function.</p><p>Further work is needed to understand the consequences of decreased CD40 expression on B lymphocyte and dendritic cells in antiviral/immunoregulatory functions in demyelinating disease, and what drives reduced expression of CD40 in B lymphocytes in established MS. Defining the genotype-independent but disease-dependent changes in B lymphocyte and dendritic cell CD40 levels identified in this study could uncover protective roles for CD40 in MS that fundamentally distinguish its pathogenesis from that of other autoimmune diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p><bold>The members of the ANZgene Consortium are:</bold> Alan Baxter (James Cook University, Townsville, Australia), Allan G Kermode (Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Australia), Bruce Taylor (Menzies Research Institute Tasmania, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia), David R Booth (ANZgene Consortium Chair) (Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia) <email>david.booth@sydney.edu.au</email>, Deborah Mason (Canterbury District Health Board, Christchurch, New Zealand), Graeme J Stewart (Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia), Helmut Butzkueven (University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia), Jac Charlesworth (Menzies Research Institute Tasmania, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia), James Wiley (Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia), Jeannette Lechner- Scott (Hunter Medical Research Institute, Newcastle, Australia), Judith Field (Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia), Lotti Tajouri (Bond University, Gold Coast, Australia), Lyn Griffiths (Griffith Institute of Health and Medical Research, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia), Mark Slee (School of Medicine, Flinders University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia), Matthew A Brown (University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia), Pablo Moscato (Hunter Medical Re- search Institute, Newcastle, Australia), Rodney J Scott (Hunter Medical Research Institute, Newcastle, Australia), Simon Broadley (School of Medicine, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia), Steve Vucic (Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia), Trevor Kilpatrick (University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia), William M Carroll (Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Australia).</p><p>We thank individuals with MS in Australia for supporting this research and all investigators of the study who have contributed to the recruitment of MS patients.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0127080.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>ANZgene</collab>.
