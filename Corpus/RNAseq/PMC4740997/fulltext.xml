Via TCGA we analyzed the molecular and clinical characteristics of 166 AML cases to investigate a prognostic role for miR-199b. The Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves for high and low expression values of miR-199b and the observed distribution of miRNA expression revealed the highly expressed group had significantly better survival outcomes (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.016, log rank test). Additionally, there was significant difference between miR-199b expression across the AML subtypes with particularly low expression found in the FAB-M5 subtype. Furthermore, FAB-M5 subtype showed a poor prognosis with a 1-year survival rate of only 25&#x000a0;%, compared with 51&#x000a0;% survival in the overall sample (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.024). Furthermore, significant inverse correlation of HoxA7 and HoxB6 expression with miR-199b was observed in FAB-M5 AML patients. Molecular mutations were analyzed among miR-199b high and low AML cases. Significant correlations in terms of association and survival outcomes were observed for NPMc and IDH1 mutations. Treatment of THP-1 cells (represents M5-subtype) with HDAC inhibitors AR-42, Panobinostat, or Decitabine showed miR-199b expression was significantly elevated upon AR-42 and Panobinostat treatment. To further understand the hematopathological consequences of decreased miR-199b, we employed a bone-marrow transduce/transplant (BMT) mouse model.

Dysregulation of miRNAs that can act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes can result in tumorigenesis. One miRNA of interest is human miR-199b-5p. Human miR-199b-5p is located on chromosome 9 and is an intragenic miRNA encoded in the dynamin 1 (DNM1) gene, from the opposite strand in a 2.2&#x000a0;kb intronic region between exons 14 and 15 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Mature 5p arm, encoded by hsa-miR-199b, is evolutionarily conserved among several species. Transcription of miR-199b is predicted to be independent of its host gene, DNM1. Studies to date have demonstrated that miR-199b targets nuclear kinase Dyrk1a and promotes calcineurin/NFAT signaling in cardiomyocytes. Suppression of miR-199b expression has been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma and predicted poor prognosis in this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Further, miR-199b was demonstrated to target HIF-1alpha in hepatocarcinoma cells and prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. miR-199b has also been showed to target HER2 in breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Notably, a recent investigation revealed overexpression of miR-199b-5p in medulloblastoma cancer stem cells results in downregulation of CD133<sup>+</sup> tumor initiating cells and causes depletion of the side population compartment of tumor stem cells via negative regulation of the Hes1-mediated Notch signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Intronic miR-199b expression in steady state hematopoiesis and its myelopoietic and hematopoietic potential. <bold>a</bold> miR-199b&#x02019;s location within the genome; intronic of the DNM1 gene. <bold>b</bold> Human primary BM CD34<sup>+</sup>, BM CD33<sup>+</sup>, PB monocytes, PB eosinophils, and PB basophils expression of miR-199b in steady state hematopoiesis. <bold>c</bold> Lentiviral particles for anti-Has-miR-199b-5p and control vector were used to transduce human BM derived CD34&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;cells.

Down-regulation of miR-199b has been strongly associated with imatinib drug resistance in 9q34.1 deleted BCR/ABL positive CML patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Silencing of miR-199b has also been associated with acquired chemoresistance in ovarian cancer, possibly mediated via activation of JAG-Notch1 signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Interestingly, successful delivery of miR-199b in tumorigenic cell lines via stable nucleic acid particles (SNALPs) lead to impaired cell proliferation, however, no apoptosis was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. MiR-199 locus has also been implicated in intracellular trafficking where miR-199b and miR-199a together has been demonstrated to control receptor-mediated endocytosis via inhibiting CLTC, Rab5A, LDLR and Cav-1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The cause of miR-199b-5p downregulation in AML has yet to be examined. Studies have revealed 20&#x000a0;% of individuals with AML harbor somatic mutations in DNMT3A and genome-wide sequencing approaches have strengthened the notion that AML can be classified on the basis of patterns of promoter methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We hypothesized that future investigations into the epigenetic status such as histone modification via histone deacetylases (HDACs) or DNA methylation of miR-199b-5p&#x02019;s promoter may further unravel the link between aberrant epigenetic regulation and subsequent pathogeneic consequences manifested via the dysregulated expression of miR-199b-5p&#x02019;s target genes as in silico analysis shows five upstream CpG islands (data not shown). Furthermore, miR-199b expression in steady state hematopoiesis has yet to be analyzed.</p><p>By gaining better insight into miR-199b-5p&#x02019;s expression in steady state hematopoiesis, we can investigate the prognositic consequences of miR-199b-5p&#x02019;s loss in depth in AML as well as determine if it can become a therapeutic target for specific subtypes of AML. Herein, we aim to determine the hematopoietic/myelopoietic consequences of miR-199b silencing ex vivo and in vivo via BM transplantation approach, clinical significance especially prognostic significance in AML and epigenetic regulation of miR-199b-5p in AML to garner more insight into its therapeutic potential. Additionally, in vivo investigations involving combinatorial deletions of cooperative factors like NPM1 or IDH1/2 are required to determine if miR-199b has leukemogenic potential. This will elucidate if loss of miR-199b-5p directly contributes to leukemogenesis or if it is better served as a diagnostic and prognostic marker.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Previously, we demonstrated miR-199b-5p was downregulated in a subset of AML patients but didn&#x02019;t have sufficient clinical details about the patients to draw a distinct correlation to miR-199b expression and AML subtype or overall survival. Additionally, both miR-199b&#x02019;s normal expression pattern in hematopoiesis and its regulation have yet to be examined. Our current studies investigate the role of miR-199b in normal hematopoiesis and AML utilizing both ex vivo and in vivo approaches and analyzing prognostic data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) on miR-199b expression in AML patients.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>miR-199b in normal hematopoiesis</title><p>To begin, we examined relative miR-199b expression in steady state hematopoiesis and showed CD33<sup>+</sup> myeloid progenitors had the highest miR-199b expression, which drops upon differentiation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). To test if suppression of miR-199b results in myeloproliferation and HSC proliferation, human bone marrow derived CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were transduced with anti-miR-199b or control lentivirus a CFU assay respectively. Silencing of miR-199b expression was confirmed via RTqPCR (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Further, a functional validation of miR-199b silencing was tested by examining the levels of HIF1-alpha, a known and validated target of miR-199b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Transcript levels of HIF1-alpha were significantly elevated in hCD34 cells expressing anti-miR-199b (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). At day 16, silencing of miR-199b in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells resulted in significant increases in CFU-GM colonies strongly suggesting dysregulation of miR-199b expression has a role in myelopoiesis and may be leukemogenic (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). The relatively low values observed for CFU-GM is possibly arising from the usage of cryopreserved human BM CD34 cells rather than freshly isolated human BM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Notably, colony assays were performed with BFU-E and CFU-E; however, miR-199b silencing did not affect erythroid proliferation (data not shown). Transcription factors like cKit and RUNX1, known regulators of HSCs and Sp1, a transcription factor that regulates myelopoiesis, are conservative targets of miR-199b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Silencing of miR-199b in AML may in part lead to perturbed myelopoiesis via selective lineage specific dysregulation of key factors that direct myelopoiesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Clinical implications of low-miR-199b in AML</title><p>In order to correlate miR-199b expression with clinical AML patient data to determine any prognostic role, we utilized the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to analyze the molecular and clinical characteristics of 166 AML cases. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves for high and low expression of miR-199b along with the observed distribution of miRNA expression revealed the highly expressed group (&#x0003e;2000 reads per million miRNA mapped) showed significantly better survival outcome (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.016, log rank test). In addition, miR-199b expression varied by cytogenetic risk category in the least squared mean plot, with significantly higher miR-199b expression in the favorable category compared to the intermediate and poor categories combined (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). Therefore, low expression of mir-199b predicts worse survival outcome and higher cytogenetic risk in AML.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Clinical relevance of miR-199b-5p across AML subtypes. <bold>a</bold> Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis of 166 AML patients from the TCGA database for high/low miR-199b expression and overall survival, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0164. <bold>b</bold> miR-199b cytogenetic risk for same patients set. <bold>c</bold> High/low miR-199b expression by FAB subtype in the same patients set. <bold>d</bold> Least squared means plot of 199b expression for different FAB subtypes using ANOVA (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). <bold>e</bold> miR-199b levels for n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;128 AML patients analyzed for miR-199b/NPM1 with n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;63 miR-199b-high samples, of which n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2 were positive for NPM1 mutation, and n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;65 miR-199b-low samples of which n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;41 positive for NPM1 mutation (Fisher p value&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.941e-08, odds ratio 19.6112) (<italic>left panel</italic>). miR-199b levels for n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;139 patients with n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;59 miR-199b-high samples (of which n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5 positive for IDH1 mutation) whereas n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;80 were miR-199b-low samples with n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;25 positive for IDH1 mutation (Fisher p value&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01175, odds ratio 3.663005) (<italic>right panel</italic>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40164_2016_33_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>Additionally, there was a significant difference in miR-199b expression across the AML FAB subtypes with particularly low numbers of miR-199b-low patients in the M5 subtype (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c) as well as low expression in M5 subtype (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). Further, M5 subtype shows a poor prognosis with a one-year survival rate of only 25&#x000a0;%, compared with 51&#x000a0;% survival in the overall sample (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.024 with a Chi squared goodness of fit test). With AML patients grouped into M5 versus other subtypes to look at the dichotomized miR-199b variable, we find all of the M5 patients have low miR-199b expression (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). Thus, it is possible low miR-199b expression is a potential reason for poor survival outcomes in this subtype, and targeted treatment may represent a personalized treatment regime for this subtype. Interestingly, most of the analyzed M5 AML patients were cytogenetically normal (CN-AML); however, these patients exhibited molecular mutations (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1).</p><p>Next, we attempted to determine the potential cooperative role of these associated molecular abnormalities (FLT3-ITD, IDH&#x02013;R140, -R132, -R172, activating Ras, NMPc) among miR-199b high and low AML patients. Significant correlations in terms of association and survival outcomes were observed for NPM1 and IDH1 mutations. Among n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;128 AML patients analyzed for miR-199b/NPM1, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;63 were miR-199b-high samples and, of these, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2 were positive for NPM1 mutation. Importantly, of the n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;65 miR-199b-low samples, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;41 were positive for NPM1 mutation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d, left panel, Fisher p value&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.94e-08, odds ratio 19.6). For IDH1 mutation, among the n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;139 AML patients analyzed for miR-199b/IDH1, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;59 were miR-199b-high samples (with n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5 positive for IDH1 mutation) whereas n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;80 were miR-199b-low samples (with n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;25 positive for IDH1 mutation) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d, right panel, Fisher p value&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.012, odds ratio 3.7). Having a better understanding of miR-199b&#x02019;s regulation could provide insight into specific therapies for low-miR-199b AML cases. It is tempting to speculate that NPM1 or IDH1 mutation may play a cooperative role in miR-199b-low associated AML, which if proved can facilitate the exploration of combinatorial strategies with MLN9708, a recently discovered and therapeutically tested inhibitor of mutated NPM1 in AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] or AGI-6780 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] for IDH2R140Q. Interestingly, miRNA expression analysis in AML patients expressing mutant NPM1 reveals significant alterations in expression profile of select miRNAs including miR-199a compared to AML with wild type NPM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Next, in order to identify the molecular mechanism that could mediate the poor survival outcome and subtype specificity associated with low miR-199b expression, we queried gene expression data for co-expressed genes. A large number of genes were significantly correlated or anti-correlated with miR-199b expression, with the most significant negatively correlated genes listed (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). Included in this list are a large number of transcription factors in the HOX family which have been previously implicated in leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and two of which, HOXA7 and HOXB6, are known targets of miR-199b. Hox family of transcription factors have been shown to play critical regulatory roles during hematopoiesis and their aberrant expression results in hematological malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. To see if the pattern of expression by subtype is reversed (since these genes are anti-correlated or transcriptionally repressed by 199b), we performed an ANOVA of 199b expression by subtype and found that indeed the expression of these genes is highest in the M5 subtype, where 199b expression is the lowest (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b). Importantly, HOXA7 and HOXB6 expression was significantly elevated in miR-199b-low AML samples with FAB-M5 subtype (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b), which increases the possibilities of important transcription factors coming in the regulatory ambit of miR-199b in HSCs.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Expression of HoxA7 and HoxB6 inversely correlates with miR-199b levels in AML with FAB M5 subtype. <bold>a</bold> Least square (LS) means plots of conserved miR-199b target HOXA7 (ANOVA p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) versus different AML FAB categories.

One example is miR-193a being modified via HDACs and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) associated with methylation through AML1/ETO recruitment of these factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

Thus, epigenetic regulation of miR-199b appears to be via histone modification.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>HDAC inhibitors restore miR-199b-5p expression in THP-1 cells to induce apoptosis. <bold>a</bold> miR-199b expression in THP-1 cells upon 24&#x000a0;h treatment with vehicle (DMSO), Decitabine (DB, 5uM), AR-42 (2uM), or Panobinostat (0.7uM) ****p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001. <bold>b</bold> Western blot for THP-1 cells treated with DMSO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], Panobinostat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] or AR-42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] blotted for acetylated (Ac) and total histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. <bold>c</bold> Apoptosis via Annexin V staining for the AR-42 and Panobinostat treated cells compared to DMSO treatment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40164_2016_33_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p>Taken together, our results demonstrate in vitro loss of miR-199b can lead to myeloproliferation and HSC proliferation while HDAC inhibitors (AR-42 or Pano) can recover miR-199b expression and promote apoptosis in leukemic cells. Both AR-42 and Pano are both clinically relevant as both are in clinical trials. For example, AR-42 is in one clinical trial in combination with DB for patients with AML (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01798901). One supporting study for this trial may be when AML cells were treated with AR-42; it raises miR-29b expression and primes the cells for DB treatment to induce apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A clinical trial is currently pairing Pano with routine therapies of idarubicin and cytarabine in AML patients over the age of 65 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00840346). Both of these inhibitors could be a mode of therapy for AML patients with low-miR-199b.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>miR-199b-low transplanted mouse</title><p>To further understand the hematopathological consequences of decreased miR-199b in the onset and development of myeloid leukemia, we employed a transduce/transplant mouse model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). The Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>Kit<sup>+</sup> (LSK) population was isolated from Ly5.2 C57Bl6 mice; transduced with anti-miR-199b or control lentivirus, and, using RT-qPCR, we confirmed that miR-199b was indeed much lower in these LSK cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, left panel). The transplanted LSK cells into Ly5.1 recipient mice post sub-lethal irradiation.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>miR-199b silencing in vivo via a transduce and transplant approach. <bold>a</bold> Bone marrow transplant (BMT) approach schematic to delete miR-199b in hematopoietic cells.

This analysis began at 3.5&#x000a0;weeks post-transplantation and continued every 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;weeks afterward to assess the complete blood count and observe the mice for any potential distress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c&#x02013;g). Short-term (3.5&#x000a0;weeks) PB analysis determined loss of miR-199b results in significant increase of neutrophils that was significantly sustained until 8&#x000a0;weeks post-transplantation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). By 20&#x000a0;weeks post-transplantation the neutrophil counts recovered completely until they rose significantly again at 26&#x000a0;weeks. Early on, this indicated loss of miR-199b expression in HSCs could have leukemic potential but the recovery and subsequent increase through the 26&#x000a0;weeks indicate that on a myeloid leukemia standpoint, miR-199b may not itself be leukemogenic.</p><p>Again, it is possible miR-199b works cooperatively with other mutations, as we suggested previously with IDH1 and NPM1 mutations. Since miR-199b expression is highest in CD33<sup>+</sup> cells during steady state hematopoiesis, perhaps the loss of miR-199b needs to be at the CD33<sup>+</sup> stage instead of the CD34<sup>+</sup> stage to induce myeloid leukemia. Nonetheless, we chose to assess the complete blood count to determine any additional patterns in the blood profile since miR-199b was silenced in the HSCs and could be affecting all blood types. We saw no significant changes in monocytes or eosinophils across the time course in the mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f, g). Surprisingly, the whole white blood cell (WBC) count saw significant increases at weeks 8, 16, and 20 where it peaked before it was no longer significant at week 26 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c).</p><p>These results interestingly, were mirrored by the lymphocyte counts, which do contribute a large number to the WBC count (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e). From this we can conclude that there may be either an immune response to the low miR-199b or low miR-199b may play an important role in not only myelopoiesis but also lymphopoiesis. An interesting avenue to investigate further may be miR-199b&#x02019;s expression in different types of lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma to see if miR-199b is implicated in these forms of blood cancers. miR-199b has yet to be linked to any lymphocytic leukemias or lymphomas but there is a report that links low miR-199a expression in primary CNS lymphoma cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] therefore with the sequence homology between miR-199a and miR-199b, miR-199b could be dysregulated in lymphomas as well and should be assessed via the TCGA database. At 27&#x000a0;weeks we chose to follow-up with flow cytometry for B and T cell markers to see if a specific cell type was increasing the high lymphocyte counts. Unfortunately, at this point, there were no significant difference between control and low-miR-199b mice for the B or T cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>h). This could have been due to the fact that the lymphocyte numbers peaked at week 20.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusions</title><p>More targeted studies are needed to determine how low miR-199b in HSCs leads to a myeloproliferative phenotype. In summary, it appears miR-199b plays an important regulatory role in differentiation and HDAC inhibitors are able to rescue miR-199b expression. MiR-199b appears to be a promising prognostic marker for FAB-M5-AML and CN-AML with NPM1 mutation. This association is correlated with relatively poor survival; furthermore, FAB-M5-AML also correlates with heightened HOXA7 and HOXB6 expression, two transcription factors known to be targets of miR-199b. Though our in vivo transplant mouse model showed only transient hematopoietic perturbations, it is possible miR-199b works cooperatively with these other mutations as part of a two-hit model leading to AML. Further studies are underway to examine the miR-199b&#x02019;s cooperativity, possibly with NPM1, and how this mechanistically results in myeloproliferation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Primary cell and RNA samples</title><p>Primary human bone marrow (BM) CD34<sup>+</sup>, BM CD33<sup>+</sup>, PB monocytes, PB eosinophils, and PB basophils RNA was obtained from stem cell technologies for transcript analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>miRNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and RT-qPCR</title><p>In order to determine the relative expression of miR-199b, miRNA was isolated from cells using miRCURY RNA Isolation Kit (Exiqon) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. cDNA was made utilizing the Universal cDNA Synthesis Kit II (Exiqon) for miRNA.
