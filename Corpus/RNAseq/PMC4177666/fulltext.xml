PcG repressed genes are commonly characterized by the presence of the epigenetic histone mark H3K27me3, catalyzed by the Polycomb repressive complex 2. Here, we present <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for a previously unrecognized plasticity of PcG-repressed genes in terminally differentiated brain neurons of parkisonian mice. We show that acute administration of the dopamine precursor, L-DOPA, induces a remarkable increase in H3K27me3S28 phosphorylation. The induction of the H3K27me3S28p histone mark specifically occurs in medium spiny neurons expressing dopamine D1 receptors and is dependent on Msk1 kinase activity and DARPP-32-mediated inhibition of protein phosphatase-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments showed that increased H3K27me3S28p was accompanied by reduced PcG binding to regulatory regions of genes. An analysis of the genome wide distribution of L-DOPA-induced H3K27me3S28 phosphorylation by ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) in combination with expression analysis by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that the induction of H3K27me3S28p correlated with increased expression of a subset of PcG repressed genes. We found that induction of H3K27me3S28p persisted during chronic L-DOPA administration to parkisonian mice and correlated with aberrant gene expression. We propose that dopaminergic transmission can activate PcG repressed genes in the adult brain and thereby contribute to long-term maladaptive responses including the motor complications, or dyskinesia, caused by prolonged administration of L-DOPA in Parkinson's disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In Parkinson's disease (PD) the motor impairment produced by the progressive death of midbrain dopaminergic neurons is commonly treated with the dopamine precursor, L-DOPA. Utilizing a mouse model of PD, we show that L-DOPA, via activation of dopamine D1 receptors, promotes the expression of genes normally repressed by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. We propose that this effect is exerted by promoting the phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 28 at genomic regions marked by tri-methylation of the adjacent lysine 27, generating a H3K27me3S28p double-mark. This event leads to displacement of PcG proteins and aberrant gene expression. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized plasticity of PcG-repressed genes in terminally differentiated neurons. Furthermore, the identification of specific genes whose expression is increased upon prolonged treatment with L-DOPA and the consequential activation of dopamine D1 receptors offer a possibility to design novel therapeutic strategies to treat Parkinson's disease and potentially other disorders caused by dysfunctional dopaminergic transmission in the brain, such as drug addiction and schizophrenia.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the Swedish Research Council (13482 to GF), the Karolinska Institutet/National Institute of Health Graduate Partnership Program (to GF), the Parkinson Foundation in Sweden (to GF), the Lundbeck Foundation (to KH) and the Danish National Research Foundation (to KH).

This disorder is commonly treated with L-DOPA, which upon conversion to dopamine, relieves the motor symptoms of PD <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Birkmayer1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, prolonged use of L-DOPA results in the emergence of dyskinesia, involving dystonic and choreic movements <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Obeso1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Several lines of evidence indicate that L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is caused by abnormal activation of dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs) located on the medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Aubert1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Feyder1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This leads to increased gene expression through sequential activation of PKA, dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk), mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 (Msk1) and eventually phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (H3S10p) <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Darmopil1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004574-Santini2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>While the regulation of histone H3S10 phosphorylation has been studied in the adult brain <xref rid="pgen.1004574-BramiCherrier1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Maze2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, almost nothing is known regarding H3S28 phosphorylation in neurons. However, in non-proliferating human fibroblasts it has been shown that H3K27me3S28 phosphorylation in response to MSK activation can lead to transcription of otherwise stably repressed genes <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Gehani1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The initial derepression is caused by displacement of gene repressor complexes containing PcG proteins, followed by transcriptional activation.</p><p>In this study, we describe an important link between dopamine signaling, H3K27me3S28 phosphorylation, and aberrant gene expression associated to reduced PcG binding. Using a mouse model of PD, we show that dopamine via D1Rs increases H3K27me3S28 phosphorylation in striatal MSNs via two pathways: 1) activation of Msk1, leading to phosphorylation of H3K27me3S28 and 2) activation of DARPP-32 leading to protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibition and suppression of H3K27me3S28p dephosphorylation. The combined effect is an accumulation of H3K27me3S28p at gene promoters that reduces PcG binding and allows transcription of a subset of genes. The results reveal a previously unrecognized plasticity of PcG-repressed genes in the adult brain, which upon environmental changes can be aberrantly induced via Erk-Msk1 mediated H3K27me3S28 phosphorylation and PKA-DARPP-32-dependent modulation of PP1 activity towards the same histone mark.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>L-DOPA triggers H3K27me3S28 phosphorylation in MSNs of hemiparkinsonian mice</title><p>The ability of L-DOPA to activate the Erk-Msk1 pathway in striatal MSNs <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Santini2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Pavon1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Westin1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, led us to hypothesize that signaling through dopamine receptors would induce phosphorylation of S28 in the context of H3K27me3 marked genomic sites to generate the H3K27me3S28p double histone modification. To test this possibility we turned to an experimental mouse model of PD in which unilateral stereotaxic injection of the neurotoxin 6-OHDA results in the elimination of the dopaminergic innervation to the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004574-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Westin1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Santini3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

This unilateral model of PD has the advantage that each mouse can serve as its own within-subject control as the dopamine sensitized MSNs in the striatum of the 6-OHDA lesioned side respond with intense D1R-mediated signaling to administration of L-DOPA, while the MSNs in the unlesioned side are not affected <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Santini2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Pavon1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Westin1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><fig id="pgen-1004574-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004574.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>L-DOPA triggers H3K27me3S28 phosphorylation in MSNs of hemiparkinsonian mice.</title><p>A) Hemiparkinsonian mice were generated by unilateral injection of 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle, eliminating the dopaminergic (DA)-innervation from the substantia nigra into the striatum.

It has been proposed that LID depends on the persistent and intermittent hyper-activation of the cAMP/DARPP-32 signaling cascade produced by L-DOPA through sensitized D1Rs.

This is not surprising since desensitization of kinase signaling pathways following persistent upstream activation and negative feedback is a common phenomenon. Accordingly, previous work showed that repeated administration of L-DOPA to 6-OHDA-lesioned mice is accompanied by a partial normalization of sensitized D1R signaling, reflected in lower levels of Erk activation and reduced global phosphorylation of H3 at S10 <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Santini2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Santini4" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Importantly, despite the attenuated induction of H3K27me3S28 phosphorylation after chronic L-DOPA, our genome-wide analysis showed that there was still a good correlation between the genomic loci gaining the H3K27me3S28p mark and gene induction. This suggested that residual kinase activity was sufficient to drive transcription from PcG-repressed genes in the context of LID (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004574.s006">Figure S6A</xref>&#x02013;C).</p><p>The decreased ability of L-DOPA to induce H3K27me3S28p observed after chronic administration correlated with reduced expression of transcripts from H3K27me3 and H3K27me3S28p marked genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004574-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), but not of transcripts from H3K27me3 marked genes lacking the H3K27me3S28p mark or transcripts in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004574-g006">Figure 6C&#x02013;D</xref>). As an exception, IE genes such as <italic>Atf3</italic>, <italic>c-Fos</italic> and <italic>Egr2-4</italic>, which encode TFs, were all induced to at least the same extent after chronic L-DOPA administration compared to acute administration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004574.s009">Table S2</xref>). This suggests that these IE genes, which are characterized by transient expression, respond with fast on/off-kinetics presumably due to rapid dephosphorylation of S28 by PP1. This would allow PcG complexes to re-bind, when the signal leading to Msk1 activation ceases, thereby re-setting gene repression until the next activating signal, like for the repeated daily L-DOPA administration in chronically treated parkisonian mice.</p><p>The IE genes, <italic>Nr4a2</italic> and <italic>Nr4a3</italic>, also known as <italic>Nurr1</italic> and <italic>Nor1</italic>, encode orphan nuclear receptors that function as TFs. These genes were more strongly induced after repeated L-DOPA administration compared to acute L-DOPA administration. It has been shown previously that the expression of Nr4a2, a gene product involved in the development of dopaminergic neurons <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Perlmann1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, is increased in response to prolonged treatment with L-DOPA and that this effect occurs in the MSNs expressing D1Rs <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Heiman1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.

Our results are in line with these observations and provide a possible mechanism accounting for the enhanced expression of Nr4a2 in response to chronic L-DOPA administration. In the striatum, Nr4a3 mRNA expression is induced by activation of D1Rs and this effect is prevented by blockade of Erk signaling <xref rid="pgen.1004574-Bourhis1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Whereas the exact role of Nr4a3 in dopaminergic transmission remains to be elucidated, the present data support the idea that, in PD, this gene is de-repressed via D1R-mediated activation of Erk and increased H3K27me3S28 phosphorylation.</p><p>Interestingly, we identified other PcG regulated genes such as neuropeptide encoding genes: galanin (<italic>Gal</italic>), thyrotropin releasing hormone (<italic>Trh</italic>) and neuropeptide Y (<italic>Npy</italic>), which all were only induced upon chronic treatment with L-DOPA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004574.s009">Table S2</xref>). In contrast to IE genes, these neuropeptide encoding genes seems to be more tightly regulated, and their activation presumably requires persistent phosphorylation of H3K27me3 marked and PcG bound regions, as well as induction of additional TFs and co-factors to lead to their transcriptional activation.</p><p>The regulation of Trh is in line with previous work showing a large increase in the mRNA for this hormone occurring in the striatal MSNs of dyskinetic rats <xref rid="pgen.1004574-CantutiCastelvetri1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.

Therefore, the increase in galanin mRNA expression produced by chronic administration of L-DOPA may lead to significant modifications in basal ganglia neurotransmission. Future studies will be necessary to determine the impact of these changes on the development and manifestation of dyskinesia.</p><p>The functional implications of differences in reactivation of PcG repressed genes remain to be investigated in more detail. However, it is possible that genes that are activated only in response to acute administration of L-DOPA are implicated specifically in the emergence of LID, whereas genes that are activated only in response to chronic L-DOPA are involved in the consolidation and manifestation of this condition. Interestingly, one of the receptors for the neuropeptide galanin, Galr2 was only induced in response to acute L-DOPA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004574.s008">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004574-g006">Figure 6F</xref>), while the gene encoding the ligand, Gal, was only induced by chronic L-DOPA stimulation as mentioned above.</p><p>Further studies are necessary to examine which permissive determinants are required at genomic sites for H3K27me3S28p mediated expression of PcG target genes. Nevertheless, the fact that many genes regulated by PcG proteins are TFs and among them many are affected by H3K27me3S28 phosphorylation and upregulated by acute and chronic L-DOPA, suggest that LID is, at least in part, a consequence of secondary transcriptional events. These TFs might only need to be induced transiently in order to trigger transcription of other genes that lead to sustained changes in neuronal plasticity associated to long-term maladaptive responses, such as dyskinesia.</p><p>Overall our novel findings reveal a previously unrecognized plasticity of PcG-repressed genes in terminally differentiated neurons. The identification of specific genes whose expression is increased upon prolonged treatment with L-DOPA and dopamine D1 receptor stimulation offer a possibility to design novel therapeutic strategies to treat Parkinson's disease and potentially other disorders caused by dysfunctional dopaminergic transmission in the brain, such as drug addiction and schizophrenia.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Female C57BL/6J mice (30 g) were purchased from Taconic (Tornbjerg, Denmark).
