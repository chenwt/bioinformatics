To move towards gene discovery and marker-assisted breeding in cacao, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification project was undertaken using RNAseq data from 16 diverse cacao cultivars. RNA sequences were aligned to the assembled transcriptome of the cultivar Matina 1-6, and 330,000 SNPs within coding regions were identified. From these SNPs, a subset of 6,000 high-quality SNPs were selected for inclusion on an Illumina Infinium SNP array: the Cacao6kSNP array. Using Cacao6KSNP array data from over 1,000 cacao samples, we demonstrate that our custom array produces a saturated genetic map and can be used to distinguish among even closely related genotypes. Our study enhances and expands the genetic resources available to the cacao research community, and provides the genome-scale set of tools that are critical for advancing breeding with molecular markers in an agricultural species with high genetic diversity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cacao</kwd><kwd>SNP</kwd><kwd>mapping</kwd><kwd>breeding</kwd><kwd>markers</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The beans of <italic>Theobroma cacao</italic>, prized worldwide for their cocoa solids and cocoa butter that serve as the defining ingredient of chocolate, are now commercially produced in over 50 countries,<bold><sup><xref rid="DSV009C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></bold> including tropical regions of Central and South America, Asia and Africa.

Only bi-allelic SNPs were retained after sequence quality and depth filtering: all insertion/deletions (indels) and multi-allelic polymorphisms were excluded. The Original SNP Report contained &#x0223c;340 K sequences after these exclusions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSV009F1">1</xref>). The next major filtering step considered data of the diversity panel as a whole. Here, SNPs were retained only if the reference (Matina 1-6) allele appeared in two accessions and the alternative allele also appeared in two accessions. This filtering step provided selection confidence against potential artifacts of single RNA samples and resulted in the list of 48,408 termed Selected Filtered SNPs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSV009F1">1</xref>). Each potential marker was evaluated on the basis of its internal sequence with each sequence subjected to review of their expected performance in the Illumina Infinium technology. First, all markers in the Selected Filtered SNP set were submitted to Illumina and assigned an Assay Design Tool score. This score predicts the success of an SNP assay on the array by taking into account the GC content and sequence adjacent to the SNP site and assigning a value from zero to one. Only SNPs with an Illumina Infinium Assay Design Tool score &#x0003e;0.9 were included in the Final Filtered SNPs.</p><p>Furthermore, minor allele frequency (MAF) was calculated for each locus. Markers with a MAF &#x0003e;0.2 were selected for the Final Filtered set. Sequences surrounding the SNPs were screened for the presence of intron&#x02013;exon junctions using BLASTn on a preliminary Matina 1-6 genome assembly<sup><xref rid="DSV009C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and any containing a putative junction site was removed. Because the array was to be used on multiple mapping populations, SNPs heterozygous in at least one, but not all, diversity panel accessions were selected for inclusion on the array. As the Infinium array uses a primer extension bead-based array for genotyping, the number of markers that can be included depends on the bead type of each marker, which in turn is dependent on the nucleotides being assayed. Markers that distinguish A/T or C/G alleles require two beads. To increase the number of loci represented, only single bead-type SNPs (A/C, A/G, T/C, T/G) were chosen for inclusion on the Cacao6kSNP array. Finally, when possible, two SNPs per transcript were selected in an effort to ensure locus representation should one marker fail.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><label>2.7.</label><title>SNP evaluation and linkage mapping</title><p>Data generated from all 1,152 samples were analysed with GenomeStudio (Illumina), and genotypes were called using a GenCall threshold of 0.15.

The genotyping error rate was small for all three parents, with UF273 Type II samples exhibiting the highest number of non-concordant genotypes with 14 out of 5,149 (0.00272).

As direct siblings are likely to share many alleles, the probability of detecting an off-type between any two pair of individuals was defined as the probability of observing more genotype differences between them than expected with a genotyping error rate of 0.01. We calculated this probability for different numbers of SNPs sampled and for three different levels of relatedness (i.e. expected number of genotype differences). The proportion of differing loci between the closely related accessions UF273 Type I and UF273 Type II (0.162) was used as a reference point likely to be encountered in practical situations. Additionally, proportion values, or levels of relatedness, of 0.1 and 0.3 were also included to indicate the number of SNP loci that might be needed to differentiate more or less related accessions.</p><p>A genetic linkage map was constructed using the CATIE Type 2 mapping population. This population resulted from the cross of Pound 7 &#x000d7; UF273 Type II and consists of 68 individual trees. The initial mapping dataset included 2,857 SNPs that demonstrated segregation in the population. To generate the linkage map, the JoinMap 4.1 software (Kyazma, the Netherlands) was used by first converting the raw genotype data into the JoinMap format using the parental genotypes to define the segregation type and then assigning the appropriate allele code based upon the genotype data.<sup><xref rid="DSV009C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Markers with a significant amount of segregation distortion (15 SNPs) and with &#x0003e;10% missing data (11 SNPs) were removed from the linkage mapping analysis. Marker grouping was selected with a recombination frequency of 0.1 or higher, resulting in the formation of 10 linkage groups (one for each chromosome of cacao). Mapping itself was performed using maximum likelihood analysis. The fit and stress values, a measure of linkage strength, of the markers on each linkage group were examined, and any markers with a value &#x0003e;7 were removed. The linkage mapping was re-iterated until all markers had values &#x0003c;7. The small size of the CATIE Type 2 population contributed to a large number of markers with high fit and stress values. In total, 242 SNPs were removed due to fit and stress values above the stated threshold, resulting in a final linkage map consisting of 68 individuals with 2,589 SNPs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><label>3.</label><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><label>3.1.</label><title>Filtering and SNP statistics</title><p>Among the transcriptome reference sequences built for Matina 1-6 genome annotation efforts,<sup><xref rid="DSV009C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> a Matina 1-6 leaf transcriptome assembly was used for the SNP discovery described here.

Unique mapped reads (red) were used to call SNPs. The repetitive (green) reads had at least one end of the read-pair map to multiple places within the transcriptome, whereas the unmapped (blue) reads failed to map under the described thresholds (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/dnares/dsv009/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>). For each accession, the average number of reads per final filtered SNP selected for the Cacao6kSNP array ranged from 13 to 67 reads per SNP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/dnares/dsv009/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>).</p><p>The original SNP report identified 339,330 SNPs, which were reduced to 48,408 selected filtered SNPs, and finally to 6,000 SNPs selected for inclusion on the Cacao6kSNP array (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSV009F1">1</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSV009F2">2</xref> plots the location along the cacao genome of the selected filtered (middle ring) and the final filtered (inner ring) SNPs. Originally designed to be broadly applicable to various germplasm collections and mapping populations, our filtering methods favoured high-quality SNPs with large minor allele frequencies across the set, rather than SNPs specific to any one genotype. Although rare SNPs may identify a specific genetic background or unusual phenotype in germplasm collections, they are likely to be homozygous and hence unmappable in mapping populations. When possible, redundancy of marker usefulness among genotypes was preferred. The inclusion of two SNPs per contig that met all the filtering criteria was a measure of precaution against failed genotyping at any one locus. This precaution was unnecessary as 5,149 of the 5,388 successfully synthesized beads (96%) yielded reliable genotype data.

Because an early transcriptome assembly was used to identify SNPs, many of these contigs were later collapsed into one another during the gene model prediction and annotation stage of genome assembly.<sup><xref rid="DSV009C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The final number of gene models represented by the selected SNPs was determined and shows a slight reduction to 4,305 gene models (1.4 SNPs/gene model on average). The gene models represented on the Cacao6kSNP array display a cross-section of cellular components, molecular functions and biological processes as determined via GOslim annotation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSV009F3">3</xref>). This diversity in the types of genes represented suggests that the SNPs selected for inclusion on the Cacao6kSNP array are likely to have broad impacts on plant physiology, making them desirable for general marker-trait association analysis. Large proportions of genes involved in protein (13%) and nucleotide (10%) binding are represented, along with those with transferase (9%) and hydrolase (8%) activities. The largest biological processes represented include metabolic, cellular and protein metabolism. Of immediate interest to cacao breeding efforts are the SNPs present in gene models involved in stress and abiotic or biotic response (4%) and those linked to developmental processes (2%).

Removing markers with low GenTrain (&#x0003c;0.4) and GenCall 10% (&#x0003c;0.2) scores resulted in a final set of 5,149 SNPs. The Cacao6kSNP array was originally run with 1,152 DNA samples (including duplicated controls), but seven DNA samples failed completely. In total, 5,149 SNPs were genotyped in 1,145 DNA samples for a total of 5,895,605 data points. Only 6,171 of these data points provided no definitive genotype representing 0.1% missing data within the total analysed dataset. The submitted Cacao6kSNP represented 6,912,000 potential data, of which 85% provided useful genotype data.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><label>3.3.</label><title>Comparison of allele calls from chip array and sequencing</title><p>A cursory survey was performed to compare the initial sequencing-based SNP calls from RNAseq with the genotype data generated from the Cacao6kSNP array. Nine accessions present in both datasets were examined for differences in allele calls (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="DSV009TB1">1</xref>). Concordance between genotypes can be found along the diagonal for each accession and ranged from 86 to 99% across the nine accessions compared (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="DSV009TB1">1</xref>). Overall, 39,399 data points were compared and found to be 93% concordant (36,724 data points). The majority of non-concordance events observed for any particular accession appear to represent differences in the sensitivity of heterozygous allele detection, that is, when one dataset called a marker heterozygous and the other set called the same marker homozygous. Homozygous changes, or those for which the sequencing reads called one homozygous allele and the array called homozygous for the other allele, were much less common. In total, 1,916 SNPs generated differing genotype calls between the Cacao6kSNP array and RNAseq data. This number was striking and represents variation for 37% of the total SNPs genotyped. A closer examination of the differences was performed. The number of non-concordant markers was calculated and sorted based on the number of accessions showing discrepancies for that particular SNP (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="DSV009TB2">2</xref>). This analysis revealed that the bulk (1,433) of the identified non-concordant SNPs differed within a single accession and that 97% (1,383) of the differences observed were heterozygous changes. Visual inspection of these SNPs in GenomeStudio displayed three well-defined clusters for the majority of the markers. Additionally, for discrepant SNPs in the parents of the CATIE mapping population, Pound 7 and UF273, Mendelian segregation was used to infer the correct genotype of the parent. For all instances when either parent was the only accession displaying discrepancies between the Cacao6kSNP array and RNAseq, segregation of the CATIE mapping populations supported the genotype value obtained by the Cacao6kSNP array. In contrast, non-congruent SNPs with three or more accessions showing differences display a larger proportion of opposing homozygotes (24&#x02013;100%), and the number of discrepant markers dropped to only 136 SNPs for this whole subset (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="DSV009TB2">2</xref>). When SNPs with three or more non-concordant accessions were examined in GenomeStudio, over half showed poor or single cluster formation, indicating issues with the Cacao6kSNP data for these SNPs. Those displaying three well-defined clusters had less than six sequencing reads for the discrepant accessions. Although experiments specifically designed to assess the accuracy of the chip array versus short read sequencing calls are still required, from our data, it appears as though the majority of non-concordant markers are the result of improper allele calls from the use of sequencing reads, based on the strong cluster formation, segregation data and small number of discrepant accessions affected by these SNPs. These issues are possibly the result of low read coverage or strand (allele) bias at the mismatched SNP causing heterozygotes to be misidentified as homozygotes. However, the less common SNPs with the opposing homozygous alleles are more likely issues with the chip array, as evidenced by the increase in poor cluster formation for these SNPs.

Both accessions showed extreme homozygosity across 5,117 SNPs, with only two and six heterozygotes identified in Matina 1-6 and Criollo 13, respectively, resulting in 99.8% homozygosity. This finding is consistent with previous analyses using microsatellite markers<sup><xref rid="DSV009C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="DSV009C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and was helpful in the generation of the respective genome assemblies. Despite their high levels of homozygosity, these accessions share only a meager 38% of their alleles (1,936 out of 5,117). A list of the markers with differing alleles between Matina 1-6 and Criollo 13 can be found in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/dnares/dsv009/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>. This allelic divergence is perhaps due to geographic isolation and differing evolutionary paths. In terms of cacao breeding, an examination of the differences between these accessions may identify alleles specific for particular traits of interest. Criollo is often preferred by the fine flavour chocolate producers but tends to suffer from poor yields,<sup><xref rid="DSV009C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="DSV009C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> whereas Matina, an Amelonado type, one of the most grown genetic groups, is higher yielding and makes up a large proportion of bulk chocolate. A better understanding of the genetic differences between these two clones may provide insight into the mechanism and control of the traits that make each desirable to cacao growers and producers.</p><p>Two other genotypes, this time closely related: UF273 Type I and UF273 Type II, were also examined. These two accessions, respectively, serve as the fathers for the CATIE Type 1 and CATIE Type 2 populations generated at CATIE, Turrialba, Costa Rica.<sup><xref rid="DSV009C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Originally intended to be a single F1 population from the cross of Pound 7 &#x000d7; UF273, five cloned trees of UF273 were used as parents. After the F1 population was planted, it was discovered that one tree out of the five UF273 trees used as a pollen donor was genetically distinct from the other four clones (UF273 Type I) and was henceforth referred to as UF273 Type II. An SSR analysis of 180 markers revealed variation in UF273 Type II alleles for 22 markers (12%), with most often one allele differing at the locus.<sup><xref rid="DSV009C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> A comparison of UF273 Type I and UF273 Type II was performed using 5,123 successful genotypes from the Cacao6kSNP array. UF273 Type I shows 60% homozygousity (3,101 out of 5,123 markers) and UF273 Type II only slightly more at 64% (3,276 out of 5,123). Further distinguishing themselves from the Matina 1-6 and Criollo 13 accessions, UF273 Type I and UF273 Type II share 84% identity (4,294 markers) and 99% of their alleles, having only eight opposing homozygous SNPs out of the 5,123 markers compared. The high proportion of shared alleles between these two accessions suggests a close genetic relationship. IBD values of all pair-wise comparisons for both the CATIE Type 1 and Type 2 mapping populations were determined and are summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSV009F4">4</xref>. A pair-wise IBD value of 0.92 was determined for UF273 Type I versus UF273 Type II, indicating that it is a first-degree (full-sib) relationship (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSV009F4">4</xref>). There are only two cases where the IBD is as high, or higher, than those of the UF273 accessions. Two full-sibs from the CATIE Type 1 population also share an IBD of 0.92, and another comparison shows an IBD of 1 (genetically identical), which can be attributed to a field error. The UF273 Type I and Type II accessions are so similar that they have often been lumped together as few genetic differences between the two were previously observed.<sup><xref rid="DSV009C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> However, this pooling often creates problems for cacao breeders as progeny generated from crosses with these accessions has been shown to segregate differently for multiple traits (Dr Wilbert Phillips, personal communication). The availability of SNPs to easily distinguish these accessions from one another would serve to reassure breeding efforts utilizing one or both. A total of 827 markers differentiating UF273 Type I and Type II accessions were reported and can be found in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/dnares/dsv009/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>.

Using a number of randomly selected loci genotyped in the Cacao6kSNP array as a pool of markers, we determined the probability of successfully differentiating accessions with 10%, 16.2% (as observed with UF273 Type I and Type II) and 30% genetic variation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSV009F5">5</xref>). A confidence threshold of 95%, taking into account the genotyping error rate, was used to identify different accessions. Serving as a measure of relatedness, the proportion of loci that were different between the first-order related UF273 accessions (0.162) was used as a reference point as differentiation between two full-sibs is likely to be a practical situation encountered in breeding programs. Proportion values of 0.1 and 0.3 were also included to show how the results might change with more or less genetically related accessions as described in the Materials and Methods. For the example of UF273 Type I and Type II, 24 loci are required to confidently distinguish one accession from another, whereas for accessions displaying only 10% variation, 30 loci would be required (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSV009F5">5</xref>). These values are consistent with those identified in bovine systems and in other cacao studies,<sup><xref rid="DSV009C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="DSV009C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> which reported that &#x0223c;40 SNP loci are required to differentiate genetically distinct individuals. The number of loci required to distinguish related accessions can be genotyped easily using modern SNP genotyping systems (Fluidigm, Sequenome, Golden Gate, etc.) and will be of value for marker-assisted selection breeding programs.

Segregating SNPs, or those where one or both parents are heterozygous, can be used to generate linkage maps in these F1 populations. The number of segregating SNPs within and between mapping populations is shown as a Venn diagram (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSV009F6">6</xref>). The total number of segregating SNPs ranges from 2,543 to 3,563, which is &#x0223c;10 times as many markers as in the composite SSR map created by Brown et al.<sup><xref rid="DSV009C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> and 2 to 3 times the number of markers in the composite map generated by Allegre et al.<sup><xref rid="DSV009C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> A number of SNPs specific to each of the mapping populations were identified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSV009F6">6</xref>). Furthermore, 260 loci segregate in CATIE Type 2 but do not segregate in CATIE Type 1. Additionally, CATIE Type 1 has 346 segregating markers that do not segregate in the Type 2 population (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSV009F6">6</xref>). These population-specific SNPs may prove instrumental in determining associations with traits specific to one population. Conversely, the 956 SNPs held in common across all populations can be used as anchor markers in a composite linkage map. Placement of the markers of this set will provide higher overall precision than use of markers from any one individual map.<sup><xref rid="DSV009C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="DSV009C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>

Ten linkage groups corresponding to the 10 chromosomes of cacao were identified, and linkage group designation was assigned by comparing mapped markers to the chromosomes of the Matina 1-6 genome assembly using the convention defined by Lanaud.<sup><xref rid="DSV009C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="DSV009C49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> Linkage mapping generally relies on large numbers of individuals within the population to identify recombination events, which are used to order markers along the map. Although quite small for linkage map generation, this population is typical of many cacao mapping populations, which are often studied in regions where resources are limited. Combined with the large land requirements of tree breeding and the need to maintain trees for many years, cacao mapping populations seldom have more than a hundred individuals, although a few exceptions exist at larger cacao research stations. The substantial increase in the number of markers should help to identify recombination events that may not be noticed with fewer markers. The genetic map generated for the CATIE Type 2 population serves as a proof of concept that larger numbers of markers can help, but not completely overcome, a limited number of individuals.

The CATIE Type 2 map has a largest gap length between markers of 14 cM on LG05 and an average longest gap length of 7.5 cM across all linkage groups. In comparison, the Allegre composite SNP map has a 7.6 cM gap (LG02) and an average longest gap length of 4.3 cM.<sup><xref rid="DSV009C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Despite the increased number of SNPs on the CATIE Type 2 map, the gap size did not decrease. The redundancy in SNP selection for the Cacao6kSNP array is the most likely reason for this observation. Although more SNPs were present, they co-located (i.e. had the same cM position) along the map. In the CATIE Type 2 linkage map (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSV009F7">7</xref>), &#x0223c;1,600 SNPs were co-located. If these SNPs were selected from additional transcripts, fewer co-locating markers, and thus smaller gaps, would be expected. Additionally, the identification of SNPs from the transcriptome limited marker positions to the gene space. As a result, gene-rich regions may contain an abundance of markers. In the future, to better distribute SNPs across each linkage group, it will be beneficial to represent more transcripts or non-transcribed SNPs, perhaps evenly positioned across the chromosome, rather than to prioritize marker redundancy.</p><p>The generation of a composite map increases the effective number of individuals within the mapping population, improving the chance of observing recombination events. The smaller size of the CATIE Type 2 population reduces the number of observed recombinations, causing markers to co-locate and generating gaps between clumps of markers. The uncertainty introduced by ordering co-located markers can also result in somewhat larger linkage groups. An estimate of base- pairs per cM was calculated for each map, first using the length of each sequenced genome separately and then averaging the resulting values together; the error presented represents the standard deviation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="DSV009TB3">3</xref>). An average size was used, because Matina has one of the larger cacao genome sizes, whereas Criollo has one of the smaller genome sizes.<sup><xref rid="DSV009C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The CATIE Type 2 map, at 2 SNPs/cM, generated an average size of 216,420 bp/cM, whereas the Allegre composite map, with 1.7 SNPs/cM, predicted 365,656 bp/cM.</p><p>Under ideal conditions, SNPs with fit and stress values (a statistical measure of whether a locus fits well between its neighbours; lower values represent a better fit) over 2 are removed from the map. To generate this map, 242 SNPs with a fit and stress value over 7 were removed; this relatively high number of markers is due to the limited number of individuals in the population, which reduces the strength of the linkages. When data from the Cacao6kSNP array is used to map a much larger population, the increased number of individuals in that population contributes to significantly improve fit and stress values for the mapped SNPs, further emphasizing that for linkage mapping, additional markers cannot completely overcome a lack of individuals. Despite this issue, the markers on the CATIE Type 2 linkage map show strong co-linearity to both the Matina 1-6 v1.1 and Criollo v1 genome assemblies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSV009F8">8</xref>). Marker positions of the linkage map were compared with the genomic positions of both assembled cacao genomes. Marker sequences for the 2,589 SNPs included on the CATIE Type 2 linkage map were blasted to each assembled genome to determine marker position, and all of the linkage groups that contain a mapped marker are displayed with identical markers connected by grey lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSV009F8">8</xref>). Eleven linkage groups are presented for the Criollo v1 assembly as some markers were found on Tc00, a scaffold used to hold sequences that could not be placed on the original Criollo v1 assembly.<sup><xref rid="DSV009C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> As such, the increased number of markers on this new linkage map may have helped to anchor additional regions of the Criollo v1 assembly (Tc00) onto the 10 chromosomes.
