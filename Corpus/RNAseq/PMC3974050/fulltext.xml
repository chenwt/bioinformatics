Non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung carcinoma and accounts for at least 85% of all lung cancer cases in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Adenocarcinomas (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinomas (LUSC) are the most common subtypes of NSCLC.</p><p>Insulin is a crucial growth factor that binds specifically to the insulin receptor (INSR) and subsequently activates the PI3K-AKT pathway. This pathway is mainly responsible for mediating the metabolic effects of insulin and regulating the MAP kinase pathway that influences important biological processes, such as cell growth and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The mature human INSR has two isoforms: Insulin receptor isoform A (IR-A) and Insulin receptor isoform B (IR-B), which form from alternative splicing of the same primary transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The biological roles of IR-A and IR-B are different. IR-B is a classical insulin receptor which only binds to insulin, while IR-A has high affinities to both insulin and IGF2. IR-B is responsible for the major metabolic effects of insulin in muscle, liver, and adipose tissues. IR-A promotes growth and anti-apoptotic effects under physiological conditions like embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The relative level of mRNA encoding IR-A and IR-B is regulated not only in a tissue-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], but also depends on the stage of cell development and differentiation. For example, in fetal tissues and cancerous cells, IR-A is the predominant isoform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Dysregulation of the INSR has been reported in multiple cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. INSR over-expression has also been associated with lung tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Since distinct biological roles of IR-A and IR-B exist, it is important to evaluate the relative abundance of IR-A and IR-B expression in NSCLC and evaluate their associated prognostic values.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed RNA-seq data from 614 NSCLC (355 LUAD and 259 LUSC) and 92 normal lung tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We observed that IR-B mRNA expression was significantly lower in some NSCLC specimens (both LUAD and LUSC) compared to adjacent normal lung tissues, thereby contributing to altered IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio in this disease. Intriguingly, we observed that patients with higher IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio generally showed upregulated oxidative phosphorylation pathway, lower epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene expression signatures in NSCLC and exhibited longer survival under standard of care in LUSC. Additionally, the down regulation of IR-B and higher IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio was also displayed in other 18 tumor types. Overall, our results suggest that the IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio may serve as a prognostic maker to guide clinical treatment decisions of LUSC; and characterizing the specific relationship of this biomarker with prognosis and treatment response might also be valuable for other cancer indications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Molecular profiling and data processing</title><p>Normalized expression data of the genes and transcript isoforms for NSCLC were downloaded from Level 3 RNA-seq data of TCGA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/dataAccessMatrix.htm">https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/dataAccessMatrix.htm</ext-link>) dated March, 2013. The data include both LUAD and LUSC. TCGA collection includes 614 treatment naive NSCLC tumor samples (355 LUAD and 259 LUSC) and 92 adjacent normal lung tissues. All cancer specimens are comprised of at least 75% tumor tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Bioinformatics analysis of insulin receptor isoforms using RNA-seq data</title><p>The normalized isoform expression files and exon expression files generated by TGCA provide expression information of INSR isoforms. IR-A and IR-B mRNA expression levels were retrieved from normalized isoform expression files. The expression levels of IR-A and IR-B mRNA were compared between normal lung tissues and tissues from LUSC and LUAD. The mRNA expression ratio of IR-A and IR-B was calculated using RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization (RSEM) normalized read counts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/RNASeq">https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/RNASeq</ext-link>); for 0 read counts and the others as well, evaluation of the distribution justified a pseudo count of 0.1. The IR-A/IR-B ratios between LUSC, LUAD and adjacent normal tissue were compared using Wilcoxon-Mann&#x02013;Whitney two group (two-tailed) test. Since IR-A differs from IR-B by the exclusion of exon 11, we also calculated IR-A/IR-B ratios using the exon 10, 11, and 12 normalized expression files from TCGA to quantify the expression levels of IR-A and IR-B for the quality assurance.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental confirmation of INSR isoform expression status in NSCLC</title><p>Experimental confirmation of INSR isoform expression status was performed in two independent panels of NSCLC specimens. Panel 1 consists of five lung cancer cDNA arrays (HLRT101, HLRT102, HLRT103, HLRT104, and HLRT105) purchased from OriGene Technologies (Rockville, MD). The arrays contained cDNAs from 50 normal lung tissue (38 unique donors), 84 adenocarcinoma and 60 squamous-cell carcinoma samples. The tumor stage ranged from Stage IA to IV. The tumor samples were comprised of 35-95% tumor. Panel 2 included primary, fresh frozen, treatment na&#x000ef;ve NSCLC tumors from 24 patients and adjacent normal tissues from 12 of the 24 patients collected from the Shanghai Chest Hospital.

Reactions were cycled with the recommended 14-cycle program and then diluted 1:5 with TE buffer. Preamplified cDNA was used immediately or stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until processed. For PCR, the BioMark RT-PCR System (Fluidigm, CA) was utilized as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The number of replicates and the composition of the samples varied depending on the particular experiment but were never less than triplicate. Average Cycle Threshold (Ct) values were used to determine sensitivity and specificity of the designed probes. Ct values were extracted from each assay with the SDS v2.0 software tool (Applied Biosystems, CA). The average Ct values of all available reference gene assays within a sample were utilized for calculation of &#x00394;Ct.</p><p>MRNA for panel 2 samples was isolated using Ambion Recover All Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (Life Technologies). RNA quality was assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip&#x000ae; (Agilent technologies, CA). RNA purity and concentration were determined spectrophotometrically(260/280&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1.9). 2ug RNA were reverse transcribed to cDNA following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. The same volume of cDNA for each sample was evaluated by qPCR.</p><p>All samples were normalized to the average expression levels of the 3 housekeeping genes: ACTB, GAPDH and UBC.

While most normal samples (88 out of 92) have IR-A/IR-B ratio equal to approximately 1 [log<sub>2</sub> (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;sd)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.10&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.84], the distribution in NSCLC patients is shifted, associated with an increased ratio in this cancer type (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). Using these distributions, we identified log<sub>2</sub>(8) (i.e., 3, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) as the cutoff value, which is at least 3 times the standard deviation from the mean (0.1), to classify the tumor specimens into two groups - high IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio and low IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio (LIR). In the subsequent analysis of RNA-seq data, 114 differentially expressed genes shared between LUAD and LUSC were identified (see Methods). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that the down-regulated genes were significantly enriched with EMT genes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C) and genes involved in ECM-receptor interaction (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B), which have been reported to be significantly increased in invasive NSCLC cancer types (Byers LA, 2013).

isoforms IR-A and IR-B may be of critical importance in NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. After the failures of two large randomized phase III anti-IGF1R trials in NSCLC, (Figitumumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], hR1507 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]), IR-A signaling has been postulated as one of the major mediators of resistance to anti-IGF1R therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, due to technical difficulties, a key measurement to address this issue, the mRNA expression status of insulin receptor isoforms in primary NSCLC was largely unknown.</p><p>In this study, we leveraged recently available RNA-seq data generated from well-characterized primary NSCLC tumors by TCGA to evaluate mRNA expression of the splice variants IR-A and IR-B. This analysis was extended to include additional NSCLC samples beyond those available from TCGA, as well as additional tumor types. In summary, in all NSCLC datasets evaluated, we observed down-regulation of IR-B mRNA expression with an associated increase in the IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio in a subpopulation of patients. We also found a significant increase in the prevalence of patients with HIR in BRCA, COAD, KIRC, KIRP, LIHC, and UCEC compared to normal tissues, with the prevalence of HIR in brain tumors (both GMB and LGG) greater than 93%. These findings are important because they suggest that many cancer types experience alterations in the INSR pathway, which may be important for disease pathogenesis. Although we observed differences in the mRNA expression levels of IR-A in the TCGA dataset compared with our internal data, it may be due to overall differences in sensitivity and specificity between the platforms for IR-A quantitation and/or heterogeneity within tumor samples between our test panels and TGCA. Additional work will need to be done to get a fuller understanding of the role of IR-A and IR-B expression in NSCLC and other cancer types.</p><p>Given the role of the INSR in glucose metabolism, we postulate that the change of IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio in tissues could be associated with differences in metabolism in tumor tissue compared to normal tissue. It has been shown previously that glucose metabolism in cancer cells is altered from normal oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], such that tumor cells take up much more glucose and mainly process it through aerobic glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation i.e. the &#x02018;Warburg effect&#x02019;&#x02009;, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This metabolic switch emphasizes the production of intermediates necessary for tumor growth and division and has been shown to be regulated by oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in a number of key cancer growth pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Alterations in the IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio in NSCLC might be related to the Warburg effect in tumors. The down regulation of IR-B could be a negative feedback from cancer cells in response to the high glucose intake, thereby decreasing the Warburg effect in cancer cells. This is suggested by our observations that cancers with higher IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio have higher mRNA expression levels of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, as well as a less cancerous phenotype and greater survival in LUSC. At the same time, since the IRA has high affinity to IGF2, the higher IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio could push cells to depend more on IGF2 signaling through IR-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], resulting in increased proliferation signaling. The concentration of IGF2 in the microenvironment of a particular tumor type may be critical to influence the effect of the increased IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio. For example, for tumor types without high IGF2, increased IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio may be of benefit to the patients due to the lack of proliferation signaling through IR-A.</p><p>To further understand the molecular characteristics associated with the changes in the IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio in NSCLC, we analyzed the differentially expressed genes between the HIR and LIR groups. We found in both LUAD and LUSC, genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions such as collagen type I, V, VI, X; integrin, alpha 8, 11; and fibronectin type III domain containing 1 are significantly down regulated in patients with HIR (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). The enzymes involved in ECM remodeling such as metallopeptidases cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, and matrix-remodeling associated 5 are also significantly down regulated (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). All these genes are part of EMT signatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], where EMT is a process by which epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion while gaining migratory and invasive properties to become mesenchymal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In NSCLC cancer specifically, EMT has been associated with EGF receptor inhibitor resistance and worse clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. ECM/integrin signaling has also been demonstrated to provide a survival advantage to various cancer cell types against chemotherapeutic drugs and antibody therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The association of HIR with decreased EMT signatures described in this manuscript suggests that HIR patients have less invasive and metastatic lung cancers, which is consistent with the observed association between HIR and increased survival. Based on our previous data in breast cancer, these results were somewhat unexpected; however, they reveal that the relevance of the IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio as a cancer biomarker has to be evaluated for each tumor type. The complex relationship between altered INSR isoforms and cancer prognosis may help explain the challenges associated with targeting the IGF1R pathway in NSCLC and other cancers. It is also important to note that there are currently no methods available to quantify the protein level of IRA and IRB. These data could be helpful for subsequent evaluation of the clinical utility of IRA/IRB mRNA ratio in caner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>HIR was commonly observed in multiple solid tumors surveyed in this study, although the functional importance of these increased ratios likely differ between these tumor types. Since both IR-A and IR-B are regulated by insulin, IGF1 and IGF2 through autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms, the microenvironment of the cancer site may also contribute to the relationship of HIR with clinical prognosis and patient survival. Therefore, the exact impact of the increase in IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio in the clinical course of specific cancer types needs to be carefully evaluated before initiation of any intervention, especially those targeting the IGF pathway. Blocking altered metabolic signaling pathways through the IGF axis could benefit patients of one type of cancer but may be less likely to benefit patients with other cancer types. Accordingly, the knowledge that the IR-A/IR-B mRNA ratio is altered across multiple cancer indications is the foundation for continued efforts to characterize the effect of this alteration on cancer progression and therapeutic response in order to achieve the most benefit.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>WZ, KS ,CM, PB KR, BWH YY, JH are employees of Medimmune.
