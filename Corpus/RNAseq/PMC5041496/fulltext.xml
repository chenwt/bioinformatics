Their inactivation due to sequestration by expanded CUG repeats causes symptoms in the neuromuscular disease myotonic dystrophy. MBL zinc fingers are the most highly conserved portion of these proteins, and directly interact with RNA. We identified putative MBL homologs in <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> and <italic>Trichoplax adhaerens</italic>, and investigated their ability, as well as that of MBL homologs from human/mouse, fly and worm, to regulate alternative splicing. We found that all homologs can regulate alternative splicing in mouse cells, with some regulating over 100 events. The <italic>cis</italic>-elements through which each homolog exerts its splicing activities are likely to be highly similar to mammalian Muscleblind-like proteins (MBNLs), as suggested by motif analyses and the ability of expanded CUG repeats to inactivate homolog-mediated splicing. While regulation of specific target exons by MBL/MBNL has not been broadly conserved across these species, genes enriched for MBL/MBNL binding sites in their introns may play roles in cell adhesion, ion transport and axon guidance, among other biological pathways, suggesting a specific, conserved role for these proteins across a broad range of metazoan species.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>30 September 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Splicing is a co- or post-transcriptional process in which the spliceosome catalyzes excision of introns, or non-coding regions, from a precursor RNA transcript while concomitantly joining exons, or coding regions. This structure of exons and introns enables the generation of multiple mRNA isoforms from a single gene through the exclusion and inclusion of exons and introns, leading to multiple protein isoforms. Alternative splicing is a process that contributes to the vast diversity observed in fungi, plant and animal proteomes. <italic>Trans</italic>-acting protein factors can function as regulators of alternative splicing by interacting with specific sequences, or RNA secondary structures, termed splicing regulatory elements, within the RNA transcript to regulate spliceosome recruitment to or interaction with splice sites. These regulators can act in a spatio-temporal and developmentally dependent manner to enhance or repress inclusion of alternative exons (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Muscleblind (MBL) is a conserved family of RNA-interacting proteins that regulate many aspects of RNA metabolism, including tissue- and development-specific activation or repression of alternative splicing (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Plants, fungi and bacteria lack any protein that resembles MBL, so it appears that this family is exclusive to metazoans, evolving approximately 800 million years ago. Typically, invertebrates encode a single <italic>MBL</italic> gene, whereas vertebrates encode multiple <italic>MBL</italic> genes; humans and other mammals have three muscleblind-like (<italic>MBNL1-3</italic>) genes. For simplicity we will refer to all <italic>MBL/MBNL</italic> genes as muscleblind and use this term or MBL when discussing this family of genes/proteins. <italic>MBNL1</italic> and <italic>MBNL2</italic> are ubiquitously expressed in adult tissue, however, <italic>MBNL1</italic> is more highly expressed in muscle, and <italic>MBNL2</italic> in brain (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). <italic>MBNL3</italic> is developmentally regulated and is primarily expressed in placental tissue and in muscle satellite cells, playing roles in muscle regeneration and differentiation (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The three human/mouse <italic>MBNL</italic> paralogs undergo alternative splicing, which affect localization and activity of the proteins. Human <italic>MBNL1</italic> contains 10 exons that can give rise to at least 10 different splice isoforms (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In particular, we focus on the 41 kDa isoform of MBNL1, which contain exons 1&#x02013;4, 6&#x02013;8 and 10. <italic>MBNL1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> play a prominent role in the RNA repeat-expansion disease myotonic dystrophy (DM). In this disease, the sequestration of Muscleblind proteins to expanded CUG repeats leads to mis-splicing of several mRNAs, causing several DM symptoms (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Mammalian MBL is also involved in other RNA metabolic processes such as regulation of gene expression (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), mRNA stability (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), alternative 3&#x02032; end processing (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), localization (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and microRNA processing (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>RNA binding by MBL proteins occurs through highly conserved tandem CCCH-type zinc finger (ZnF) domains (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Many studies have strived to identify RNA motifs recognized by MBNL1 and the mechanism by which it binds to transcripts and regulates splicing. Fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) MBL and human MBNL1 tend to bind YGCY (Y = C or U) containing RNA motifs (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). CLIP-seq and RNA Bind-n-Seq experiments have identified slightly more specific and sub-optimal motifs, including the 4mers GCUU and UGCU, with MBNL1 binding specificity characterized as YGCY + GCUU (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>We analyzed sequence conservation and explored the splicing regulatory capacity of MBL proteins from <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> (CiMBL), <italic>Trichoplax adhaerens</italic> (TaMBL) and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (CeMBL), alongside human/mouse MBNL1 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> MBL. Using validated splicing reporter mini-genes in HeLa cells over-expressing MBL protein, we found that these homologs can regulate splicing of specific, exogenous pre-mRNAs. RNAseq experiments accessing global splicing regulation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) stably expressing MBL proteins showed that the homologs also regulate many endogenous targets. MBL proteins from human, <italic>Ciona</italic>, fly, worm and <italic>Trichoplax</italic> are present in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic localization suggests extra-nuclear activity, which would further extend the functional conservation of non-human MBLs beyond that of splicing regulation. Studying distant MBL proteins may provide insight into ancestral or novel functions that have been conserved from <italic>Trichoplax</italic> to human MBNL proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cloning, cell lines and splicing reporters</title><p>N-terminal HA-tagged DNA constructs encoding HsMBNL1, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (DmMBL), CeMBL, CiMBL and TaMBL were cloned into the pCI plasmid (Promega) using standard cloning procedures.

Using the human/mouse 41 kD isoform of <italic>MBNL1</italic> sequence as a query, we performed BLAST searches to identify homologs in these organisms. The 41 kD isoform of <italic>MBNL1</italic> contains the linker region between both pairs of zinc fingers (exon 3), lacks exon 5, which can control nuclear/cytoplasmic localization, and lacks exon 7, which has been proposed to contribute to MBNL1 dimerization (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This isoform has been extensively studied and exhibits both nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). <italic>Zinc-finger X1</italic> in <italic>Ciona, Muscleblind D</italic> in <italic>Drosophila, Muscleblind-1a</italic> in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> and a hypothetical protein in <italic>Trichoplax</italic> were identified as the highest scoring homologs. For clarity, we refer to these proteins as HsMBNL1, CiMBL, DmMBL, CeMBL and TaMBL for human, <italic>Ciona, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis</italic> and <italic>Trichoplax</italic> Muscleblind proteins, respectively. To quantify the extent of overall protein homology, Smith&#x02013;Waterman alignments comparing HsMBNL1 to each homolog, and the associated similarity scores, which reflect aligned residues with similar properties, were calculated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). DmMBL showed the highest overall similarity score of 62.8%, followed by TaMBL, CiMBL and CeMBL.</p><p>The Muscleblind family contains CCCH-type ZnF RNA-binding domains, normally occurring as a tandem pair. Our multi-species alignment shows that the ZnF domains are highly similar and are the most conserved regions of these proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, far right), despite the fact that the number of ZnFs, internal spacing between the conserved cysteine and histidine residues, and spacing between tandem ZnF domains vary among each homolog. Some regions outside of the ZnF domains are also conserved and have been previously shown to be important for MBL function. The motifs RD/KWL, or LEV box, and KxQL/NGR, which closely flank the first ZnF pair, are involved in nuclear localization for human MBNL1 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and may be present in DmMBL, CeMBL and TaMBL (Supplementary Figure S1). The linker region between tandem ZnF pairs exhibit the next highest density of conserved residues outside of the ZnFs. Mutation and truncation analysis in this linker region has demonstrated its importance for human MBNL splicing activity (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Finally, numerous proline residues are conserved, some of which lie in the linker region and have been previously shown to interact with Src family kinases and alter their activity (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The overall similarity between the MBL proteins in our study, particularly within the RNA-binding domains, suggests conserved RNA binding and provided the rationale for investigation of conserved splicing regulation by these homologous proteins.</p><p>To initially explore splicing of the MBL homologs, we conducted cell-based splicing assays using mini-gene reporters. Transfection of HA-tagged expression vectors encoding each homolog yielded similar, high expression levels in HeLa cells, as assessed by Western blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The homologs were also observed in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of transfected HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure S2A). Splicing reporter mini-genes, including human cardiac troponin T type 2 (<italic>TNNT2</italic>) exon 5 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), mouse nuclear factor I/X (<italic>Nfix</italic>) exon 8 (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), human <italic>MBNL1</italic> exon 5 (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), human sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase 1 exon 22 (<italic>ATP2A1</italic>) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), mouse very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (<italic>Vldlr</italic>) exon 16<sup>10</sup>, and human insulin receptor exon 11 (<italic>INSR</italic>) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) were co-transfected with MBL/MBNL homolog or GFP (control). Inclusion levels of each alternative exon was quantitated by RT-PCR, and expressed as percent spliced in (&#x003a8;) and also splicing activity as a percentage of activity relative to HsMBNL1. Across all mini-gene reporters tested, we observed the same direction of splicing regulation (either activation or repression) for all homologs, with varying degrees of regulation relative to HsMBNL1. For example, expression of HsMBNL1 represses inclusion of MBNL1 exon 5 from 67% to 19%; all MBL homologs exhibited similar repressive activity, but at varying degrees, with CeMBL exhibiting the weakest activity (&#x003a8; = 44%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Similarly, all MBL homologs could enhance inclusion of <italic>ATP2A1</italic> exon 22, raising &#x003a8; from 15% to between 55&#x02013;79% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><p>Homologs that most strongly repressed MBNL1 exon 5 were not necessarily those that most strongly enhanced ATP2A1 exon 22. Assessment of splicing activity using additional reporters revealed that potency of MBL/MBNL splicing activity depends on the specific transcript (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, Supplementary Figure S3). These differences in activity may be due to differences in <italic>cis</italic>-element architecture of the reporters, and also differences in the MBL/MBNL activity due to sequence variation between homologs. Among the reporters tested, DmMBL exhibited the most potent splicing activity relative to HsMBNL1, CeMBL was the poorest regulator for two of the reporters and TaMBL exhibited 60&#x02013;80% activity, regardless of reporter. These results are consistent with previous data showing that HsMBNL1 and DmMBL act as both activators and repressors of alternative splicing; here, we observe that CeMBL, CiMBL and TaMBL also exhibit these activities.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>MBNL1/2 null cells reconstituted with MBL homologs were generated to test global splicing regulation</title><p>To assess the ability of the MBL homologs to regulate endogenous transcripts across the transcriptome, independent of potential over-expression artifacts, we established stable cell lines expressing each homolog. First, to identify endogenous targets of mouse MBNL proteins, we performed RNAseq on 3 independent wild type MEF clones and 3 independent <italic>MBNL1/2</italic> knockout MEF clones (double knockout, or DKO, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We then selected one of the DKO clones and stably integrated an expression cassette containing each N-terminal GFP-tagged homolog, driven by the EF1&#x003b1; promoter, along with a puromycin selection cassette. Following puromycin selection, we used fluorescent-activated cell sorting to select cells that express similar levels of GFP-tagged MBL homolog. RNAseq libraries were generated from the five cell lines and an additional line expressing GFP alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Expression levels of GFP-tagged homologs were comparable across all lines, as assessed by Western blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>RNAseq libraries were generated from WT, MBNL1/2 knockout (DKO) and Muscleblind-reconstituted mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).

Each clone expresses similar levels of MBL/MBNL homolog, as assessed by Western blot.

The control, GFP-expressing cell line also showed localization to both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Supplementary Figure S2B). Differences in nuclear-cytoplasmic localization may be due to differences in protein sequence among the homologs, cell type, cell state and/or extracellular signals, but presence in the nucleus is consistent with a conserved function in regulation of splicing.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>Endogenous exons are regulated by MBL homologs in reconstituted DKO cells</title><p>RNAseq reads were mapped by STAR (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) to the genome and splice junctions, yielding 76M, 51M, 65M, 51M, 38M and 70M uniquely mapping reads from GFP, Hs, Ci, Dm, Ce and Ta-reconstituted lines, respectively. Psi values were quantitated using MISO (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) across all alternative splicing events. Clear examples of MBNL-regulated events that could also be regulated by each of the homologs were observed. For example, <italic>Map4k4</italic> exon 20 is included from 64&#x02013;73% in WT MEFs, but at 36&#x02013;42% in DKO MEFs; homolog expression was sufficient to enhance inclusion to 62&#x02013;88%, depending on the homolog (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). We further analyzed alternative splicing events across the transcriptome, focusing on events that were MBNL-dependent (those that exhibit a monotonicity Z-score &#x02265; 1.5 between WT and DKO MEFs, Supplementary Table S1) and could be rescued by any given homolog (MISO Bayes Factor &#x02265; 5 and |&#x00394;&#x003a8;| &#x02265; 0.1, Supplementary Table S2). We identified 194, 158, 92, 112 and 91 exons significantly regulated in Hs, Ci, Dm, Ce and Ta-MBL reconstituted cells, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, Supplementary Table S2). All major classes of splicing event types were represented, including skipped/cassette exons, retained introns, mutually exclusive exons and alternative 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; splice sites. Both splicing activation and repression activities were observed for each homolog, with a slight bias toward exon inclusion for Hs and Ce (binomial <italic>P</italic>-values &#x0003c; 0.01) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Distant MBL homologs regulate splicing of many endogenous exons in a manner similar to human MBNL1.

Other homologs also showed positive correlations, with R<sup>2</sup> values ranging from 0.43 (Dm) to 0.71 (Ce). In general, the direction of splicing regulation (activation or repression) by MBL homologs was consistent with regulation by endogenous MBNLs; the number of events regulated by one or more homologs is shown in Supplementary Figure S3B. To compare the extent to which each homolog regulates splicing, we plotted the magnitude of splicing regulation for each ortholog (|&#x00394;&#x003a8;|) relative to control (GFP-expressing) cells. HsMBNL1 and TaMBL exhibited the most and least dramatic regulation, respectively, as assessed by median |&#x00394;&#x003a8;| relative to control (GFP-expressing) cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>).</p><p>Splicing events that were significantly regulated by a greater number of homologs tended to be regulated in a direction consistent with that observed when comparing WT to DKO MEFs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).

As has been previously observed, YGCY motifs are enriched in the introns downstream of exons activated by MBNL, and in the upstream introns and exons repressed by MBNL, relative to control exons, as assessed when comparing WT to DKO MEFs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).

Co-transfection of each homolog in HeLa cells could partially rescue mis-splicing (Supplementary Figure S4A), suggesting that each homolog may compete for binding to CUG repeats to release endogenous MBNLs, through recognizing a binding site similar to that recognized by human/mouse MBNLs. In further support of this hypothesis, we also tested the ability of each homolog to bind to expanded CUG repeats. Transfection of a plasmid encoding 480 CTG repeats into the reconstituted MEFs yielded GFP foci in the nucleus of each cell line (Supplementary Figure S4B), although fly MBL did not yield foci as strong as the other homologs. This fly isoform has been previously demonstrated to bind CUG repeats more weakly than the MBNL binding site found in intron 4 of cardiac troponin T (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>Enrichment of MBNL binding motifs in introns of specific Gene Ontology categories across evolution</title><p>To gain insight into properties of MBL/MBNL target exons throughout evolution, we analyzed exons in species with reasonably comprehensive gene ontology annotations (<italic>Trichoplax</italic> was omitted from this analysis). We used motif conservation to predict MBL/MBNL target exons, and asked whether particular gene ontology categories were enriched among putative MBL/MBNL target genes. We first computed branch length conservation for top MBL/MBNL target 4-mers, as previously assessed by RNA BindNSeq (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), within introns &#x02212;150 to &#x02212;1 upstream of each exon and +1 to +150 downstream of each exon. Branch length conservation was assessed using multiple alignments of human introns relative to 6 vertebrate species, mouse versus 8 vertebrates, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> versus 8 insects, C<italic>. elegans</italic> versus 5 worms and <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> versus C<italic>. savignyi</italic>. We asked whether the mean branch length of MBNL motifs was higher than expected, relative to control motifs, in genes within each gene ontology category. Interestingly, we found that gene ontology categories containing the most highly conserved MBL/MBNL motifs were similar across broad evolutionary time (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). For example, &#x02018;calcium ion binding&#x02019;, &#x02018;ATP binding&#x02019; and &#x02018;actin filament binding&#x02019; were enriched across at least 4 of the 5 analyses, as well as &#x02018;membrane&#x02019;, &#x02018;ion transport&#x02019; and &#x02018;cell adhesion&#x02019;. While specific target exons of MBL/MBNL proteins have not necessarily been conserved across such large evolutionary distances, a role for MBL/MBNL in mediating the splicing of genes involved in particular biological functions may be conserved across millions of years of evolutionary time.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec id="SEC4-1"><title>Diverse Muscleblind homologs regulate alternative splicing of mammalian transcripts</title><p>Splicing reporter assays in HeLa cells and RNAseq analysis of endogenous transcripts in MEFs reconstituted with MBL proteins from fly, worm, <italic>Ciona</italic> or <italic>Trichoplax</italic> showed conserved alternative splicing regulation that positively correlated with splicing activity observed with the mammalian MBNL proteins (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These observations indicate a strongly conserved role for Muscleblind proteins as regulators of alternative splicing across all metazoans. A multi-species alignment between the homologs revealed that the CCCH-type ZnF&#x02013;RNA binding regions are the most conserved regions between species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and Supplementary Figure S1). A lack of conservation existing outside of the RNA binding domains suggests that these proteins regulate splicing primarily via interactions between ZnF domains and YGCY binding sites found in RNAs of MBL/MBNL-regulated events.</p><p>Differences observed in splicing regulation by the homologs may be attributable to differences in the number of ZnFs, differences in ZnF binding affinity or specificity, and spacing between tandem ZnF domains. These ZnF properties have been previously shown to affect HsMBNL1&#x02013;RNA interaction and splicing regulation (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). While we did not observe an obvious correlation between homolog ZnF number and the extent of splicing regulation, it is plausible that some substrates are more strongly regulated by MBL homologs containing a greater number of ZnFs. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog we studied contains 2 ZnFs, but homologs with 4 ZnFs have also been described (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>); it would be interesting to compare their activities.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-2"><title>Context-dependent splicing activity of Muscleblind is conserved across metazoans</title><p>Our results are consistent with previous studies that have shown that other alternative splicing factors have maintained their RNA regulatory maps (binding motifs upstream of exons and within exons correlates with repression and motifs present downstream of exons correlates with activation). The best studied is <italic>Nova</italic>, whose RNA binding protein domains are 94% identical across vertebrates (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). <italic>Nova</italic> homologs from Sea anemone, fly and lancelet can regulate several splicing events across different species (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), and <italic>Pasilla</italic> (<italic>Drosophila</italic> Nova homolog) globally regulates splicing using an RNA regulatory map similar to mouse (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).

The 12 splicing events regulated by all MBL homologs are notable for the large &#x00394;&#x003a8; for these events (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), which is twice the mean &#x00394;&#x003a8; for events regulated by four or fewer homologs. A possible explanation for why these events are regulated by all homologs is that these exons contain multiple and redundant MBL/MBNL binding sites that facilitate robust binding and splicing regulation.

For example, CeMBL is located primarily in the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and exhibits the strongest correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.71) to WT cells after HsMBNL1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).
