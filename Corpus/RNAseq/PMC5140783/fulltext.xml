id="P2">The utility of tumor-derived cell lines is dependent on their ability to recapitulate underlying genomic aberrations and primary tumor biology. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 25 bladder cancer (BCa) cell lines and compared mutations, copy number alterations (CNA), gene expression and drug response to BCa patient characteristics in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We observed a mutation pattern associated with altered CpGs and APOBEC-family cytosine deaminases similar to mutation signatures derived from somatic alterations in muscle invasive (MI) primary tumors, highlighting a major mechanism(s) contributing to cancerassociated alterations in the BCa cell line exomes. Non-silent sequence alterations were confirmed in 76 cancer-associated genes, including mutations that likely activate oncogenes <italic>TERT</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, and alter chromatin-associated proteins (<italic>MLL3</italic>, <italic>ARID1A</italic>, <italic>CHD6</italic> and <italic>KDM6A</italic>) and established BCa genes (<italic>TP53, RB1</italic>, <italic>CDKN2A</italic> and <italic>TSC1</italic>). We identified alterations in signaling pathways and proteins with related functions, including the PI3K-mTOR pathway, altered in 60% of lines; BRCA DNA repair, 44%; and <italic>SYNE1&#x02013;SYNE2</italic>, 60%. Homozygous deletions of chromosome 9p21 are known to target the cell cycle regulators <italic>CDKN2A</italic> and <italic>CDKN2B</italic>. This loci was commonly lost in BCa cell lines and we show the deletions extended to the polyamine enzyme <italic>methylthioadenosine</italic> (MTA) <italic>phosphorylase</italic> (<italic>MTAP</italic>) in 36% of lines, transcription factor <italic>DMRTA1</italic> (27%) and antiviral <italic>interferon epsilon</italic> (<italic>IFNE</italic>, 19%). Overall, the BCa cell line genomic aberrations were concordant with those found in BCa patient tumors. We used gene expression and copy number data to infer pathway activities for cisplatin treated cell lines, then used the inferred pathway activities to build a predictive model of platinum response. When applied to platinum-treated patients gathered from TCGA, the model predicted overall response. Together, these data and analysis represent a valuable community resource to model basic tumor biology and to study the pharmacogenomics of BCa.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bladder cancer</kwd><kwd>mutation</kwd><kwd>copy number</kwd><kwd>cell lines</kwd><kwd>oncogene</kwd><kwd>exome sequencing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P3">Bladder cancer (BCa) is the sixth most common cancer in the United States with over 74,000 new cases and 16,000 deaths each year (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). While there are recurrent genetic aberrations in BCa (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) that relate to overall patient survival (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), tumor classification (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and response to therapies (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), BCa is also characterized by elevated mutational burden (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and a high degree of molecular heterogeneity (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). These factors complicate the study of molecular mechanisms of disease and highlight the need to select experimental models that recapitulate the genomic variation seen in patients.</p><p id="P4">Human tumor-derived cancer cell lines have long served as model systems to study the mechanisms driving cancer and to discover potential therapeutics (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, and not uncommonly, drug response in cell lines does not translate to patient tumors. One of the many factors contributing to this lack of translatability is the difference in genomic aberrations between cell lines and tumors. A systematic comparison of genomic features in cell lines and tumors has only recently been possible with contributions from individual research groups (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and large collaborative efforts such as the TCGA for tumor samples (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) for cancer cell lines. One such comparison looked at high-grade serous ovarian cancer and found that the two most commonly used cell line models were hyper-mutated compared to solid tumors, highlighting a potential disconnect between the genomic features of commonly used cell lines and primary tumors. Furthermore, cross-contamination of cell lines has been welldocumented and likely also contributes to confounding results (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). For all of these reasons, the choice of cell line models is critical if results from <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments are to have biological and clinical relevance. A number of investigators have explored similar concepts in ovarian (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), head and neck (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), colorectal (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), melanoma (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and non-small cell lung (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) cancers. Here, we provide the data and analyses to include BCa in this growing list, a necessary step to strengthen the analysis of all cancer types.</p><p id="P5">While the CCLE and GDSC are valuable pharmacogenomics resources, they have limited mutational profiling data and are under-represented for BCa cell lines. Previous efforts characterized a panel of 40 BCa cell lines for gene expression and response to chemotherapy (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and analyzed copy number alterations (CNAs) using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Here we present mutational and CNA profiling using exome sequencing on 25 BCa cell lines, along with an integrative analysis of mutations, CNA and mRNA expression to compare the cell lines to primary human bladder tumors. We use the genomic and pathway profiles of the cell lines to stratify human BCa patients according to treatment response and identify a set of pathways that are predictive of platinum chemotherapy. To help investigators select the appropriate cell model for experimental functional studies, we make our data, analysis results, and scripts publically available: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.synapse.org/UC25">https://www.synapse.org/UC25</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><p id="P6">We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 25 BCa cell lines derived from 21 MI and 4 non-muscle invasive (NMI) tumors that were authenticated using DNA fingerprinting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Exomes were sequenced to a mean depth of ~60X coverage with 86% of exonic bases sequenced to a depth of &#x02265;10X (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). All WES-predicted variants passing the mutational pipeline described in the Methods are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>. A previously observed high rate of somatic BCa mutations predominated by single nucleotide variants (SNV) in CpGs and associated with the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing (APOBEC) family of DNA cytosine deaminases has been described and prompted us to examine the tri-nucleotide context of the cell line variants (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This revealed a common signature in both the 21 MI tumor-derived lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and the 4 NMI tumor-derived lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) that was dominated by C&#x0003e;T transitions in CpGs, and by C&#x0003e;T and C&#x0003e;G APOBEC-mediated changes in a T-<underline>C</underline>-W context, where the underlined cytosine is altered and W = A/T. The signature represented 16.9% and 12.3% of all alterations, respectively, in the MI tumor-derived lines. Significantly, 204 SNVs in known or putative BCa genes were validated in the cell line exomes as described below and can be similarly analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Exomic variants associated with APOBEC enzymes and altered CpGs comprised 50/204 (24.5%) and 33/204 (16.2%) of variants, respectively; indicating a likely mechanism(s) underlying a large fraction (40.7%) of cancer-associated alterations in the exome. The proportions of the signature-associated variants in the cell lines are within the distribution reported from the analysis of somatic alterations in MI primary tumors (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Considering the cell line analysis unavoidably incorporates both germline and somatic variants, these results indicate the strength of the APOBEC- and CpG-associated signature in the exome.</p><p id="P7">We tested a total of 309 NGS-predicted variants identified in known cancer genes using PCR and Sanger sequencing and 237 (83%) NGS-predicted variants were confirmed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). The majority of variants that were not confirmed had a low number of variant read counts. Validated variants were then computationally assessed using the Annotation, Visualization and Analysis (AVIA) pipeline, v2.0 (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>); and more than half (128/237, 54%) were predicted to be deleterious by more than one functional analysis algorithm.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Mutational landscape of BCa cell lines</title><p id="P8">Nineteen genes have NGS-predicted, Sanger sequencing-validated alterations in &#x02265;4 of the 25 lines, including the <italic>lysine-specific methyltransferase 2C</italic> (<italic>MLL3/KMT2C;</italic> altered in 40% of lines), <italic>FAT atypical cadherin 4</italic> (<italic>FAT4;</italic> 24%) and <italic>retinoblastoma 1</italic> (<italic>RB1;</italic> 20%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Using Sanger sequencing, we identified <italic>telomerase reverse transcriptase</italic> (<italic>TERT</italic>) promoter variants in 84% of lines, confirming <italic>TERT</italic> as the most frequently altered BCa gene. We also detected previously unreported variants in less frequently altered, but well known cancer-associated genes including <italic>breast cancer 1</italic> (<italic>BRCA1</italic>) and <italic>Kirsten Rat Sarcoma</italic> homolog (<italic>KRAS</italic>). New potentially deleterious variants such as a G&#x0003e;T, p.E66X were detected in <italic>tumor protein p53</italic> (<italic>TP53</italic>) in cell line UM-UC-6 and in genes encoding chromatin remodeling functions, such as a C&#x0003e;T, p.R4139X in <italic>MLL3</italic> in cell line MGH-U3, an insertion and frameshift, p.D1850fs, in the chr 1p36 locus <italic>AT rich interactive domain 1A</italic> (<italic>ARID1A</italic>) in cell line UM-UC-6, and a deletion and frameshift, p.P1139fs, in the chr X <italic>lysine-specific demethylase 6A</italic> (<italic>KDM6A</italic>) in cell line UM-UC-13.

We selected the TCCSUP and UM-UC-3 lines to evaluate because they have previously been reported to have high <italic>TERT</italic> mRNA expression, high TERT protein levels and high telomerase activity (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The UM-UC-3 line contains a heterozygous c.&#x02212;124C&#x0003e;T variant and the TCCSUP line contains a homozygous c.&#x02212;124C&#x0003e;T variant, both suggesting increased <italic>TERT</italic> expression (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). After <italic>TERT</italic> mRNA knockdown, both lines showed a significant decrease in growth after 5 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), supporting a functional impact of the promoter mutations on overall <italic>TERT</italic> expression and the BCa cell phenotype.</p><p id="P10">We mapped proteins encoded by genes with sequence variants to putative pathways to identify potentially altered signaling networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Eleven genes encoding proteins involved in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling were altered in 60% of the lines, most frequently by altered <italic>PI3K regulatory subunit (PIK3CA)</italic> and the tyrosine kinase gene, <italic>ERBB2</italic>. In agreement with previous observations (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), the BRCA DNA repair pathway, including <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>ATM</italic>, were altered in 44% of lines in a predominantly mutually exclusive manner. This is similar to 40/127 (32%) of tumors from TCGA patients (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) which also exhibited BRCA pathway gene alterations that were predominantly mutually exclusive. Cell lines exhibited variants in genes encoding related proteins and/or functions, including the <italic>spectrin repeat containing, nuclear envelope 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> (<italic>SYNE1</italic> and <italic>SYNE2</italic>) in 60% of lines; and the lysine-specific methyltransferases <italic>MLL3, MLL2/KMT2D</italic>, <italic>MLL5/KMT2E</italic>, and <italic>MLL/KMT2A</italic> in 52% of lines. Many of the alterations we confirmed occur in genes that are frequently mutated in primary bladder tumors (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), thus enabling future experimental study of these genes and pathways using these BCa cell lines.</p><p id="P11">Several recent studies have examined genomic aberrations in the BCa cell lines (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). There was complete overlap of <italic>TERT</italic> promoter mutations observed in our study and those reported in Borah, et al. (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) including c.&#x02212;348G&#x0003e;C and c.&#x02212;269G&#x0003e;A, both observed in a single line, and c.&#x02212;57A&#x0003e;C observed in two lines. For the 25 lines studied here, Earl, et al. (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) reported 68 mutations in 10 genes and we confirmed 53 (78%) variants in our WES data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Our analysis also improved the annotation of several previously reported mutations (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). We determined that a deletion in the <italic>phosphatase and tensin homolog</italic> (<italic>PTEN</italic>) in line J82 was a homozygous loss of exons 7 and 8 (codons 212&#x02013;342, NM_000314) and a deletion in <italic>RB1</italic> in line TCCSUP was a homozygous loss of exons 18&#x02013;27 (NM_000321). This comparison revealed that our knowledge of cancer gene alterations in these cell lines was far from complete, and accurate mutation detection and annotation is required to overcome inter-study variability that could have a significant impact on experiments investigating BCa cell biology and response to therapy.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Global and local copy number analysis</title><p id="P12">In addition to characterizing sequence alterations, we used WES to identify CNAs. Using the ExomeDepth method (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), we identified duplications and deletions in each of the 25 BCa cell lines. The median length of duplications was 307 kb and was 51 kb for deletions. Similarly, the CCLE analyzed a total of 26 BCa cell lines using Affymetrix SNP6.0 chips (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and Earl, et al. assayed 40 BCa cell lines using Illumina Beadarrays (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). A total of 13 cell lines were assayed using all three platforms. Despite the different platforms and underlying data analyses, we found a high degree of overlap between loci with CNA using ExomeDepth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). On average, 75% of ExomeDepth-identified duplications overlapped with amplified regions detected in the CCLE and with 53% of those detected by Earl, et al. ExomeDepth deletions overlapped with 64% of the depleted regions identified in the CCLE and 75% of those in Earl, et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). For the same 13 cell lines, we compared CCLE and Earl, et al. copy number values on a gene-by-gene basis. For 12 of these lines we found an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.68 ranging from 0.47 to 0.81. The one exception was the UM-UC-3 line that showed a poor correlation of 0.17, potentially due to a misidentification in either the CCLE or Earl, et al.

This produced evidence of sequence and copy number alterations at nucleotide resolution at the sites of sequence variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).

Here, we show that BCa cell lines model the genomic features of patient tumors and these features can be used to model response to platinum drugs. The generation of genomic data and clinical trials that leverage these data is increasing (e.g., MATCH [NCT02465060], SWOG1314 [NCT02177695]), highlighting the importance of model systems such as cell lines to study the mechanisms of drug response and resistance.</p><p id="P22">The GDSC and CCLE remain the most comprehensive pharmacogenomic cell line collections, yet both datasets lack comprehensive mutational profiling. According to a recent survey of major BCa genomics datasets, there are 34 genes frequently and significantly mutated by somatic alterations in BCa tumors (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Many of these newly identified cancer genes have not been characterized in commonly-utilized BCa cell lines, including important chromatin associated genes such as <italic>STAG2</italic> and <italic>MLL2</italic> (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).

Analysis of the mutations in the cell lines revealed remarkably similar overall proportions of sequence motifs that were altered as compared to MI primary tumors (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and demonstrate a large fraction of exomic cancer-associated variants (40.7%) are associated with APOBEC enzymes and altered CpG sites. Additionally, this analysis likely underestimates the significance of these alterations as variants creating new CpGs with unknown regulatory significance were not counted and our analysis includes an unknown proportion of germline variants that dilutes the somatic mutation signal.</p><p id="P24">The chr 9p21.3 deletion typically associated with <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, <italic>p14ARF</italic> and <italic>CDKN2B</italic> loss (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) was frequently observed in the cell lines, similar to primary tumors; however to date the presence, extent and effect of the deletions on the surrounding genes has been unclear in BCa and in these lines, representing key experimental gaps in these important reagents.
