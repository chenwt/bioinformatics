Using poly(A)-independent and strand-specific RNA-seq, we identified 1,500 to 1,800 lncRNAs expressed in each of the following tissues of Brown Norway rats: the renal cortex, renal outer medulla, liver, cardiac left ventricle, adrenal gland, and hypothalamus. Expression and the binding of histone H3K4me3 to promoter regions were confirmed for several lncRNAs. Rat lncRNA expression appeared to be more tissue-specific than mRNA. Rat lncRNAs had 4.5 times fewer exons and 29% shorter transcripts than mRNA. The median cumulative abundance of rat lncRNAs was 53% of that of mRNA. Approximately 28% of the lncRNAs identified in the renal outer medulla appeared to lack a poly(A) tail. Differential expression of 74 lncRNAs was detected in the renal outer medulla between Dahl SS rats, a model of salt-sensitive hypertension, and salt-insensitive, congenic SS.13<sup>BN26</sup> rats fed a high-salt diet. Two of the differentially expressed lncRNAs, which were confirmed, were located within the congenic region and contained several sequence variants. The study identified genome-wide characteristics of lncRNAs in the rat model and suggested a role of lncRNAs in hypertension.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The relevance of a large group of non-protein-coding RNA, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), to hypertension remains nearly completely unexplored.

Much of the work in this area has focused on microRNA, but not lncRNA.

An emerging model for the action of some, but not all, lncRNAs is that lncRNAs interact with ribonucleoproteins and position chromatin modification complexes to enable regulation of gene transcription at select locations of the genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. An example of this is the human HOTAIR RNA, which serves as a scaffold that mediates the assembly of select histone modification complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. lncRNAs could also have functional impact in the cytoplasm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>lncRNAs in the rat model organism are poorly characterized.

The lack of a systematic characterization of lncRNAs in the rat is a bottleneck for studying lncRNAs in hypertension.</p><p>In the present study, we characterized lncRNAs in several tissue regions and organs in the Brown Norway rat, the strain that provided the reference rat genome. We used poly(A)-independent and strand-specific RNA-seq since not all lncRNAs contain a poly(A) tail and some lncRNAs may be transcribed from the DNA strand opposite to the one encoding an mRNA.

Furthermore, transcripts with complete branch lengths (CBL) &#x0003e;0 and open reading frames of &#x0003e;150 amino acids were removed since protein-coding open reading frames usually contain at least 100 amino acids.

Using the criteria shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>, 2,761 lncRNA transcripts were identified in at least one of the six tissue regions analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Dataset</xref>). These lncRNA transcripts corresponded to 1,620 lncRNA gene loci. The number of detectable lncRNAs was 1,589 for the liver, 1,806 for the renal cortex, 1,640 for the cardiac left ventricle, 1,812 for the renal outer medulla, 1,748 for the adrenal glands, and 1,520 for the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Dataset</xref>). The complete dataset was deposited into Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE60069).</p><p>The vast majority of the identified lncRNAs, 2,630 out of 2,761 (95%), were novel transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). The identified lncRNAs were classified as intergenic, intronic and antisense lncRNAs based on spatial relationships of their gene loci with protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). In general, antisense lncRNAs are transcripts that have either intronic or exonic overlaps with a protein coding gene on the opposite strand. lncRNAs that do not have any overlap with mRNA exons are either intergenic or intronic lncRNAs. It should be noted that lncRNAs described in the current study were transcripts and multiple lncRNAs may be located in the same gene loci. The identified lncRNAs were mostly intergenic lncRNAs (2,373 or 86%) and secondly antisense lncRNAs (223 or 8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A, 1B</xref>).</p><p>A cutoff of mean + 2 &#x000d7; standard deviation, where mean and standard deviation were calculated from the FPKM values of an lncRNA in all tissues analyzed following quantile normalization, was used to identify lncRNAs enriched in a specific tissue. We found enrichment of 99 lncRNAs in the renal cortex, 69 in the renal outer medulla, 159 in the cardiac left ventricle, 224 in the liver, 152 in the adrenal gland, and 264 in the hypothalamus. Note that the smaller numbers of lncRNAs enriched in the renal cortex and the renal outer medulla were likely in part because the two tissues were similar. To verify the RNA-seq result, one lncRNA identified as enriched in each of the six tissues by RNA-seq was selected for real-time PCR analysis. The tissue enrichment was confirmed in nearly all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A-2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Expression of rat lncRNAs was often correlated with active promoters</title><p>We examined the binding of histone H3K4me3 to the promoter regions of five lncRNA genes to further verify that the identified rat lncRNAs were likely encoded by transcriptionally active genes rather than detection artifacts. Binding of H3K4me3 around the transcriptional start sites is a characteristic of genes that are transcriptionally active or poised for activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. As expected, immunoprecipitation using an H3K4me3 antibody, compared to a control antibody, resulted in substantial enrichment of the promoter region of the actively transcribed GAPDH gene in all five tissues analyzed, but no enrichment of an exon of the myoglobin gene which was used as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>The expression of each of the 5 lncRNAs we chose to analyze was enriched in one of the tissues examined (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). The H3K4me3 binding to the promoter of the selected lncRNA gene was compared between the tissue in which it was enriched and one tissue where it was not enriched. The other tissues in which the lncRNA was not enriched were not analyzed because of the limited amount of immunoprecipitated DNA. For 4 of the 5 lncRNA genes examined, H3K4me3 binding was substantially increased in the tissue in which the lncRNA expression was enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B to 3E</xref>). This was observed even when the expression abundance of an lncRNA was modest such as the selected lncRNAs enriched in the renal cortex and the renal outer medulla (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Increased H3K4me3 binding was not observed for the lncRNA enriched in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>). It is known that H3K4me3 binding occurs in many, but not all, transcriptionally active promoters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. These data support that the identified rat lncRNAs were likely real transcripts.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Expression of rat lncRNAs appeared more tissue-specific than mRNA</title><p>The expression profiles of lncRNAs were distinct between the six tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). The two biological replicates of each tissue were correctly clustered based on the lncRNA expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>).

The proportion of identified lncRNAs that were expressed in 4 or fewer of the 6 tissues analyzed was larger than that of mRNA. The numbers of lncRNAs expressed in one or more of the 6 tissues examined were summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>.

In sharp contrast, mRNAs detected in these rat tissues contained a median of 9 exons (p = 0). Rat lncRNAs had a median length of 2,154 nucleotides, which was 29% shorter than the median length of rat mRNA (p = 4.8e-16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>The overall abundance of lncRNAs was compared to that of mRNAs by examining cumulative (sum of the 6 tissues), maximum or median abundance across the 6 tissues as well as abundance in each tissue. For all parameters examined, mRNAs were more abundant than lncRNAs by somewhere between 1.4 and 4 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>A significant fraction of Rat lncRNAs was not poly-adenylated</title><p>We compared renal outer medullary lncRNAs identified using poly(A)-independent RNA-seq in the current study to those identified in a previous study that used poly(A)-dependent RNA-seq<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. lncRNAs identified as being enriched in the renal outer medulla in the current study were expressed at higher levels in the previous study compared to lncRNAs enriched in the renal cortex, supporting consistency between the two studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Of the 1,812 lncRNAs identified in the current study, only approximately 1,300 were identified in the previous study, indicating that approximately a quarter of lncRNAs in rat renal outer medulla were not poly-adenylated. This cannot be explained by differences in sequencing depth. The sequencing depth of the previous study was greater than the current study, which would increase, not decrease, the chance of detecting transcripts. It cannot be explained by different degrees of transcript fragmentation, either. The average or median number of exons per transcript was similar between the two studies. However, we cannot rule out possible roles of stranded vs. non-stranded RNA-seq or differences in rat strains in contributing to the different numbers of lncRNAs identified in the two studies.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Effects of substituting a segment of chromosome 13 and a high-salt diet on lncRNA expression in SS rats</title><p>The Dahl salt-sensitive SS rat is a widely used model of human salt-sensitive forms of hypertension and renal injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.

In addition, 6 and 232 sequence variants were identified in the gene bodies of TCONS_00028980 and TCONS_00029009, respectively. These data suggest genetic differences between the BN and SS alleles might contribute to the differential expression of these two lncRNAs between SS and SS.13<sup>BN26</sup> rats.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study provided a systematic characterization of lncRNAs in rat and identified several lncRNAs that might be involved in hypertension. These findings provide a new foundation for lncRNA research in hypertension and other diseases that utilize rat models.</p><p>Previous studies have reported catalogs of lncRNAs in the liver of Brown Norway rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, the pineal gland and the colon of Sprague-Dawley rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, and several whole organs in Fischer 344 rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Unique features of the current study compared to some or all of the previous studies included analysis of several specific tissue regions in Brown Norway rats, use of poly(A)-independent and strand-specific RNA-seq, de novo identification of lncRNAs, and, importantly, systematic examination of genome-wide characteristics of rat lncRNAs.</p><p>Some of the characteristics of rat lncRNAs appear different than lncRNAs in other species, while some characteristics are in common with other species. The number of rat lncRNAs we identified is similar to those identified in mice using methods close to ours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The smaller number of exons and the higher degree of tissue specificity we observed in rat lncRNAs compared to mRNA have also been observed in other species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Median abundance of lncRNAs has been reported to be as low as a tenth of mRNA and lncRNA genes are generally shorter than protein-coding genes in other species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Our results indicate that median cumulative (sum of the 6 tissues) abundance of rat lncRNAs is about one half of that of mRNA and the median transcript length of rat lncRNAs is only 29% shorter than mRNA despite a much smaller number of exons.</p><p>lncRNAs remain nearly completely unexplored in hypertension research. However, emerging evidence indicates lncRNAs may have functional significance in the development, physiology or diseases of the heart and the vasculature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Angiotensin II, a potent regulator of arterial blood pressure, has been reported to alter the expression of several lncRNAs in rat vascular smooth muscle cells, including an lncRNA that hosts two microRNAs implicated in cell proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The role of lncRNAs in the physiology and non-tumor diseases of the kidney, an organ critical for long-term control of arterial blood pressure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, is not known. Several lncRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in kidneys of mouse models of obstructive nephropathy and glomerulonephritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.</p><p>We found approximately 4% of all lncRNAs detectable in the renal outer medulla were differentially expressed between SS and SS.13<sup>BN26</sup> rats on a high-salt diet. This percentage is similar to the percentage of mRNAs that were found differentially expressed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. No lncRNA reached an FDR of less than 0.05 when compared between the two strains on the 0.4% NaCl diet. The number of mRNAs that were differentially expressed on the 0.4% NaCl was also much smaller than on the high-salt diet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>, lncRNAs that did not reach the FDR cutoff based on RNA-seq could in fact be differentially expressed based on real-time PCR.</p><p>The two lncRNAs that we identified as differentially expressed between SS and SS.13<sup>BN26</sup> rats and located in the congenic region may be controlled by sequence differences in the regulatory regions of the genes between the SS and Brown Norway alleles. It would be valuable to investigate whether and how these or other lncRNAs functionally contribute to the development of salt-sensitive hypertension.</p><p>Several lncRNAs have been found to serve as scaffolds that bring together chromatin modification complexes at select genome locations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. lncRNA-mediated assembly of chromatin modification complexes can occur locally in a cis acting manner just as lncRNAs are transcribed. Alternatively, lncRNAs can regulate the assembly of chromatin modification complex in a trans acting manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The result would be changes in DNA methylation, histone modification, or other chromatin characteristics at specific genomic locations, leading to changes in the expression of genes encoded by those genomic segments. We recently identified differential methylation in several hundred specific CpG islands in the renal outer medulla of SS and SS.13<sup>BN26</sup> rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Several of the differentially methylated regions were located in the transcriptional start site or intergenic regions of differentially expressed protein-coding genes. DNA methylation or demethylation enzymes per se do not have the capacity to select specific sites of the genome for modification. It would be important to determine if lncRNAs contribute to the observed site-specific differential methylation in SS rats.</p><p>Epigenomic modifications and transcriptional regulation in general likely play an important role in the development and inheritance of hypertension<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Understanding of rat lncRNAs opens a novel venue for studying the role of transcriptional and other molecular control mechanisms in the development of hypertension and other diseases in rat models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d33e25" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Supplementary information</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep07146-s1.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d33e31" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Supplementary Dataset 1</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep07146-s2.xls"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by US National Institutes of Health grants HL111580 (ML), HL121233 (ML), HL082798 (AWC, ML), and Advancing a Healthier Wisconsin Fund FP1701 and FP1703 (PL).</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="b1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name>

Classification of lncRNAs identified in at least one of the six tissues obtained from Brown Norway rats. lncRNAs were classified as antisense, intronic complete overlap (concs), intronic contained (incs), intronic partial overlap (poncs), and intergenic based on the spatial relationship between the genomic sequences encoding lncRNAs and protein-coding genes. B. Schematic illustration of the classification of lncRNA genes based on their spatial relationship with protein-coding genes.

Promoter regions for lncRNAs with higher transcript abundance in the liver (B), cardiac left ventricle (C), renal cortex (D), or renal outer medulla (E) were enriched in chromatin fragments immunoprecipitated from the respective tissue using an antibody for histone H3K4me3.
