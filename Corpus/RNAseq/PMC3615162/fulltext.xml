Recently, complete cardiac regeneration has been demonstrated in fish and newborn mice following resection of the cardiac apex. However, it remained entirely unclear whether the mammalian heart can also completely regenerate following a complex cardiac ischemic injury. We established a protocol to induce a severe heart attack in one-day-old mice using left anterior descending artery (LAD) ligation. LAD ligation triggered substantial cardiac injury in the left ventricle defined by Caspase 3 activation and massive cell death. Ischemia-induced cardiomyocyte death was also visible on day 4 after LAD ligation. Remarkably, 7 days after the initial ischemic insult, we observed complete cardiac regeneration without any signs of tissue damage or scarring. This tissue regeneration translated into long-term normal heart functions as assessed by echocardiography. In contrast, LAD ligations in 7-day-old mice resulted in extensive scarring comparable to adult mice, indicating that the regenerative capacity for complete cardiac healing after heart attacks can be traced to the first week after birth. RNAseq analyses of hearts on day 1, day 3, and day 10 and comparing LAD-ligated and sham-operated mice surprisingly revealed a transcriptional programme of major changes in genes mediating mitosis and cell division between days 1, 3 and 10 postnatally and a very limited set of genes, including genes regulating cell cycle and extracellular matrix synthesis, being differentially regulated in the regenerating hearts. We present for the first time a mammalian model of complete cardiac regeneration following a severe ischemic cardiac injury. This novel model system provides the unique opportunity to uncover molecular and cellular pathways that can induce cardiac regeneration after ischemic injury, findings that one day could be translated to human heart attack patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Heart regeneration</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>heart disease</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death in North America and Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] killing more than 860,000 people annually in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].

Thus, one key transcriptome signature of the postnatal heart is a massive change in the mitotic machinery, correlating very closely with shutting down of cell cycle.</p><p>We next compared the cardiac transcriptome of non-manipulated, LAD-ligated, and sham-operated mice in 10 day-old mice (P10). Of note LAD ligation or sham-operations were performed at P1, i.e., we analyzed a time-point where we already observed complete regeneration of the damaged cardiac tissue. Intriguingly, whereas there were large differences in the transcriptomes as compared to non-manipulated mice, remarkably we detected only a very small number of differentially expressed genes (294 genes) at P10 comparing LAD-ligated and sham-operated mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 1D-F</xref>).

Thus, as compared to sham-operations, the regenerated LAD-ligated hearts show remarkably few transcriptional changes, but still carry a gene expression signature indicating that the cell cycle machinery has not been entirely switched off yet in the repaired cardiac tissue.</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Differentially expressed genes between sham-operated and LAD-ligated mice left ventricles</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes in the left ventricle of non-manipulated, LAD-ligated and sham-operated mice, all from P10.

First attempts to use bone marrow derived-progenitor cells have proven inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] and recently new avenues have been taken to identify novel cardiac progenitor populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] or to activate, for instance, epicardial progenitors for heart regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Moreover, it has been recently reported that fibroblasts in the damaged myocardium can be reprogrammed into cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] and regeneration can be initiated by pre-existing cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. However, in most cases regeneration has proven to be limited in terms of the repaired areas and in terms of restoration of heart functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].</p><p>The discovery that fish can regenerate the heart following resection of the tip of the heart was a revelation because it introduced the concepts that complete heart regeneration might be possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. That cardiac regeneration following apex resection is also possible in newborn mouse heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] further supported this notion. Our data now show that newborn mice have also the capacity to completely repair, within 7 days, a complex injury following a severe cardiac ischemic insult. Lineage tracing suggests that, at least in part, such regeneration is mediated via cell cycle entry of pre-existing cardiomyocytes. Based on our gene expression data it appears that neonatal cardiomyocytes maintain the capacity to proliferate whereas this capacity is lost around 7 days after birth. Whether this loss correlates and is possibly regulated via binucleation of cardiomyocytes, which in mouse occurs within the first week after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], needs to be determined.</p><p>Intriguingly, although we showed that expression of thousands of genes comparing the neonatal heart to cardiac tissue on postpartum days 3 and 10, we found only about 290 differentially expressed genes between sham-operated and LAD ligated hearts assessed on P10. As defined by reactome analyses, most of these differentially expressed genes have been annotated to cell cycle progression, mitosis, or DNA replication. Thus, clearly one of the key mechanisms that permit regeneration vs scarring is the differential regulation of cell cycle genes in the newborn heart. The observation of only a small number of differentially expressed genes between LAD-ligated and sham-operated mice is consistent with the near complete functional recovery of cardiac function in LAD-ligated mice. The finding of differentially expressed genes on the pathway for extracellular matrix and collagen synthesis between LAD-ligated and sham-operated mice is likely indicative of residual healing of the myocardium post-infarction. The control of cell cycle progression in cardiomyocytes is of particular interest not only for cardiac regeneration but also for the fact, that - to our knowledge - not a single cardiomyocyte-derived tumor has ever been reported in the literature. We of course cannot exclude differences in the newborn versus day 7 old mice in cardiac stem cells, inflammatory responses to the tissue damage, or changes in the fibrotic response as also playing a part in the alteration in mitotic potential of the myocardium between postpartum day 1 and day 7.</p><p>In conclusion, our model system reveals that complete repair of a myocardial infarction is possible in the newborn mouse. Whether this extends to other mammalian species needs to be tested. Importantly, our model might allow to possibly unlock fundamental mechanisms of regeneration that could be used in the future to also repair adult hearts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Ligation of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) in neonates</title><p>P0.5, P1.0, P1.5 neonatal and one week old (P7.5) C57BL6J mice were used for the LAD ligation model. First, neonates were briefly sedated by putting the newborns into an isoflurane induction chamber followed by an approximately 4 min long cooling period in ice water. Hypothermia induces a reversible cardiac arrest in pre-weanling rodents and thereby allows for controlled thoracic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Next the experimental animals were taped to a cooling bag in the right lateral position to ensure continued hypothermic anesthesia during the surgical procedure. The skin was cut just a few millimeters below the left foreleg. Next, the Pectorals major et minor muscles were dissected and the thorax opened in the 4<sup>th</sup> intercostal space. Ligation of the left anterior descending artery was performed with a 10-0 ethilon suture (Ethicon). The musculosceletal thorax and the skin were closed with a 8-0 vicryl suture (Ethicon). Finally, mice were put onto a 38<sup>o</sup> Celsius heated pad. After confirmation of spontaneous breathing the mice received a dose of subcutaneous buprenorphine (0.05mg/kg). Survival rates in our protocol were above 90% of sham-operated and above 90% of LAD-ligated mice. All animal experiments were approved by the Austrian Ethical Board.</p></sec><sec id="s4_2"><title>Histology</title><p>The hearts were harvested at defined time points, washed in PBS and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at room temperature. Next, the PFA was exchanged with 70% Ethanol and the samples embedded in paraffin and cut at 2.5&#x003bc;m. Paraffin sections were rehydrated and then either stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) or further processed for immunohistochemical stainings.</p></sec><sec id="s4_3"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>2.5&#x003bc;m paraffin sections were rehydrated followed by antigen retrieval in boiling citrate buffer for 20 min. Samples were then stained overnight at 4<sup>o</sup> Celsius with antibodies against phospho-Histone 3 (Ser10, #04-1093, Millipore), TroponinT (#MS-295, Thermo Scientific), BrdU (#ab6326, Abcam), cleaved Caspase 3 (#9661, Cell Signaling), and Ki67 (#PA0118, Novocastra). Goat anti-mouse Alexa 555 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 were used as secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 hr. Samples were counterstained with DAPI for 15 min and mounted in DAKO. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was detected on cryosections; hearts were first fixed in 4% PFA overnight and then washed in PBS once. Next, the fixed hearts were stored in 30% sucrose/PBS at 4<sup>o</sup> Celsius overnight and then embedded in OCT. 10&#x003bc;m sections were cut from the cryo-preserved tissue blocks and stained with an antibody against GFP that crossreacts with YFP (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec id="s4_4"><title>Lineage tracing</title><p>Homozygous female YFP reporter mice (Rosa26-loxP STOP loxP-YFP) were crossed with male Myh6-MerCreMer mice. Pregnant females were injected Tamoxifen (Sigma, 20mg/kg dissolved in peanut oil) intraperitoneally on day E19.5. Newborn mice were immediately transferred to a foster mother and the LAD ligation procedure was performed on P1.5. After 7 days of permanent LAD ligation, hearts were harvested on P8.5 and stained for YFP as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4_5"><title>5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling</title><p>LAD ligation was performed on P0.5.

The integrity and quantity of RNA was determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). 4&#x003bc;g of total RNA was used to generate RNA-seq libraries using TruSeq RNA sample preparation kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, RNA was purified and fragmented using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads using two rounds of purification followed by the first and second cDNA strand synthesis. Next, cDNA 3' ends were adenylated and adapters ligated followed by 10 cycles of library amplification. Finally, the libraries were size selected using AMPue XP Beads (Becmkan Coulter) purified and their quality was checked using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Libraries were run on a single lane per sample of the HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina) to generate 100bp paired-end reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4_8"><title>RT-qPCR</title><p>Six differentially expressed genes between the pairwise comparisons were selected for validation by RT-qPCR: <italic>Col12a1</italic>, <italic>Ddc</italic>, <italic>Hmgcs2</italic>, <italic>Spp1</italic>,<italic>Zbed6</italic> and <italic>Zbtb20</italic> and for one housekeeping gene, <italic>Actb</italic>. cDNA was synthesized using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad) using manufacturers instruction.

Gene based read counts were then obtained using HTSeq count module (version 0.5.3p9). Differential expression analysis was performed on the counts data using DESeq Bioconductor package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. The analysis was run with the default parameters. Independent filtering was done on the counts data prior to statistical testing to remove 40 % of the genes with lowest counts. The DESeq package uses a negative binomial model to test for differential expression. Raw p values were then adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Genes with adjusted p value of 0.05 or less were termed as differentially expressed genes. The analysis was performed using R 2.15. Comparisons were performed between non-manipulated P1, P3 and P10 mouse hearts. LAD-ligated mouse hearts were compared against sham-operated mice samples and also against non-manipulated P10 mouse hearts. Of note, from the 294 differentially expressed genes comparing LAD-ligated vs sham-operated hearts we removed Xist from the list in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Table 3</xref> because of current experiments performed to assess sex differences between the cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="s4_10"><title>Clustering analysis</title><p>After detecting differentially expressed genes in the heart, genes that changed in common between all three time points (P1, P3, P10 of non-manipulated mice) were then determined using sdef R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. The mean of the p values for the differentially expressed genes in the three comparisons was taken and the top 50 genes with lowest mean p value were clustered and visualized in a heatmap. Ensembl identifiers were mapped to gene symbols prior to produce the heatmap. Custom scripts were written to perform the clustering and visualization of the data.
