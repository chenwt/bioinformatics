Transcripts at only a few copies per cell are readily detectable, allowing the discovery of low abundance viral and bacterial transcripts in human tissue samples. Here we describe an approach for mining large sequence data sets for the presence of microbial sequences. Further, we demonstrate the sensitivity of this approach by sequencing human RNA-seq libraries spiked with decreasing amounts of an RNA-virus. At a modest depth of sequencing, viral transcripts can be detected at frequencies less than 1 in 1,000,000. With current sequencing platforms approaching outputs of one billion reads per run, this is a highly sensitive method for detecting putative infectious agents associated with human tissues.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infectious agents (IAs) are a common cause of acute and chronic human diseases. For example, it is estimated that approximately 20&#x00025; of all human cancers are caused by an infectious agent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019838-Pagano1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019838-Parkin1">[2]</xref>. Many infectious causes of human disease have likely remained undiscovered because of limitations of traditional, culture-based identification methods. Metagenomic sequencing has high sensitivity and offers the possibility of identifying new IAs, should they exist. Examples of conditions with potential associations to IAs include autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease and malignancies such as oropharangeal cancer, colorectal cancer and childhood leukaemia/lymphomas.</p><p>Previous studies have focused on a targeted approach using RT-PCR or conventional detection methods to confirm disease associations with known IAs. The expansion in sequencing capacity enabled by massively parallel sequencing platforms allows for the first time complete and unbiased surveys of the human genome, transcriptome and microbiome. Several recent studies have demonstrated the utility of this approach for detecting IAs; examples include the discovery of a novel polyomavirus in Merkel Cell carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019838-Feng1">[3]</xref>, and identification of a previously unknown arenavirus associated with the deaths of three human organ transplant recipients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019838-Palacios1">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Although many investigators are using metagenomic sequencing for the purpose of detecting novel IAs, a rigorous empirical study of IA detection level in human tissues is missing. This kind of experiment is necessary to determine sequencing depth and to establish precisely the amount of IA expression that can be reliably detected. Such an experiment also provides a proof of principle for the methodology, by illustrating that known IAs can be detected if present at a certain level of abundance. This information will be useful for any group attempting IA detection using sequence data generated on a massively parallel platform. The data presented here establishes a detection limit using RNA sequencing data from a human colorectal tumour biopsy tissue spiked with viral RNA.</p><p>We have implemented a bioinformatics strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0019838-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) for the detection of putative pathogen sequences from large data sets of short sequence reads, such as those generated by the Illumina GAIIx and HiSeq. Mate-pair sequences are aligned sequentially against non repeat-masked, same-species rRNA, cDNA and genome reference sequences, and any reads aligning above user-defined thresholds are subtracted. The reads that remain unaligned to any of the host species sequences are then used to interrogate a collection of all known bacterial and viral genome sequences. The identity of microorganisms in the original tissue specimen is then inferred from sequence matches. Although in principle either genome or transcriptome sequence can be interrogated, we prefer to analyze transcriptomes by this approach. Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (WTSS or RNAseq) provides in depth sampling at reduced cost. A comprehensive transcriptome analysis can be performed with approximately 1/10<sup>th</sup> the number of bases (10 Gb) vs. the 100 Gb required for whole genome sequencing. Transcripts at only a few copies per cell are readily detectable, allowing the discovery of even low abundance viral and bacterial transcripts. Transcriptome analysis also has the advantage of only reporting actively expressed transcripts rather than just the presence of a particular sequence. In the case of IA gene expression, this implies a much greater likelihood of disease involvement, especially if expression levels can be compared to corresponding normal tissue from the same individual.</p><fig id="pone-0019838-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0019838.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flow chart of subtraction methodology.</title><p>Paired end reads from a human sequence library are first filtered to remove low quality reads; &#x0003c;Q20 average, reads with low complexity (&#x0003e;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;20 nt homopolymers), and reads comprised of artifactual adapter or primer sequences.

In order to determine sensitivity experimentally, a known IA was required as a template. RNA isolated from a single stranded RNA virus was chosen to enable testing of the entire procedure, including cDNA synthesis and sequence library construction. A non-human virus was selected to ensure all detected reads would be derived from the spiked material and not from native expression. The virus chosen was Heterosigma akashiwo RNA virus (HaRNAV), which infects the toxic bloom-forming unicellular alga, <italic>Heterosigma akashiwo</italic> (<italic>Raphidophyceae</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019838-Tai1">[5]</xref>. This positive-sense single stranded RNA virus (Picornavirales) has a fully sequenced 8.6 kbp genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0019838-Lang1">[6]</xref> (GenBank: AY337486.1) and as such was a part of our in-house infectious agent database. HaRNAV has a GC content of 46&#x00025;.</p><p>HaRNAV RNA was quantified by Nanodrop&#x000ae; and added over 4 log dilutions to aliquots of total RNA extracted from a snap-frozen human biopsy sample (details in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref> section). Four libraries were prepared, each from 2 &#x000b5;g of total human RNA (RNA integrity number 9.1), to which 0.2 ng, 20 pg, 2 pg and 0.2 pg, respectively, of viral RNA was added. The viral samples were prepared as 10-fold serial dilutions and HaRNAV would be expected to be recovered 1 in 10,000, 1 in 100,000, 1 in 1 million and 1 in 10 million reads, respectively. DNA from a marine cyanophage (SPWM3) was added at the opposite ratios as HaRNAV to the cDNA preparation, also over 4 log dilutions. This spike in at the cDNA level served as a detection control for the steps following cDNA generation and was included as a comparator to the RNA spike in. 100 &#x000b5;l of a 10 pM concentration of each of the resulting libraries were run on an Illumina GAIIx sequencer. The resulting data from each library were of high and equivalent quality, with the percentage of bases &#x0003e;Q30 ranging from 87.1&#x00025; to 88.8&#x00025; and a post purity filtered rate of 80&#x00025; to 84&#x00025;, number of reads are noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019838-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019838-t002">2</xref>.

This in-house database, which we call IAdb is frequently updated to remain current. The version of IAdb used for this manuscript was composed of 27,699 sequences totaling 3.9 Gbp, including 23,163 sequences from 1,016 bacterial genomes. (<ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria</ext-link>) and 3,536 (72.6 Mbp) viral refseq sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/release/viral">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/release/viral</ext-link>).&#x000a0;It is publicly available for download at <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.bcgsc.ca/supplementary/IADB/">ftp://ftp.bcgsc.ca/supplementary/IADB/</ext-link>. For alignments to the IAdb, Novoalign (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.novocraft.com/">http://www.novocraft.com/</ext-link>) was used (version 2.05.20 [-o SAM -r A -R 0, default options] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.novocraft.com/">http://www.novocraft.com/</ext-link>) which reports all locations and genomes mapped equally well by a given read pair. Novoalign is a more permissive but slower short read aligner than bwa that takes into account quality scores. These features make it more suitable than bwa for identifying metagenomic sequences, which may have limited similarity to the reference sequences in IAdb. Counts of read pairs matching each Genbank accession in our IAdb were obtained. However, for the purpose of this study, we only tallied read pairs that mapped unambiguously, that is, where both members of the mate pair matched the same accession and with the correct pairing distance and orientation.</p><p>In our overall approach sequential subtraction of host sequences serves two purposes 1) it speeds up the final alignment to IAdb, by weeding out decreasing number of pairs aligned against increasingly larger sequence databases and 2) it helps remove the background noise. For the present study alignments were run on a single 3 GHz 8 CPU Intel(R) Xeon(R) 64-bit 61 GB RAM computer running CentOS release 5.4.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019838-t001">Table 1</xref> demonstrates detection of the spiked HaRNAV genetic material using the blinded data. For library 1, which contained the highest concentration of viral RNA, HaRNAV was one of the most highly expressed agents, and was still in the top 100 for pair abundance in subsequent libraries 2 and 3. As these 4 libraries were technical replicates made from the same total RNA preparation all other IA levels were similar across all libraries. This simplified the detection of the spiked sample especially at the lower limit. Reads were normalized to the library with the fewest number of reads after the removal of those reads that aligned to rRNA (library 1). A summary of the observed and expected numbers of reads is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019838-t002">table 2</xref>.</p><p>These data illustrate robust recovery of both the HaRNAV RNA and the phage DNA in terms of positive hits with the expected pairs per million being proportional to those observed (Pearson correlation &#x0003e;0.99). However the number of RNA viral read pairs in each library was about 1/3 of that expected, based on the amount of material spiked into the library. This discrepancy may be due to the difficulty of accurate quantification of ssRNA viruses coupled with a preferential capture of smaller RNA products in the library preparation. We have demonstrated with the phage spike in that recovery was close to expected after the cDNA stage again indicating that the bias was at an early stage of library preparation.

The simulation tested the effect of read lengths of 36, 50, 76 and 100 nt and error rates by simulating HaRNAV and herpesvirus genomes having up to 5&#x00025; simulated error.</p><p>We observe that mapping is minimally impacted by errors, consistent with the permissive limit on the mapping accuracy of Novoalign, the aligner used to search IAdb (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019838-t003">Table 3</xref>). Because errors were simulated at random on viral entries, they are not evenly distributed and the longer the read, the higher the chance of incurring more than the allowed number of mismatched bases during alignment. Thus, for an aligner such as Novoalign that uses a threshold of a fixed number of mismatches, rather than accept an error frequency, longer reads may actually impair the detection of non-identical, but highly related species. However, Novoalign's permissive nature is of utility here, in that it allows mapping of reads with lower stringency than bwa, which enables the identification of putative IA agents that are not identical to known genomes. Until public sequence repositories become many orders of magnitude more comprehensive and allow accurate species identification, using a permissive aligner in conjunction with 75&#x02013;100 nt read pairs is a just proposition for IA detection</p><p>The mapping accuracy of bwa (&#x0003c;3&#x00025;) could be limiting in identifying retroviruses whose identity is close to that of human endogenous retroviral (HERV) sequences, for instance, but unrestrictive if sequences are sufficiently (&#x0003e;3&#x00025;) divergent. To test this hypothesis, we challenged the IA detection pipeline in identifying and subtracting HERV-derived read pairs while detecting HERV-like viruses-derived pairs. HERVs are remnants of ancient retroviral genomes integrated in human germline DNA, some of which are transcribed. A HERV-K sequence (DQ821442.1) encoding a reverse transcriptase (<italic>pol)</italic> and its closest known viral genome homologue (FJ979639.1) deposited in the Genbank NT database, a region of the Simian retrovirus 4 (SRV4) strain having 60&#x00025; sequence identity with HERV-K, were chosen for the simulation. When reads were simulated with no errors, none of the HERV-K pairs passed the pipeline beyond human transcriptome alignments and all the SRV4 were recovered. When we applied a 5&#x00025; simulated mutation rate to both sequences and simulated 76 nt paired reads, we observe that in average 76&#x0002b;/&#x02212;35.4 read pairs escaped the transcriptome filtration for HERV-K when testing 1000 pairs, due to corresponding read pairs that accrued more than bwa's maximum allowable limit of 3&#x00025; errors. The number of unfiltered pairs is low despite a substantial (5&#x00025;) mismatch rate, because when at least one read within a pair still maps to a human sequence target with more than 97&#x00025; accuracy the pair is removed. This is in fact the case for 92.4&#x00025; of pairs simulated from an HERV-K sequence having 5&#x00025; randomly distributed errors. In contrast, none of the SRV4 faux pairs are subtracted, since the sequence is sufficiently divergent from human sequences, including HERVs. The pipeline is thus conservative in that it is designed to stringently remove as much of the host &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d; as possible before the final, more permissive mapping to viral/bacterial genomes.</p><p>To address the issue of detecting unknown agents, we have ran the IA detection pipeline on simulated HaRNAV and herpesvirus read pairs, as described above, but using a modified IAdb depleted of the HaRNAV (NC_005281.1) and herpesvirus 4 (NC_009334.1) genome sequence entries, respectively. Whereas we do not detect any HaRNAV reads in the former experiment because of lack of similar entries in IAdb, we detect herpesvirus pairs, due to the overrepresentation of highly similar herpesvirus species in public sequence data repositories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019838-t004">Table 4</xref>). This highlights that success in identifying a putative IA with this set of tools is dependent on how wide-ranging the sequence database is. Different approaches could be designed to help make sense of reads unmapped from IAdb, reads with the potential to characterize poorly annotated agents not represented in the highly curated IAdb. For example, unmapped pairs could be assembled <italic>de novo</italic> and the resulting contigs aligned onto a more comprehensive, but fragmented, sequence database such as Genbank NT.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0019838-t004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0019838.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Effect of IAdb entry removal on viral sequence detection.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0019838-t004-4" xlink:href="pone.0019838.t004"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td colspan="3" align="left" rowspan="1">Conditions</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HaRNAV</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Herpesvirus 4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Read Length (nt)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Error on genome</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of simulated pairs tested</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean #pairs detected<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt103">&#x0002a;</xref> &#x0002b;&#x02212; std.dev.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean #pairs detected &#x0002b;&#x02212; std.dev.</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">76</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3&#x00025;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0&#x0002b;&#x02212;0.0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.0&#x0002b;&#x02212;0.0&#x0002a;&#x0002a;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0&#x0002b;&#x02212;0.0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.7&#x0002b;&#x02212;1.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0&#x0002b;&#x02212;0.0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">90.3&#x0002b;&#x02212;5.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1000</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0&#x0002b;&#x02212;0.0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">978.3&#x0002b;&#x02212;3.5</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt103"><label/><p>&#x0002a;Upon depletion of HaRNAV and Herpesvirus 4, respectively and listing pairs that hit other entries. &#x0002a;&#x0002a; Pairs map unambiguously to AY961628.3, Human herpesvirus 4 strain GD1 and/or NC_007605.1, Human herpesvirus 4 type 1.
