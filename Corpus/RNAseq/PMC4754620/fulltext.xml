To study hypoxia-related processes and regulatory mechanisms, apple (<italic>Malus domestica</italic>, cv Granny Smith) fruit, harvested at commercial ripening, were kept at 1&#x000b0;C under normoxic (control) and hypoxic (0.4 and 0.8 kPa oxygen) conditions for up to 60 days. NMR analyses of cortex tissue identified eight metabolites showing significantly different accumulations between samples, with ethanol and alanine displaying the most pronounced difference between hypoxic and normoxic treatments. A rapid up-regulation of <italic>alcohol dehydrogenase</italic> and pyruvate-related metabolism (<italic>lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate decarboxylase, alanine aminotransferase</italic>) gene expression was detected under both hypoxic conditions with a more pronounced effect induced by the lowest (0.4 kPa) oxygen concentration. Both hypoxic conditions negatively affected <italic>ACC synthase</italic> and <italic>ACC oxidase</italic> transcript accumulation. Analysis of RNA-seq data of samples collected after 24 days of hypoxic treatment identified more than 1000 genes differentially expressed when comparing 0.4 vs. 0.8 kPa oxygen concentration samples. Genes involved in cell-wall, minor and major CHO, amino acid and secondary metabolisms, fermentation and glycolysis as well as genes involved in transport, defense responses, and oxidation-reduction appeared to be selectively affected by treatments. The lowest oxygen concentration induced a higher expression of transcription factors belonging to AUX/IAA, WRKY, HB, Zinc-finger families, while MADS box family genes were more expressed when apples were kept under 0.8 kPa oxygen. Out of the eight group VII ERF members present in apple genome, two genes showed a rapid up-regulation under hypoxia, and western blot analysis showed that apple MdRAP2.12 proteins were differentially accumulated in normoxic and hypoxic samples, with the highest level reached under 0.4 kPa oxygen. These data suggest that ripe apple tissues finely and specifically modulate sensing and regulatory mechanisms in response to different hypoxic stress conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>ethylene-responsive factors</kwd><kwd>low oxygen stress</kwd><kwd><italic>Malus domestica</italic></kwd><kwd>metabolic profiling</kwd><kwd>postharvest</kwd><kwd>pyruvate metabolism</kwd><kwd>storage</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="75"/><page-count count="18"/><word-count count="13692"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypoxic (reduced oxygen level) or anoxic (complete absence of oxygen) conditions can occur in natural environments when the root system is flooded (waterlogging) or the whole plant is overwhelmed by water (submergence). A wealth of information is available on metabolic (in particular energy metabolism) responses, oxygen signaling mechanisms, and the transcriptional regulation occurring under low oxygen stress concerning the vegetative tissues of model species such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice (van Dongen and Licausi, <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>A common response among plant species to low oxygen availability is the activation of the fermentative pathways to sustain glycolysis in the absence of mitochondrial respiration, which results in the production of lactate or ethanol. The accumulation of alanine, &#x003b3;-aminobutirate (GABA), and succinate and a decrease in the amount of aspartate appear to be other common responses (Narsai et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Transcription factors (TFs) such as zinc-finger, ethylene responsive factors (ERFs), and LOB domain proteins have also been identified as highly induced by hypoxia in various species (Mustroph et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, transcriptional adjustments to oxygen depletion are triggered by the ERF family group VII, which may act as an oxygen sensor in plants through the N-end rule pathway (NERP) for protein degradation (Gibbs et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Licausi et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>; Licausi, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Apart from the common responses, which have been identified as conserved throughout the plant kingdom but also in different plant tissues and cell types (Mustroph et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), a large array of tissue and cell type specific hypoxic responses have been identified (Mustroph et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Intrinsic differences in metabolism between organs have also been detected (Ellis et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), and the severity of oxygen shortage can induce varying responses. An analysis of large sets of global expression data highlighted significant differences in the oxidative stress components in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> under anoxia and hypoxia (Pucciariello et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>A reduction in oxygen levels (together with an increase in carbon dioxide and a decrease in temperature) is deliberately applied to extend the storage life of fruit in systems called controlled atmosphere (CA; Yahia, <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). This technology leads to a reduction in respiration, as well as ethylene biosynthesis and action, and subsequently to a better maintenance of commercial quality parameters. Pome fruit (apples and European pears) can be successfully stored for several months, for up to 1 year for specific apple varieties under CA conditions where oxygen is generally maintained at concentrations ranging from 2-3 to 1 kPa. In recently introduced advanced CA protocols, oxygen levels are set at concentrations as low as 0.4 kPa (Dynamic CA, DCA). Under DCA apples better maintain technological quality parameters, namely flesh firmness and acidity, the most important drivers of consumer preference for apples, with a reduction in the incidence of cold storage disorders such as superficial scald (Tonutti, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, in DCA protocols the reduction in oxygen reaches the lowest level tolerated by the fruit, the so-called anaerobic compensation point, with a high risk of severe quality losses due to the onset of internal physiological disorders and the development of off-flavors. Thus, an evaluation of the metabolic conditions of the fruit is crucial in order to quickly adjust the oxygen concentration up to a &#x0201c;safe&#x0201d; level of around 1 kPa, which is above the anaerobic compensation point.</p><p>Despite the commercial applications of CA, the precise mode of action of low oxygen in fruit is scarcely understood. Works based on metabolomics (Pedreschi et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2009a</xref>; Vandendriessche et al., <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Hatoum et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), proteomics (Pedreschi et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2009b</xref>), and transcriptomics (Mellidou et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) have provided important information on the processes and metabolites associated with the development of common physiological disorders in apples and pears (internal browning, core breakdown) during traditional CA storage. These studies reported data on the effects of long-term storage (in general after 4&#x02013;8 months) at oxygen concentrations ranging from 1 to 3 kPa. Knowledge of the molecular and metabolic responses occurring under extremely low (&#x0003c;1 kPa) oxygen concentrations such as those used in DCA protocols, in particular at the initial stages of the storage period, is very limited. To our knowledge, no information currently exists on the regulatory mechanisms involved in the responses of fruit to hypoxic conditions.</p><p>In this work we report data on the application of an integrated approach on apples kept under two levels of low oxygen concentrations throughout the initial 2 months of storage, when, in general, a strict control of the effects of the extremely low oxygen concentration is required for a successful DCA performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and treatments</title><p>Apple (<italic>Malus domestica</italic> Borkh., cv Granny Smith) fruit were harvested at commercial ripening stage (starch index of 7, based on a 1&#x02013;10 scale) in an orchard located at Andriano (Bolzano, Italy). Homogeneous fruits in terms of size and peel color were selected and immediately stored in three refrigerated (1&#x000b0;C) experimental chambers under normoxia. After 3 days of acclimation of fruit to low temperature (T0 sampling point), 0.4 (0.4ox), and 0.8 (0.8ox) kPa oxygen atmospheres (in nitrogen and 0.9&#x02013;1 kPa CO<sub>2</sub>) were applied in two different chambers, whereas control apple samples were kept under normoxic conditions (Nox). The temperature of the chambers was maintained at 1&#x000b0;C throughout the experimental period (60 days). On day 30, based on ethanol accumulation, (which reached the threshold value of about 75 mg/L of fruit juice in 0.4ox samples), the oxygen concentration in the 0.4 kPa chamber was increased to 0.8 kPa and maintained up to the end of the experimental period. Fruit samples were collected after 3, 10, 17, 24, 31 (1 day after the shift to 0.8 kPa in 0.4ox treatment), and 60 (end of experiment) DIA (days in atmospheres) from T0. The small experimental chambers were equipped with a device allowing fruit sampling without affecting the atmosphere composition.

Considering differences between the inner and the outer parts of the cortex that have been observed in terms of composition (pears, Pedreschi et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2009a</xref>) and oxygen concentration (apple, Mellidou et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), the samples collected included both parts.</p></sec><sec><title>NMR analysis</title><p>NMR analysis was performed on a total of 57 samples (T0+18 samples for each treatment). Three biological replicates, each with two technical replicates were analyzed for each sampling time. For each biological replicate 5 g of frozen pulp were thawed and homogenized. The juices obtained were immediately filtered through a 0.2 &#x003bc;m PTFE membrane filter and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Five hundred and forty microliters of surnatant were mixed with 60 &#x003bc;l of sodium phosphate buffer (0.2 M NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> in 100% <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O, 10 mM TSP, and 30 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>, pH 7.0). A total of 450 &#x003bc;l of the mixture was pipetted into 4.25 mm NMR tubes (Bruker BioSpin srl).</p><p>For the analysis of metabolite content, all resonances of interest were manually checked. Signals were assigned on template one-dimensional NMR profiles using matching routines of AMIX 7.3.2 (Bruker BioSpin) in combination with the BBIOREFCODE (Version 2-0-0; Bruker BioSpin) reference database and specific published literature (Vermathen et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Each identified signal (i.e., the corresponding peak in the NMR spectrum) was automatically integrated (i.e., the area under the curve was calculated, being directly proportional to the total concentration of the respective metabolite) using a homemade R-script. No calibration using reference standards was performed, thus, the exact concentration of each metabolite was not determined but only the relative intensity is reported.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and transcript analyses</title><p>Total RNA was extracted as described by Botton et al. (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). RNA quality and integrity were checked on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Reverse transcription and RT-qPCR analyses were conducted as described by Falchi et al. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Gene selective primers were constructed on putative 3&#x02032; untranslated regions (UTR), using multiple sequence alignments to select non conserved regions (CLUSTALX, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw/index.html">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw/index.html</ext-link>).

Specificity was confirmed by melting curve analysis. Data were processed with DataAssist Software version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Monza, Italy) and normalized to Md_8283:1:a (Botton et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) using the (Livak and Schmittgen, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) method.

The 24 DIA samples were chosen as they represent the latest samplings under the two different hypoxic conditions before the shift to 0.8 kPa oxygen of the 0.4ox samples. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was carried out on an Illumina HiSeq2000 in two lane single-read 50 bp. Downstream steps including the processing of fluorescent images into sequences, base-calling, and overall quality value calculations were performed using the Illumina data processing pipeline version 1.8.2.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA-seq data processing and analysis</title><p>Contaminants and low quality regions were removed from illumina reads using the tool ERNE (Del Fabbro et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Tophat2 (Kim et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) was used to align the reads onto the reference genome (Mdomestica_196_v1.0; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.org">www.phytozome.org</ext-link>) previously indexed with Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). To avoid ambiguous read mapping, TopHat2 was used enabling the option -M that removes reads with multiple mapping locations. The reference annotation for gene models was downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.org">www.phytozome.org</ext-link>. No attempt for <italic>de novo</italic> transcript reconstruction was carried out. Cuffdiff (Trapnell et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) was used to: determine the amount of reads mapping in different locations, normalize the counts as Reads Per Kilobase of exon per Million fragments mapped -RPKM- (Mortazavi et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), compare the expression between two different conditions, and assess the significance of changes (expressed as Log<sub>2</sub> fold ratios). For data visualization, MapMan (Usadel et al., <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) was used to place differential gene expression data in the context of the appropriate metabolic pathways. The appropriate mapping filewas retrieved from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mapman.gabipd.org/">http://mapman.gabipd.org/</ext-link>. A GO analysis was performed with the Bioconductor GOseq package correcting for gene length bias (Young et al., <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), using DE genes with |logFC|&#x0003e;1 and |qval|&#x0003c;0.001.

For each sample, a total of 10 &#x003bc;g of proteins was resolved in 8% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel followed by western blotting according to standard protocols. Rabbit polyclonal anti-MdERF antibodies were used, that had been raised against three MdRAP2.12 specific synthetic peptides (LTADYLWPDLKKPSS, VNDSSQDYYSALGFL, and GEQGSKTPEISSVL, displayed by Mdo006712 and Mdo006699; Licausi et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>) and affinity purified at Primm Srl laboratories (Milan, Italy).

Western blotting experiments were repeated with three different biological samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Random Forest was applied for both supervised (outcome labels are used) and unsupervised (outcome labels are not used, i.e., the systems is not trained to recognize different conditions) learning, using sum-normalized bins as input variables (Breiman, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Briefly, the algorithm fits many classification trees to a data set, and then combines the outcomes from all the trees. The algorithm begins with the selection of many (2000 in our setting) bootstrap samples from the original data. A tree is fitted to each bootstrap sample. Because many different trees are built on the same dataset, the RF algorithm allows to derive a similarity measure between all pairs of samples by counting the number of times two samples are placed in the same terminal node of a tree. The matrix that contains all the pairwise proximities between samples (proximity matrix) can be considered as a matrix of distances between points in an Euclidean space. By means of classical multidimensional scaling, the coordinate of the point can be calculated from proximities and the points (representing the samples) can be plotted to have an overview of the space distribution of the data. In the unsupervised case, this plot is extremely useful to enlighten the presence of natural partitions or cluster among the data. The scaling coordinate for the unsupervised analysis are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.

Alanine (doublet, detected at 1.48 ppm), asparagine (doublet, 2.94 ppm), aspartate (multiplet, 2.87 ppm), and ethanol (triplet, 1.18 ppm) contributed the most to the separation between normoxic and hypoxic samples. On the other hand, 0.8ox samples were only partially separated from the other two groups along Dimension 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>After manually checking the resonances of interest, 16 metabolites were identified, of which eight were differentially accumulated between one or both hypoxic samples and the control in terms of the whole set of samples from T0 to 60 Days In Atmosphere (DIA; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Ethanol and alanine significantly increased under both hypoxic conditions, with ethanol displaying a higher accumulation in 0.4ox than in 0.8ox (log<sub>2</sub> FC of 3.93 and 0.85 compared to Nox, respectively). Uridine showed a significantly lower accumulation in both hypoxic conditions (log<sub>2</sub> FC of &#x02212;1.03 and &#x02212;0.83 in 0.4ox and 0.8ox, respectively), whereas other compounds displayed different trends, such as threonine and GABA, which were significantly higher only in 0.4ox and 0.8ox samples, respectively. Asparagine and aspartate showed a &#x02212;0.44 fold change in 0.4ox samples, whereas for &#x003b1;-galactose a slight decrease was detected only in 0.8ox samples.

Consequently, in order to identify novel processes characterizing storage under different O<sub>2</sub> conditions, the apple cortex was transcriptionally profiled. Illumina RNAseq of the samples A (T0), B (0.4ox at 24DIA), and C (0.8ox at 24 DIA) generated more than 126 million short single-end reads, with each cDNA library containing more than six millions reads, of which more than 88% were mapped (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref>).

and Fe (II)-dependent oxygenase (FeKGO) genes were highly affected by hypoxic conditions. One FeKGO gene (<italic>MDP0000436890</italic>) showed the highest FC (5.76) expression when comparing B vs. C samples and other nine FeKGO genes showed a strong upregulation (FC &#x0003e; 3) in 0.4ox samples. This thus, indicates that there is an intrinsic connection between oxygen deprivation and oxygenases in apples. Other genes with a very high expression in 0.4ox samples compared to 0.8ox were those encoding cytochrome P450 (12 out of 13 identified as DE), and 18 (out of 20 identified as DE) MLP-like proteins putatively involved in RNA processing/ribonucleases, defense and biotic stimulus responses. As far as the hormone signaling and metabolism is concerned, several auxin-related genes were more expressed in 0.4ox compared to 0.8ox samples, such as a SAUR-like auxin-responsive and an auxin-responsive family protein, three genes involved in brassinosteroid metabolism, two GAST1 protein homologs and one cytokinin oxidase. However, four DEGs involved in ethylene signal transduction were identified as being more expressed in the 0.8ox sample, as well as one gene putatively involved in cytokinin signal transduction.</p><p>In the 0.8ox sample, the gene showing the highest FC compared to the 0.4ox sample was a dicarboxylate/malate carrier gene (<italic>MDP0000309741</italic>, FC = 5.55), which might be related to a more pronounced catabolism of malic acid. Considering genes involved in transport, seven tonoplast dicarboxylate transporter and three sulfate transporter genes had higher expression in the 0.8ox sample with FC &#x0003e; 2. As reported above, transmembrane transport and specific ion transport are among the GO terms overrepresented in apples kept at 0.8ox compared to 0.4ox samples. This might indicate that intracellular trafficking in the apple cortex is highly sensitive to slightly different hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, nitrate reductase was also found to be more expressed in the 0.8ox sample compared to 0.4ox.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription factors and signal transduction components underlying changes in responses to different low O<sub>2</sub> levels</title><p>Clearly, subtle changes in O<sub>2</sub> levels lead to a very large shift in transcriptome composition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). ERF TF abundance is important but only partially explains such changes since ERF-VIIs have not yet been reported to target such a large range of genes. To further highlight possible players in this relatively large transcriptomic change operating over a small O<sub>2</sub> difference, differentially regulated TFs were identified.</p><p>A total of 63 putative TFs were differentially expressed (qth &#x0003c; 0.001 and |fth|&#x0003e; 1) of which, 18 were more expressed in 0.8ox and 45 more expressed in the 0.4ox sample (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">S7</xref>). In the 0.8ox sample, the TF showing the highest FC (4) was a member of the MADS box family (<italic>MDP0000212925, AGAMOUS80</italic>), whereas in the 0.4ox sample an AUX/IAA transcriptional regulator family protein (<italic>MDP0000223496</italic>) showed the highest FC (3.03), together with three other AUX/IAA genes. The lowest oxygen concentration induced an up-regulation of four WRKY, five HB, and two Zinc-finger genes.</p><p>A putative VQ motif gene (<italic>MDP0000346969</italic>) was found to be induced at 0.4 kPa, compared to 0.8 kPa O<sub>2</sub>. VQ proteins play an important role in plant growth, development, and response to environmental conditions, most likely by acting as cofactors of group I and IIc WRKY (Cheng et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Two putative WRKY TFs (WRKY 23 <italic>MDP0000652760</italic> and WRKY33 <italic>MDP0000708692</italic>) were induced at 0.4 kPa oxygen compared to 0.8 kPa oxygen. These TFs belong to the WRKY group I (Rushton et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and thereby could interact and co-operate with VQ proteins (Cheng et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In addition, two other members of the WRKY TF family (<italic>MDP0000134105, MDP0000127976</italic>) were more expressed in the 0.4ox than 0.8ox sample.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is well known that decreases in oxygen concentration as those used in CA protocols result in a retarded metabolism, reduced respiration, delayed ripening, and an extension of shelf life in several fruit species including apples (Yahia, <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). We exploited an integrated transcriptomic and metabolic approach to characterize, as comprehensively as possible, apple cortex responses to different oxygen regimes adopted during apple storage. We found that in apple cortex, the overall metabolism is markedly affected throughout the imposed period of low oxygen stress (up to 60 days of storage in hypoxia) with responses that vary in terms of temporal pattern and intensity.</p><p>As observed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Blokhina et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), one of the main effects of hypoxic conditions in apple cortex is modulation of the oxygenase expression. In addition, the differential expression of a large number of members of the superfamily of cytochromes P450 may indicate the presence of finely-tuned mechanisms activating oxygen in signaling events (Lewis, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). GO classes related to important metabolic (e.g., carbohydrate) and biological (e.g., photosynthetic light reactions, transport, defense) processes and functions (e.g., hydrolase activity) were found to be highly affected by both hypoxic conditions. In addition, our data concerning the number of DEGs (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4</xref>) and the overall evaluation of the GO terms overrepresented when comparing 0.4 and 0.8ox samples (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) indicate that the slightly different hypoxic conditions imposed have a profound effect on apple fruit physiology.</p><p>One of the main physiological effects of applying CA conditions to ripening fruit is the reduction in ethylene biosynthesis. Given the relationships between ethylene and ripening gene expression in climacteric fruits (Grierson, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), this impacts strongly on the ethylene-dependent processes occurring in detached climacteric fruit. In our trial, ethylene production was not measured, although Both et al. (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) report that in Royal Gala apples, decreasing oxygen levels from 1 to 0.5 kPa lead to a reduction in ethylene biosynthesis after 8 months of storage and the following 6 days of shelf-life at 20&#x000b0;C. Considering the two main ethylene biosynthetic steps, ACC synthase and ACC oxidase, our data suggest that under hypoxic conditions ethylene production is negatively affected through a repressive effect on both <italic>ACS</italic> and <italic>ACO</italic> transcript accumulation, confirming previous results obtained by Gorny and Kader (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). This repressive effect was more pronounced in 0.4ox and was removed by shifting 0.4&#x02013;0.8 kPa at 31 DIA. The increasing levels of expression of both <italic>ACS</italic> and <italic>ACO</italic> genes observed in the Nox samples, was delayed in hypoxia in a concentration dependent way. There is thus a key difference between model plants subjected to hypoxia or flooding and detached apple fruit stored under low oxygen. In fact, although differences have been observed among species and organs, in whole plants the submergence adaptation is associated with ethylene production/accumulation (Steffen and Sauter, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><sec><title>Slight changes in low oxygen concentration affect pyruvate metabolism, fermentative pathway, and amino acid accumulation</title><p>Changes in the pyruvate metabolism in apple fruit appear to be a key event occurring under low oxygen conditions, as observed in model species. The accumulation of ethanol under extremely low oxygen concentration and/or during prolonged CA storage has been reported (Mattheis et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>) also in relation to the development of low oxygen-induced physiological disorders (Vandendriessche et al., <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Lumpkin et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). As observed by Lumpkin et al. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) in Red Delicious apples, the rate of ethanol accumulation increases with the decrease in O<sub>2</sub> levels. The relationship between different low oxygen concentrations and ethanol accumulation was confirmed in our experimental conditions in which 0.4 kPa oxygen represented a significantly more intense stress condition compared to 0.8 kPa (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This subtle difference in terms of oxygen concentration is readily perceived and associated with the differential transcriptional up-regulation of <italic>ADH</italic> genes as early as 3 DIA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and after 24 DIA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). However, post-transcriptional/post-translational regulation mechanisms modulating ethanolic fermentation cannot be ruled out (Bucher et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>).</p><p>The differential effect of the two hypoxic levels on the fermentative pathway was confirmed by the observation that, after shifting the oxygen concentration from 0.4 to 0.8 kPa (at 30 DIA), the ethanol concentration at 60 DIA was not different in the two hypoxic samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The different responses to the imposed conditions are even more evident when considering the changes occurring in terms of alanine concentration. The increase in alanine, one of the most salient effects of hypoxia (Limami, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), may also have an important role in apple fruit tissue, in maintaining the glycolytic flux by preventing excessive pyruvate accumulation, while retaining carbon resources within the cell (Rocha et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Hatoum et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) reported increases in alanine concentrations in Braeburn apples after long-term storage (up to 8 months) under 2.5 kPa O<sub>2</sub>,/3.7 kPa CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. In the same apple variety, Vandendriessche et al. (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) showed different alanine accumulations in relation to a different composition of the atmosphere (changes in both oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations) after 4 months storage. Under our experimental conditions, the increase in alanine content occurred very rapidly (3 DIA) in both hypoxic samples.</p><p>A comparison of gene expression patterns, reveals, in general, a correlation between the intensity of the hypoxic stress and the expression level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), as also observed for specific hypoxia-related genes (e.g., pyruvate decarboxylase) in other fruit species such as <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> (Pasentis et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) This is also confirmed by RNA-seq data showing that several ADH loci were more expressed in 0.4ox samples at 24 DIA. The accumulation of <italic>AlaAT</italic> transcripts was extremely abundant in 0.4ox samples, suggesting a low oxygen response threshold for this gene. This was confirmed by the effects on the specific transcript accumulation of shifting oxygen from 0.4 to 0.8 kPa (31 DIA), which is an extremely pronounced effect for <italic>AlaAT</italic>. In soybean roots, transcripts from <italic>GmAlaAT</italic> subfamily A increased during water logging, and declined to levels below the initial value during the recovery (re-oxygenation) treatment (Rocha et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Taken together these data suggest that, in apple fruit, specific <italic>AlaAT</italic>s possess a high level of transcriptional control by factors modulated by slight changes in oxygen concentration. This also suggests that under hypoxic conditions the fate of pyruvate, as a substrate to produce acetaldehyde (ethanol), lactate, or alanine, is highly dependent on the different low oxygen concentrations. Gene expression data concerning <italic>PDC, ADH, LDH</italic>, and <italic>AlaAT</italic> indicate that, with the exception of <italic>AlaAT</italic> in 0.8ox samples, there was an up-regulation in response to hypoxia as early as after 3 DIA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). All these genes belong to a core group of genes showing altered expression under hypoxia in model plant species (<italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, and poplar, Mustroph et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and, in apple fruit, their up-regulation appears to be transient with a general decrease in transcript accumulation in later stages of storage. Interestingly, among these genes, those that are homologous to core-responsive anaerobic genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Mustroph et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) exhibited a peak of induction when fruit were kept at 0.4 kPa oxygen for 10 days, although they were significantly up-regulated in milder hypoxic conditions. <italic>AlaAT</italic>, instead, was only induced by the lowest oxygen concentration used in this study, suggesting it to be regulated by strict hypoxia- or anoxia-specific mechanism(s).</p><p>In addition to alanine, other aminoacids were affected in relation to the intensity of hypoxic stress (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Compared to the Nox sample, GABA, a well-known end-product of plant cells held under low oxygen conditions, showed an increasing trend (statistically significant only under 0.8ox conditions). Since no induction of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) genes was observed under hypoxia, it can be hypothesized that post-transcription or post-translational regulation of this enzyme occurs in conditions of oxygen deficiency. Alternatively, either polyamine degradation or non-enzymatic proline oxidation could contribute to GABA accumulation under hypoxia (Shelp et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Signorelli et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In pears, increases in GABA content are the main markers of hypoxia (Pedreschi et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2009a</xref>): taken together, these findings may indicate that, as observed in other plant organs, also in fruit tissues GABA represents a key metabolite in the interface between C and N metabolism under energetically demanding stresses. Whether, as reported by Michaeli and Fromm (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), GABA may also act a signaling molecule and/or a sensor for the energetic level of the fruit remains to be elucidatedInterestingly, GABA and alanine accumulation patterns showed a similar trend characterized by a transient increase in the early stages (3&#x02013;17 DIA) of storage followed by a decrease. This suggests that in apple fruit the metabolisms of alanine and GABA are correlated. Asparagine and aspartate are significantly reduced by 0.4 but not by 0.8 kPa, which suggests that the two stress levels differently modulate the decrease in the carbon-flux into the TCA cycle. An accumulation of threonine accompanied by the attenuation of aspartate in 0.4ox samples could indicate that threonine synthesis is induced during extremely low oxygen stress, since the biosynthesis of threonine starts from aspartate. However, the synthesis of threonine requires energy, carbon, and nitrogen (Galili, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>), and plants under oxidative stress tend to direct the metabolism toward saving ATP. Additional investigations are needed to elucidate this aspect of threonine metabolism under hypoxia. The general decrease of uridine in both hypoxic samples compared to the control (where uridine increases throughout the storage period) might be, as suggested by Loef et al. (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), the consequence of the enhanced use, under the imposed stress, of preformed nucleotides, in order to avoid the high energy cost of a de-novo biosynthesis of uridine which represents an important cofactor in the use of sucrose. An attenuation of uridine has been detected in potatoes where oxygen concentration gradients are present within the growing tuber (Geigenberger et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Carbohydrate, cell wall, and secondary metabolisms as well as intracellular transport processes are highly responsive to different hypoxic levels</title><p>In elongating plant organs, the decrease in ATP and the reduced level of energy production caused by hypoxia induce a number of reactions. The primary metabolism is affected in terms of the catabolic pathways that allow the hydrolysis of starch and the catabolism of sucrose. Based on our expression data, also this seems to occur in hypoxic detached apples.</p><p>The transient up-regulation of beta-amylase observed in Granny Smith apples stored under hypoxia can be considered as specific to organs accumulating starch (such as apples), since amylases are not up-regulated in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings and poplar roots where starch reserve may be unavailable or not accessible (Mustroph et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Apples accumulate starch during the late stages of development, and when stored (particularly for long periods), the starch content is still high. In starch-accumulating organs (such as coleoptiles and germinating rice seeds) starch degrading enzymes (&#x003b1;-amylase, &#x003b2;-amylase, debranching enzyme, &#x003b1;-glucosidase) are active and low oxygen conditions up-regulate amylase gene expression (in particular &#x003b2;-amylase) in several species (Mustroph et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Also in apples, &#x003b2;-amylase appears to be a hypoxia-induced gene and might be involved in the decrease in starch content observed during CA storage (Gorin et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1978</xref>).</p><p>As reported in the vegetative tissues of several species, the prompt up-regulation of <italic>SuSy</italic> gene expression indicates that also in apple fruit, this is one of the core-responsive genes to hypoxia, which are highly sensitive to changes in oxygen concentration in the environment. The induction of <italic>SuSy</italic> has been associated with the activation of mechanisms that compensate for severe ATP deficiency by the induction of alternative pathways that use inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) instead of ATP for phosphorylation reactions. Compared to the invertase-hexokinase pathway, <italic>SuSy</italic> activation is considered as a truly energy-saving pathway. Similarly to findings for <italic>AlaAT</italic>, there seems to be a strict relationship between the oxygen concentration and the level of <italic>SuSy</italic> gene expression induction in apple cortex.</p><p>To meet the energy demand in many plants subjected to hypoxic stress, an increase in carbohydrate flux through glycolysis occurs. One of the key steps in glycolysis is the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-biphosphate catalyzed by PFK. In some plant species, PFK is induced under low oxygen conditions, and similarly to Susy, this is true for the form (PFP) that uses PPi instead of ATP in order to save energy (Bailey-Serres et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>The rapid and marked up-regulation of the <italic>PFK</italic> expression indicates that also in apple fruit, as observed in sensitive and tolerant plants to hypoxia (Mustroph et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), PFK is highly sensitive to hypoxic conditions and is probably key in re-setting carbon metabolism under oxygen deficiency through an induction of the glycolytic pathway. Although <italic>SuSy</italic> and <italic>PFK</italic> resulted highly induced by hypoxic conditions, focusing on the first 60 days of low oxygen storage, our data do not show any significant differences among samples in terms of the main sugars (fructose, glucose, and sucrose) content (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This might be the result of post-transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms that are activated in relation to hypoxic stress. Mustroph et al. (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) reported that while the genes were strongly expressed, the activities of PFK and PFP were only slightly increased in cell extracts of rice in response to short-term anoxic treatments. The same authors reported that different regulatory mechanisms concerning <italic>PFK/PFP</italic> gene expression and activity could be related to the different level of sensitivity/tolerance to low oxygen conditions. Whether this also occurs in apples still needs investigating.</p><p>RNA-seq data indicate that transmembrane carriers/ion transporters are among the GO terms overrepresented when comparing the two hypoxic conditions, and this suggests that ionic and osmotic homeostasis is altered under low oxygen stress in apple cortex with effects on cellular physiology and metabolism. The gene most expressed with the highest fold change in C (0.8ox) vs. B (0.4ox) sample is a dicarboxylate carrier. Regalado et al. (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) characterized three <italic>V. vinifera</italic> mitochondrial dicarboxylate/tricarboxylate carriers (DTC) putatively involved in the transport of mitochondrial malate (and other organic acids). Two of these <italic>DTC</italic> genes showed a developmental expression pattern during grape berry ripening (when malic acid concentration decreases) suggesting they are involved in malic acid transport into mitochondria for oxidation. Since one of the main effects of lowering oxygen concentrations in DCA protocols is to maintain higher levels of organic acids (malic acid, as the main organic acid in apples), the higher expression of these dicarboxylate carrier/transporter genes in 0.8ox samples may be related to a more pronounced catabolism of malic acid.</p><p>Another effect of the low oxygen storage of apple fruit is the maintenance of flesh firmness, one of the most important quality parameters. In general, the lower the oxygen level the higher the values of apple flesh firmness both at the end of the storage period and during the post-storage life (Hennecke et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The loss of flesh firmness is strictly related to changes in the composition, architecture, and physical properties of primary cell wall constituents. These changes are driven by specific enzymes (above all hydrolases) through reactions leading to solubilization and depolymerizations of two main domains: pectins and hemicellulose. In apples, the decrease in total pectin and hemicellulose content has been found to be higher under storage at 3% compared to 1% oxygen concentration where the free pectin content was lower (Siddiqui et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Gwanpua et al. (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) reported that a loss of neutral sugars, an increase in pectin solubility and a decrease in water soluble pectins are associated with Jonagold apple softening, which is more pronounced in fruit stored under normoxia than in CA. The key role played by pectin depolymerization process in apple softening has been clearly demonstrated in <italic>PG1</italic>-suppressed &#x0201c;Royal Gala&#x0201d; apples, which maintain higher firmness values after ripening (Atkinson et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The lower expression in the 0.4ox sample of genes with important roles in pectin (polygalacturonases, pectate lyase) and hemicellulose/xyloglucan (&#x003b2;-xylosidase) depolymerization, together with one expansin and one xyloglucan endotransglysolyase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) would explain, at the molecular level, the beneficial effects of extremely low oxygen concentrations on flesh firmness. Three pectinacetylesterase (PAE) genes were more expressed in the 0.4ox sample. No information is available in the literature concerning the possible role of PAE in the cell wall metabolism of ripening fruit and the biological function of pectin acetyl esterification is not clear. Renard and Jarvis (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) suggested that de-acetylation favors pectin-calcium interactions resulting in strengthening the wall and middle lamella. In potato plants overexpressing PAE, the tuber cell wall was found to have greater failure strength and was stiffer, which was explained by increased interactions (ionic binding of divalent cations, hydrogen bond) between homogalacturonan monomers (Orfila et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Perhaps this also occurred in apples stored at the lowest oxygen concentration used in our trial, and PAE may have a role, together with other cell wall enzymes, in altering the physical properties of primary cell wall in ripening fruit. Since in climacteric fruit, the up-regulation of some cell wall degrading enzymes at ripening is ethylene-dependent, it would be interesting to assess whether the mechanisms regulating the expression of these genes are directly related to hypoxic sensing mechanisms or to the reduction/inhibition of ethylene production and/or signal transduction.</p><p>With regard to specific secondary metabolism pathways, it seems that opposite effects are induced by varying the oxygen level on terpene synthesis and the earliest step of the phenylpropanoid pathway. In fact, a terpene synthase gene was more (FC &#x0003e; 2) expressed in the 0.8ox sample. This appears to be in agreement with findings of Both et al. (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) who reported a decrease in a terpene compound in Royal Gala apples stored under decreasing levels of oxygen concentration (from 1.0 to 0.5 kPa). Phenylalanine ammonia lyase genes (PAL) were more expressed (two at FC &#x0003e; 2 and two at FC &#x0003e; 1) under the lowest oxygen concentrations. The production of different classes of phenol compounds through the activation of the phenylpropanoid pathway and the up-regulation of <italic>PAL</italic> expression has been associated with the responses of detached fruit to various kinds of abiotic stress such as cold (Lo Piero et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and wounding (Tosetti et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Based on the RNA-seq data, it can be hypothesized that the earliest step in this secondary metabolic pathway is also highly sensitive to different levels of hypoxic stresses. Since the expression of a cinnamoyl CoA reductase was also induced, the production of defense-related metabolites, including lignin, may possibly be induced under extreme stress conditions. Mellidou et al. (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) reported an up-regulation of a cinnamoyl reductase gene in Braeburn apples affected by the CA-induced browning disorder.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription factors are selectively modulated in hypoxic apples suggesting the presence of finely-tuned regulatory mechanisms</title><p>The high number of TFs that were differentially expressed in the 0.4ox vs. 0.8ox sample comparison clearly indicates that the responses to different levels of hypoxia are (also) the result of a modulation of signaling events leading to differentially regulated transcriptional activity, which is apparently more pronounced when the stress is more intense (45 and 18 putative TFs were more expressed in 0.4ox and 0.8ox samples, respectively). In harvested fruit, a modulation of WRKY TFs has been associated with different responses/tolerance to stresses such as wounding (Tosetti et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and low temperature (Sanchez-Ballesta et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>).</p><p>The involvement of AP2/ERFs members in the responses to different stresses including oxygen deprivation was demonstrated by Nakano et al. (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and then by Licausi et al. (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) who described two members of the group VII ERF proteins (HRE1 and HRE2) as possible regulators of the hypoxic response in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The transcription of these two genes is highly up-regulated under low oxygen conditions, which is also what we observed in apple cortex where the two orthologues of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HRE (<italic>MDP0000288465</italic> and <italic>MDP0000848905</italic>) showed a prompt up-regulation under hypoxic conditions, with the highest levels of transcript accumulation occurring in the 0.4ox samples. It is still not clear whether the induced expression of these two TFs in apple is required to maintain the expression of fermentative and other hypoxic genes to ameliorate tissue survival under low oxygen condition as observed in <italic>Arabidospis</italic> (Licausi et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>). The other members of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> group VII ERF subfamily, which are constitutively expressed, have been proposed as candidates for early oxygen sensing through the N-end rule pathway (NERP; Bui et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>The results of western blot analysis clearly indicate that the apple ERF-VII MdRAP2.12 protein differentially accumulates in samples held at different oxygen concentrations, with the highest level reached in samples maintained at the lowest oxygen concentrations, whereas under normoxia no accumulation of the protein was detected. The different accumulation of MdRAP2.12 protein in the apple cortex after 24 DIA indicates a strong inhibition of the plant cysteine oxidase activity, which targets ERF-VII proteins toward proteolysis, at 0.4 KPa O<sub>2</sub> in the surrounding environment (Weits et al., <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Taken together these results suggest that the NERP involving the degradation of RAP2.12 and the oxygen sensing mechanisms described in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are also present in apple fruit cortex tissues. The rapid and marked up-regulation of HRE genes also seems to indicate that these TFs are the elements primarily responding to changes in oxygen concentration possibly sensed by the levels of RAP2.12 protein, and responsible for the regulation of the expression of hypoxia-induced genes (e.g., <italic>ADH</italic>, Licausi et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>).</p><p>Apple varieties react differently to extremely low oxygen conditions during storage, in particular in terms of ethanol production and accumulation, as observed, for example, in Red Delicious fruit which accumulate much more ethanol than Granny Smith (Zanella and Tonutti, unpublished). If this is the result of different oxygen sensing mechanisms involving group VII ERF TFs in general and in particular RAP2.12 remains to be elucidated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Harvested apple fruit maintained under extreme low oxygen conditions for up to 60 days undergo marked changes in their overall metabolism. Based on our integrated metabolic and transcriptomic approach, some processes appear to be already affected at the earliest stages of exposure to hypoxia. It can thus be concluded that:<list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>Apple fruit cortex tissues are highly sensitive even to subtle differences in oxygen concentrations close to the anaerobic compensation point.
