Mice deficient in Themis1 show a strong impairment in T cell selection in the thymus and defective T cell activation. The related Themis2 protein is expressed in B cells where it associates with signaling proteins Grb2 and Vav1, and is tyrosine phosphorylated after BCR stimulation. Thus, it has been proposed that Themis2 may transduce BCR signals, and hence play important roles in B cell development and activation. In this article, we show that Themis2 is expressed in all developing subsets of B cells, in mature follicular and marginal zone B cells, and in activated B cells, including germinal center B cells and plasma cells. In contrast, B lineage cells express no other Themis-family genes. Activation of B cells leads to reduced Themis2 expression, although it remains the only Themis-family protein expressed. To analyze the physiological function of Themis2, we generated a Themis2-deficient mouse strain. Surprisingly, we found that Themis2 is not required for B cell development, for activation, or for Ab responses either to model Ags or to influenza viral infection.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Themis-family proteins are defined by the presence of a cysteine-containing, all-&#x003b2; in Themis (CABIT) domain (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The family can be traced down to cnidarians, but in mammals it is composed of five members: Themis1 (originally Themis, but in this article termed Themis1 for clarity), Themis2, Themis3, Garem, and Gareml. The three Themis proteins share a similar structure including two consecutive CABIT domains and a proline-rich region (PRR), whereas Garem and Gareml contain one CABIT domain, a PRR, and a SAM domain (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Themis1 and Themis2 show high conservation between each other, and both have a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) and conserved C-terminal tyrosine residues, which serve as SH2-binding sites upon phosphorylation (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Signals from the BCR and TCR play critical roles in the development, survival, and activation of B and T lymphocytes. Several studies showed that Themis1 is essential for normal T cell development (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In the absence of Themis1, positive selection of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive thymocytes is impaired. Themis1 is phosphorylated after TCR stimulation, suggesting that Themis1 participates in signaling from the TCR (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). A recent study showed that Themis1 dampens signaling in thymocytes after low-affinity TCR stimulation, which normally results in positive selection, but when Themis1 is absent, such low-affinity stimulation results in increased TCR signaling and hence negative selection (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>In comparison, little is known about Themis2. Studies in cancer cell lines suggested a role for Themis2 in differentiation and proliferation (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Subsequently, Themis2 was shown to be involved in LPS-induced TNF-&#x003b1; production in RAW cells and primary human macrophages where it interacts with Lyn, Grb2, and Vav1 (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Themis2 also associates with Grb2 and Vav1 in B cells and is phosphorylated after BCR stimulation (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Furthermore, expression of Themis2 in the T cell lineage rescues thymocyte development in Themis1-deficient mice, suggesting that Themis1 and Themis2 carry out similar functions (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, Themis1 and Themis2 show mutually exclusive expression: Themis1 is expressed in T cells, whereas Themis2 is expressed in B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.immgen.org">http://www.immgen.org</ext-link>). It has been noted for a long time that there are strong similarities between BCR and TCR signaling pathways (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>); often one protein will exert a certain function in T cells, whereas its paralogue performs a similar function in B cells. Given the important role for Themis1 in T cell development and the high degree of similarity between Themis1 and Themis2, we hypothesized that Themis2 may have a critical function in B cell development or activation.</p><p>In this article, we show that Themis2 is expressed in all subsets of developing and mature B cells, and that no other Themis-family member is expressed in the B cell lineage. Furthermore, we show that Themis2 expression is downregulated after B cell activation. However, despite this nonredundant expression pattern, we find that, surprisingly, in the absence of Themis2, B cell development, activation, and Ab responses are unaffected.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Mice</title><p>The embryonic stem cell line JM8.F6 with the <italic>Themis2</italic><sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup> targeted allele (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.komp.org">http://www.komp.org</ext-link>) was used to generate C57BL/6J-<italic>Themis2</italic><sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup>/Nimr mice.

To extend this analysis, we examined expression of the Themis-family genes in developing subsets of B lineage cells in the bone marrow (pro-B, pre-B, immature B, and mature recirculating B cells) and the spleen (transitional type 1 [T1], T2, and T3 B cells), and in mature B cell subsets in the spleen (follicular and marginal zone B cells), lymph nodes (follicular B cells), and peritoneal cavity (B1 and B2 cells). As a positive control for expression of <italic>Themis1</italic>, we used mRNA isolated from the thymus and from splenic and lymph node T cells, and for <italic>Themis3</italic> we used mRNA from the small intestine.

Such a possible related function was further supported by the report that ectopic expression of Themis2 in the T cell lineage rescues thymocyte development in Themis1-deficient mice (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We show in this article that the only Themis-family member expressed in B lineage cells is Themis2, with no expression of either Themis1 or Themis3, or of the single CABIT domain proteins Garem and Gareml. Furthermore, we show that this exclusive expression is seen in all subsets of B cells examined, including developing B cells in the marrow, mature B cells in the spleen and lymph nodes, B1 cells in the peritoneal cavity, and in activated B cell subsets. Comparison of Themis2 expression showed that germinal center B cells and B10 cells have the lowest level of expression, suggesting that activation of B cells results in a decrease in Themis2 expression. In agreement with this, we found that activation of B cells in vitro with anti-IgM, LPS, and CD40L+IL-4 results in a rapid decline of Themis2 expression, with no compensating upregulation of expression of any other Themis-family gene. Similarly, previous studies had shown that expression of Themis2 in macrophages is reduced in mice undergoing infection or inflammation (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the function of Themis2, we generated a mouse strain deficient in Themis2 by deleting exon 4 of <italic>Themis2</italic>. The resulting <italic>Themis2</italic> allele is still transcribed, resulting in an mRNA with exon 3 spliced to exon 5, which is predicted to result in a frameshift and subsequent termination of translation in exon 6. As expected, immunoblot analysis of B cell extracts from these mutant mice showed that no full-length or truncated Themis2 protein was detectable using Abs recognizing epitopes in exons 4 and 6. It remains possible that an N-terminal fragment of Themis2 is still made in this strain, although we were unable to test for this in the absence of Abs to epitopes encoded by exons 1, 2, or 3 of <italic>Themis2</italic>. However, such a hypothetical truncated Themis2 protein would include only the N-terminal part of the first CABIT domain of Themis2. It would not contain the rest of this domain, the second CABIT domain, NLS, PRR, or Y660.</p><p>It is unlikely that such a truncated protein would be functional for several reasons. First, the PRR and Y660 of Themis2 are required in macrophages for binding of Themis2 to Grb2 and Lyn, respectively (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Second, mutation of either the PRR or Y660 impairs the ability of Themis2 to promote LPS-induced release of TNF-&#x003b1;. Third, the PRR of Themis1 is required for binding to Grb2 in T cells and for the recruitment of Themis1 to the LAT adapter protein, and hence the immunological synapse (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Fourth, the CABIT domains, NLS and PRR of Themis1, are required for normal T cell development (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Finally, a point mutation in the C-terminal end of the second CABIT domain of Themis1 leading to a premature stop codon also abrogates thymocyte development, demonstrating that a Themis1 protein containing only the first CABIT domain is not sufficient to maintain normal function (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that if a truncated Themis2 protein is generated from the <italic>Themis2</italic><sup>KO</sup> allele, it is unlikely to be functional.</p><p>Analysis of <italic>Themis2</italic><sup>KO/KO</sup> mice showed that, surprisingly, Themis2 is not required for normal B cell development. No developmental defect was seen even under competitive conditions, where small deficits are more likely to be visible. Analysis of V, D, and J gene usage for both H and L chain Ig genes showed no significant changes in Themis2-deficient mice, indicating that loss of Themis2 did not measurably affect B cell selection. Similarly, loss of Themis2 did not affect in vitro activation of B cells in response to stimulation through the BCR, TLR4, CD40, or IL4R, and did not perturb BCR internalization or Ag presentation to T cells. Finally, Themis2 was not required for Ab responses either to T-independent or T-dependent model Ags, or to influenza virus during the immune response to infection.</p><p>This lack of phenotype could potentially be because of functional redundancy between Themis2 and other related proteins. However, RNAseq analysis showed that Themis2-deficient B cells did not upregulate expression of other Themis-family genes. Thus, B lineage cells in <italic>Themis2</italic><sup>KO/KO</sup> mice do not express any Themis-family member, making it unlikely that the lack of phenotype in <italic>Themis2</italic><sup>KO/KO</sup> mice is due to redundancy with Themis-family proteins. Another possibility for the lack of phenotype is that the <italic>Themis2</italic> gene is nonfunctional. This is unlikely for two reasons. First, the <italic>Themis2</italic> gene is found in all vertebrates, indicating that Themis2 is likely to have an important function (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Second, it is possible that the <italic>Themis2</italic> gene in laboratory mice has become nonfunctional. However, this is also unlikely because ectopic expression of mouse <italic>Themis2</italic> in the T cell lineage can rescue T cell development in Themis1-deficient mice (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that Themis2 has an important physiological role, but not in the processes examined in this study. We note that Themis2 is expressed in myeloid cells, and it may be that Themis2 is more important in these cells.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that Themis2 is expressed in all subsets of developing, mature and activated B cells. Surprisingly, however, loss of Themis2 does not perturb B cell development, activation, or Ab responses. Further studies are needed to identify the physiological function of this conserved protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material">
