Massive-scale poly(A+) RNA sequencing of TIA1 or TIAR-knocked down HeLa cells reveals transcriptome signatures comprising genes and functional categories potentially able to modulate several aspects of membrane dynamics associated with extracellular matrix and focal/cell adhesion events. The transcriptomic heterogeneity is the result of differentially expressed genes and RNA isoforms generated by alternative splicing and/or promoter usage. These results suggest a role for TIA proteins in the regulation and/or modulation of cellular homeostasis related to focal/cell adhesion, extracellular matrix and membrane and cytoskeleton dynamics.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from Ministerio de Econom&#x000ed;a y Competitividad-FEDER (BFU2008-00354 and BFU2011-29653).

For example, they have been shown to play an important role during embryogenesis. Accordingly, mice lacking TIA1 and TIAR die before embryonic day 7, indicating that one or both proteins must be properly expressed for normal early embryonic development. Indeed, mice lacking TIA1 or TIAR, or ectopically over-expressing TIAR, show higher rates of embryonic lethality <xref rid="pone.0113141-Piecyk1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113141-Beck1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113141-SnchezJimnez2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

To assess the potential long-term regulatory roles of TIA proteins in cellular responses, we used an RNA interference strategy to stably down-regulate TIA1/TIAR expression together with genome-wide profiling analysis, to identify genes and processes involved in cell phenotypes regulated and/or modulated by TIA proteins.
