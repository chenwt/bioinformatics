Across non-mammalian vertebrates, nucleated erythrocytes are present in the circulation often with extended longevity throughout the life cycle of the organism. Intriguingly, the potential contribution of nucleated erythrocytes as transcriptionally-active cells to non-respiratory physiological processes has not been systematically addressed in non-mammalian species. Instead, red blood cell (EC) functions in non-mammalian vertebrates have tacitly been assumed to follow a highly conserved role as observed in mammalian anucleated erythrocytes.</p><p>The immune response is understood to have a modular structure mainly formed by sub-sets of activated leukocytes responding to different combinations of PAMPs via PRR-mediated recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026998-Medzhitov1">[1]</xref>. These cellular interactions are modulated by extrinsic local regulation by soluble factors including cytokines that form complex networks of cellular communication. Immune-specific mRNAs including PRRs and cytokines have been shown to exhibit considerable promiscuity for expression throughout the diverse cellular phenotypes involved in an immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026998-Abbas1">[2]</xref>. This in turn suggests that a nucleated cell of hematopoietic origin in circulation should have the potential to respond and contribute to the immune response given its ability to move freely throughout the body.</p><p>The origins and definitive descriptions of the evolution of the erythrocyte lineage in vertebrates is lacking. The ontogeny of vertebrate erythropoiesis has been well characterised in mammals, birds, amphibians and bony fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026998-deJong1">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026998-Palis1">[5]</xref>.

We hypothesised that the presence of a nucleus and transcriptional/translation machinery could confer to non-mammalian erythrocytes an active, ligand-induced transcriptional re-programming leading to a functional role that contributes to the immune response. Our results show that trout and chicken erythrocytes are capable of eliciting PAMP-specific responses that correspond to an active cellular response that likely regulates leukocyte activity. The observed modulatory role of erythrocytes in non-mammalian vertebrates, the presence of many transcripts that interact with other physiological systems, and the vast number of these cells in the circulation leads us to suggest that a reorganisation of the current thinking of integrated immunity/physiology in non-mammalian systems may be required.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Nucleated erythrocytes contain the cellular machinery to respond to PAMPs</title><p>Rainbow trout erythrocytes (tECs) are present in the circulation at a concentration of approximately 1&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> cells/ml and show a typical oval morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026998-g001"><bold>Fig. 1a</bold></xref>) as in almost all non-mammalian vertebrates with few exceptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026998-Claver1">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026998-Chattoraj1">[9]</xref>.

After quality trimming, a total of 80&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> reads (average 44 bp/read), were obtained in approximately a 1&#x02236;1 ratio for each library. No sequenced rainbow trout genome is available therefore RNA-Seq analysis and gene annotations were carried out by mapping the sequences against the SIGENAE contig database for rainbow trout (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sigenae.org/">http://www.sigenae.org/</ext-link>). RNA-Seq analysis resulted in the expression from both libraries of 25940 features (corresponding to contigs). A direct comparison of both libraries (unique contig number in each pool) revealed 2378 unique features that were up-regulated and 1475 unique features were down-regulated by 2-fold or higher in the poly (I&#x02236;C) treated library compared to the control library (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026998.s005">Table S1</xref></bold>).

Even though RNA-Seq analysis revealed thousands of genes to be differentially regulated by 2 fold or greater between libraries, the expression of only 55 genes were calculated by DESeq analysis to be statistically different between control and poly (I&#x02236;C) stimulated tEC at p&#x02264;0.1 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026998.s006">Table S2</xref></bold>). This number dropped to 41 genes at p&#x02264;0.05. However, for sequencing we used duplicate pools of RNA from the incubations of tEC obtained from 8 individual tEC cultures. While DESeq analysis can theoretically be performed on the data from nonreplicated samples, when used in this fashion it will be very conservative and will indicate that only a fraction of the differentially regulated genes are statistically different <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026998-Anders1">[14]</xref>.

Here we demonstrate that nucleated erythrocytes from rainbow trout and chicken develop specific PAMP-PRR responses at the level of the transcriptome and, at least in trout, erythrocytes stimulated with poly (I&#x02236;C) secrete thermo labile molecules that can modulate the anti-viral response in macrophages. Our studies indicate that nucleated erythrocytes from two vertebrate groups spanning significant evolutionary time possess the cellular and molecular machinery to specifically respond to pathogens and likely contribute to the regulation of an immune response. Therefore, this ability may well extend to all non-mammalian vertebrates.</p><p>We suggest that the current paradigm of the leukocyte-driven immune response that is mainly derived from mammals may require modification for the vast majority of vertebrate species that have nucleated erythrocytes. The current paradigm for organisation of the immune response suggests that the cells of the immune system are organised into PRR-driven networks and multi-cellular effector modules that act in a coordinated fashion to eliminate invading pathogens from the organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026998-Medzhitov1">[1]</xref>. Our data, far from challenging the above shows that nucleated erythrocytes are capable of PRR-driven responses, produce soluble factors that modulate leukocyte activity and therefore play an active role in the non-mammalian immune response. Evidence in support of this can be gathered from a limited set of observations derived from a diverse group of organisms, including mammals, where functional responses in erythrocytes include: haemoglobin-derived anti-microbial responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026998-Jiang1">[15]</xref>, glycophorin A-mediated pathogen sink <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026998-Baum1">[16]</xref>, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-like protein and activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026998-Kleinbongard1">[17]</xref>, specific human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026998-Beck1">[18]</xref>, IFN&#x003b1; production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026998-Workenhe1">[19]</xref>, hormone binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026998-Pottinger1">[20]</xref> and cortisol receptor 1 (CR1)-dependent immune complex clearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026998-Hess1">[21]</xref>. Thus in the erythrocytes a set of biological processes relevant to immunity and the immune response are present. Furthermore the dual functionality of haemoglobin, active in the anti-microbial response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026998-Jiang1">[15]</xref> and in respiratory gas exchange in both invertebrates and vertebrates, provides an interesting evolutionary backdrop for the evolution of the erythrocytes in vertebrates.</p><p>The global transcriptome perspective obtained from RNA-Seq analysis also points toward a more complex and integrated role for erythrocytes in regulatory physiology. The presence of mRNAs relevant to specific receptor-response networks from diverse physiological systems including endocrine, immune and reproductive uncovers the exciting possibility that ligand regulated transcription in the abundant erythrocytes may have a fundamental and previously unrecognized regulatory function in homeostatic balance. Extrapolating from mRNA abundance measurements (absolute transcript number) erythrocytes do not express exceptionally high levels of mRNA in comparison to PAMP-activated leukocytes, however given their abundance in the circulation, several millions of mRNA transcripts/ml of blood could be expected. Furthermore, transcripts produced in response to PAMP stimulation were polysome-bound suggesting a rapid biological response for both cellular and secreted proteins. Considering the transcript diversity uncovered by RNA-Seq, one is tempted to speculate that circulating erythrocytes may constitute a regulatory tissue interface between physiological compartments in the organism with largely unknown properties.</p><p>In conclusion, here we demonstrate that nucleated erythrocytes in non-mammalian vertebrates likely participate in an active fashion in the immune response and contain an mRNA repertoire integrating functions from other physiological systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult rainbow trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) of approx. 150 g mean weight were obtained from J.
