The functional readout of the pathway is activation through mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 leading to nuclear foci of repair. We have recently developed an FA triple-staining immunofluorescence based method (FATSI) to evaluate FANCD2 foci formation in formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples. DNA-repair deficiencies have been considered of interest in lung cancer prevention, given the persistence of damage produced by cigarette smoke in this setting, as well as in treatment, given potential increased efficacy of DNA-damaging drugs. We screened 139 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) FFPE tumors for FANCD2 foci formation by FATSI analysis. Among 104 evaluable tumors, 23 (22%) were FANCD2 foci negative, thus repair deficient. To evaluate and compare novel-targeted agents in the background of FA deficiency, we utilized RNAi technology to render several lung cancer cell lines FANCD2 deficient. Successful FANCD2 knockdown was confirmed by reduction in the FANCD2 protein. Subsequently, we treated the FA defective H1299D2-down and A549D2-down NSCLC cells and their FA competent counterparts (empty vector controls) with the PARP inhibitors veliparib (ABT-888) (5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) and BMN673 (0.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M), as well as the CHK1 inhibitor Arry-575 at a dose of 0.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M. We also treated the FA defective small cell lung cancer cell lines H719D2-down and H792D2-down and their controls with the BCL-2/XL inhibitor ABT-263 at a dose of 2&#x02009;&#x003bc;M. The treated cells were harvested at 24, 48, and 72&#x02009;h post treatment. MTT cell viability analysis showed that each agent was more cytotoxic to the FANCD2 knock-down cells. In all tests, the FA defective lung cancer cells had less viable cells as comparing to controls 72&#x02009;h post treatment. Both MTT and clonogenic analyses comparing the two PARP inhibitors, showed that BMN673 was more potent compared to veliparib. Given that FA pathway plays essential roles in response to DNA damage, our results suggest that a subset of lung cancer patients are likely to be more susceptible to DNA cross-link based therapy, or to treatments in which additional repair mechanisms are targeted. These subjects can be identified through FATSI analysis. Clinical trials to evaluate this therapeutic concept are needed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lung cancer</kwd><kwd>Fanconi anemia</kwd><kwd>pathway dysfunction</kwd><kwd>therapeutic target</kwd><kwd>FATSI</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="40"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="6292"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>With more than 159,480 deaths estimated in 2013, lung cancer is the number one cancer killer in the United States (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The standard first-line treatment of advanced lung cancer is platinum-based chemotherapy. However, response rates to chemotherapy vary widely among patients with the most common type, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), likely due to heterogeneity in terms of platinum-sensitivity. Great efforts have been made to try to identify molecular predictive markers of platinum resistance. Inability to repair platinum adducts by the lack of nucleotide excision repair proteins (ERCC) has received considerable attention, as a potential predictor of the efficacy of adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Results for this strategy, however, are conflicting (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), possibly due to poor discrimination by antibodies of pertinent proteins isoforms.</p><p>Another major mechanism of DNA repair, related to homologous recombination, is through the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. FA genes collaborate to form foci of DNA repair on chromatin following DNA damage or during S phase of cell cycle (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Cells with FA deficiency are hypersensitive to DNA damage agents such as cisplatin and mitomycin C (MMC) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and tumors from patients with germ line deficiency in some of the genes of this pathway have been shown to be sensitive to DNA-damaging agents, as well as inhibitors of other repair pathways, such as PARP inhibitors (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Additional studies have shown disruption of the FA cascade in sporadic cancers (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). These disruptions may involve epigenetic silencing of the FA-core complex, or mutations of one of several FA genes. The FA pathway contains 16 complementation groups, referred to as FA subtypes A, B, C, D1/BRCA2, D2, E, F, G, I, J, L, M, N, O, P, and Q. Eight of these proteins (A, B, C, E, F, G, L, and M) are subunits of FA-core complex 1, a nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>The FA complex I functions to activate FANCD2 and FANCI by mono-ubiquitinating the protein following response to DNA damage (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The activated FANCD2 and FANCI proteins are subsequently transported to subnuclear foci, which are thought to be the sites of DNA repair and also contain BRCA1, FANCD1/BRCA2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Rad51 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Given that the FA pathway plays an essential role in response to therapy-induced DNA interstrand cross-links, it is very plausible that cancers with defective FA pathway are more sensitive to cross-link based therapy. Since FANCD2 foci formation is critical for cancer cells to resist MMC and cisplatin, the best way to assess the functionality of this repair pathway as a whole is by evaluating FANCD2 foci formation. We have developed an FA triple-staining immunofluorescence based method (FATSI) to evaluate FANCD2 foci formation, and have generated preliminary data showing somatic deficiency of this pathway in tumors across several organ sites (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>Herein, we report our evaluation of FA deficiency in a series of tumors from patients with NSCLC and the response of lung cancer cells with reduced FANCD2 expression (FANCD2 knock-down cell) to treatment with inhibitors of PARP, CHK1, and BCL-2/XL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>FA triple-staining immunofluorescence analysis</title><p>Human NSCLC samples were obtained from The Tissue Procurement Shared Resource of the Ohio State University (OSU) Comprehensive Cancer Center and The Cooperative Human Tissue Network, Midwestern Division at OSU, after Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.

Overexpression has been reported in up to 80% of small cell lung cancers (SCLC). ABT-263 (navitoclax) is a potent and selective inhibitor of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, disrupting their interactions with pro-death proteins leading to the initiation of apoptosis (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).

There is a growing appreciation that defects in homologous recombination repair underlie hereditary and sporadic tumorigenesis, conferring a survival advantage to cancer cells. However, this deficiency may increase sensitivity of tumors to certain DNA-damaging agents. Homologous recombination deficiency may therefore prove to be a target of cancer treatment, as long as appropriate biomarkers become available to identify patients with these tumors (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Our recently developed FATSI method to evaluate FANCD2 foci formation, which is capable of evaluating the functionality of the pathway using FFPE tumor samples (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) could represent such a test. This method is suitable for large scale screening to select cancer patients most suitable for treatment with DNA-damaging agents. In addition, the therapeutic window for certain novel molecular targeted agents such as PARP inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors, and BCL-2/xL inhibitors may be larger for the FA-deficient tumors because the DNA lesions induced cannot be efficiently repaired and will eventually lead to the cells undergoing apoptosis (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><p>We found that 22% of NSCLC tumors examined had functional deficiency in the FA pathway and that cells with deficient FA pathway were more sensitive to treatment with PARP inhibitors. Both MTT and clonogenic analyses showed BMN673 was more potent compared to veliparib. This may be due to veliparib having a much weaker ability to trap PARP&#x02013;DNA complexes despite its great activity as a PARP catalytic inhibitor (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Furthermore, our studies showed that lung cancer cells with deficient FA pathway were more sensitive to treatment with a CHK1-kinase pathway inhibitor and a BCL-2/XL inhibitor.</p><p>Of concern are the results showing that veliparib up-regulated FA and nucleotide excision repair proteins in the H1299 FA wild type cells. Thus, treatment with veliparib in repair wild type cells may plausibly influence resistance to DNA targeting cytotoxic chemotherapy. Cancers with defective FA or NER pathways, which are incapable of mounting a compensatory response, may represent a better target for veliparib (or BMN673) alone or in combination with DNA targeted cytotoxic chemotherapy. It is unclear at this point if targeting two additional repair mechanisms in the setting of FA dysfunction will be better than one in tumor shrinkage and/or delaying the appearance of resistance. That is, for example, inhibiting base excision repair through PARP inhibition/PARP trapping and nucleotide excision repair through ERCC1 in FA-deficient tumors. It is possible that the risks of additional toxicities may outweigh any potential benefits. However, these experiments are worth conducting but it would be optimal to use best in class drugs.</p><p>The identification of patients with somatic functional deficiency of the FA pathway in their tumors may also lead to a better understanding of the specific genetic/epigenetic events that drive the cancer in these patients, by selecting these patients for deep DNA and RNA sequencing and methylome analysis. The genetic instability caused by the repair deficiency may lead to additional molecular changes that take over as drivers, a concept that have been named non-oncogenic addiction or induced sustainability (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Identification and inactivation of these added drivers may result in an opportunity for synthetic lethality. Our laboratory is pursuing this approach by performing RNAseq in FA-deficient tumor archival material and in fresh biopsies from patients in clinical trials of PARP inhibition.</p><p>Resistance to DNA interactive agents and PARP inhibitor may develop in patients with FA dysfunctional tumors through the recovering of function after a period of treatment. It has been reported that promoter methylation of several FA genes resulted in deficiency in FA repair foci formation in human cancers (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The plasticity of epigenetics changes may lead, for example, to hypomethylation of these promoters with a resulting recovery of FA function. Other reported mechanisms of function recovery include post-treatment restorative acquired mutations in previously dysfunctional repair genes (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Thus, it is of tantamount importance that any patient selection for clinical trials evaluating therapeutics in FA-deficient tumors is based on screening of recent tumor material, not separated by intervening treatment. Requiring biopsies once progression occurs will offer invaluable information regarding the mechanisms mediating acquired resistance.</p><p>In summary, the FATSI method shows that a proportion of lung cancer patients have tumors with FA deficiency. We have also demonstrated that lung cancer cells with defective FA pathway were more sensitive to PARP inhibitors and increase the therapeutic window of other molecularly targeted agents. Clinical studies are needed to validate the therapeutic potential of these preclinical findings.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Pathology Core Lab and Tissue Procurement facilities of the OSUCCC, and The Cooperative Human Tissue Network Midwestern Division at The Ohio State University, for their assistance.
