many animals, including mammals and insects. Carbohydrates are considered key carbon
sources for the gut microbiota, imposing strong selective pressure on the complex
microbial consortium of the gut. Despite its importance, the genetic traits that
facilitate carbohydrate utilization by gut microbiota members are still poorly
characterized. Here, genome analyses of 47 representative <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>
(sub)species revealed the genes predicted to be required for the degradation and
internalization of a wide range of carbohydrates, outnumbering those found in many
other gut microbiota members. The glycan-degrading abilities of bifidobacteria are
believed to reflect available carbon sources in the mammalian gut. Furthermore,
transcriptome profiling of bifidobacterial genomes supported the involvement of
various chromosomal loci in glycan metabolism. The widespread occurrence of
bifidobacterial saccharolytic features is in line with metagenomic and
metatranscriptomic datasets obtained from human adult/infant faecal samples, thereby
supporting the notion that bifidobacteria expand the human glycobiome. This study
also underscores the hypothesis of saccharidic resource sharing among bifidobacteria
through species-specific metabolic specialization and cross feeding, thereby forging
trophic relationships between members of the gut microbiota.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Bifidobacteria are Gram positive bacteria with high GC-content genomes that typically
reside in the gastro intestinal (GIT) tract of various animal species, including warm
blooded mammals and social insects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Noteworthy, bifidobacteria reach
a very high relative abundance as part of the infant gut microbiota<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, and this early life prevalence supports their purported role as modulators of
various metabolic and immune activities of their host<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Non-digestible
carbohydrates derived from the diet, together with host-produced glycans found in the
mammalian gut represent critical energy sources believed to be responsible for the
survival and proliferation of many microbial components of the gut microbiota, including
bifidobacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. It is therefore important to know what molecular
strategies are employed by members of the gut microbiota to harvest and metabolize
complex glycans in order to understand how they underpin their ecological fitness in,
and adaptation to, the GIT environment. Furthermore, carbohydrate metabolism in the
mammalian gut may occur in a concerted manner by various members of the microbiota,
including bifidobacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Thus, carbohydrates are presumed to be partly
responsible for microbiota dynamics in this changeable environment. Genomics has been
crucial in revealing the complex interactions and molecular dialogue between a host and
its resident (bifido)bacteria, and in unraveling bifidobacterial gut colonization
strategies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Recently, all 47 currently recognized bifidobacterial
sub/species have been genomically decoded<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, thus providing the
necessary genetic background for this group of bacteria. Here, we describe an analysis
of the genomes and transcriptomes of representatives of all 47 (sub)species that are
currently assigned to the <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> genus, predicting bifidobacterial
genome-based strategies for carbohydrate metabolism that impact on the overall
glycobiome of the gut microbiota and host, while also being pivotal for the
establishment of trophic relationships between members of gut microbiota.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genomes of the <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> genus and carbohydrate
metabolism</title><p>Genome sequences from the type strain of each of the 47 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>
(sub)species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>) were used to
assess the contribution of carbohydrate metabolism to the corresponding
pan-genome, core genome and variome, determined as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In total, 18,181 and 551 BifCOGs
(<italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>-specific Clusters of Orthologous Genes) represent the
pan-genome (pan BifCOGs) and the core of bifidobacterial genomic coding
sequences (core BifCOGs) of the <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> genus, respectively.
Functional annotation of the core BifCOGs, based on a recently updated EggNog
database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, indicates, as expected, that a large part of the
conserved core genes encode housekeeping functions and functions involved in the
adaptation to/interaction with a particular environment, including carbohydrate
metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). Interestingly,
about 5.5% of the core BifCOGs is associated with carbohydrate metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>), whereas the carbohydrate
metabolism functional family is the most represented COG family of the pan
BifCOGs (13.7%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). This
finding suggests a strong selective pressure towards the acquisition and
retention of accessory genes for carbohydrate utilization by bifidobacteria in
order to be competitive in a particular ecological niche. The commitment of
bifidobacteria towards the utilization of a wide array of simple and complex
carbohydrates is further underlined by EggNog profiling of adult
human&#x02019;s faecal metagenomes sequenced as part of the Human Microbiome
Project (HMP). Results showed that the average abundance of the carbohydrate
metabolism functional family in HMP metagenomic datasets is 8.0%, thus being 58%
lower than the abundance detected in the bifidobacterial pan-genome, i.e. 13.7%
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). Notably, the
carbohydrate metabolism functional family is the most abundantly represented COG
family within the <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> pan-genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). The pan-genome analysis also allowed
the identification of the <underline>T</underline>ruly <underline>U</underline>nique <underline>G</underline>enes (TUG),
consisting of genes present in just one of the examined bifidobacterial genomes
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). Interestingly, no
functional annotation can be made for the majority of TUGs (54.1%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). However, 13.2% of the
identified TUG can be attributed to a COG family representing proteins involved
in carbohydrate metabolism, including glycosyl hydrolases (GH) and carriers for
carbohydrate uptake. This data supports the notion that carbohydrate metabolism
supports adaptation and specialisation processes, and consequently speciation
within the <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> genus.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Carbohydrate-active enzymes encoded by the genus
<italic>Bifidobacterium</italic></title><p>Considering the importance of carbohydrate metabolism and energy conversion
systems in gut inhabitants such as bifidobacteria, we decided to investigate the
presence of genes predicted to encode GHs, polysaccharide lyases (PLs),
carbohydrate esterases (CE), glycosyl transferases (GT) and carbohydrate binding
modules (CBM), and other carbohydrate metabolic pathway components using the
predicted core- and pan-genome of the <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> genus. Genomic data
showed that <italic>B. scardovii</italic> and <italic>B. biavatii</italic> have a significantly
larger set of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, also termed
glycobiome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, as compared to other bifidobacterial species
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Normalization of GH counts against genome
size (Mbp), generating a GH index, provided an insight into the relative extent
of adaptive events related to carbohydrate metabolism found in individual
bifidobacterial species. Notably, four species (<italic>B. scardovii, B. biavatii,
Bifidobacterium saeculare</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium dentium</italic>) possess a
GH index that is approximately 50% higher than the bifidobacterial average
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Classification according to the
<underline>C</underline>arbohydrate <underline>A</underline>ctive <underline>E</underline>nzymes (CAZy) system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> revealed that the pan-genome of the analysed
<italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> representatives includes 3,385 genes encoding
predicted carbohydrate-active enzymes, including members of 57&#x02009;GH,
13&#x02009;GT and seven CE families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2 and Fig. S3</xref>), while no
putative Polysaccharide Lyases (PL)-encoding genes were detected. Genes encoding
members of CAZy family GH13 are most commonly found in bifidobacterial genomes,
especially for those bifidobacteria isolated from the mammalian gut (24.2% of
the total predicted bifidobacterial GH repertoire, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig.
1</xref>). Enzymes belonging to this family are widespread in bacteria and are
characterized by their degradative abilities towards a wide range of
carbohydrates, including plant-derived polysaccharides, such as starch and
related substrates (amylose and amylopectin and/or (cyclo)maltodextrins), and
trehalose. Furthermore, stachyose, raffinose and melibiose may also represent a
target for members of the GH13 family<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and their complete
breakdown is achieved with the involvement of GH36 enzymes, which were shown to
be abundant in the analysed bifidobacterial genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S2</xref>). Such carbon
sources indeed represent very common glycans found in the adult mammalian
(omnivore and herbivore) diet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. We also observed distinct
differences between predicted glycobiomes of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> species with
regards to their (predicted) ability to degrade plant polysaccharides as opposed
to host-derived glycans, such as N- or O-linked glycoproteins, human milk
oligosaccharides (HMOs) and glycosaminoglycans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The
bifidobacterial glycobiome was shown to contain members of GH families that are
known to be involved in host-glycan degradation, such as GH33, encompassing
exo-sialidases, GH29 and GH95, which represent fucosidases, GH20, which include
hexosaminidase and lacto-N-biosidase activities, GH112, representing
lacto-N-biosidases, GH38 and GH125, involving &#x003b1;-mannosidases as well
as GH101 and GH129, which include &#x003b1;-N-acetylgalactosaminidases.
Interestingly, members of the <italic>B. scardovii</italic>, <italic>B. longum</italic> subsp.
<italic>infantis</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium bifidum</italic> species possess the most
extensive set of such host-glycan-degrading GH families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig.
1</xref>). Such glycobiome specialization probably reflects species-specific
adaptation to a particular ecological niche and illustrates strict co-evolution
with their mammalian host. Clustering of bifidobacterial species based on their
predicted GH and carbohydrate-degradation pathway repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) allows the identification of a cluster, designated as GHP/A,
representing species with a considerable array of predicted GH43 family enzymes
involved in degradation of complex plant polysaccharides, such as
(arabino)xylan, which plays an important structural role as a main constituent
of the plant cell wall<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, and as such represents a substantial
component of plant cell wall-derived dietary fiber<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. This
finding suggests that bifidobacteria rich in GH43 member-specifyings genes are
adapted to hosts with a vegetarian or omnivore diet. A subgroup of the cluster
GHP/A, named GHP/A1, appears to possess a wider array of GHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). This subgroup encodes a large number of GH3 family enzymes
that are predicted to be involved in the degradation of an extensive range of
plant-derived polysaccharides (e.g., cellodextrin, (arabino)xylan and
(arabino)galactan), as well as involved in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis and
turnover. Notably, bifidobacterial species isolated from honey/bumblebees
specify a peculiar GHP/C cluster, whose members possess a discrete set of GH43
and GH3 enzymes, but in addition these particular bifidobacterial genomes are
predicted to encode a very limited repertoire of GH13 representatives, in
contrast to all other bifidobacteria. This is in accordance with the absence or
paucity of carbohydrates with &#x003b1;-glucosidic linkages in the
honey/bumblebee diet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The remaining bifidobacterial species,
not fitting in clusters GHP/A or GHP/C, are included in cluster GHP/B, which is
characterized by an under-representation of GH43 and GH3.</p><p>In order to further evaluate the importance of the bifidobacterial contribution
to degradation of complex carbohydrates found in the human gut, we compared the
bifidobacterial GH repertoire with all the so far sequenced members of the human
gut microbiome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. For this purpose, we used GH data of 2,674
genomes available in the CAZy database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> with the addition of
data obtained from the bifidobacterial genomes analysed in this study.
Interestingly, the <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> genus was shown to specify one of the
largest arsenal of GH13, GH43, GH3 and GH51 family members (2.0 fold-, 2.6
fold-, 5.8 fold-, 7.0 fold-, respectively, more with respect to the average GH
arsenal of the gut microbiome), along with <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp.
(<italic>Bacteroidales</italic> family) and <italic>Clostridiales</italic> family. Furthermore,
abundance of these GH families has been shown by a small number of other members
of the gut microbiota such as <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> spp. (<italic>Bacillales</italic>
family) and <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spp. (<italic>Actinomycetales</italic> family) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). These findings corroborate the very substantial
contribution to glycan-breakdown potential by bifidobacteria in the mammalian
gut.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Secreted glycosyl hydrolases of bifidobacteria</title><p>In order to allow GH enzymes produced by different organisms to act in concert
and to access glycans with a degree of polymerization exceeding that of the
corresponding uptake system, certain GH enzymes are expected to be located on
the cell surface or secreted into the environment. Notably, even though the
majority of the identified GH enzymes from the bifidobacterial pan-genome is
predicted to be intracellular, 10.9% of the deduced bifidobacterial GH pool is
predicted to be extracellular, of which 32.9% are members of the GH13 family and
annotated as pullulanases and &#x003b1;-amylases, 24% are members of the
GH43 family and predicted to act as &#x003b2;-xylosidases and
&#x003b1;-L-arabinofuranosidases, while 12% are members of the GH51 family
and classified as &#x003b1;-L-arabinofuranosidases. These data suggest that
bifidobacteria secrete a relevant pool of GH for the degradation of plant
polysaccharides, which would accordingly represent an important resource for the
host in the context of obtaining access to dietary fibres. The secreted
bifidobacterial pan-genome also encompasses GHs involved in host-glycan
degradation (see above), being classified as families GH29, GH33, GH95 and
GH101, and constituting 0.4%, 3.5%, 0.8% and 2.7% of this secreted pan-genome,
respectively. Predicted extracellular GHs were identified in 43 species of the
genus <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, with a particularly high prevalence in <italic>B.
biavatii</italic> (endowed with 17 secreted GHs, including 4 GH43 and 4 GH13
members), <italic>B. scardovii</italic> (endowed with 11 secreted GHs, including 3 GH43
and 3 GH51, annotated as &#x003b1;-L-arabinofuranosidases) and <italic>B.
bifidum</italic> (endowed with 11 secreted GHs, including two GH84 and two GH33
members, predicted to act as N-acetyl &#x003b2;-glucosaminidases and
sialidases, respectively). The remaining bifidobacterial genomes are predicted
to encode seven or less secreted GHs. The two secreted N-acetyl
&#x003b2;-glucosaminidases and the two secreted sialidases found in <italic>B.
bifidum</italic> are crucial for the utilization of HMOs and intestinal
glycoconjugates such as mucin, thus further supporting the notion that this
microorganism is highly adaptated to colonize and persist in the mammalian
gut<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Nevertheless, <italic>B. bifidum</italic> is unable to use
sialic acid as its sole carbon source and the activity of sialidases appears to
be important only to allow access to other carbohydrates associated to
sialylated host-encoded glycans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Furthermore, the released
sialic acid can be utilized by other bifidobacteria, such as <italic>B. breve</italic>,
resulting in cross-feeding between bifidobacterial species that share the same
ecological niche<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Saccharolytic pathways of bifidobacteria</title><p>Predictions of complete pathways for the degradation of simple
(di/trisaccharides) and complex sugars through Pathway Tools software<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> showed that <italic>B. biavatii</italic> specifies the largest number of
such pathways (14 complete pathways) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), while the
predicted repertoire for carbohydrate degradation of <italic>B. bombi,
Bifidobacterium crudilactis, B. longum</italic> subsp. <italic>infantis, B.
minimum</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium ruminantium</italic> is limited to just nine
pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Notably, when assessing
presence/absence data of pathways involved in the breakdown of simple and
complex carbohydrates shown in the GHP clustering profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig.
1</xref>), bifidobacterial species isolated from honey/bumblebees,
constituting cluster GHP/C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), lack genes encoding
glycogen degradation I and glycogen degradation II pathways. Based on recent
discoveries, glycogen metabolic pathways are present in bacterial species able
to face diverse environments and showing a flexible lifestyle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.
More recently, it was reported that the ability of <italic>Lactobacillus
acidophilus</italic> to synthesize and store energy in the form of glycogen,
either prior to or during its transit through the host, potentially confers a
competitive advantage in the GI tract<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. This is supported by the
fact that glycogen storage is ubiquitous among enteric bacteria, possibly due to
the necessity to support rapid growth in the intestinal environment where there
is intense trophic competition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. On the other hand, it was
hypothesized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> that the loss of glycogen pathways is a strong
indication of genome degradation associated with parasitic or symbiotic
behaviour of bacteria. Though the original study of Henrissat <italic>et al.</italic> was
based on the analysis and comparison of just 55 fully sequenced bacterial
genomes, their findings have more recently been substantiated by others
involving 1202 bacterial proteomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Among
<italic>Bifidobacteriaceae</italic>, it is noteworthy that <italic>B. actinocoloniiforme,
B. asteroides, B. bohemicum, B. bombi, B. coryneforme</italic> and <italic>B.
indicum</italic>, species isolated from insects and constituting the GHP/C
cluster, show a smaller genome size compared to all other bifidobacterial
species isolated from mammals. We therefore speculate that
<italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> members linked to insects have enjoyed a longer
adaptation history to their hosts, in evolutionary terms, because mammals
appeared on earth in the late Paleocene (between 65 and 23&#x02009;mya),
whereas insects in the Devonian period (between 459 and 359&#x02009;mya) or
even before according to a recent phylogenomics study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. This
hypothesis is confirmed by comparison of the phylogenetic supertree of all known
bifidobacterial species and that obtained for their corresponding hosts,
revealing a co-evolution host-microbe profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p>The genomes of <italic>B. asteroides</italic>, <italic>B. actinocoloniiforme, B. indicum, B.
coryneforme, B. bombi</italic> and <italic>B. bohemicum</italic> possess a complete
trehalose degradation IV pathway, which is absent in the majority of the other
bifidobacteria and in all other examined members of the family
<italic>Bifidobacteriaceae</italic>. The acquisition of this pathway, which is
apparently specific for bifidobacterial species isolated from the insect gut,
may be related to the fact that trehalose is used as carbohydrate storage and
blood-sugar by many insects including bees<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Remarkably, a large
majority of bifidobacterial genomes included in cluster GHP/B do not encompass
pathways for L-arabinose and/or xylose metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig.
1</xref>). These genomes encode relatively few GH43 enzymes compared to the
GHP/A and GHP/C clusters, thus confirming a strict genetic adaptation to
ecological niches where these plant carbohydrates are not available. The
ecological origin of most of the GHP/B members that do not possess L-arabinose
and/or xylose degradation pathways is either raw/fermented milk or faecal
material/gastrointestinal tract of suckling animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>), where a milk-based diet represents
the main nutrient retrieval opportunity. In this context, <italic>B. breve, B.
bifidum</italic> and <italic>B. longum</italic> subsp. <italic>infantis</italic> have been isolated
from infants, <italic>B. thermacidophilum</italic> subsp. <italic>porcinum</italic> and <italic>B.
choerinum</italic> from piglet, <italic>B. crudilactis</italic> from raw bovine milk and
<italic>B. mongoliense</italic> from fermented mare&#x02019;s milk (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>), thus suggesting that these species
have evolved to focus solely or predominantly on the degradation of carbon
sources present in milk and have lost or did not acquire the ability to use
(certain) plant polysaccharides. Fermented milk is a strict anthropogenic
environment and these bacteria are unlikely to have evolved in fermented milk
<italic>per se</italic>. In fact, the natural ecological environment of these species
is still expected to be the gut from various (suckling) animals. In this
environment such bifidobacterial taxa have enjoyed the presence of a rich
reservoir of milk-based carbohydrates (oligosaccharides/lactose), which thus
caused their genomes to acquire a genetic arsenal that allowed them to access
these carbon sources. In contrast, <italic>B. ruminantium</italic> and <italic>B. boum</italic> taxa
have been isolated from the bovine rumen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>), an environment rich in plant polysaccharides, although
they lack GH43-encoding genes and consequently cluster in GHP/B. Other
rumen-derived bifidobacteria do encode GH43 enzymes, perhaps indicating that
certain bifidobacteria rely on cross-feeding, which is in line with
bifidobacteria being a minor component of the rumen microbiota, although their
functional role is largely unknown. <italic>B. breve</italic> deserves a special mention
as this species seems to have adopted a non-specialist strategy of acquiring
constituent elements of both plant- and host-derived carbohydrates (consistent
with its isolation from both infants and adults), yet is lacking the ability to
directly access (many) HMOs, or mucin, nor possessing the ability to metabolize
xylose/arabinose-containing carbohydrates, though it can metabolize a wide range
of &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-glucose- and
&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-galactose-containing sugars<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.
Thus, it may, perhaps co-operatively, rely on other (bifido)bacterial species
like <italic>B. bifidum</italic> or <italic>B. longum</italic> subsp. <italic>infantis</italic> in order to
sustain growth on the above mentioned complex sugars<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Carbohydrate utilization patterns of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic></title><p>Fermentation profiles of the 47 sequenced <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> strains revealed
that all strains are able to ferment a common set of sugars, which include
glucose, sucrose and raffinose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig.
S5</xref>, panel a). In contrast, fermentation capabilities for other sugars,
such as lactose, galactose, maltose, melibiose, fructose, lactulose,
maltodextrins, turanose, &#x003b2;-gentibiose and xylose, were shown to be
variable for the majority of the strains tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>, panel a). Notably, we identified
bifidobacterial taxa such as <italic>B. cuniculi</italic> displaying an ability to grow on
a wide range of simple and complex carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>, panel a), thus suggesting metabolic
expansion of its carbohydrate acquisition abilities perhaps to enhance
competitiveness in one or more ecological niches. In contrast, other
bifidobacterial species, such as <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> subsp.
<italic>animalis</italic>, only utilize a relatively small number of the carbohydrates
assayed here (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>, panel a), an
observation which, together with the very limited number of predicted
GHs/carbohydrate pathways encoded by this taxon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>),
underlines a rather high level of genetic adaptation to an ecological niche.
Growth studies highlighted the existence of different carbon sources that are
differentially utilized by bifidobacteria, in a manner consistent with our
predictions. In this context growth experiments involving most members of the
<italic>B. asteroides</italic> phylogenetic group showed that they do not exhibit any
appreciable growth on glycogen, an observation which is consistent with <italic>in
silico</italic> pathway predictions. Cultivation trials performed on
plant-derived carbohydrates such as arabinose or xylose revealed that these
sugars are utilized by a majority of the bifidobacteria tested except for those
taxa that form the GHP/B cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), which are not
predicted to encode enzymes of the L-arabinose degradation I and xylose
degradation I pathways. The ubiquitous monosaccharide mannose that is found in
both plant and animal glycans, is easily shunted into the glycolytic pathway via
isomerization of mannose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.
Growth on mannose is, however, not a wide-spread property among the tested
bifidobacterial taxa, a finding that is consistent with genomic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), which revealed a variable distribution of genes
supporting bifidobacterial mannose utilization such as genes encoding predicted
mannosidases and mannose-6-phosphate isomerases. Interestingly, when
mannosidase-encoding genes were detected, they were in the large majority of
cases shown to be located within a putative N-glycan (host-derived) degradation
cluster. Lactose constitutes a typical glycan that specifically occurs in the
mammalian diet, though normally limited to the early stages of life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. <italic>In silico</italic> analyses involving the genomes of 47
bifidobacterial taxa revealed a ubiquitous distribution in their chromosomes of
genes encoding &#x003b2;-galactosidases. This finding suggests a rather
wide-spread utilization of lactose as well as other galactose-containing glycans
such as galactan, galacto-oligosaccharides, Human milk oligosaccharides (HMO)
and mucin, which require particular &#x003b2;-galactosidases for their
degradation, among members of the <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> genus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Growth experiments involving lactose showed that, except
for <italic>B. ruminantium</italic> and <italic>B. thermacidophilum</italic> subsp<italic>.
thermacidophilum</italic>, all other tested bifidobacteria are able to ferment
this disaccharide. In contrast, <italic>in silico</italic> analyses suggested that
L-rhamnose is rarely used by bifidobacteria due to the apparent lack of genes
encoding L-rhamno-gamma-lactonase, L-rhamnoate dehydratase and
2-keto-3-deoxy-L-rhamnoate aldolase. Notably, fermentation profiles involving
this carbon source confirmed that only <italic>B. biavatii</italic> is able to ferment
L-rhamnose. Furthermore, we evaluated the abilities of members of the genus
<italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> to utilize typical host glycans like mucin and HMO.
Interestingly, in addition to the currently known bifidobacterial archetypes
that can utilize these host-glycans (<italic>B. bifidum</italic> and <italic>B. longum</italic>
subsp. <italic>infantis</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, we identified that <italic>B. biavatii,
B. crudilactis, B. kashiwanohense, Bifidobacterium stellenboschense</italic> and
<italic>Bifidobacterium mongoliense</italic> are all capable of HMO metabolism.
Inspection of their genome sequences revealed the presence of genes predicted to
encode sialidases, fucosidases, N-acetyl-&#x003b2;-hexosaminidases,
endo-&#x003b1;-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and &#x003b2;-galactosidases,
which have previously been shown to be crucial for the breakdown of these
complex carbohydrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. This further illustrates the broad
catabolic abilities of bifidobacteria in general and in particular their
specialization to utilize complex carbohydrates that are commonly found in the
(infant) mammalian GIT.</p><p>In order to substantiate the notion that bifidobacterial genomes contain specific
genes responsible for the utilization of key carbohydrates that are present in
their ecological niches and correspond to their saccharolytic phenotype, we
investigated the transcriptome for a representative bifidobacterial species for
each of the seven bifidobacterial phylogenetic clusters described
previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> grown on (where possible) glucose, glycogen,
lactose, xylose, rhamnose, mannose, trehalose or HMO as the sole carbon source
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>, panel b). RNAseq
experiments allowed the identification of the transcriptomes for each
bifidobacterial strain tested in cases where growth was obtained, revealing that
the carbohydrate metabolism COG family [COG category (G)], is one of the most
represented in the transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig.
S5</xref>, panel c). Manual inspection of the identified transcriptomes
highlighted the existence of a large arsenal of genes encoding GHs and other
enzymes that constitute parts of carbohydrate metabolic pathways, including
suspected carbohydrate carrier systems that are expressed when bifidobacteria
are cultivated on a carbohydrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig.
S6</xref>). In this context, we identified &#x003b2;-galactosidases of
the GH2 and GH42 families that were shown to be expressed when bifidobacteria
are grown on lactose, as well as MFS and ABC systems predicted to act as
carriers for lactose and/or glucose and/or galactose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6</xref>). Cultivation of bifidobacteria on
mannose, rhamnose, trehalose or xylose resulted, in cases where growth was
observed, in the transcription of genes encoding specific catabolic pathways
such as D-mannose degradation, L-rhamnose degradation II, trehalose degradation
I and xylose degradation I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig.
S6</xref>), observations that are consistent with our <italic>in silico</italic>
assignments. The transcriptomes of bifidobacteria grown on glycogen clearly
showed that transcription of genes encompassing the glycogen degradation I
pathway, predicted to be indispensable for glycogen to glucose breakdown, is
switched on under these circumstances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6</xref>). The only exceptions are represented by the transcriptomes
of <italic>Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum</italic> and <italic>B. stellenboschense</italic> in
which the genes predicted to specify amylomaltase and glucokinase enzymes are
not expressed, suggesting the existence of an alternative pathway for conversion
of the intermediate carbohydrate maltose into
&#x003b2;-D-glucose-6-phosphate. Transcriptomic data recovered from growth
of <italic>B. biavatii</italic> on the complex substrate HMO revealed up-regulation of a
sizable number of different GH-encoding genes, such as those predicted to belong
to GH1 (predicted &#x003b2;-D-fucosidases), GH2 (putative
&#x003b2;-galactosidases), GH3 (putative
&#x003b2;-N-acetylhexosaminidases), GH29 (&#x003b1;-L-fucosidases), GH30
(possible &#x003b2;-fucosidases), GH36 (likely
&#x003b1;-N-acetylgalactosaminidases), GH42 (putative
&#x003b2;-galactosidases), GH85
(endo-&#x003b2;-N-acetylglucosaminidases) and GH112 (predicted
galacto-N-biose/lacto-N-biose phosphorylases) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6</xref>). Other up-regulated GH-coding genes
included those specifying members of GH13, GH32 and GH43 families, even though
their predicted enzymatic activities do not appear to be directed against
HMO.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mutualistic/commensal breakdown activities of bifidobacteria on
carbohydrates</title><p>In gut ecosystems, bacteria can exploit mutualistic as well as commensal and
competitive activities during metabolism of various carbon sources available in
such an environment. Thus, we were interested to evaluate possible trophic
relationships towards carbohydrates between bifidobacterial taxa found in
various ecological niches. Specific bi-association of bifidobacterial taxa were
selected based on their common ecological origin (e.g., human-, porcine-, or
rabbit-gut). Their growth performances on carbon sources that are commonly
available in their particular ecological niche were assayed during
co-cultivation (bi-association) and compared to those achieved when the strains
were grown separately (mono-association). Such trials suggested that when
cultivated together these bifidobacterial taxa were taking an evident benefit as
supported by the enhanced cell densities in the bi-associations compared to the
mono-associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). These growth-benefits were in
a few cases evident for both strains such as in the case of the <italic>B. magnum</italic>
and <italic>B. cuniculi</italic> combination when these strains were cultivated on xylan
or on starch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Such findings were further
supported by the evaluation of transcriptomic changes, employing an RNAseq
approach, observed for these bifidobacterial strains when cultivated together as
compared to the situation where these strains were assayed separately. Notably,
in bi-associations where a benefit was noticed in terms of cell numbers for both
strains, such as for <italic>B. magnum</italic> and <italic>B. cuniculi</italic> cultivated on
starch, complementarity in terms of the transcription of the genetic repertoire
for the metabolism of this complex sugar was observed for these strains. In
fact, under such conditions the alpha-glucoside phosphorylase-specifying genes,
i.e. BMAGN_0016 and BCUN_1467, as well as amylase-encoding genes, i.e.
BMAGN_0612 and BCUN_0313, of both <italic>B. magnum</italic> and <italic>B. cuniculi</italic> were
shown to be transcribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, while
these latter enzymes are predicted to be intracellular, two genes encoding
putative extracellular pullulanases (BCUN_0354 and BCUN_0356), were shown to be
transcribed. Even though the detected transcription level for these genes was
low, it may be that such enzymes allowed a partial de-branching of starch so as
to allow internalization of the released degradation products into the bacterial
cell for complete degradation. The resulting starch-degradation products such as
maltose and alpha-glucosides are presumed to be internalized by means of ABC
transporters (BMAGN_0006-BMAGN_0009 and BCUN_2019-BCUN_2022) and/or PTS systems
(BMAGN_0338 and BCUN_1552), of which the corresponding genes were shown to
exhibit increased transcription (2.37 fold and 10.42 fold with
p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, respectively) relative to
mono-association conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Thus, on this
substrate both strains appear to co-operate in order to achieve starch
degradation thanks to the collective action of their extracellular amylases,
perhaps resulting in the production of a larger amount of starch-derivatives
compared to that achieved when the strains are cultivated separately on this
substrate. In contrast, when these strains were co-cultivated on xylan, we only
noticed an up-regulation of the gene encoding a beta-xylosidase (BCUN_1638) in
<italic>B. cuniculi</italic>. Similarly, <italic>B. cuniculi</italic> exhibited a modest
transcriptional upregulation of the genes specifying the putative uptake and
degradation machinery for xylose (BCUN_0705-BCUN_0707 and BCUN_1645), whereas
<italic>B. magnum</italic> showed no modulation in the beta-xylosidase-encoding gene,
yet down-regulation of genes involved in xylose transport. The latter findings
suggest that <italic>B. magnum</italic> modulates gene expression in order to support
growth of <italic>B. cuniculi</italic> and allows this latter strain to participate in
xylan degradation and harvesting of the deriving xylose. Since none of these
enzymes are predicted to be extracellular, an alternative explanation for this
behavior is partial degradation of xylan to xylo-oligosaccharides during media
preparation. These degradation products can be the target for specific uptake
transporters, allowing their complete breakdown inside the bacterial cells.
Another scenario was noticed for the co-cultivation of <italic>B.
stellenboschense</italic> and <italic>B. biavatii</italic> grown in the presence of
glycogen, where only the latter strain seems to take advantage of the presence
of the other strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). In fact, under these
circumstances <italic>B. biavatii</italic> substantially enhanced transcription of various
genes encoding enzymes predicted to be involved in the hydrolysis of glycogen
such as predicted glycosyl hydrolases of the GH13 and GH77 families, as well as
a glycogen phosphorylase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast, <italic>B.
stellenboschense</italic> did not reveal any transcriptional modulation of genes
with predicted functions in glycogen utilization when the strains were
co-cultivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Similarly, data concerning
co-cultivation of <italic>B. longum</italic> subsp. <italic>suis</italic> and <italic>B.
thermacidophilum</italic> subsp. <italic>porcinum</italic> on starch is also consistent
with a cross-feeding scenario. In fact, under these growth conditions, qPCR
assays revealed that cell numbers of <italic>B. longum</italic> subsp. <italic>suis</italic> are
enhanced (&#x02265;2 fold) with respect to those noticed when this strain
was cultivated on its own on this substrate. Furthermore, transcriptome analyses
revealed a significant induction (&#x02265;8 fold,
p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) of genes encoding a complete ABC
system involved in the up-take of maltose, which is a starch-derived glycan, of
<italic>B. longum</italic> subsp. <italic>suis</italic> when grown with <italic>B.
thermacidophilum</italic> subsp. <italic>porcinum</italic> in the presence of starch as the
sole carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast, even though the
<italic>B. thermacidophilum</italic> subsp. <italic>porcinum</italic> genome is predicted to
encode a secreted GH13 family enzyme (BPORC_0608), the transcription of genes
predicted to be involved in starch metabolism of <italic>B. thermacidophilum</italic>
subsp. <italic>porcinum</italic> did not appear to be affected by the presence of <italic>B.
longum</italic> subsp. <italic>suis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our findings suggest that bifidobacteria access carbohydrates that are
commonly present in their ecologic niches employing trophic interactions that
may vary from commensalism to mutualistic. Furthermore, these concerted
breakdown activities may similarly exert positive effects on other members of
the gut microbiota and thus promote an expansion of the gut glycobiome.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Bifidobacteria and mammalian gut adaptation</title><p>Bifidobacteria have predominantly been identified in the GIT of mammals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. However, their functional contribution to the microbiota
residing in this body compartment has not been thoroughly investigated. We
therefore looked for the presence of GH-encoding bifidobacterial DNA sequences
among 44 out of 136 available gut metagenome data sets from healthy adults,
enrolled in the Human Microbiome Project<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> that had shown
consistent presence of bifidobacteria based on MetaPhlAn profiling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, as well as in nine metagenomes and related metatranscriptomes
of healthy infant gut microbiota, sequenced by the Broad Institute (NCBI
bioproject ID 63661). The coverage of each gene included in the bifidobacterial
pangenome was computed based on the metagenomic reads with &#x0003e;98%
full-length identity. As displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, the average
abundance of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> genes ranged from 0.2% to 35.9%, with a
distinctly higher prevalence of bifidobacteria in the faecal metagenomes from
infants. This is consistent with the catabolic potential for HMOs.
Interestingly, among the most frequently represented bifidobacterial genes in
the metagenomic data sets from adult, the presence of an extensive repertoire of
GH-encoding genes, such as those specifying GH3, GH13, GH43, GH51 and GH77
(involved in the breakdown of complex plant carbohydrates), is noteworthy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Such findings reinforce the notion that despite the
relative paucity of bifidobacteria detected in the adult human gut, their
functional contribution to the human gut microbiome may be important in terms of
expanding the overall glycobiome of the large intestine, thereby affecting the
overall gut physiology. Furthermore, in the metagenome datasets from infants the
relatively high bifidobacterial abundance is also reflected by the prevalence of
bifidobacterial GH-encoding genes, such as those specifying members of the GH2,
GH20, GH29, GH33, GH36, GH42, GH84, GH95, GH101 and GH112 families, involved in
the degradation of milk-related carbohydrates such as lactose and HMOs, as well
as in mucin degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Notably, GH-specifying
genes encoding &#x003b2;-hexosaminidases, lacto-N-biosidases,
galacto-N-biose/lacto-N-biose phosphorylases, &#x003b1;-L-fucosidases,
sialidases, neuraminidases, N-acetyl &#x003b2;-glucosaminidases,
hyaluronidases and endo-&#x003b1;-N-acetylgalactosaminidases are not
widespread in adult metagenomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Availability of
metatranscriptomes corresponding to the analysed infants&#x02019;
metagenomes revealed pronounced transcription of the bifidobacterial GH gene
predicted to be involved in milk, HMO and mucin degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig.
4</xref>), clearly supporting the key functional roles exploited by these
GHs in the infant gut microbiota.</p><p>To further elucidate the functional contribution of bifidobacteria to the human
microbiota we screened the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets for the
presence of genes encompassing carbohydrate degradation pathways that had been
predicted to be present in the bifidobacterial pan-genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs
1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). Both the adult and infant metagenomes
showed a high abundance of genes for the <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>
phosphoketolase-dependent, or so-called bif shunt, pathway, as expected, as well
as genes involved in galactose degradation I, melibiose degradation, lactose
degradation III, glycogen degradation I, glycogen degradation II and sucrose
degradation IV pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), accompanied by presence
of genes involved in starch degradation V, arabinose degradation I, xylan
degradation and xylose degradation I pathways. The presence of such pathways
illustrates their presumed importance for adaptation of bifidobacteria to the
human gut environment. Interestingly, the infant&#x02019;s
metatranscriptomic datasets correspond to the presence of the bif shunt (as
expected) and pathways for galactose, lactose, glycogen and sucrose degradation,
while no or low transcriptional activity was detected that corresponded to
catalytic pathways for the plant polysaccharides arabinose, xylan and xylose
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), reflecting the paucity of these
carbohydrates in an infant&#x02019;s diet.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Bifidobacteria may be considered as key representatives of the mammalian gut
microbiota, especially during the first phase of their host&#x02019;s life.
However, very little is known about their genetic strategies to colonize and persist
within the gut, and to get access to the nutrients available in this environment.
The current study highlights the very extensive saccharolytic features displayed by
members of the <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> genus, revealing how these bacteria metabolize
specific carbohydrates available in their particular ecological niche. Comparison of
the glycobiome identified in the genus <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> with those identified
in other members of the human gut microbiota revealed their unique and important
contribution in terms of GHs involved in the breakdown of complex plant
carbohydrates such as arabinoxylan, galactan and starch. The impact of
bifidobacteria in the breakdown of dietary carbohydrates is also crucial for the
establishment and reinforcement of trophic relationships between members of the gut
microbiota. In fact, both mutualistic as well as commensal interactions in the
mammalian gut can be carbohydrate-driven<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Here, we have shown how
a simple bifidobacterial community may co-operate between themselves as well as with
other members of the gut microbiota in the utilization of specific glycans, commonly
available in the mammalian gut, by means of cross-feeding activities so as to
provide growth benefits to one or both members of such a community as well as with
the other members of the gut microbiota. Such findings support the concept of the
existence of a social intelligence of bifidobacterial communities in the harvesting
and metabolism of glycans available in their ecological niches, which regulate the
dynamics of the gut microbiota relationships. However, it is reasonable to expect
that in much more complex microbial communities such as those identified in the
mammalian gut, cross-feeding activities as exemplified by bifidobacteria also
involve other members of the gut microbiota, perhaps generating an even larger
beneficial effect. A survey of human gut metagenomic datasets, representing both
adult and infant samples, revealed that, notwithstanding their relatively low
abundance in adults, the functional contribution of bifidobacteria to the enzymatic
arsenal directed at degradation of complex carbohydrates is relevant. In this
context, the expansion of the GH repertoire dedicated to the metabolism of infant
dietary sugars, such as HMOs, as well as mucin is noteworthy. Another clear sign of
advanced bifidobacterial adaptation to its mammalian host is represented by the
identification in a small number of bifidobacterial taxa which include <italic>B.

activities between two bifidobacterial strains, bacteria were co-cultivated on
MRS supplemented with a particular glycan [RS2-resistant starch (Sigma,

sample was further purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation
according to an established method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Quality and integrity of
the RNA was checked by Agilent 2200 Tape Station Nucleic Acid System (Agilent
Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.). One hundred ng of total RNA was used as the
starting input for RNA-Seq library preparation. Briefly, 100&#x02009;ng of
total RNA was treated with Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit for Gram-positive bacteria
(Epicentre, Madison, WI, U.S.A.) to remove rRNA according to the
supplier&#x02019;s instructions. The yield of rRNA depletion was checked by
Agilent 2200 Tape Station Nucleic Acid System (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto,

Technologies, USA) followed by size evaluation using Experion (BioRad, UK).
Whole transcriptome library was constructed using the Ion Total-RNA Seq Kit v2
(Life Technologies, USA). Barcoded libraries were quantified by qRT-PCR and each
library template was amplified on Ion Sphere Particles using Ion One Touch 200
