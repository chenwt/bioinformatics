Here, we present a detailed characterization of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> growth and starvation over a time-course lasting two weeks. We have measured multiple cellular components, including RNA and proteins at deep genomic coverage, as well as lipid modifications and flux through central metabolism. Our study focuses on the physiological response of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> in stationary phase as a result of being starved for glucose, not on the genetic adaptation of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to utilize alternative nutrients. In our analysis, we have taken advantage of the temporal correlations within and among RNA and protein abundances to identify systematic trends in gene regulation. Specifically, we have developed a general computational strategy for classifying expression-profile time courses into distinct categories in an unbiased manner. We have also developed, from dynamic models of gene expression, a framework to characterize protein degradation patterns based on the observed temporal relationships between mRNA and protein abundances. By comparing and contrasting our transcriptomic and proteomic data, we have identified several broad physiological trends in the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> starvation response. Strikingly, mRNAs are widely down-regulated in response to glucose starvation, presumably as a strategy for reducing new protein synthesis. By contrast, protein abundances display more varied responses. The abundances of many proteins involved in energy-intensive processes mirror the corresponding mRNA profiles while proteins involved in nutrient metabolism remain abundant even though their corresponding mRNAs are down-regulated.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Bacteria frequently experience starvation conditions in their natural environments. Yet how they modify their physiology in response to these conditions remains poorly understood. Here, we performed a detailed, two-week starvation experiment in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. We exhaustively monitored changes in cellular components, such as RNA and protein abundances, over time. We subsequently compared and contrasted these measurements using novel computational approaches we developed specifically for analyzing gene-expression time-course data. Using these approaches, we could identify systematic trends in the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> starvation response. In particular, we found that cells systematically limit mRNA and protein production, degrade proteins involved in energy-intensive processes, and maintain or increase the amount of proteins involved in energy production. Thus, the bacteria assume a cellular state in which their ongoing energy use is limited while they are poised to take advantage of any nutrients that may become available.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project was funded by Army Research Office (ARO, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arl.army.mil/">http://www.arl.army.mil/</ext-link>) grant W911NF-12-1-0390, and in part by grants from the NIH, NSF, and Welch Foundation (F1515) to EMM.

However, how these changes affect specific cellular components and processes is not fully known. Existing surveys, even if conducted at the genome scale, tend to have limited completeness, in at least two ways. First, most studies collect only one type of genome-scale data. For example, they either measure changes in gene expression, through RNA or protein levels, or they measure changes in metabolites. Second, technological limitations often prevent the detection of some subset of molecules in a category of interest. For example, small bacterial RNAs with key roles in regulation may be lost from a sample when using typical methods to purify &#x0201c;total&#x0201d; RNA from cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, DNA microarray-based methods for profiling gene expression can only detect specific RNA sequences depending on the design of their probes, whereas RNA-seq transcriptomic methods theoretically recover all RNA species in a sample [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Similarly, in proteomics, 2-D gel electrophoresis approaches typically detect many fewer proteins than newer mass spectrometry based shotgun methods [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, while the short-term changes in cellular physiology that occur in a laboratory culture of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> have been the subject of intensive study, considerably less is known about the changes in cellular composition that occur during the long-term survival of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and other non-spore-forming microbes under starvation, despite the likely prevalence of this condition in nature [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Most studies of this metabolic state have concentrated on the long-term survival of cells in rich medium [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Under these conditions, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> experience an ecological catastrophe in which 90&#x02013;99% of the cells die within a few days due to pH and nutrient changes in the medium, and mutants emerge that continue to divide on the resources released from dead cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Thus, these are studies of genetic adaptation to changed conditions rather than purely of changes in cellular physiology in stressed and starving, but genetically wild-type, cells.</p><p>Finally, most genome-wide analyses of gene regulation focus on comparing differential changes across only two or three distinct environmental conditions or between two different time points. These studies reveal a snapshot of global physiological regulation but they do not provide insight into the underlying dynamics of regulation. By studying the dynamics of gene regulation over time, we can develop an understanding of how a cell&#x02019;s physiology is regulated in the face of a natural environment that may undergo frequent changes.</p><p>Here we performed a time course experiment of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> B REL606 growth and starvation up to two weeks. We used a chemically defined glucose-limited medium in which cells entered a starvation state but did not lose viability for at least one week. We collected genome-wide RNA and protein levels at multiple time points, as well as lipid-modification and central metabolic-flux data, all under identical, controlled experimental conditions. The resultant data set serves as a rich resource for computational models that span and integrate cellular sub-systems and for cataloguing and correlating the responses of specific genes and/or molecules across cellular subsystems during growth and long-term starvation. We analyzed these data using a novel, general approach for unbiased classification of expression time courses. We found that the mRNA pool was drastically reduced during starvation, possibly to limit new protein synthesis overall, and that some proteins declined rapidly in abundance, in proportion to their mRNAs, while others were buffered to rapid changes in their transcripts. Overall, we observed a pattern where starving <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells employ transcriptional and translational/post-translational regulation to limit energy requirements while remaining capable of nutrient uptake and metabolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Controlled measurements of multiple cellular components yield highly reproducible data and unprecedented depth of coverage</title><p>We grew multiple cultures of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> REL606, from the same stock, under identical growth conditions of long-term glucose starvation, in the same medium. The samples were subsequently distributed to different laboratories that measured RNA, protein, lipids, and central metabolic flux ratios. Freezer stocks of the REL606 strain were revived for 24 h, diluted and preconditioned for another 24 h, and diluted again to initiate the experimental time course (<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Each biological replicate was performed on separate days. In a pilot experiment a growth curve was measured to determine informative time points for analysis (<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).

Additionally, cell viability remained constant after entry to stationary phase at 24 h for up to one week.

For both, we found that measurements from separate biological replicates correlated highly with each other. We saw Spearman correlations of 0.92, 0.92, and 0.95 between biological repeats of raw proteomics counts and correlations of 0.93, 0.93, and 0.94 for raw RNA-seq counts between the 3 h biological replicates (<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, we also compared the overlap in protein IDs between the first three time points (3, 4, and 5 hrs), when the cells were exponentially dividing and the protein concentrations were more-or-less at steady state, and we found a high overlap among these time points. Each single time point yielded just over 2600 protein IDs, any pair yielded just over 2300 common protein IDs, and all three time points yield over 2100 overlapping protein IDs (<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Thus, our measurements were highly reproducible.</p><p>We next compared how many different RNA and protein species we detected compared to previous 'multi-omic' studies (<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Yoon et al. used 2D gels and microarrays to measure 60 significantly changing proteins and 4,144 mRNAs in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> REL606, the same strain used in this study [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. By comparison, at 3&#x02013;4 h, we observed over 2,600 proteins, with ~1,200 that changed significantly at some point in the time course, along with 4,116 mRNAs, 85 tRNAs, and 89 other noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), a category that is largely made up of small RNAs. Even though the total number of proteins Yoon et al. observed at early exponential phase was not reported [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], it was likely an order of magnitude less than our observations, if it followed the same pattern as the proteins found to have significant changes in expression.

To perform <italic>K</italic>-means clustering, an arbitrary choice for the number of clusters must be made such that the profiles are well separated into groups with unique and distinct behaviors. (We also developed an alternative classification approach that does not depend on such an arbitrary choice, see below.) We varied the number of clusters for both mRNA and protein profiles, and we found the best clustering performance, assessed by visual inspection, to be around 15 clusters for the mRNA profiles and 25 clusters for the protein profiles. Thus, the mRNAs appeared to respond in a more uniform manner than the proteins did.

After this transitional period of entry to a starved state, the transcription profiles remained relatively constant, with only minor changes in expression.

New protein synthesis could be globally limited in at least three ways: by reducing the amounts of rRNAs, charged tRNAs, or mRNAs. To understand how these different RNA pools changed relative to each other, we calculated the relative amount of mRNA, tRNA, ncRNA, and rRNA present in both ribosome depleted and non-ribosome depleted samples (<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). In the non-ribosomal depleted case the fraction of rRNA changed very little throughout the course of the experiment while the tRNA fraction increased and the mRNA fraction decreased. In the ribosome depleted samples (in which we removed residual rRNA counts due to incomplete depletion before analysis), the tRNA fraction also increased as the mRNA fraction decreased, confirming that this effect was not due to sensitivity or sampling-bias issues resulting from rRNA dominating the RNA pool in the non-ribosome depleted sample.</p><p>We would like to emphasize that the above clustering of the RNA and protein abundances were performed independently of each other.

We also expected a correlation within individual time courses between the relative levels of a protein and its transcript.

We considered two limiting cases: At one extreme we assumed each protein had a degradation rate slower than the time scale of the experiment. At the other extreme we assumed each protein was degraded on a time scale that was fast compared to the time scale of the experiment. In the first limiting case proteins integrate their transcript levels over time. In the second limiting case (relative) protein levels track with their (relative) transcript level.

In this approach the patterning that comes from hierarchical clustering can be arbitrary, depending on the level of the hierarchy one chooses to focus on. Here, instead, we sought to sort the time courses into general behaviors in an unbiased manner. To accomplish this goal we fit each individual mRNA and protein to a piecewise continuous curve (<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig</xref>). This curve was defined by four free time parameters and three free amplitude parameters.

Up-regulated proteins were, like the up-regulated transcripts, involved in carbohydrate catabolism but also included terms involved in stress response and metabolism of glycerol.

However, during our time course, transcript levels of PagP and PhoP did not change significantly. Furthermore, neither PagP nor PhoP was observed at the protein level. In the case of PagP, this could be due to the difficulty in detecting outer membrane beta-barrel proteins by our mass-spec proteomics method. With respect to phospholipid modification, CFA synthase protein levels increased between 3&#x02013;6 h before decreasing again. This observation agreed with prior data showing that CFA synthase was important during the transition to stationary phase [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

As cells ceased to divide, the demand for new protein synthesis declined. Reducing the overall pool of mRNA could contribute to limiting new protein synthesis. Upon entry to stationary phase, lipid A and phospholipids were modified by PagP and CFA synthetase, respectively (<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). Modification of lipids continued gradually until eventually the lipid species that were rare during growth dominated at two weeks.</p><fig id="pcbi.1004400.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004400.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Summary of key results.</title><p>(A) Cells are starved around 6&#x02013;8 h after the initiation of growth, and the cell viability (and OD<sub>600</sub>) remained constant up until at least one week. At two weeks, however, there was a decrease of 38% in viability. (B) The relative fraction of rRNA (compared to all RNA) stayed fairly constant through the entire time course, as did the fraction of tRNA (in non-rRNA depleted samples). On the other hand, relative levels of mRNA decreased upon entry to stationary phase perhaps as a strategy for reducing overall protein synthesis. As a reference we also analyzed RNA fractions for the rRNA-depleted samples, to demonstrate that this reduction of mRNA levels was not simply due to the low relative counts of mRNA compared to rRNA in the nondepleted samples. Note that the rRNA-depleted samples still contained residual amounts of rRNA, as shown. (C) Phospholipids and lipid A were modified in a manner consistent with the activation of stress responses. Modifications began early in the stationary phase and slowly increased during the time course for up to two weeks. (D) Transcriptional changes (measured by mRNAs) separated into at least two temporal domains, before and after stationary phase. A possible third region corresponded to late transcriptional changes observed at two weeks. All changes in regulation had begun by 10 h. At this point stress response genes were up-regulated and energy intensive processes were down-regulated. (E) Approximately 20% of the measured protein levels were proportional to their transcript levels over time while 15% of the protein levels integrated their transcript&#x02019;s response over the entire duration of the experiment. This observation highlights that differences in post-transcriptional regulation, such as protein degradation, cause differences in regulation between mRNAs and their expressed proteins.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1004400.g006"/></fig><p>All genes started to change in expression by 10 h, and mRNA expression clustered temporally into two regimes, before and after 10 h (cells entered a starved state at around 8 h) with some late changes in expression beginning around two weeks (<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). We found that 20% of observed proteins were regulated in proportion to their transcripts (<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>), allowing for rapid down-regulation of the processes they were involved in. On the other hand, 15% of the observed proteins were integrally related to their transcripts (<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>) and likely served to buffer against environmental changes. In addition to measuring and characterizing RNA and protein changes upon entry to stationary phase, we also demonstrated how a piecewise curve-fitting strategy allowed us to classify expression profiles into different categories. The enriched terms in the resulting classification were reasonably aligned with what was known about, or at least consistent with, cells coping with starvation (<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). Importantly, this classification was accomplished in an unbiased manner, without any ad hoc assumptions about the number of clusters that should exist in the data.</p><p>We found that, as cells entered a starved state, the total pool of mRNA was depleted compared to all other RNAs and many individual transcripts were down-regulated, possibly as part of a broader strategy to reduce the production of new protein. Reducing overall protein production could also be achieved by limiting the available ribosomes or by limiting the pool of available tRNA. The stringent response, activated in starving cells through the ppGpp alarmone, down-regulates new rRNA synthesis [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, in our data, the relative fraction of rRNA within a cell changed little over time, and the tRNA fraction actually increased with time. Thus, new protein synthesis in starving cells may be limited more by the reduced mRNA pool than by reduced translational efficiency due to decreases in rRNA or tRNA abundance. Even if the total rRNA decreased over the time course, the total mRNA would have decreased more by a proportional amount. Said another way, the down-regulation of new rRNA synthesis by the stringent response may be most important for shutting down the production of ribosomes needed by new cells in an actively dividing culture, rather than for reducing the level of ribosomes in already existing cells.</p><p>It has been suggested that the degradation rate of many proteins in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> is much slower than the doubling time during growth [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As a consequence, when cells cease to divide, such as in the case of glucose starvation, not all proteins can respond immediately to possible changes in transcript levels. In effect, the amounts of some proteins may be buffered against relatively fast changes in nutrient availability. At the same time certain proteins may need to be rapidly regulated to ensure survival upon starvation. We found that a subset of the proteome, ~20% of proteins, fell into the rapidly regulated category that may be degraded quickly&#x02014;they maintained an abundance that was proportional to their transcripts. Another subset, ~15% of proteins, tended to be much more stable&#x02014;they were proportional to the integrated abundance of their transcripts over the time scale of our experiment. For example, the abundance of several flagellar proteins was proportional to their transcript levels, whereas proteins involved in metabolism and energy production integrated their transcript levels over time. Turning off proteins involved in cell division and the flagellar machinery, both energy-intensive processes, needs to happen relatively quickly. By contrast, the proteins that were relatively stable were enriched for energy production terms. Thus, these proteins presumably persist so that if nutrients were to become available again the cell will be capable of using them to re-initiate growth. For proteins to track dynamically with their transcripts they must have a short half-life. For this reason, we can compare those terms enriched for proteins that dynamically correlate with their transcripts to the COG terms reported by Maier et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] that have shorter than average half lives in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>. We found that those COG terms with shorter than average half-lives were generally consistent with terms that were enriched in highly dynamically correlated proteins and mRNAs. In particular, Maier et al. found that terms involved with energy production (COG term C), metabolism (COG terms H, I, G), protein turnover (COG term O), and signaling (COG term T) had protein turnover rates significantly faster than the overall average.</p><p>Among the terms that were significantly regulated in stationary phase, we saw that motility was down-regulated, likely because it places a high energy burden on cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Additionally, it has been shown that flagella in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> are down-regulated by the stringent response [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Other observed differential regulation is related to energy conservation (shutting down expensive or unneeded pathways), catabolism (breaking down non-essential components for food), stopping translation of new protein (as there is no longer demand for protein from new cells), or a general stress response (increasing nutrient influx or bolstering membrane integrity).</p><p>We also found many uncharacterized genes (both among the protein and the RNA profiles) that were significantly up- or down-regulated upon entry to stationary phase. A subset of these proteins have computationally predicted functions [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] that were consistent with our findings for annotated genes. For instance, several uncharacterized proteins that were up-regulated are predicted to be involved in stress response and cell-wall biogenesis. Other predictions seem to be inconsistent with our observations for annotated genes or indicate that these genes regulate rather than take part in these processes. For example, some uncharacterized proteins that were up-regulated are predicted to be involved in translation, even though translation was heavily enriched in down-regulated genes. These uncharacterized genes might down-regulate the activity of ribosomes, for example. Lists of proteins and transcripts that were significantly regulated in our time course are provided in the Supplemental materials (<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004400.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> Tables).</p><p>Even though mRNA abundances within an operon were highly correlated (as expected), in many cases their protein profiles were only weakly correlated. This finding could be due to different translation efficiencies between proteins [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] as well as differing degradation rates. In support of the former, we saw a tendency for proteins separated by a larger distance within a transcript to be less correlated than those located closer to one another. However, it was likely that different protein degradation rates also played a role in the low correlation between proteins within an operon. Indeed, many proteins coded by proximal regions of a transcript showed poor correlation in their profiles (<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Other explanations for this tendency of proteins nearby on the genome to be more highly correlated could be due to distance from the transcript start site or transcript length. Yet, our data did not show evidence for either of these scenarios. Distance from the transcript start site was not correlated with protein expression (&#x003c1; = &#x02013;0.02, <italic>P</italic> = 0.65) and transcript length was only very weakly correlated with protein expression (&#x003c1; = 0.12, <italic>P</italic> = 0.003). However, we cannot necessarily rule out other explanations for the observed intra-operon protein correlation vs. distance between genes.</p><p>In addition to the expected disparities between RNA and protein levels, we also observed surprising changes in enzyme activity that did not correspond to the respective RNA-seq and proteomics analysis. For example, we saw striking levels of lipid modification late during the time course. These modifications were easily explained by their association with adaptation to stressful environments such as depleted nutrients and cations as well as increased acid resistance during starvation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the stark differences in RNA, protein, and activity trends of the enzymes responsible for the lipid modifications, PagP and CFA synthase, highlight the fact that activation does not necessarily follow abundance measurements. In support of this idea, it has been shown that cylopropination by CFA synthase depends upon the concentration of bicarbonate, which could lead to a decoupling between protein levels and activation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Metabolic fluxes were quite constant throughout the growth phase of the experiment, and these labeling patterns remained in place once growth ceased. At the two-week time point, however, the labeling patterns in histidine changed substantially, which during steady-state growth on glucose would have been interpreted as a change in the flux ratio corresponding to P5P from the G6P lower branch declining. This change so late in the experiment was unexpected, since we did not anticipate substantial turnover in cellular composition that late in stationary phase. The observation suggests that either internal amino acid recycling or some <italic>de novo</italic> amino-acid synthesis, possibly related to the moderate decline in the number of viable cells, occurs past the one week time point.</p><p>A goal of systems biology has been to understand how phenotype originates from genotype. The phenotype of a cell is determined by complex regulation of processes including cell signaling, gene regulation, metabolism, and lipid biochemistry. Understanding the connection between phenotype and genotype is crucial to understanding disease and for synthetic engineering of biology. Even though computational models of individual component subsystems, such as flux models of metabolism [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], have enjoyed a long history of success, they remain limited in their application. Much effort is currently being spent on understanding how to best integrate data from multiple subsystems. For example, there are many proposed approaches to combining gene expression with metabolic flux networks [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] while other studies have focused on integrative, whole-cell models [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Given the growing interest in integrative modeling approaches, there is a pressing need for studies that collect high quality genome-wide data across multiple cellular subsystems from the same biological samples. Our data set is a rich resource for comparing and contrasting the response of multiple cellular subsystems. Additionally, in the future we plan to use the techniques developed in this paper to measure the response of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to several other environmental conditions, which will allow for more detailed models of regulation.</p><p>Despite the completeness and quality of our data set, however, there were a few key limitations concerning our approach. Our analysis via RNA-seq and shotgun MS allowed for high confidence when comparing the relative levels of a particular transcript or protein over time. However, due to potential differences in detection efficiency between individual RNAs or peptides, care should be taken when comparing absolute abundances. In our analysis we used the APEX method to account for differences in protein detection efficiency. We normalized RNA by the length of a transcript as an estimate of RNA detection efficiency, for a particular experiment. This approach resulted in a correlation coefficient of ~0.71 between proteins and their transcripts, a finding on the high end for such correlation measurements. Previous reports on the correlation between mRNA and protein levels in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> have yielded correlation coefficients of ~0.5 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, even straightforward means of correcting our experimental bias led to reasonable comparisons of levels between individual RNAs or proteins. Additional detection biases we did not account for, such as GC content bias in RNA-seq [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], were likely responsible for some of the remaining unexplained variation [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>The stepwise linear function we used for modeling works for a majority of our expression profiles. However, in some cases it over-fits the data and in other cases the function is unable to capture the underlying behavior. An example of a profile that may be under-constrained is a gene that is up- or down-regulated without further changes to expression. In this case the free time parameters <italic>t</italic>
<sub>2</sub> through <italic>t</italic>
<sub>4</sub>, along with amplitude parameter <italic>A</italic>
<sub>2</sub>, may be under-constrained. Even in this case, however, the parameters <italic>t</italic>

<sub>2</sub>+<italic>t</italic>
<sub>3</sub>+<italic>t</italic>
<sub>4</sub>, <italic>A</italic>
<sub>1</sub>, and <italic>A</italic>
<sub>3</sub> are still well constrained, providing enough information to reliably sort the profiles based upon behavior. Thus, since we used our model for classification and not for prediction purposes, any potential parameter over-fitting did not substantially affect our final results. More complicated temporal profiles, such as multiple peaks separated in time, could not be captured by our function. The presence of these more complicated behaviors was rare enough as to not warrant special consideration.</p><p>In summary, our study provides both the most complete measurement, to our knowledge, of multiple cellular components in a changing environment, and novel computational approaches to analyze such data. Thus, this work represents an important step toward understanding how regulation of a cell&#x02019;s physiology is coordinated, on a global, systems level, by interactions between multiple cellular subsystems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Cell growth</title><p>

Peptides were loaded onto an Acclaim C18 PepMap RSLC column (Dionex; Thermo Scientific) and eluted using a 5&#x02013;40% acetonitrile gradient over 250 min at 300 nl/min flow rate. Eluted peptides were directly injected into an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) by nano-electrospray and subject to data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry, with full precursor ion scans (MS1) collected at 60,0000 resolution. Monoisotopic precursor selection and charge-state screening were enabled, with ions of charge &#x0003e;+1 selected for collision-induced dissociation (CID). Up to 20 fragmentation scans (MS2) were collected per MS1. Dynamic exclusion was active with 45 s exclusion for ions selected twice within a 30 s window.</p><p>Spectra were searched against an <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain REL606 protein sequence database and common contaminant proteins (MaxQuant using SEQUEST (Proteome Discoverer 1.4; Thermo Scientific)). Fully-tryptic peptides were considered, with up to two missed cleavages. Tolerances of 10 ppm (MS1) and 0.5 Da (MS2), carbamidomethylation of cysteine as static modification, and oxidized methionine as dynamic modification were used. High-confidence peptide-spectral matches (PSMs) were filtered at &#x0003c;1% false discovery rate determined by Percolator (Proteome Discoverer 1.4; Thermo Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Flux analysis</title><p>Flux ratios were obtained from the samples grown with <sup>13</sup>C labeled glucose, using methods previously described [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

To the hydrolyzed cell material we added 40 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF) and gently mixed until a &#x0201c;light straw&#x0201d; color was obtained.

Each time point was analyzed separately, and the reported fluxes represent the integral of growth up until that point. For this reason, we do not display fluxes beyond 8 h, when growth ceased and there should not be any more net amino acid synthesis. We did, however, monitor the labeling patterns in all amino acids for the later time points. Although most patterns were unchanged, we did note that histidine labeling changed substantially at the final time point of two weeks.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Lipid analysis</title><p>Lipid A and phospholipids were isolated from bacterial pellets containing 3&#x02013;9&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> cells.

Initially, proteins with low counts (&#x0003c;10) over the entire duration of the time course were filtered out. Each time point was then normalized to the read depth (e.g. the sum of all counts for that particular time point). Only proteins with a fold change of &#x02265;1.5 were considered for further analysis. Protein profiles were then normalized to the maximum value for a given protein time course. To estimate the absolute protein abundance we made use of the APEX normalization method [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>To analyze relative RNA levels, raw RNA read counts per gene (ignoring rRNAs) were normalized within each sample using DESeq [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To identify RNAs that had changed significantly, we carried out a differential expression analysis between the 3 h time point and each subsequent time point, using DESeq, and we kept RNAs with a significant difference (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) at least one time point for further analysis. To compare absolute RNA abundances within a single time point, raw RNA counts were normalized by gene length. Finally, normalized RNA and protein profiles, both relative and absolute, were averaged across all three biological replicates.</p><p>Clustering of protein profiles was performed using the python library scipy [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. We used the <italic>k</italic>-means clustering algorithm with the number of protein clusters set to 25 and RNA clusters to 15. To compare relative protein profiles with the integral of their relative transcript levels we integrated each of the transcript profiles, from the initial time to each additional time point, using the trapezoidal method implemented by the python library numpy [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>We used a piecewise continuous curve to fit both RNA and protein profiles. This curve was defined by seven free parameters, four free time parameters, and three free amplitude parameters. To fit the profiles we used a custom implementation of a differential evolution (DE) algorithm [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Briefly, the DE algorithm initially generates an ensemble of random parameter guesses within a predefined range; subsequently, vectors of individual parameter sets (sometimes called agents) are mixed together at a predefined crossover rate, only those crossover events that yield a smaller error (defined by a predefined cost function) are kept, and the process is iterated until a convergence criterion is met. In our fits we used an ensemble of 15 agents with a crossover frequency of 0.75 and a mixing strength of 0.6. The crossover frequency determines the probability that an agent will be changed at any given iteration and the mixing strength determines how large a change an agent undergoes if it was chosen to be altered. The crossover frequency and mixing strength were picked based upon an empirical study of the dependence of convergence efficiency on these parameters [<xref rid="pcbi.1004400.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] for some standard optimization problems.

Scaling by the standard deviation places a relatively lower weight on data points with relatively larger errors for a given protein or mRNA.</p><p>Some of the profiles may be slightly over-fit by our curve (e.g. profiles that are up-regulated or down-regulated once during the time course without further modulation of expression).

The four categories we used were that of up-regulated, down-regulated, transiently up-regulated, and transiently down-regulated. Genes that were up (or down) regulated were those genes that increased (or decreased) at some point during the time course and did not decrease (or increase) at some later time. Genes that were transiently up (or down) regulated were those genes that increased (or decreased) at some point during the time course but decreased (or increased) at some later time. The sorting into categories was aided by our estimate of the distribution of parameters that allowed for a good fit within the population of fits. A fit was considered good if it was on average (across the time course) one standard deviation or less away from the experimental average.</p><p>We used the DAVID database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov">david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov</ext-link>) to perform Gene Ontology term enrichment on each subset of sorted genes: up-regulated, down-regulated, transiently up-regulated, and transiently down-regulated. Specifically we made use of DAVID's API, instead of the web interface, to generate the GO-enrichment through a python script. GO terms were clustered based upon genes in a given term to reduce redundancy in the returned results.</p><p>As a complementary approach we also enriched for KEGG pathway terms in the entire set of significantly changing proteins (without presorting) using the DAVID database API. The protein levels within each returned KEGG pathway were then averaged to see if there was any consistent response across the entire pathway.
