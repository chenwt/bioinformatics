To date, however, the evidence from plant systems is mixed as to whether patterns of DNA methylation vary significantly among tissues and, if so, whether these differences affect tissue-specific gene expression. To address these questions, we analyzed both bisulfite sequence (BSseq) and transcriptomic sequence data from three biological replicates of two tissues (leaf and floral bud) from the model grass species <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>. Our first goal was to determine whether tissues were more differentiated in DNA methylation than explained by variation among biological replicates. Tissues were more differentiated than biological replicates, but the analysis of replicated data revealed high (&#x0003e;50%) false positive rates for the inference of differentially methylated sites (DMSs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Comparing methylation to gene expression, we found that differential CG methylation consistently covaried negatively with gene expression, regardless as to whether methylation was within genes, within their promoters or even within their closest transposable element. The relationship between gene expression and either CHG or CHH methylation was less consistent. In total, CG methylation in promoters explained 9% of the variation in tissue-specific expression across genes, suggesting that CG methylation is a minor but appreciable factor in tissue differentiation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>KR was supported by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, National Research Service Award EB009418 from the University of California, Irvine, Center for Complex Biological Systems.

Epigenetic modifications include histone variants but also DNA methylation. In plants, the methylation of cytosines occurs in three sequence contexts: CG, CHG and CHH, where H = A, C or T. All three contexts are usually methylated in repetitive sequences, which serves to limit the transcription and proliferation of transposable elements (TEs) [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Genes are often also methylated, but typically only in the CG context [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The function of this gene-body methylation (gbM) is not yet clear, but potential functions include the exclusion of histone H2A.Z [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], control of aberrant intragenic expression [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], protection from transposable element (TE) insertion [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and facilitation of intron-exon splicing [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>DNA methylation has long been hypothesized to have a direct effect on gene regulation during development [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. With the growing availability of single base resolution methylation data, like bisulfite sequencing (BSseq) data, this hypothesis has been tested directly. In humans, for example, DNA methylation varies dramatically throughout development, and this variation is often correlated with gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In plants, the available evidence suggests that methylation levels vary for highly specialized tissues, such as the endosperm and the pollen vegetative nucleus [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and that this methylation variation likely contributes to genetic imprinting and trans-generational silencing of TEs [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Outside of these few specialized tissues, a clear picture has not yet emerged as to whether methylation commonly varies among plant tissues and, if so, whether methylation variation contributes to tissue-specific gene expression (GE). Some evidence suggests that most plant tissues do not vary substantially in DNA methylation. For example, genome-wide profiling in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) identified few DNA methylation differences between shoot and root, and only a few additional differences in CHH methylation between these two tissues and the embryo [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, a survey of several <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> accessions found that tissue-specific variation in methylation was much less pronounced than genetic variation, leading the authors to conclude that &#x0201c;&#x02026;DNA methylation is less dynamic than gene expression patterns in plants and only plays a role during specific stages of development or cell type, such as companion cells&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to these studies, there is some emerging evidence that differential methylation may play a role in tissue specific GE. For example, researchers have detected ~2000 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) among four soybean tissues, and a subset of these DMRs correlate with tissue-specific GE of ~60 genes [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Similarly, analysis of tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns in <italic>Sorghum bicolor [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</italic>, <italic>Populus tichocarpa</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> ssp. <italic>mays</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] hint that epigenetic variation among vegetative tissues correlates with tissue-specific expression. However, not all of these studies have measured methylation at single-base resolution, which greatly limits the ability to draw firm conclusions; the number of contrasts of methylation between plant tissues is growing, but such studies remain rare.</p><p>Methodological differences among studies have also made conclusions difficult. For example, few methylation studies have employed biological replication, and thus it is usually unclear whether methylation variation between tissues exceeds the statistical variation expected from within a single sampled tissue. Even when the data are at single-base resolution, studies have used different summaries of the data as the basis for inferences, and this has caused confusion. Some studies have focused on summarizing methylation for genomic features like genes and TEs [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Other studies have focused on DMRs as a summary of the data. DMRs were initially defined as stretches of DNA sequence for which methylation differences between samples were higher than expected at random [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While the initial definition of DMRs is straightforward and meaningful, more recent studies have used empirical means, such as sliding windows, to identify DMRs, and these empirical definitions vary from study to study [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As a result, the interpretation and meaning of DMRs varies among studies, compromising the value of inferences.</p><p>This study is focused ultimately on the question of whether DNA methylation and GE covary between tissues. To that end, we have measured both DNA methylation and gene expression between two tissues (leaves and floral buds) of <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> (brachypodium), a grass species that has served as a model for genomic studies [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. While our ultimate goal is to assess methylation and GE, our proximal goals include an empirical assessment of the effects of replication both on inferring methylation differentiation between tissues and on the impact of summary methods (i.e., DMRs vs. single-base metrics) on inferences. Overall, we find the two tissue samples to be significantly different in DNA methylation patterns, but we also find that the false positive rate without replication is high (&#x0003e;50%). In all respects, DMRs are less useful than single-base or regional measures in our empirical analyses. Altogether, we find that CG methylation and GE covary between tissues, explaining up to 9% of variation in gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec003"><title>DNA Methylation within and between tissue samples</title><p>To assess methylation variation, we utilized BSseq data from a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] that generated reads from three biological replicates of two tissues: leaf and immature flower buds. We denoted the leaf replicates as L1, L2 and L3 and the floral bud replicates as F1, F2 and F3. The data had conversion error rates of &#x0003c;1.3% for each replicate [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>](<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150002.s005">S1 Table</xref>). Following the previous study, we mapped BSseq reads to the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> genome and tallied only uniquely mapping reads. Each replicate yielded ~15X of mapped coverage, such that each tissue had ~45X coverage per base, on average [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, no plant DNA methylation papers have assessed whether tissue-specific variation exceeds that expected from proper biological replication. To assess this question, we first tested for a signal of differentiation between two BSseq datasets at single nucleotide sites, which we call <underline>D</underline>ifferentially <underline>M</underline>ethylated <underline>S</underline>ites (DMSs). To identify DMSs, we required a minimum coverage of 3 reads for each site in each tissue and then applied Fisher&#x02019;s Exact Test (FET) [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Methods</xref>). There were many DMSs between two biological replicates from the same tissue. For example, there were 218,631 DMSs between L1 and L2 and an average of ~250,000 DMSs between two leaf replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). However, DMSs were more abundant between replicates from different tissues, with an average of ~324,000 differential sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The average number of DMSs was significantly higher for between-tissue vs. intra-tissue comparisons (permutation, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01), indicating that the tissue samples were significantly differentiated.</p><fig id="pone.0150002.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0150002.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>The inferred number of DMSs and DMRs between replicates.</title><p>A) The upper matrix reports the number of DMSs between two BSseq replicates.

Using the combined replicates from each tissue, FET analyses identified 500,245 DMSs. Following a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we assumed these 500,245 DMSs to be our best estimate of &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; DMSs between tissues and found that this true set rarely overlapped in location with DMSs that were identified between replicates within a tissue; typically &#x0003c;5% of within-tissue DMSs overlapped with the true set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In contrast, the overlap was more significant, at 15.6% on average, between the true set and DMSs identified between replicates from different tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). These percentages define genetic distances between two BSseq replicates that can then be used for clustering analyses. A neighbor-joining analysis clearly separated replicates from different tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), further supporting the contention that the two tissue samples differ in DNA methylation beyond that expected from sampling.</p><p>The 15.6% average amount of overlap between the &#x02018;true&#x02019; set of DMSs and the DMSs based on single replicates likely reflects, in part, lower statistical power for the single replicates. It is interesting to note, however, that comparisons between single-replicates also yield high false-positive rates (FPRs), which cannot be an artifact of higher statistical power with combined data. For example, the comparison of L3 and F3 replicates yielded 368,643 DMSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Of these, 92,989 (or 18.6%) overlapped with the set of true DMSs; hence, 81.4% of the DMSs identified between these two replicates were not supported by the larger, combined data set. In other words, had we relied on a single replicate from each tissue for this study, &#x0003e;80% of our inferences would have been incorrect relative to more extensive data. In theory, the high FPR can be reduced either by increasing the stringency of the FET or by adjusting the FET for multiple-tests, but these adjustments do not help in this case. For example, when we focused on the L3 vs. F3 comparison and applied a false discovery rate (FDR) correction at <italic>q</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, we found 10,435 DMSs compared to 368,643 without FDR adjustment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). However, none of these DMSs overlapped with the true set, yielding an FPR of 100%.</p><p>A potential advantage of studying DMRs, as opposed to DMSs, is that they summarize signals over contiguous sites, and it is thus possible that they reduce the FPR. As we have noted, the definition of a DMR varies widely among studies; here we focused on the original definition to define DMRs as a region of non-random differentiation between samples [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To determine expectations under &#x02018;randomness&#x02019;, we permutated cytosine methylation states throughout the genome (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Materials &#x00026; Methods</xref>); permutations indicated that &#x02265; 5 DMSs in a row were 1.3% of those expected at random (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150002.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Accordingly, we defined a DMR as &#x02265; 5 DMSs in a row that had a consistent direction of methylation bias (i.e., hypomethylated in one or the other tissue). These DMRs contain 2,672 DMSs, which is a small percentage (0.5%) of the total set of 500,245 DMSs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150002.t001">Table 1</xref>), indicating that DMSs are rarely

Those sites that are not DMSs or CMSs either lack evidence of methylation in both tissues or do not have a significant FET.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>With this definition, we again observed more DMRs between tissues (187, on average) than within tissues (59, on average)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), and this difference was again statistically significant (permutation, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). By combining data (L1+L2+L3 vs. F1+F2+F3), we inferred a &#x02018;true&#x02019; set of 448 DMRs with an average size of 38.4 bp, a minimum length of 5.00 bp and a maximum length of 522 bp. For DMRs, 1.0% of within-tissue DMRs overlapped on average with the true set, whereas 6.9% of between-tissue DMRs overlapped with the true set on average. These distances again separated the tissues in clustering analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), verifying significant tissue differentiation. However, the between-tissue FPR based on single BSseq replicates was consistently higher for DMRs than for DMSs, with a <italic>minimum</italic> FPR of 89.2%. In other words, ~80% or more of our DMR inferences were incorrect for contrasts between single replicates relative to the more extensive dataset.</p><p>This raises the question as to why the FPR is so high and whether our observations are unique. To answer the latter question, to our knowledge only one other study of plants has used biological replication for BSseq data to compare methylation between <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lyrata</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. (At least one other paper replicated their control but not experimental samples [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].) In the <italic>Arabidopsi</italic>s paper, the authors used replication to help filter the number sites for testing, thus reducing the multiple test problem and increasing statistical power. They did not, however, explicitly report on the level of within vs. between tissue differences. To address the former question, the FPR may be high for technical, statistical and/or biological reasons. Technically, BSseq data are subject to conversion error, but conversion errors are unlikely to explain our observations because coverage is high and conversion error is low. Statistically, it is easy to envision that the FET may signal numerous false-positives, but the FPR remains high for DMSs when the FET is FDR corrected [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], as noted above. Finally, biological variation among replicates may contribute to the FPR, both because tissue samples are likely to include mixtures of different cell types that vary in proportion among replicates [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and also because it is likely that there is heterogeneity in methylation levels even among cells of a single type [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We thus suspect, but cannot prove, that the largest contribution to variation among replicates is biological in origin.</p><p>Our FPR calculations deserve two further comments. First, the FPR calculations rely on the assumption that the set of &#x02018;true&#x02019; DMSs and DMRs are defined by our analysis of combined data. This assumption cannot hold fully because there must be false-positives in the combined data, but the FPR rate of the combined data are difficult to assess. Second, we note that as levels of methylation differentiation become more pronounced, the signal:noise ratio will also increase. Thus, our data reflect the importance of replication for contrasts between tissues in the same species; however, it may not be as useful to replicate data that are designed to summarize broad-scale differences in methylation patterns between distantly related species [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Differences in methylation patterns between tissues</title><p>Given that we found tissue-specific differentiation between leaves and floral buds, we sought to categorize the pattern of methylation differences, both in terms of cytosine contexts and genomic locations. For these results, we based all analyses on combined leaf (L1+L2+L3) and floral (F1+F2+F3) data, following [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Our first finding was that the two tissue samples were more similar than different in their methylation patterns. To reach this conclusion, we identified sites with conserved methylation between the two tissues&#x02013;i.e., Conserved Methylated Sites (CMSs). To be a CMS, a site required the support of a binomial test [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] at a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.05 in both tissue samples. Overall, we found that 18,780,682 cytosines were methylated in both tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g002">Fig 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150002.t001">Table 1</xref>), representing 18.7% of the 100,229,480 genomic cytosines in the proper context for methylation (i.e., CG, CHG or CHH). Among CMSs, most (62.7%) were in the CG context, with an appreciable minority in the CHG context (29.8%) and relatively few in the CHH context (7.5%). Overall, the set of CMSs and DMSs were mutually exclusive, and there were 37-fold more CMSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g002">Fig 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150002.t001">Table 1</xref>).

Cytosines were most commonly methylated in the CG context, but 56.5% (282,440 sites) of DMS sites occurred in the CHG context (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150002.t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). To investigate further, we estimated the DMS &#x02018;rate&#x02019; by comparing the observed number of DMSs to the available number of cytosines in a particular context. For example, there were 19,722,162 cytosines in the CHG context throughout the genome and a total of 282,440 DMSs, yielding a rate of 1.43% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150002.t001">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, CG and CHH methylation had lower rates, at 0.55% and 0.17%, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150002.t001">Table 1</xref>). CHH methylation may not be as differentiated in part because the overall proportion of methylated CHH sites was much lower than CG or CHG sites. Interestingly, the direction of DMSs was biased, because 57% were methylated in floral buds but not leaf, representing a deviation from the expectation of equality (binomial, p&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup>).</p><p>Our observation that variability between tissues was highest at CHG sites is similar to comparisons among rice tissues [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and among somaclonal variants of oil palm [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Similarly, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> species tissue-specific differences were attributable to CHH and CHG methylation changes within DMRs [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, CG methylation varies more than CHH or CHG methylation among tomato developmental stages [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and also between generations of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thalian</italic>a mutation accumulation lines [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Thus, the principle context of DNA methylation variability varies either as a function of species or the tissues sampled.</p><p>Having assessed the effect of context, we shifted our attention to three genomic features of interest: genes, promoters and transposable elements (TEs). Among the three features, the set of 68,264 non-genic, annotated TEs had the highest CMS rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), as was expected from previous studies of plant genomes [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], with methylation levels of 95.3% at CG sites and 64.4% at CHG sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150002.t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). That said, TEs also had the highest DMS rates, at 2.62% in the CHG context (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150002.t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). CHH methylation levels were low (&#x0003c;5%) throughout TEs, as noted previously for the entire brachypodium genome [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In contrast to TEs, the 26,072 annotated genes had the lowest DMS rate at 0.18% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150002.t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), but this low rate may reflect the fact that genes were primarily methylated in the CG context, which had the lowest DMS rates. Promoter regions, which were defined as 1.0 kb 5&#x02019; upstream of the 26,072 genes, had noticeably higher levels of conserved CHG methylation between tissues (at 14.5%) than genes (3.46%), but were similar to genes in most other respects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g002">Fig 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150002.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Given that CMSs and DMSs were especially prominent in TEs, it was not surprising that the distribution of CMSs and DMSs across chromosomes mimicked the density of TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150002.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), and there was no obvious correlation between CMSs and DMSs with gene density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g002">Fig 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150002.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Altogether, the analysis of single sites paints a clear picture: most methylation occurred in TEs and most variation between tissues was within TEs in the CHG context.</p><p>Finally, we examined the pattern and location of the 448 DMRs identified between tissues to assess whether they paralleled results based on single sites. First, 65% of DMRs were hypo-methylated in floral buds (p &#x0003c; 0.01), verifying increases in overall methylation in this tissue. Second, although most DMSs were found in the CHG context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), we found that 67% of the DMSs within all of our DMRs were sites in the CHH context. This observation suggests that there may be a spatial (clustered) context to the mechanisms that underlie CHH differences between tissues, consistent with the observation in maize that CHH sites tend to be clustered [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Finally, the location of DMRs was biased: 39% of DMRs were found in unannotated regions of the genome, but 31% were found within TEs, 17% within genes and 13% within promoter regions. Given that the total number of cytosine sites within TEs and within genes was similar, at ~29 million bases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150002.t001">Table 1</xref>) each, the lower percentage in genes again indicates that genic methylation is more highly conserved between tissues than methylation of TEs.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Methylation &#x00026; Gene Expression</title><p>The primary goal of this paper is to determine whether methylation differentiation between tissues covaries with GE.

If DMRs influence differential GE, we hypothesized that DMRs should be enriched around differentially expressed genes. To test this hypothesis, we measured the distance (in bp) between a DMR and the closest differentially expressed gene. We then tested whether the observed average distance from DMRs to genes was smaller than expected at random, as tested by permutation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Materials &#x00026; Methods</xref>). We found that on average a DMR was 18,710 bp from a differentially expressed gene, which was not significantly smaller than the random expectation of 17,572 bp (<italic>p</italic> = 0.82; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150002.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Based on this analysis, there is no evidence to suggest that DMRs are enriched near differentially expressed genes, as one might expect if DMRs help drive tissue-specific expression on a genome-wide scale.</p><p>Thinking that we may have missed an important signal by focusing on the entire genome, we delved into the three genomic features separately. For each feature, we focused on DMRs that were hyper-methylated in one vs. the other tissue. For example, we tallied DMRs within 25 genes that were hyper-methylated within floral buds. For this set of 25 genes, we predicted lower GE in floral than leaf tissue. Similarly, for the 19 genes that had a methylated DMR in leaf but not floral tissue, we predicted lower GE in leaf. These predictions were not upheld by the data, however (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In fact, the average level of differential expression did not vary among genes that had a hyper-methylated DMR in floral bud, a hyper-methylated DMR leaf or no DMR whatsoever (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). We repeated this analysis for promoter regions of 1.0 kb 5&#x02019; upstream of genes, and again found no discernible pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

Moreover, BSseq data have rarely been replicated in these studies. Hence, our first goal was simple: to determine whether methylation between two tissues is, in fact, differentiated beyond the level expected from proper replication. For this comparison we chose two tissues that have been sampled commonly in other plant studies&#x02014;leaves and floral buds. Overall, we were able to detect a significant signal of differentiation between tissue samples based on two methodological approaches (permutation tests and clustering analyses) and two measures of variation (DMSs and DMRs).</p><p>Nonetheless, a sobering observation was that the false positive rate (FPR) was extremely high for contrasts between single replicates. For DMS analyses, the lowest FPR in our analyses was 75%. In other words, had we based our inferences on single replicates, three-quarters of our inferences about the sites of &#x0201c;tissue-specific&#x0201d; methylation would have been incorrect relative to inferences based on the larger, replicated dataset. The FPR for DMR analyses was similarly large, at least 80%. While there are ways to decrease the FPR statistically in theory, they may result in the cost of sensitivity and power. Such tradeoffs in the use of BSseq replicates are the topics of ongoing theoretical and algorithmic research, but thus far these render improvements only for data with less coverage those in this study [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Altogether, we conclude that reliance on single BSseq replicates may be misleading when the goal is to focus on specific DMRs or DMSs. For this reason, we recommend analyzes that summarize over a region&#x02013;e.g., genes [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] or promoters or TEs&#x02013;as opposed to individual sites or individual DMRs. Moreover, because replication has been applied so rarely in plant studies, we hope that our description of within- and between-tissue replicates helps guide interpretation of the existing literature.</p><p>Although we detected significant methylation differentiation between tissues, our results were similar to previous studies in documenting that tissues are far more similar than different in their methylation patterns [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For example, we detected ~37-fold more sites conserved between tissue samples than variable sites. Most of the observed differences occurred in the CHG context within TEs and promoters, but there were also slight biases in <italic>total</italic> methylation between leaf and floral bud. Overall, these observations add to the growing notion that methylation differences between plant tissues are slight, except for a few exceptional tissues, such as the endosperm and the pollen vegetative nucleus [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Since neither of these tissues contributes to ensuing generations, these epigenetic changes may be of little evolutionary consequence, although it seems that the pollen vegetative nucleus may play a role in generation-to-generation epigenetic reprogramming [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>We have shown that tissue-specific methylation differentiation is higher than variation among replicates, but do any of these methylation differences drive functional differentiation? To address this question, we generated RNAseq data for the same sets of replicates and examined the correlation between differential GE and differential methylation, many of which were significant. The most striking aspect of these results is that they vary by methylation context. In general, CG methylation correlates with GE as predicted: higher CG methylation in one tissue correlates with lower GE in that tissue. This relationship is true whether one examines genes, promoters or TEs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150002.t003">Table 3</xref>). In contrast, the results for CHH and CHG variation are more varied, with CHH methylation trending in the opposite direction than predicted for both promoters and TEs. These observations indicate that CG methylation is the primary component of variation to affect (or at least covary with) GE. This observation is consistent with the fact that genic expression in pines covaries with CG but not CHG methylation, even though pine genes are heavily methylated in both contexts [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Another interesting aspect about methylation contexts is that they appear to be hierarchical, because typically neither CHH nor CHG variation exceeds CG methylation, regardless of the region under consideration (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g004">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g005">5D, 5E and 5F</xref>). These results suggest that CG methylation acts in some unknown way to limit methylation in the other contexts, at least in brachypodium. It remains to be seen whether this relationship holds for other species and additional tissues.</p><p>Overall, our study suggests that methylation patterns covary with tissue-specific expression, but also that differential CG methylation explains only a small proportion of tissue-specific variation in GE (i.e., between 1% and 9% of variation; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150002.t003">Table 3</xref>). We note, however, that our study likely underestimates the magnitude of the effect, for at least two reasons. First, the predictive power will probably increase with the number of tissues sampled. An explicit goal of future studies should be to estimate the percentage of GE variation explained by DNA methylation based on a broader range of tissue-types; however, to do so will require better sampling&#x02013;both in terms of tissues and replicates&#x02013;than has been performed to date. Second, like most other papers in plant epigenetic research, our tissue samples undoubtedly included multiple cell types; indeed we suspect that the variation in cell types is the primary reason for high variation in DMSs and DMRs among biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150002.g001">Fig 1</xref>). A recent review has called to question the value of &#x02018;tissue&#x02019; vs. &#x02018;cell&#x02019; samples [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the review, the authors argue that the signal of differentiation for highly specialized cells will be masked within tissue samples that contain multiple cell types. This may or not be true, as it depends critically on the as-yet-unknown pattern of cell differentiation and of course the cellular composition of tissue samples. Nonetheless, their point is well taken: it is possible that tissue, as opposed to cell-type, samples lead to underestimate of the overall contribution of epigenetic variation to gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec013"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec014"><title>BSseq Data and Mapping</title><p>The BSseq data were published previously [<xref rid="pone.0150002.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and were available in the Short Read Archive (accession nos.

We considered DMSs in all contexts (i.e., CG, CHG and CHH) to define DMRs. To assess significance, we calculated the length of DMRs (as defined by the number of unidirectional DMSs) expected to be found at random in the genome, given both the underlying distribution of cytosines in proper context and the numbers of DMSs and CMSs. To calculate the random expectation, we permuted DMSs and CMSs among genomic sites in their appropriate contexts, identified DMRs within permutated genomes, and ascertained DMR lengths. After permuting across the genone, we identified DMRs and noted the number of DMSs that constitute each DMR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150002.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).
