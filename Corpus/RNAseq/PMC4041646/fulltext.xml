This limitation is usually overcome by the enrichment of such samples with whole genome amplification (WGA), mostly by multiple displacement amplification (MDA) based on &#x003c6;29 polymerase. However, this technique can be biased by the GC content of the sample and is prone to the development of chimeras as well as contamination during enrichment, which contributes to undesired noise during sequence data analysis, and also hampers the proper functional and/or taxonomic assignments. An alternative to MDA is direct DNA sequencing (DS), which represents the theoretical gold standard in genome sequencing. In this work, we explore the possibility of sequencing the genome of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> from the minimum number of DNA molecules required for pyrosequencing, according to the notion of one-bead-one-molecule. Using an optimized protocol for DS, we constructed a shotgun library containing the minimum number of DNA molecules needed to fill a selected region of a picotiterplate. We gathered most of the reference genome extension with uniform coverage. We compared the DS method with MDA applied to the same amount of starting DNA. As expected, MDA yielded a sparse and biased read distribution, with a very high amount of unassigned and unspecific DNA amplifications. The optimized DS protocol allows unbiased sequencing to be performed from samples with a very small amount of DNA.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by grant CP09/00049 Miguel Servet, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Spain to GD; by projects SAF2009-13032-C02-01 and SAF 2012-31187 (AM), BFU2009-12895-CO2-01 and SAF2010-16240 (FC) from the Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation (MCINN), FU2008-04501-E from Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation(MCINN) in the frame of ERA-Net PathoGenoMics and Prometeo/2009/092 from Conselleria D&#x02019;Educaci&#x000f3; Generalitat Valenciana, Spain, to AM.

The main restriction for all platforms is the amount of DNA required for sequencing (e.g. 1 &#x000b5;g of starting material for a rapid library in 454 FLX + technology). However, quite often the amount of DNA available is limited, e.g. biopsies, laser dissection experiments, genomics for non-cultivable microorganisms, single cell genomic experiments, etc. The most commonly used method to increase the initial amount of DNA for sequencing is Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA) <xref rid="pone.0097379-Binga1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, which employs random hexamers to extend genomic fragments by using the isothermal polymerase from the &#x003c6;29 phage of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic><xref rid="pone.0097379-Vlek1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This reaction was originally designed to amplify circular DNA templates, resulting in 10,000-fold amplification after a few hours <xref rid="pone.0097379-Dean1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Multiple Displacement Amplification is of special interest in studying selected gene loci by PCR after whole genome amplification <xref rid="pone.0097379-Paez1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097379-Raghunathan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It has been applied in tumor genetics, single cell microbial genomics and viral genomics <xref rid="pone.0097379-Yoon1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097379-Swan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>However, it is also widely known that the MDA reaction may produce genome coverage bias <xref rid="pone.0097379-Dean1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> mainly caused by different inter-primer distances <xref rid="pone.0097379-Lage1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, resulting in a low coverage or even unamplified regions. In addition, regions of high GC content could lead to amplification biases <xref rid="pone.0097379-Pinard1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Finally, the low specificity of the random hexamers together with an amplification temperature of 30&#x000b0;C make the MDA reaction prone to amplifying template-free hexamer concatenations, to be contaminated by alien sequences, and to the formation of chimeric sequences <xref rid="pone.0097379-Lasken1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>To overcome the limitations of MDA, a number of protocol improvements <xref rid="pone.0097379-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097379-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> or novel bioinformatics approaches <xref rid="pone.0097379-Bredel1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097379-Rodrigue1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> have been developed.</p><p>For 454 pyrosequencing, 1 &#x000b5;g of DNA is required for library preparation yielding picograms of the prepared library <xref rid="pone.0097379-RocheDiagnostic1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Most of that library is spent for the titration of the emulsion PCR (emPCR), which involves mixing single-stranded library templates with DNA-capturing sepharose beads in an oil emulsion, expecting thus to capture single sequences. The successful quantification of the number of molecules is critical in order to reduce the amount of starting material needed to sequence a DNA sample. Meyer and collaborators <xref rid="pone.0097379-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> used qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) to quantify the prepared library and calculate the exact template/bead ratio avoiding emPCR titration steps, consequently reducing the amount of starting DNA needed to sequence a given sample. Zheng and collaborators <xref rid="pone.0097379-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> described an alternative method to prepare 454 libraries, wher! e the A and B standard 454 adaptors are replaced by custom 454 adaptors in &#x0201c;Y&#x0201d; form and where the exact number of amplifiable molecules is subsequently quantified by qPCR with MGB (Minor Groove Binder) Taqman probes. These probes allow quantification of small amounts of DNA down to a few zeptograms (10<sup>&#x02212;21</sup> grams), even below the minimum amount needed for proper sequencing <xref rid="pone.0097379-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. These improvements have opened the way to Direct Sequencing (DS) starting from very small amounts of DNA and skipping the whole genome amplification step.</p><p>The objective of this work is to obtain a 454 shotgun library for DS starting from the amount of DNA needed to reach exactly the minimal number of molecules required to fill the target picotiterplate (PTP) region. We replaced the steps in which DNA is lost in the standard 454 protocol by more sparing alternatives and quantified these minimal libraries with the qPCR assay designed by Zheng and collaborators <xref rid="pone.0097379-Zheng2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. To assess whether DS can be proposed as an alternative to MDA we compared the sequencing results obtained using both methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Library Preparation and Sequencing Results</title><p>We used flow cytometry and cell sorting to obtain aliquots of 20000 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Extracted DNA was divided in two sub-samples containing DNA equivalent to 10000 cells each. Previous setting-up experiments showed that about 10000 bacterial cells, of genome size close to the one of <italic>E. coli,</italic> was the minimal number required to obtain enough DNA to fill 1/8 of a PTP plate (data not shown): the first sub-sample was not amplified and came directly from DNA extraction to library preparation (DSsample) while the second underwent MDA-WGA (MDAsample). Both sub-samples were then processed by optimized 454 library preparation protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097379.s001">Figure S1</xref>), using two adaptors (Y3 and Y5) with different MID tagging. To calculate the exact number of DNA molecules in the library, the samples were quantified by MGB-TaqMan probe qPCR <xref rid="pone.0097379-Zheng2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

The DNA from 20,000 cells was extracted and split into halves, where one half was amplified with GenomiPhi (MDA) and a second half was processed without whole genome amplification (DS). The shotgun libraries were prepared with the same alternative protocol for the both MDA and DSsamples. Library quality control points were the test PCR with emPCR primers to prove the removal of self-ligated adaptors and the library concentration checking with qPCR. The MDAsample and DSsample with different MIDs in two repetitions were combined into two sequencing runs as sho! wn in the scheme. Panel B: DNA amount requirements in the standard Rapid Library Preparation Method Manual GS FLX+ Series &#x02013; XL+ (May 2011) compared with the amounts actually needed for sequencing on a selected PTP region. The minimal amount of prepared library required for proceeding to emPCR step in the standard 454 protocol may lose 99% of input DNA during the library preparation step. Then, this amount is diluted to a working stock of 10&#x02013;7 molecules, defined as the best starting point to perform the emPCR titration step. However, if the exact number of molecules is quantified with qPCR, the emPCR titration step can be omitted, so actually only 0.13 pg of prepared library are needed for sequencing on 1/8 region of PTP (equivalent to 340,000 ssDNA molecules). This allows to use an alternative shotgun protocol where the DNA losses are reduced.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0097379.g001"/></fig><p>Quantification of DSsample-Y3 and DSsample-Y5 libraries resulted in 414,443 and 41,043 ssDNA (single strand DNA) molecules respectively. Given that DSsample-Y5 did not contain the required number of molecules as planned for sequencing on a half of 1/8 PTP (170,000 molecules, the second half of PTP was filled with MDAsample), both DS libraries were enriched by 4 PCR cycles using emPCR primers to amplify the sample just sufficiently to reach the minimal required number of molecules. The samples were then quantified again to test whether the amount of DNA was sufficient, then 5,773,461 and 384,561 ssDNA molecules of DSsample-Y3 and DSsample-Y5 were obtained, respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097379.s008">Table S1</xref>). MDAsample libraries yielded more DNA and were diluted down to the same concentration as DSsample enriched libraries and pooled together DSsample-Y3 with MDAsample-Y5 (run1) and DSsample-Y5 with MDAsample-Y3 (run2, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097379-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Sequence quality assessment of the run1 had an output of 63,305 sequences (average quality score 36.05).

Furthermore, the resulting amount of the library is diluted up to 10<sup>7</sup> molecules, which is supposed to be the correct starting concentration for emPCR titration <xref rid="pone.0097379-RocheDiagnostic1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This requirement results in an insurmountable obstacle for limited or rare samples. To overcome this drawback, the most widely used method has been isothermal MDA. However, MDA entails a number of serious problems, which have been reported previously.</p><p>Several authors have already suggested that next-generation sequencing library preparation protocols can be started with a lower amount of DNA than that required by the standard protocol. They stated that the true limiting factor, in the case of 454 sequencing, is to reach the number of enriched beads required by the platform <xref rid="pone.0097379-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097379-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097379-White1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097379-Lennon1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to prepare a 454 shotgun library for direct sequencing, starting with the amount of DNA needed to reach the exact minimal number of molecules required to fill the target picotiterplate (PTP) region (e.g. 340,000 enriched beads for 1/8th PTP plate, equivalent to 0.13 pg of 700 bp fragments). To asses this hypothesis, we reduced sample losses by modifying the standard Roche protocols using thriftier alternatives. It is well known that nebulization is responsible of DNA losses during the library preparation process. Rather than fragmenting the sample in a nebulizer, we sonicated it in the same tube in which DNA extraction was performed, thus also avoiding losses due to sample transfer. Small fragments were removed exclusively with AMPure magnetic beads. These changes have been already reported as good alternatives of the standard protocol and they can be used at a large scale <xref rid="pone.0097379-Lennon1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Assessing the minimum number of enriched beads/molecules required by the 454 platform calls for highly sensitive quantitative methods. Minor Groove Binding (MGB) and Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) probes are surely some of the most sensitive DNA quantification systems <xref rid="pone.0097379-BuhGasparic1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The Roche standard rapid shotgun library method uses a Y-adaptor with a fluorochrome, which quantifies the number of correctly ligated molecules by a fluorometer. However, its sensitivity is much lower than that of MGB probes. Roche standard adaptors interfere with MGB probes by using similar absorption and emission wavelengths. To avoid this, two alternatives may work: using a MGB label that does not interfere with Roche Y adaptors, or synthesizing Y adaptors without the fluorochrome <xref rid="pone.0097379-Zheng2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Thus, we used Y adaptors with MGB-Taqman probes designed by Zheng and collaborators, enabling us to quantify the exact number of amplifiable molecules of these minimal libraries by qPCR <xref rid="pone.0097379-Zheng2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Once the exact number of amplifiable molecules is calculated, the user can proceed directly to proper emPCR without the need to perform the previous emPCR titration step, saving further DNA <xref rid="pone.0097379-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097379-Zheng2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097379-Lennon1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Zheng and collaborators <xref rid="pone.0097379-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> started with 1 ng of size-selected nebulized fragments, ligated custom Y adaptors and generated a library that was sufficient for 10 Titanium runs. In this work, we started with an even lower DNA concentration, without diluting the original DNA sample, and preparing a sufficient minimal library able to be sequenced in one Titanium run (1/8 region of PTP). Due to the fact that DNA losses during extraction and small fragment removal cannot be avoided, the amount of size-selected sonicated fragments in our work was definitely lower than 50 pg (theoretically, the DNA content of 10,000 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells). To design sequencing experiments of limited samples, we must always have sufficient sequence coverage and some sample losses in DNA extraction and library construction. Eve! n if no DNA losses took place, a typical bacterial cell containing 6&#x02013;16 fg of DNA would never provide a sufficient number of molecules for high-throughput sequencing <xref rid="pone.0097379-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. To this end, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097379.s008">Table S1</xref> helps users choose the appropriate PTP region size for sequencing quantified minimal libraries. If the number of molecules required to fill the smallest PTP region (1/8th is the smallest PTP subdivision most widely used) is not obtained, then amplification by PCR with emPCR primers with a low number of cycles could be performed.</p><p>In this work, the performance of direct sequencing (DS) was compared with the widely applied multiple displacement amplification (MDA) approach used for samples with small amounts of DNA. Direct sequencing provided homogeneous genome coverage throughout most of the genome. By contrast, MDAsample generated regions with a genome coverage as high as 121 X, leaving almost all of it (97.55%) uncovered. This observation is in accordance with reports by other authors using MDA, who estimated that more than 40% of the sequence could be missing, and that the heterogeneous coverage distribution in MDA frequently leads to failure, without being able to hone in on the target genome by further sequencing efforts either <xref rid="pone.0097379-Marcy1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097379-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097379-Rodrigue1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097379-Woyke1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.

In DS experiments, we obtained sequences that matched &#x02018;nr&#x02019; database but did not belong to the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome, moreover, the same kinds of contamination were observed in parallel with the MDA experiment. We think that flow cytometry might be the source of these non-target sequences.

In this work, although the cells used for DNA extraction in both approaches (DS and MDA) were obtained by flow cytometry sorting, the number of unassigned sequences was considerably lower in DSsample (12.84%) than in that obtained by MDAsample (up to 94.24%). The commercially available MDA reagents have frequently been reported as being contaminated by unwanted DNA. Several authors dealing with MDA contamination concluded that contamination did not come from human DNA or other target genomes, but could originate from hexamer concatenation or from the enzyme preparation process, including host bacteria <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>

This approach could replace MDA in many genome sequencing projects, even in studying previously uncharacterized organisms. Direct sequencing provides unbiased, reliable and reproducible genetic information from any sample with a minimum amount of starting material. In contrast to MDA, which is widely applied to projects dealing with limited amounts of DNA, DS provides a homogeneous distribution of reads mapped to a reference genome, avoiding low efficiency, chimera formation and amplification problems previously described in MDA. We propose that DS is a candidate to replace MDA in most &#x0201c;omic&#x0201d; projects including RNAseq experiment, given that its sequencing efficiency reduces the cost of library preparation and maximizes the gathering of genetic information.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Strains and Media</title><p>The <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain K12 was cultured overnight (O/N) in liquid Lysogeny Broth medium at 37&#x000b0;C.

To assess similarities between the different groups, ANOVA was performed using the correlation eigenvalues and the different theoretical clusters. The robustness of hierarchical grouping among different groups was measured with a bootstrap analysis with 1000 generations. Hierarchical clustering was performed using the R packages hclust and pvclust <xref rid="pone.0097379-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s5k"><title>Data Access</title><p>Sequences were deposited in EMBL-EBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with study number ERP003418 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB4158">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB4158</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0097379.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Steps in standard Rapid Library Preparation GS FLX+ Series &#x02013; XL+ (May 2011) compared with optimized protocol used in this work.</bold> The main changes include sonication for DNA fragmentation (not nebulization), small fragments were removed exclusively with AMPure beads, and alternative chemicals were used for library preparation.
