Because disease susceptibility is a multifactorial complex phenotype, an integrative biology approach is required to dissect the molecular networks involved. Here, we report such an approach using next-generation sequencing combined with advanced network and pathway biology methods to simultaneously profile mRNA and miRNA expression at multiple time points (0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hr) in milk and blood FACS-isolated CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes from animals infected <italic>in vivo</italic> with <italic>Streptococcus uberis</italic>. More than 3700 differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified in milk-isolated monocytes (MIMs), a key immune cell recruited to the site of infection during mastitis. Upregulated genes were significantly enriched for inflammatory pathways, whereas downregulated genes were enriched for nonglycolytic metabolic pathways. Monocyte transcriptional changes in the blood, however, were more subtle but highlighted the impact of this infection systemically. Genes upregulated in blood-isolated monocytes (BIMs) showed a significant association with interferon and chemokine signaling. Furthermore, 26 miRNAs were DE in MIMs and three were DE in BIMs. Pathway analysis revealed that predicted targets of downregulated miRNAs were highly enriched for roles in innate immunity (FDR &#x0003c; 3.4E&#x02212;8), particularly TLR signaling, whereas upregulated miRNAs preferentially targeted genes involved in metabolism. We conclude that during <italic>S. uberis</italic> infection miRNAs are key amplifiers of monocyte inflammatory response networks and repressors of several metabolic pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>infection</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>RNAseq</kwd><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>transcriptional networks</kwd><kwd>complex genetics</kwd><kwd>tolerance</kwd><kwd>complex immunity</kwd><kwd>resistance</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name> DJS Export </meta-name><meta-value>v1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Bovine mastitis is an inflammation-driven disease of the bovine mammary gland that is associated with significant costs to the global dairy industry. In Europe this cost is estimated to be approximately &#x020ac;2 billion euro per year (<xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Wells <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>), with similar figures available in the United States (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Bailey 2009</xref>). Causative agents of mastitis infection include, but are not limited to, coliforms (<italic>Escherichia coli)</italic>, Streptococci (<italic>Streptococcus uberis</italic>) and Staphylococci <italic>(Staphylococcus aureus</italic>). <italic>S. uberis</italic> is now ranked among the most prevalent mastitis-causing pathogens throughout Europe and North America (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Reinoso <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Ward <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>).</p><p>Mastitis develops as bacteria entering the udder via the teat canal stimulate a pathological form of inflammation. Bacteria encounter epithelial cells lining the mammary gland stimulating a local inflammatory response that facilitates their transport across the epithelial barrier, where they are detected by resident immune cells, such as monocytes. Both cell types constitutively express surface pathogen recognition molecules such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), enabling them to function in a sentinel capacity. Invasive <italic>S. uberis</italic> triggers TLR2 and TLR4 mobilizing local and systemic inflammatory mediators (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bannerman <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Moyes <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Typically, chemokines, interleukins (ILs), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; initiate local physiological changes in vascular permeability, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. Concurrently, systemic innate immune changes provoke acute phase protein (APP) production, which is distributed systemically to suppress the spread of bacteria locally (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Mitterhuemer <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). During this phase, immune cells are recruited to the point of infection (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Rinaldi <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Monocytes are released from the bone marrow into the circulatory system and eventually reach the mammary gland via chemokine ligand&#x02013;mediated cell migration. There they differentiate into macrophage and dendritic cell populations (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Dong <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Shi and Pamer 2011</xref>). Neutrophils comprise the majority of immune cells in an infected gland during an infection. Neutrophils are tasked with directly clearing invasive bacteria via phagocytosis or neutrophil extracellular traps (NETS) and subsequently aid in resolution of inflammation (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Lippolis <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Reinhardt <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Once recruited to the site of infection, monocytes and neutrophils orchestrate antimicrobial activity to control bacterial spread and resolve the infection (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Dong <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Serbina <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). Immune cells and other somatic cells can be detected in the milk of infected animals, and the counts of the number of such somatic cells per ml, called the somatic cell count, is an indicator of mastitis (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Bailey 2009</xref>).</p><p>The local immune response in mammary tissues has been examined by several approaches both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Candidate gene-based approaches and microarray technology have determined that more than 2000 genes spanning immunity, metabolism, and tissue remodeling are active during mastitis (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Mitterhuemer <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Moyes <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Swanson <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). However, modest data are available examining transcriptional activity in either milk or blood monocytes from infected animals (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Prgomet <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), and little is known regarding the role microRNAs (miRNAs) play in regulating these responses.</p><p>The miRNAs are small, noncoding RNAs that play a key role in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Connell <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). They have been shown to regulate immune function in several cell types. Neutrophil senescence, for example, is regulated by a discrete miRNA repertoire (<xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Ward <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Na&#x000ef;ve mouse B cells are indirectly regulated by miR-155 via histone deacetylase 4 repression, whereas naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell differentiation and function are regulated by global changes in miRNAs (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bronevetsky <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Sandhu <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). In a recent study, we concluded that miRNAs likely play a key role in regulating the innate immune response in mammary epithelial cells to a bovine mastitis pathogen <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Lawless <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although miRNA expression is abundant in numerous bovine tissues, genome-wide studies elucidating the regulatory roles of miRNAs in bovine immunity are limited (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Coutinho <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Jin <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Xu <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Furthermore, no bovine studies to date have applied next-generation sequencing (NGS) to examine global miRNA expression in immunity and infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this study, we report a NGS approach to profile the expression of bovine miRNAs and mRNAs at multiple time points in milk and blood CD14<sup>+</sup> monocyte cells isolated from Holstein Friesians infected <italic>in vivo</italic> with <italic>S. uberis</italic>, a causative agent of bovine mastitis.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Animals</title><p>Ten female Holstein Friesians in the middle of their first lactation period, aged between 26 and 30 months and between 3 and 5 months postpartum, were selected for this study.

ISG15 has been shown to act as a negative regulator of both the NF-&#x003ba;B and RIG-I signaling pathways (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Arnaud <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Minakawa <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>).</p><p>Identifying hubs solely based on their degree can identify nodes that, in general, have been annotated to have many interactions. This fails to address whether the number of connections in a particular network of interest is more or less than is expected (given the number of known interactions for that node in the database and the size of the network). To address this issue, we have developed the Contextual Hub Analysis Tool (CHAT) (H., L. Wiencko, K., Bryan, A., Noyelle-Depierre &#x00026; D., J. Lynn., unpublished results ), a network analysis tool that identifies nodes in a network that are more highly connected to contextually relevant nodes (in this case DE nodes) than is expected by chance (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.113.009936/-/DC1/TableS8.xlsx">Table S8</ext-link>). Applying this method to our network identified that several of the hub nodes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, KIAA0101) did not have more connections to DE genes than expected by chance. This means that these genes, although highly connected, are less likely to be functionally important in our network. However, all of the transcriptional regulators of innate immunity that were identified as hubs in the analysis above (JUN, NFKB1, RELA, STAT1, STAT3, EP300, CREBBP), were also identified by CHAT to be significantly more connected to 36 hpi DE genes than expected by chance. CHAT also identified several other known innate immunity transcriptional regulators in the top 20 "contextual&#x02019; hubs, including REL, IRF1, and IRF9. Fifteen of the top 20 contextual hubs are annotated by InnateDB as having a role in innate immunity (FDR &#x0003c;1.16E<sup>&#x02212;12</sup>). Although the ranking of the top contextual hubs changed from 36 to 48 hpi, the most significant hubs remained the same.</p><p>The network was also analyzed using the jActiveModules plugin (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ideker <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>) in Cytoscape 2.8.2 (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Shannon <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>) to identify high-scoring DE subnetworks. This type of analysis can aid in the identification of functionally relevant groups of DE genes that may be acting in concert. A single highly connected component (&#x0003e;10 nodes) was identified consisting of 278 nodes and 1585 interactions. This module consisted of several of the transcriptional hubs (CREBBP, EGR1, EP300, NFKB1, RELA) identified in the analysis above and their interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Pathway analysis of genes in the module revealed that the module was statistically enriched for many of the same pathways that were identified in the analysis of all upregulated genes including Jak-STAT signaling, the TLR, NLR, and RIG-I pathways, apoptosis, and chemokine and cytokine signaling (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.113.009936/-/DC1/TableS9.xlsx">Table S9</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s26"><title>Profiling miRNA expression in blood-isolated and milk-isolated CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes</title><p>Sequencing of 100 miRNA Illumina libraries yielded more than one billion reads for both the MIM and BIM samples.

Previously, we identified 19 novel miRNAs in bovine mammary epithelial cells using miRDeep2 (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Lawless <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Applying the same approach as our previous study, we identified a further 20 high-confidence putatively novel bovine miRNAs that were independently predicted in multiple MIMs/BIMs miRNAseq data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.113.009936/-/DC1/TableS13.xls">Table S13</ext-link>).</p><p>Searching the miRBase database (v20) using BLAST identified that eight of the novel miRNAs had close homology to other miR-2284 family members. miRBase currently lists this miRNA family as having 102 members, yet virtually no data exist regarding what function such a large group of constitutively expressed miRNAs may have. Other novel miRNAs discovered in this study included a homolog of hsa-miR-3680-3p, a miRNA identified in human periphery blood (<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Vaz <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). The discovery of these miRNA further adds to the database of bovine miRNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s30"><title>Discussion</title><p>Infectious disease is a serious threat not only directly to human health but also to animal health, for which it is associated with substantial annual economic losses, public confidence issues, and food security concerns. Currently, there is a significant gap in the understanding of the molecular and genetic mechanisms that underpin susceptibility to infectious disease in humans and in animals. An important reason for this is the fact that disease susceptibility is a multifactorial complex phenotype, which is not the result of single genes acting in isolation but rather is attributable to perturbation at a network or systems level (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Barabasi <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Such networks are regulated at multiple different levels (<italic>e.g.</italic>, genetic, transcriptional, posttranscriptional) and, as such, a multiomic integrative biology approach is needed to understand them.</p><p>Here, we report NGS approach coupled with advanced network and pathway biology methods to simultaneously profile the mRNA and miRNA networks that are differentially regulated <italic>in vivo</italic> in blood-isolated and milk-isolated CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes during infection with a bovine mastitis pathogen, <italic>S. uberis</italic>. Bovine mastitis is an inflammation-driven disease of the bovine mammary gland, which costs the global dairy industry billions of dollars per year (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Bailey 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Wells <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>). Profiling genome-wide changes in mRNA expression in MIMs and BIMs using RNAseq, we observed more than 3500 genes to be statistically altered in their expression in response to <italic>S. uberis</italic> challenge. Notably, this RNAseq approach identified approximately 1000 more DE genes than had been previously reported in a microarray-based analysis of RNA expression in mammary tissue of cattle infected with the same pathogen (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Jensen <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Moyes <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Swanson <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). As expected, given that mastitis is a relatively localized inflammatory disease in the mammary gland, the majority of DE genes were identified in MIMs, which are recruited to the site of infection. This influx of immune cells (including monocytes) to the site of infection was observed in recorded SCC data only in the infected animals. However, we also observed a small but significant transcriptional response in BIMs to <italic>S. uberis</italic> infection that was primarily associated with an interferon and cytokine signaling signature. Previous studies have also shown more systemic changes in gene expression in neighboring uninfected mammary glands, the liver, and in the blood (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Blum <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Jensen <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Mitterhuemer <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).</p><p>The predominant signature associated with upregulated mRNAs in MIMs from <italic>S. uberis</italic>&#x02013;infected animals was the strong transcriptional activation of innate immune and inflammatory gene expression. In particular, we noted the transcriptional activation of key pattern recognition pathways, including the TLR, NLR, and RIG-I pathways, which likely drive the observed proinflammatory response. The involvement of TLR signaling (particularly TLR2 and TLR4) in the host response to mastitis is well-documented (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Buitenhuis <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ma <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Mitterhuemer <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Porcherie <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Whelehan <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>); however, less is known about the involvement of the NLR and RIG-I pathways (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Moyes <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Interestingly, the RIG-I pathway is classically associated with viral RNA recognition; however, recent findings suggest that RIG-I can also recognize nucleic acids released by invasive bacteria and trigger IFN-&#x003b2; and inflammasome activation (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abdullah <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). These findings concur well with the observed interferon and inflammasome activation transcriptional signatures observed in our study.</p><p>Several previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have strongly suggested roles for miRNAs in regulating bovine immunity (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Dilda <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Lawless <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>); however, none of these have globally profiled the miRNA response to infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this study, we have also used NGS sequencing to profile miRNA expression in MIMs and BIMs after <italic>S. uberis</italic> infection. Twenty-six miRNAs were identified as DE in MIMs and three were identified in BIMs. Several of these have been previously described as targeting immune or inflammatory regulators in other species. Of particular interest is our finding that downregulated but not upregulated miRNAs in MIMs are predicted to preferentially target genes involved in innate immunity and inflammation. Furthermore, the TLR, NLR, and RIG-I pathways discussed above were all preferentially predicted to be targeted. This strongly suggests that the transcriptional suppression of these miRNAs enables the activation and amplification of the proinflammatory response. Further supporting this conclusion is the fact that several of the DE miRNAs in our study have been validated to target genes in these pathways in other species. miR-149, for example, which was downregulated in MIMs after <italic>S. uberis</italic> infection, has been shown to target mouse CD14 and IRAK1 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Chi <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), key signaling proteins in the TLR pathway. Both CD14 and IRAK1 are also predicted to be targets of bta-miR-149 in our study.</p><p>The other predominant transcriptional signature that we found in MIMs after <italic>S. uberis</italic> infection was the widespread repression of a number of metabolic processes (&#x0003e;150 KEGG-annotated metabolism genes are downregulated at 36 hpi). Interestingly, we found that upregulated miRNAs were predicted to preferentially target genes involved in metabolism, suggesting that miRNAs, which are upregulated in response to <italic>S. uberis</italic> infection, may contribute to the transcriptional suppression of metabolic pathways. This signature of metabolic gene transcriptional suppression may appear initially paradoxical in light of the fact that production of inflammatory cytokines is expected to require substantial energy consumption. It is now becoming widely appreciated that activated macrophages undergo the Warburg effect, switching their metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis (McGettrick and O&#x02019;Neill 2013). This metabolic switch has recently been investigated using a combined metabolomics and microarray approach (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Tannahill <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>) and has revealed the upregulation of a number of genes involved in glycolysis in bone marrow&#x02013;derived macrophages challenged with LPS [<italic>e.g.</italic>, solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter), member 1 (SLC2A1/GLUT1), hexokinase 3 (HK3), fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3)] and the downregulation of several key genes encoding enzymes in the TCA cycle [<italic>e.g.</italic>, malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2)]. Our transcriptional data are consistent with the data presented in this article (<italic>e.g.</italic>, SLC2A1; HK2 and HK3 and PFKFB4 are all upregulated and MDH1 and IDH1 are downregulated in MIMs at 36 hpi) and suggest that although there is a broad signature of transcriptional suppression of metabolism, these cells are likely to be highly glycolytically active. Several other genes encoding enzymes in the TCA cycle (which was statistically overrepresented among downregulated genes) were also transcriptionally repressed in MIMs at 36 hpi, including the following: dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase; fumarate hydratase; IDH3B; pyruvate dehydrogenase beta; MDH2; succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit B; and succinate-CoA ligase, alpha subunit. As has also recently been shown in bone marrow&#x02013;derived macrophages, LPS strongly increases levels of succinate, a TCA cycle intermediate (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Tannahill <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Succinate acts as an inflammatory signal in macrophages inducing IL1B through the transcription factor HIF-1&#x003b1;, both of which are transcriptionally activated in MIMs 36 hpi (<italic>IL1B</italic> is 10-fold upregulated). Another metabolic pathway that is significantly transcriptionally repressed in MIMs at 36 and 48 hpi is the KEGG Valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation pathway. Valine, leucine, and isoleucine are branch-chain amino acids that are converted into Acyl-CoA derivatives. These are converted into either acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA and enter the TCA cycle (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Sears <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Most of the other significantly downregulated pathways, including fatty acid metabolism, propanoate metabolism, butanoate metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism, lysine degradation, and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, also result in the production of acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA that enter the TCA cycle. A similar pattern of expression leading to the transcriptional downregulation of the TCA cycle and alternative pathways involved in producing TCA cycle components has also been reported in other infection models (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Chin <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). The transcriptional repression of these pathways is therefore also consistent with a switch in metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis during the proinflammatory response.</p><p>Another pathway that is significantly downregulated is the KEGG primary bile acid biosynthesis pathway. Despite the potentially misleading name, this pathway primarily consists of the reactions involved in cholesterol metabolism. The downregulation of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism has also been reported in monocytes isolated from HIV<sup>+</sup> individuals (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Feeney <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>) and a number of bacterial infections (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Dushkin 2012</xref>). The accumulation of cholesterol in monocytes and macrophages leads to the formation of foam cells, which in humans are associated with the inflammatory disease, atherosclerosis (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Ross 1999</xref>). The downregulation of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism is likely driven in part by the transcriptional suppression of the PPAR-&#x003b3; transcription factor in MIMs at 36 hpi and the downregulation of PPAR-&#x003b1; at 48 hpi, both of which are key transcriptional regulators of these pathways (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Dushkin 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the PPARs also have a role in the regulation of inflammation, in which their suppression is required to induce inflammatory gene expression (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bensinger and Tontonoz 2008</xref>). Of further note is that one of the liver X receptors, LXR-&#x003b2; (NR1H2), which together with the PPARs is a key regulator of inflammation and lipid metabolism (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bensinger and Tontonoz 2008</xref>), is upregulated in MIMs at 36 and 48 hpi. LXRs are also known to antagonize inflammatory gene expression, so it is somewhat surprising to find LXR-&#x003b2; to be upregulated. This may reflect the fact that balance is needed to avoid excessive inflammation or that LXRs and PPARs do not completely overlap in the genes that they regulate.</p><p>An additional link between metabolism and inflammation that is currently undergoing intensive investigation is the role of NAD<sup>+</sup>, sirtuins (SIRTs), and AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) in suppressing inflammation (McGettrick and O&#x02019;Neill 2013). The activation of TLR4, which along with TLR2 and TLR9 is transcriptionally upregulated in MIMs at 36 hpi, has been shown to induce NAM phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT; upregulated in MIMs at 36hpi), which in turn activates SIRT1 (upregulated in MIMs at 36 hpi) via NAD<sup>+</sup>. SIRT1 limits inflammation by repressing RELA transcription factor activity, a key transcriptional hub identified in MIMs. SIRT1 also activates AMPK (upregulated in MIMs at 36 hpi), a central regulator of energy metabolism. Activation of AMPK has been shown to decrease NF-&#x003ba;B activity and TNF-&#x003b1; production in macrophages stimulated with LPS, IL-12 production in DCs, and HIF-1&#x003b1;. These data suggest that at 36 hpi, the brakes are starting to be applied to limit the inflammatory response to <italic>S. uberis</italic> infection via SIRT1 and AMPK. The affect of this break is apparent at 48 hpi, where the genes encoding TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1B, IL-12, and HIF-1&#x003b1; are all downregulated in comparison to 36 hpi. The limiting of inflammation at this stage makes sense based on the bacterial count data, which show that bacterial CFU/ml are declining, suggesting that the infection is being resolved. Interestingly, AMPK activity also inhibits both the cholesterol and fatty acid metabolic pathways that, as discussed above, are downregulated in MIMs after <italic>S. uberis</italic> infection. This suppression of fatty acid metabolism has been shown to be beneficial to the host during a viral infection (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Moser <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we also observed the statistically significant over-representation of downregulated genes annotated in the KEGG glutathione metabolism pathway. Glutathione has an important role in innate and adaptive immunity and has been shown to confer protection against microbial, viral, and parasitic infections (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Morris <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Glutathione metabolism also plays an important role in macrophages in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. The transcriptional suppression of this pathway in MIMs after <italic>S. uberis</italic> infection may be a consequence of the metabolic switch to glycolysis and may be detrimental to the host, leading to an excess of oxidants in the cells, which could drive the inflammation and tissue damage that are characteristic of mastitis. In patients with active tuberculosis, PBMC intracellular glutathione levels declined by 70%; this was correlated with increased proinflammatory cytokines and enhanced bacterial growth (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Guerra <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). Supplementation with glutathione has been demonstrated to lead to the control of mycobacterial growth (<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Venketaraman <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>) and also appears to have beneficial effects in reducing inflammation in HIV<sup>+</sup> patients (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Morris <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). This suggests that glutathione supplementation is a potential strategy to reduce the effects of inflammation in mastitis.</p><p>miRNAs also likely play a key role in regulating the links between inflammation and metabolism observed in this study. Human SIRT1, for example, which as discussed above limits inflammation, has been shown to be a target of miR-34a (<xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Yamakuchi <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). Our data are consistent with this relationship also existing in MIMs, where we have found bta-miR-34a to be downregulated at 36 and 48 hpi and SIRT1 to be upregulated. Other examples of miRNAs that likely transcriptionally regulate metabolic pathways in MIMs include miR-451, which is upregulated in MIMs at 36 and 48 hpi and has been shown to target MO25 in mouse heart tissue altering AMPK signaling (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). miR-451 has also been shown to regulate the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines in mice in response to influenza infection (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Rosenberger <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>).</p><p>Aside from providing new insight into the regulatory role miRNAs play in <italic>S. uberis</italic> infection <italic>in vivo</italic>, our study also provides the groundwork for a number of potential practical applications in veterinary medicine. miRNAs, for example, exhibit many properties that have made them of significant interest as noninvasive biomarkers. miRNAs are abundantly and stably expressed in a range of accessible tissues, including serum, milk, urine, saliva, and semen, where they can be readily measured (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hata <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Kosaka <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Importantly, for a potential biomarker, miRNAs have high information content, and the expression profile of small numbers of them have been shown to be diagnostic of disease (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">De Guire <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). The use of miRNAs as a clinical biomarker is most advanced in human cancer research. In 2009, Prometheus Laboratories released an miRNA biomarker to accurately identify 25 different tumor types (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ajit 2012</xref>), and miRNA biomarkers are now available for early cancer prognosis from two other companies, Asuragen and Rosetta Genomics. NGS-based technologies, such as the approach used in this study, are empowering RNA expression profiling, including miRNAs, on a genome-wide scale with unprecedented resolution, accuracy, and speed and at a relatively low cost (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Schuster 2008</xref>). There is significant potential to develop these approaches as diagnostics of infection in animals and also in humans.</p></sec>
