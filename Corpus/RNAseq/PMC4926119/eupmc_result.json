    "Non-target site resistance (NTSR) to herbicides is an increasing concern for weed control. The majority of previous studies have focused on metabolic resistance mechanisms of NTSR, but no research exists on gene regulation mechanisms behind herbicide resistance, such as microRNA (miRNA). Here, we identified 3 American sloughgrass (Beckmannia syzigachne Steud.) populations containing fenoxaprop-P-ethyl-resistant plants. We then constructed small RNA libraries and subjected them to deep sequencing and bioinformatics analyses. Forty known and 36 potentially novel, predicted miRNAs were successfully identified. Of these, we identified 3 conserved, predicted candidate NTSR-determinant miRNAs and their potential corresponding target genes, as well as 4 novel potential miRNAs with high count. Target gene prediction and annotation indicated that these 7 differentially expressed miRNAs potentially play a role in regulating specific stress-responsive genes, very likely related to herbicide resistance. Expression profiles were determined with quantitative real-time PCR. The present study is a novel, large-scale characterization of weed miRNAs. The results should further our understanding of miRNA expression profiles associated with herbicide resistance, allowing for the development of more effective weed management strategies."
