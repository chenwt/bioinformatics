We describe quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of 105 genomically annotated breast cancers of which 77 provided high-quality data. Integrated analyses allowed insights into the somatic cancer genome including the consequences of chromosomal loss, such as the 5q deletion characteristic of basal-like breast cancer. The 5q <italic>trans</italic> effects were interrogated against the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures, thereby connecting CETN3 and SKP1 loss to elevated expression of EGFR, and SKP1 loss also to increased SRC. Global proteomic data confirmed a stromal-enriched group in addition to basal and luminal clusters and pathway analysis of the phosphoproteome identified a G Protein-coupled receptor cluster that was not readily identified at the mRNA level. Besides ERBB2, other amplicon-associated, highly phosphorylated kinases were identified, including CDK12, PAK1, PTK2, RIPK2 and TLK2. We demonstrate that proteogenomic analysis of breast cancer elucidates functional consequences of somatic mutations, narrows candidate nominations for driver genes within large deletions and amplified regions, and identifies therapeutic targets.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">A central deficiency in our knowledge of cancer concerns how genomic changes drive the proteome and phosphoproteome to execute phenotypic characteristics<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The initial proteomic characterization in the TCGA breast study was performed using reversed phase protein arrays; however this approach is restricted by antibody availability. To provide greater analytical breadth, the NCI Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) is analyzing the proteomes of genome-annotated TCGA tumor specimens using mass spectrometry<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.

The cohort included a balanced representation of PAM50-defined intrinsic subtypes<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> including 25 basal-like, 29 luminal A, 33 luminal B, and 18 HER2 (ERBB2)-enriched tumors, along with 3 normal breast tissue samples. Samples were analyzed by high-resolution, accurate mass, tandem mass spectrometry (MS) that included extensive peptide fractionation and phosphopeptide enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). An isobaric peptide labeling approach (iTRAQ) was employed to quantify protein and phosphosite levels across samples, with 37 iTRAQ 4-plexes analyzed in total. A total of 15,369 proteins (12,405 genes) and 62,679 phosphosites were confidently identified with 11,632 proteins/tumor and 26,310 phosphosites/tumor on average (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">Supplementary Tables 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). After filtering for observation in at least a quarter of the samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>) 12,553 proteins (10,062 genes) and 33,239 phosphosites, with their relative abundances quantified across tumors, were used in subsequent analyses in this study. Stable longitudinal performance and low technical noise were demonstrated by repeated, interspersed analyses of a single batch of patient-derived luminal and basal breast cancer xenograft samples<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1d,e</xref>). Due to the heterogeneous nature of breast tumors<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, and because proteomic analyses were performed on tumor fragments that were different from those used in the genomic analyses, rigorous pre-specified sample and data QC metrics were implemented<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">3</xref>). Extensive analyses concluded that 28 of the 105 samples were compromised by protein degradation. These samples were excluded from further analysis with subsequent informatics focused on the 77 tumor samples and three biological replicates.</p><p id="P6">Genome and transcriptomic variation was observed at the peptide level by searching MS/MS spectra not matched to RefSeq against a patient-specific sequence database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The database was constructed using the QUILTS software package<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> leveraging RefSeq gene models based on whole exome and RNA-seq data generated from portions of the same tumors and matched germline DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). While these analyses detected a number of single amino-acid variants (SAAVs), frameshifts, and splice junctions, including splice isoforms that had been detected as only single transcript reads by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Supplementary Table 5</xref>), the number of genomic and transcriptomic variants that were confirmed as peptides by MS was low (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). Sparse detection of individual genomic variants by peptide sequencing has been noted in our previous studies<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and reflects limited coverage at the single amino-acid level with current technology. However quantitative MS analysis of multiple peptides for each protein is used to reliably infer overall protein levels. This is an advantage for MS since antibody-based protein expression analysis is typically based on a single epitope. To illustrate this capability in the current data set an initial analysis of three frequently mutated genes in breast cancer (TP53, PIK3CA, and GATA3) and three clinical biomarkers (ER, PGR, and ERBB2) was conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD17">Supplementary Table 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD18">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). As expected, TP53 missense mutations were associated with elevated MS-based protein levels, as observed by RPPA (Reverse Phase Protein Array), especially in basal-like breast cancer. TP53 nonsense and frame-shift mutations were associated with a decrease in TP53 protein levels that was particularly striking in the MS data. In contrast, the mostly C-terminal GATA3 frame-shift alterations did not result in decreased protein expression when measured by the median of all GATA3 peptides, suggesting these proteins are expressed despite truncation. No consistent effect of somatic PIK3CA mutation was observed at the level of protein expression. Good correlations between RNA-seq and MS-protein expression levels were found for ESR1 (r=0.74), PGR (r=0.74), ERBB2 (r=0.84) and GATA3 (r=0.83) with moderate correlations observed for PIK3CA (r=0.45) and TP53 (r=0.36). Lower TP53 protein abundance levels compared to mRNA levels were especially prevalent in luminal tumors, suggesting post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms such as proteasomal degradation. To explore this hypothesis a search was made for E3 ligases that showed negative correlation to p53 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD19">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). These analyses identified UBE3A (r=&#x02212;0.42; adj. pval=0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>), an established TP53 E3 ligase<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. In comparing CNA, RNA, and protein levels for GATA3, copy number gains in chromosome 10q were anti-correlated with RNA and protein levels in basal-like tumors. This observation prompted a search for other gains or losses that were anticorrelated with RNA and/or protein levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref> for further analyses). Overall, six genes were identified that significantly anti-correlated at an FDR&#x0003c;0.05 on both RNA and protein level to their CNA signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>). GATA3 amplification on 10q in basal-like breast cancer showed the strongest anti-correlation, followed by the hexosamine and glycolysis pathway enzymes GFPT2 and HK3, which are upregulated in basal-like breast cancer despite being subjected to frequent chromosomal deletion on 5q. Global analysis of the correlation of mRNA-to-protein yielded a median Pearson value of r=0.39, with 6,135 out of 9,302 protein/mRNA pairs (66.0%) correlating significantly at an FDR&#x0003c;0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD20">Supplementary Table 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). Similar to the colon cancer analysis<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> metabolic functions such as amino acid, sugar and fatty acid metabolism were found to be enriched among positively correlated genes<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> whereas ribosomal, RNA polymerase and mRNA splicing functions were negatively correlated. Overall these analyses demonstrate the utility of global proteome correlation analysis for both confirmation of suspected regulatory mechanisms and identification of candidate regulators meriting further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Copy Number Alterations</title><p id="P7">To determine the consequences of CNA on mRNA, protein and phosphoprotein abundance, both in &#x0201c;<italic>cis</italic>&#x0201d; on genes within the aberrant locus and in &#x0201c;<italic>trans</italic>&#x0201d; on genes encoded elsewhere, univariate correlation analysis was used as previously described<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. A total of 7,776 genes with CNA, mRNA and protein measurements were analyzed by calculating Pearson correlation and associated statistical significance (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value) for all possible CNA-mRNA and CNA-protein pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>, see Methods). For the phosphoproteome, 4,472 CNA-phosphoprotein pairs were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). Significant positive correlations (<italic>cis</italic>) were observed for 64% of all CNA-mRNA, 31% of all CNA-protein, and 20% of all CNA-phosphoprotein pairs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>. Proteins and phosphoproteins correlated in <italic>cis</italic> to CNA were, for the most part, a subset of the <italic>cis</italic> effects observed in mRNA-to-CNA correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 10</xref>). The fractional difference of well-annotated oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes among the significantly <italic>cis</italic>-correlated CNA-to-mRNA and -protein gene pairs was analyzed. Based on a reference list of 487 oncogenes and tumor suppressors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 10</xref>), these cancer relevant genes occur 37.6% more frequently in the subset of genes that correlate both on CNA/mRNA and CNA/protein levels than in the subset that only correlate on CNA/mRNA but not on CNA/protein level (Fisher exact p-value=0.02). This suggests that CNA events with a tumor promoting outcome more likely lead to <italic>cis</italic> regulatory effects on both the protein and mRNA level, whereas CNA events with no documented role in tumorigenesis are more likely to be neutralized on the protein level than on the RNA level. <italic>Trans</italic> effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) appear as vertical bands, with accompanying frequency histograms (in blue) highlighting &#x0201c;hot spots&#x0201d; of significant <italic>trans</italic> effects. Using a minimum threshold of 50 <italic>trans</italic>-affected genes, 68% of the tested genes were associated with <italic>trans</italic> effects on the mRNA level, whereas only 13% were associated with effects on the protein level and 8% on the phosphoprotein level. Importantly, CNA-protein correlations appeared to be a reduced representation of CNA-mRNA correlations. Furthermore, for many CNA regions correlations were more directionally uniform on the protein level than on the mRNA level. CNA regions exhibiting the most <italic>trans</italic> associations at the protein level were found on chromosomes 5q (LOH in basal; gain in LumB), 10p (gain in basal), 12 (gain in basal), 16q (LumA deletion), 17q (LumB amplification), and 22q (LOH in luminal and basal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Trans associations are not necessarily direct consequences of the chromosomal aberration. For example since 5q loss occurs in at least 50% of basal-like breast cancers<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, many of the trans effects involve genes that mark the basal-subtype. To identify candidate driver genes whose copy number alterations are direct drivers of <italic>trans</italic> effects, results were compared with functional knock-down data on 3,797 genes in the Library of Integrated Cellular Signatures (LINCS) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lincsproject.org/">http://www.lincsproject.org/</ext-link>)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. For any given gene with copy number alterations (&#x0201c;CNA-gene&#x0201d;), sets of genes were identified corresponding to proteins that changed where there was gain (&#x0201c;CNA-gain trans gene set&#x0201d;) or loss (&#x0201c;CNA-loss trans gene set&#x0201d;). These gene sets were then compared to the effects of gene knock down in the LINCS database (see Methods). Queries for 502 different CNA-genes meeting the criteria defined above identified 10 CNA-genes that could be functionally connected to <italic>both</italic> CNA-gain and CNA-loss <italic>trans</italic> protein-level effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). A permutation-based approach implemented to test significance (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>) yielded an FDR &#x0003c; 0.05 for 10 genes affected by both CNA gains and losses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). These proteins were defined as potential regulatory candidates for the CNA <italic>trans</italic> effects observed on the proteome level in this study, since in a gene-dependent manner on average 17% of these <italic>trans</italic> effects were consistent with the knockdown profiles. Notably, the established oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase ERBB2 was functionally connected only to CNA gain <italic>trans</italic> effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). The E3 ligase SKP1<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and the ribonucleoprotein export factor CETN3, both located on chromosome arm 5q with frequent losses in basal-like breast cancer and less frequent gains in luminal B breast cancer, were detected as potential regulators affecting the expression of the tyrosine kinase and therapeutic target EGFR, and SKP1 also was linked to SRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5d</xref>). Another potential regulator, FBXO7, (a substrate recognition component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex), was affected mostly by LOH events on chromosome 22q.

To investigate the extent to which the PAM50 &#x0201c;intrinsic&#x0201d; breast cancer classification scheme is reflected or refined on the proteome level in the CPTAC samples, clustering analyses were first restricted to the reduced set of PAM50 genes. When RNA data for the 50 PAM50 genes were clustered directly (without using a classifier), the clustering was similar to the TCGA PAM50 annotation (second annotation bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Restricting both the RNA and proteome data to the set of 35 PAM50 genes observed in the proteome produced a similar result (bottom two annotation bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), and all the major PAM50 groups were recapitulated in the proteome almost as well as in the RNA data. This indicates that although different tissue sections of the same tumors were used for RNA-seq and protein analysis, very similar subtype-defining features can be observed in both data types. Global proteome and phosphoproteome data were then used to identify proteome subtypes in an unsupervised manner. Consensus clustering identified basal-enriched, luminal-enriched, and stromal-enriched clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Figs. 6a&#x02013;d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">7a</xref>). Unlike the clustering observed with PAM50 genes, mRNA-defined HER2-enriched tumors were distributed across these three proteomic subgroups. The basal-enriched and luminal-enriched groups showed a strong overlap with the mRNA-based PAM50 basal-like and luminal subgroups, whereas stromal-enriched proteome subtype represented a mix of all PAM50 mRNA-based subtypes, and has a significantly enriched stromal signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3e</xref>). Among the stromal-enriched tumors there was strong representation of reactive type I tumors as classified by RPPA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 12</xref>), showing agreement between the RPPA and mass spectrometry-based protein analyses for the detection of a tumor subgroup characterized by stromal gene expression<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">Since the basal- and luminal-enriched proteome subgroups are coherent, pathway analyses were conducted on these two subtypes, using the stromal-enriched subgroup as a control to assess specificity.

The luminal-enriched subgroup was exclusively enriched for estradiol and ESR1-driven gene sets. In contrast, multiple gene sets were enriched and upregulated specifically in the basal-like tumors. Particularly extensive basal-like enrichment was seen for MYC target genes; for cell cycle, checkpoint, and DNA repair pathways including regulators AURKA/B, ATM, ATR, CHEK1/2, and BRCA1/2; and for immune response/inflammation, including T-cell, B-cell, and neutrophil signatures.

Subgroup 4 included a majority of tumors from the basal-enriched proteomic subgroup, but was admixed particularly with luminal-enriched samples. This subgroup was defined by high levels of cell cycle and checkpoint activity. All basal and a majority of non-basal samples in this subgroup had TP53 mutations. Consistent with high levels of cell cycle activity, a multivariate kinase-to-phosphosite abundance regression analysis highlighted CDK1 as one of the most highly connected kinases in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Table 16</xref>).

A proteogenomic circos-like<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> plot (termed a &#x0201c;pircos&#x0201d; plot) was used to map these outlier kinase values onto the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 10a</xref>). The ERBB2 locus showed the strongest effect of increased phosphoprotein levels associated with gene amplification-driven RNA and protein over expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>).

The analysis of the ERBB2 amplicon also uncovered co-outlier phosphorylation status for MED1, GRB7, MSL1, CASC3 and TOP2A, all previously described in association with ERBB2 amplification.

To further examine whether outlier kinases were breast cancer subtype-specific, independent of amplification status, the BH-corrected probability was calculated of finding that number of phosphosite outliers within a subtype, given the total number of outliers across all subtypes, the subtype sample size and the total sample size.

An example of how high-dimensional proteomic analysis provides insight into unresolved genomic issues concerns the study of loss of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q).

Orthogonal candidate screening using functional genomics methods identified loss of CETN3 and SKP1 as potential transregulators, with upregulation of EGFR as a downstream consequence in basal-like breast cancers.

Candidate genes that exhibited similar gene amplification-driven proteogenomic patterns to HER2 included CDK12, TLK2, PAK1 and RIPK2. The proteogenomic link with gene amplification was particularly strong for CDK12, in keeping with its location in the ERBB2 amplicon, while the strengths of correlation between DNA amplification, RNA, protein and phosphoprotein for the other examples were more variable. The presence of activated CDK12 in the ERBB2 amplicon might explain why tumors arising in BRCA1 carriers are usually ERBB2 negative. As a positive transcriptional regulator of BRCA1 and multiple FANC family members, CDK12 promotes DNA repair by homologous recombination. CDK12 amplification would, therefore, oppose the functional effects of BRCA1 haploinsufficiency during tumor evolution<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.

By contrast, the vast majority of significant gene sets annotated as "signaling" were enriched only at the phosphoprotein level. d, Global heat map representing all gene sets significantly enriched in at least one of the proteomic breast cancer subtypes. The stromal-enriched group was characterized by breast cancer normal-like, adipocyte differentiation, smooth muscle, toll-like receptor signaling and endothelin gene sets, supporting the clustering-based annotation of high stromal and/or adipose content in these tumors (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplemental Table 13</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms778057f11"/></fig><fig id="F12" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><label>Extended Data Figure 8</label><caption><title>Phosphoproteome pathway clustering, kinase-phosphosite multivariate regression, and protein co-expression networks</title><p id="P28">a, Phosphoproteome pathway clustering. Using phosphorylation state as a proxy for activity, deep phosphoproteome profiling allows development of a breast cancer molecular taxonomy based on signaling pathways. K-means consensus clustering was performed on pathways derived from single sample GSEA analysis of phosphopeptide data (908 pathways shown). Of four robustly segregated groups, subgroups 2 and 3 substantially recapitulated the stromal- and luminal-enriched proteomic subgroups, respectively. Subgroup 4 included a significant majority of tumors from the basal-enriched proteomic subgroup, but was admixed particularly with luminal-enriched samples. This subgroup was defined by high levels of cell cycle and checkpoint activity. All basal and a majority of non-basal samples in this subgroup had TP53 mutations. Subgroup 1 was a novel subgroup defined exclusively in the phosphopeptide / pathway activity domain, with no enrichment for either proteomic or PAM50 subtypes. It was defined by G-protein, G-protein coupled receptor, and inositol phosphate metabolism signatures, as well as ionotropic glutamate signaling. b, Analysis of the regulatory relationship between outlier kinases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supplementary Table 19</xref>) and phosphopeptides by regulatory multivariate regression analysis (see Methods) identified CDK1 as the most highly connected of the outlier Cyclin-Dependent Kinases, with highest centrality (based on node-degree; see Methods) among the outlier CDKs and seventh highest centrality among all the outlier kinases considered in the remMap analysis. Each line represents a phosphosite-kinase relationship. c&#x02013;f, Analysis of differences in the co-expression patterns among genes/proteins across different subgroups. A Joint Random Forest (JRF) method was applied to simultaneously build gene co-expression and protein co-expression networks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Table 17</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref>). Modules in these networks revealed different interaction patterns between basal-enriched and luminal-enriched subgroups. c, Network module P1 of the protein co-expression network, defined chiefly in the proteome space. This module contained 12 genes connected by 39 edges, among which 34 were protein-specific and 5 were shared by both the protein and mRNA co-expression networks. Many edges were supported by published information and were contained in the STRING database. Edges in red are specific to the protein co-expression network; edges in green are shared by both protein and gene co-expression networks; edges indicated by double lines are contained in the STRING database with confidence score greater than 0.15. MMP9, one of the central proteins in this module, contributes to metastatic progression and is a potential target for anti-metastatic therapies for basal-like / triple negative breast cancer. d, Heatmaps of the absolute correlation across each pair of genes in module P1 (shown in Panel c), based on either protein or gene expression data for samples in the basal-enriched and luminal-enriched subgroups, respectively. The MMP9 protein was strongly co-expressed with the other members of the module only in the basal-enriched subgroup. Notably, this observation is dependent on protein data; the correlation at the mRNA level for this module was consistently low in both the basal-enriched and luminal enriched subgroups indicating that these events coherently occur at the proteomic level. e, Co-expression network based on proteomics data. The network contains 693 proteomic network-specific edges (grey) and 792 edges shared with the RNAseq network (green). For each module, the most enriched category and corresponding Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value is reported. Pie charts adjacent to each module show the proportion of proteomics-specific edges (grey area) and edges shared between proteomics and RNAseq data (green area). f, RNAseq network.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms778057f12"/></fig><fig id="F13" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><label>Extended Data Figure 9</label><caption><title>Phosphoproteome signatures of PIK3CA (a,b) and TP53 (c,d) mutated tumors highlight activated key regulators and indicate frequency of activation</title><p id="P29">a and c, Phosphosites upregulated in mutated tumors (SAM FDR&#x0003c;0.05 across all tumors and independently also across luminal tumors; average phosphosite signal for all markers shown as bar graph). To avoid confounding by intrinsic subtype-specific distinctions, only markers that were significantly identified both in analyses covering all tumors and analyses restricted to luminal tumors were selected (FDR &#x0003c;0.05). Color bars in the margins indicate FDRs for grouped analysis of different mutation classes and indicate kinase substrates of known kinases in the respective pathways. Significantly regulated kinase phosphosites are annotated. The average phosphorylation signal of the marker phosphosites provides a read-out for PI3K and TP53 pathway activity in mutated tumors (histogram below heatmap). A 95% prediction confidence interval (indicated by dashed lines) across the average signal in non-mutated tumors was chosen in order to discriminate active from non-active tumors. The most strongly activated PIK3CA kinase domain mutant tumor differed from the other 9 kinase domain mutant tumors, as it contained an amino acid side chain charge neutral H1047L instead of the more common positively charged H1047R mutation. Among the 62 phosphosites identified that were significantly upregulated in PIK3CA mutated tumors, 13 phosphosites were found on phosphoproteins that are known substrates of well-annotated kinases in the PIK3CA pathway (panel a, right column). In the mutant TP53 analysis a total 20 phosphosites were found on phosphoproteins that are known substrates of well annotated kinases in the p53 pathway (panel c, right column). b and d, Upregulated phosphosite sets were derived from isogenic PIK3CA and TP53 mutant versus wild-type cell line pairs and tested for enrichment within mutant versus wild-type CPTAC tumors using single sample GSEA.

To better understand the downstream effects of ERBB2 amplification, phosphosite outliers in known ERBB2 signaling genes (MSigDB pathway set, KEGG_ERBB_SIGNALING PATHWAY) were identified for the 15 samples that had ERBB2 phosphosite outlier status. Forty-one genes were identified as having a phosphosite outlier in at least one of the ERBB2 amplified samples. PAK4 and ARAF phosphosite outlier status were found in seven of the 15 ERBB2 kinase outlier samples; GSK3B outliers were found in 6 samples; and EIF4EBP1, MAP2K2, ABL1 and AKT1 outlier status was found in 5 of the 15 samples. c, Proteogenomic outlier expression analysis for TLK2 and RIPK2.
