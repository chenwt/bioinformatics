Among them, RAD-sequencing is one of the most widely used. It relies on digesting DNA with specific restriction enzymes and performing size selection on the resulting fragments. Despite its acknowledged utility, this method is of limited use with degraded DNA samples, such as those isolated from museum specimens, as these samples are less likely to harbor fragments long enough to comprise two restriction sites making possible ligation of the adapter sequences (in the case of double-digest RAD) or performing size selection of the resulting fragments (in the case of single-digest RAD). Here, we address these limitations by presenting a novel method called hybridization RAD (hyRAD). In this approach, biotinylated RAD fragments, covering a random fraction of the genome, are used as baits for capturing homologous fragments from genomic shotgun sequencing libraries. This simple and cost-effective approach allows sequencing of orthologous loci even from highly degraded DNA samples, opening new avenues of research in the field of museum genomics. Not relying on the restriction site presence, it improves among-sample loci coverage. In a trial study, hyRAD allowed us to obtain a large set of orthologous loci from fresh and museum samples from a non-model butterfly species, with a high proportion of single nucleotide polymorphisms present in all eight analyzed specimens, including 58-year-old museum samples. The utility of the method was further validated using 49 museum and fresh samples of a Palearctic grasshopper species for which the spatial genetic structure was previously assessed using mtDNA amplicons. The application of the method is eventually discussed in a wider context. As it does not rely on the restriction site presence, it is therefore not sensitive to among-sample loci polymorphisms in the restriction sites that usually causes loci dropout. This should enable the application of hyRAD to analyses at broader evolutionary scales.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>N. Alvarez and N.

The cost of genome sequencing has substantially dropped over the last decade and repositories now encompass an incredible amount of genomic data, which has opened avenues for the emerging field of ecological genomics. However, when working at the population level&#x02014;at least in eukaryotes&#x02014;sequencing whole genomes still lies beyond the capacities of most laboratories, and a number of techniques targeting a subset of the genome have been developed [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151651.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among the most popular are approaches relying on hybridization capture of exome [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] or conserved fragments of the genome [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], RNA sequencing (RNAseq [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]), and Restriction-Associated-DNA sequencing (RADseq [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151651.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). The latter has been developed in many different versions, but generally relies on specific enzymatic digestion and further selection of a range of DNA fragment sizes. RAD-sequencing has proved to be a cost- and time-effective method of SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) discovery, and currently represents the best tool available to tackle questions in the field of molecular ecology. The wide utility of RAD-sequencing in ecological, phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies is however limited by two main factors: i) the quality of the starting genomic DNA; ii) the degree of divergence among the studied specimens, that translates into DNA sequence polymorphism at the restriction sites targeted by the RAD protocols.</p><p>Sequence polymorphism at the DNA restriction site causes a progressive loss of shared restriction sites among diverging clades and results in null alleles for which sequence data cannot be obtained. This limitation critically reduces the number of orthologous loci that can be surveyed across the complete set of analyzed specimens and leads to biased genetic diversity estimates [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This phenomenon, combined with other technical issues&#x02013;such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) competition effects&#x02013;is a serious limitation of most classic RAD-sequencing protocols that needs to be addressed.</p><p>In addition, RAD-sequencing protocols rely on relatively high molecular weight DNA (especially for the ddRAD protocol [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]), notably because enzyme digestion and size selection of resulting fragments are the key steps for retrieving sequence data across orthologous loci. Therefore, RAD-sequencing cannot be applied to degraded DNA samples, a limitation also shared by classical genotyping methods and amplicon sequencing. Museum collections, although encompassing samples covering large spatial areas and broad temporal scales, have not necessarily ensured optimal conditions for DNA preservation. As a result, many museum specimens yield highly fragmented DNA&#x02013;even for relatively recently collected samples [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], limiting their use for molecular ecology, conservation genetics, phylogeographic and phylogenetic studies [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151651.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A cost-effective and widely applied approach for genomic analyses on museum specimens would allow exploring often unique biological collections, e.g., encompassing rare or now extinct taxa/lineages or organisms occurring ephemerally in natural habitats and posing problems for sampling. It would also allow studying temporal shifts in genetic diversity using historical collections, now applied only in a handful of cases at a genomic scale [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Hybridization-capture methods have been acknowledged as a promising way to address both the allele representation and DNA quality limitations [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151651.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Such approaches however usually rely on prior genome/transcriptome knowledge and until recently have been largely confined to model organisms. Addressing this limitation, the recent development of UltraConserved Elements (UCE [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151651.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]) or anchored hybrid enrichment [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] capture-based methods allowed targeting homologous loci at broad phylogenetic scales using one set of probes. It however requires a time-consuming design and costly synthesis of the probes for capturing the DNA sequences of interest. Similarly, exon capture techniques, recently applied in the field of museum genomics [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], require fresh specimens for RNA extraction or synthesizing the probes based on the known transcriptome.</p><p>Here, we present an approach we called &#x02018;hybridization RAD&#x02019; (hyRAD), in which DNA fragments, generated using double digestion RAD protocol (ddRAD [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]) applied to fresh samples, are used as hybridization-capture probes to enrich shotgun libraries in the fragments of interest. Our method thus combines the simplicity and relatively low cost of developing RAD-sequencing libraries with the power and accuracy of hybridization-capture methods. This enables the effective use of low quality DNA and limits the problems caused by sequence polymorphisms at the restriction site. Moreover, utilizing standard ddRAD and shotgun sequencing protocols allows application of the hyRAD protocol in laboratories already utilizing the abovementioned methods, for little cost.</p><p>In short, the hyRAD approach consists of the following steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151651.g001">Fig 1</xref>):</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>generation of a ddRAD library based on high-quality DNA samples, narrow size selection of the resulting fragments and removing adapter sequences;</p></list-item><list-item><p>biotinylation of the resulting fragments, hereafter called the probes;</p></list-item><list-item><p>construction of a shotgun sequencing library from DNA samples (either fresh or degraded as in museum specimens);</p></list-item><list-item><p>hybridization capture of the resulting shotgun libraries on the probes;</p></list-item><list-item><p>sequencing of enriched shotgun libraries and optionally of the ddRAD library (probes precursor) for further use as a reference;</p></list-item><list-item><p>bioinformatic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151651.g002">Fig 2</xref>): assembly of the reads into contigs, alignment to the sequenced ddRAD library or <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, SNP calling.</p></list-item></list><fig id="pone.0151651.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0151651.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Lab-work procedure used for hyRAD development.</title><p>Homologous reads from shotgun genomic libraries are captured through hybridization on random RAD-based probes.

We thus evaluate the number of captured loci homologous to those retrieved by sequencing the RAD-seq libraries.However, different factors affect signal to noise ratio (i.e. the proportion of fragments homologous with the probe) in the captured libraries and can decrease the numbers of homologous fragments retrieved.</p><sec id="sec011"><title>Vsearch RAD loci clustering (RAD-ref)</title><p>High quality reads of RAD probes were clustered by similarity using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://insidedna.me/link/rWYf">Vsearch</ext-link> [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] to obtain loci for further mapping the reads from the hybridization-capture libraries.

To obtain the most reliable contigs across samples, Vsearch was run in two iterations. During the first iteration, we obtained consensus clusters at the within-individual level (i.e. clustering of the raw reads for each sample independently). During the second iteration, Vsearch was run on the consensus clusters obtained from the first iteration. The second iteration allowed us to obtain consensus clusters at the among-individual level. For both iterations we ran Vsearch with various identity thresholds (0.51, 0.61, 0.71, 0.81, 0.83, 0.91, 0.93, 0.96, 0.98 for the within-individual level and 0.51, 0.61, 0.71, 0.81, 0.85, 0.88 for the among-individual level) in order to identify an optimal identity threshold for clustering, i.e. a threshold that maximizes the number of clusters with a minimal coverage of 2x and 3x, respectively. In all cases, we used the cluster_fast option for clustering. The consensus sequences of each secondary cluster were then used as locus references in subsequent alignment and SNP calling steps.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Vsearch RAD loci clustering and extension using captured reads (RAD-ref-ext)</title><p>To obtain RAD-ref-ext, we iteratively extended contigs of the RAD-ref using reads from the hybridization-capture library (by pooling reads contributed by all the analysed specimens) using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://insidedna.me/link/pBHd">PriceTI</ext-link> [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] with 30 cycles of extension and a minimum overlap of a sequence match to 30.

This is an interesting result as BLAST analyses on the six catalogs did not retrieve differences in the level of known contaminants (see below).</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Loci overlap among the assembly methods</title><p>About 15.2% of the reference loci obtained via <italic>de novo</italic> assembly were shared with those based on the clustering of RAD-seq reads (either RAD-ref or RAD-ref-ext; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151651.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In contrast, an appreciable fraction of the obtained reference loci (59.7%) were unique to the assembly-ref approach. When mapping raw RAD reads on RAD-ref, 26.3% did not map, 42.4% mapped once and 31.3% mapped more than once. This shows that RAD-ref summarizes ca. &#x000be; of the reads from the RAD dataset. In contrast, when mapping raw RAD reads on assembly-ref, 78,3% of reads did not map, 21,6% mapped once and 0,1% mapped more than once. This result shows that assembly-ref possibly contains three quarters of all loci that are not homologous to the RAD probes. Such low signal to noise ratio (targeted reads to the number of total reads) is most likely a result of background carryover in the hybridization capture step, a phenomenon which can have many sources., It could result from &#x02018;daisy-chaining&#x02019; of the captured fragments [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151651.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], where partially complementary DNA molecules hybridize with the other fragments that are already hybridized to the probes. We can however discard this explanation as a primary reason for the background carryover as extending of RAD probes did not produce longer contigs (in RAD-ref-ext assemblies). Another likely reason could be carryover of random DNA fragments with repetitive sequences. The extent of such process can be significantly reduced by adding blocking agents to the hybridization mix (typically Cot-1 as was performed for the <italic>O</italic>.<italic>decorus</italic> dataset [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] or salmon sperm DNA), as well as optimizing hybridization temperature and wash stringency to increase capture efficiency. Such developments are desirable because they increase the percentage of reads matching the loci of interest and eventually improve the overall sequencing coverage.</p><fig id="pone.0151651.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0151651.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Number of loci obtained using different bioinformatic approaches, identified using the OrthoMCL [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] pipeline for orthology detection.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0151651.g005"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Effects of sample preparation and age on the numbers of SNPs obtained and the exogeneous DNA content</title><p>Reads can be mapped on a reference either once with a highest score (i.e., single mapping) or on more than one region of reference with close scores (i.e., multi mapping). The reasons for multi-mapping events can be biological (e.g., paralog sequences) or technical (splitting single loci into more reference loci), nevertheless these mapping events cannot be used for SNP calling and offer another benchmark for the assembly methods used. Differences in the number of single mapping events and in the numbers of SNPs obtained were not substantial between sonicated and non-sonicated samples, and depended on the sample age and the bioinformatic pipeline used (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151651.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151651.g004">4</xref>). We expected that museum specimens should perform better without sonication, as the DNA was already visibly fragmented, and sonication of museum specimens may increase the levels of exogenous DNA contamination (by fragmenting intact fungal or bacterial DNA contaminating museum samples; M. Meyer, pers. comm.). In terms of mapping events, whereas the fresh sample usually showed a better ratio of single- to multi-mapping events when sonicated, there was a trend towards a higher percentage of unique mapping events for non-sonicated 30-years old museum specimens, on average 1.3 times higher, irrespective of the reference used (the difference was less clear for 58-years old museum specimens, and depended on the reference used). We would therefore advise not to sonicate DNA obtained from the museum specimens, which significantly cuts down the price and time required for library preparation, except in cases when no signs of degradation are observable on the DNA profile. As levels of DNA degradation of contemporary samples may vary, one may consider that the sonication step should be advisable when working with well-preserved DNA. However, this is still an open question, as whereas BLAST searches did not retrieve higher fractions of contaminants in sonicated <italic>vs</italic>. non-sonicated libraries, the expected population structure was retrieved was the non-sonicated one mapped on assembly-ref.</p><p>As one of the main types of post-mortem DNA degradation is deamination of cytosines, highly damaged ancient or museum DNA samples are usually characterized by higher uracil content [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In classical library preparation protocols, the usage of a proofreading polymerases should stall the chain elongation in the presence of uracil and thus reduce the misincorporation errors in the final dataset. On the other hand this approach might not be optimal for highly degraded ancient DNA samples, where a large fraction of DNA fragments may carry cytosine to uracil misincorporations [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Moreover the usage of a proofreading polymerase does not prevent the misincorporations caused by direct deamination of methylated cytosine to thymine, or less common deamination of guanidine to adenine [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151651.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In the protocol used above [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the second strand synthesis was performed using Klenow Fragment (3&#x02019; &#x02192; 5&#x02019; exo-), lacking proofreading ability, and thus approximately half of the resulting DNA fragments should have cytosine to uracil misincorporation substituted for thymine, amplifiable by proofreading DNA polymerase. We thus opted for a bioinformatic post-processing way of filtering-out such bases. Post-mortem damage in the sequenced samples was assessed by mapDamage2.0, which rescales sequence files by downscaling quality scores of likely post-mortem damaged bases. As some SNPs became filtered by lower quality scores after the rescaling, the number of SNPs is decreased after mapDamage2.0. We expected higher number of discarded SNPs in the oldest samples, because of a higher proportion of DNA damage occurring with time. The proportion of SNPs discarded after applying mapDamage2.0 was the highest among the 58 years old samples (1.46% for RAD-ref; 1.89% for RAD-ref-ext; 2.36% for assembly-ref), although relatively low, given the samples&#x02019; age and preservation type (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151651.s005">S1 Table</xref>).</p><p>It is worth mentioning, that the higher number of SNPs detected in libraries from museum specimens, comparing to the fresh samples, is not an effect of post-mortem damage (an opposite trend was detected with the higest proportion of type II transitions to transitions [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and transversions present in the fresh specimens; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151651.s004">S4 Fig</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Application: spatial genetic structure of <italic>Oedaleus decorus</italic></title><p>The <italic>de novo</italic> reference catalog was composed of 408,851 reference contigs.

On average, each of the 49 samples were characterized by 1864 SNPs and each SNP was found in 32 individuals (62.7% of matrix fullness).</p><p>The spatial genetic structure inferred by fastStructure revealed two geographically distinct clades in the west and the east of the Palearctic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151651.g006">Fig 6</xref>).

Despite the differences in single-mapping events among samples of different ages were retrieved, the obtained numbers of SNPs were not significantly different for the two age classes of the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>helle</italic> museum specimens. We obtained around a thousand of SNPs from <italic>L</italic>. <italic>helle</italic> samples up to 58 years old, confirming that it can be successfully applied in the field of museum genomics. The application of the catalog-building method that was the most promising for resolving population genetic structure (i.e., non-sonicated library mapped to assembly-ref) to the grasshopper <italic>O</italic>. <italic>decorus</italic>, confirmed the usefulness of hyRAD to retrieve phylogeographic data using museum samples up to one hundred years old. Our method does not require time-consuming and costly probes design and synthesis, nor access to fresh samples for RNA extraction, making it one of the simplest and most straightforward technique for obtaining orthologous loci from degraded museum samples.</p><p>In the protocol, we applied a modified shotgun library preparation method, optimized for degraded DNA from museum specimens [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the capture protocol presented here can be applied to any type of library preparation, including commercial ones, simplifying the workflow and cutting down the preparation time.</p><p>We also explored several bioinformatic approaches for loci assembly from the captured libraries, a crucial step when working on organisms without a reference genome. Identifying the most appropriate catalog-building method may depend on the goals of each study. In our case, the pipeline that was the best at identifying population structure in the butterfly was relying on a non-sonicated library mapped to the <italic>de novo</italic> reference assembly from captured reads from a single ethanol-preserved specimen, using SOAP<italic>denovo</italic> assembler (assembly-ref). Despite the fact that a maximum of 26% of the obtained sequences mapped to the references and the proportion of single mapping events were not higher than 10% on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151651.g003">Fig 3</xref>), we could successfully call around a thousand of loci in each case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151651.g004">Fig 4</xref>), with high coverage across the samples.</p><p>Importantly from the wetlab protocol perspective, in the hybridization step, we have used blocking oligonucleotides to prevent &#x02018;daisy-chaining&#x02019; of captured sequences by adapter sequences&#x02019; homology. Using a blocking agent preventing similar chaining caused by repetitive sequences (Cot-1 DNA, applied to the grasshopper libraries, see below [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]) as well as optimizing the conditions of hybridization and capture reactions for increased stringency (e.g., by decreasing hybridization temperature and the stringency of the washes using higher concentration of SDS and/or lower concentration of SSC) may further increase the hybridization efficiency and thus the numbers of reads mapping on the reference and reduce the number of low-coverage loci.</p><p>The <italic>de novo</italic> assembly building pipeline produced the largest contig of 2,352 bp for the butterfly and 13,103 bp for the grasshopper dataset. Although the mean length of the assembled contigs was much smaller, our method also allows retrieving longer sequences than the length of the probes used. The reason for this is that captured sequences hybridize with other DNA fragments with homologous sequences, flanking the probe sequence (i.e., &#x02018;daisy-chaining&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151651.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]). This may lead to enrichment across larger fractions of genome, a side effect of our method, that can be utilized for assembly of larger contigs by using longer probes and capturing longer targets.</p><p>The method presented here, although based on the restriction enzyme digestion of DNA to create the random genomic probes, does not depend on the restriction site presence in the captured library. This represents a significant improvement over classical RAD-sequencing datasets, in which increase in the phylogenetic distance among samples is correlated with an increase in the number of missing sites [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], sometimes leading to conflicting signals between RAD- and capture-based datasets [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], or are characterized by the presence of null alleles that lead to heterozygosity or <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>ST</italic></sub> underestimation [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151651.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this aspect, our approach is similar to other capture-enrichment protocols, such as UltraConserved Elements [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] or exome-capture [<xref rid="pone.0151651.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with the benefit of much simpler and less expensive probe generation, without access to genome information or fresh specimens for RNA isolation. Not relying on the presence of restriction site, the method presented here should be also useful for broader phylogenetic scales, allowing sequencing homologous loci from more divergent taxa, which would not be possible to retrieve using classical RAD-seq approaches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151651.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Profile of the RAD-probes precursor, the RAD-seq library.</title><p>Left panel, <italic>X</italic>-axis: fragment size (semi-<italic>log</italic> scale); <italic>Y</italic>-axis: fragment density (Relative Fluorescent Units).
