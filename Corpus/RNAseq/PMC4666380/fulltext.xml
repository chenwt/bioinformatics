PCR is a fundamental step in preparing DNA samples for high-throughput sequencing. However, there are errors associated with PCR-mediated amplification. Here we examine the effects of four important sources of error&#x02014;bias, stochasticity, template switches and polymerase errors&#x02014;on sequence representation in low-input next-generation sequencing libraries. We designed a pool of diverse PCR amplicons with a defined structure, and then used Illumina sequencing to search for signatures of each process. We further developed quantitative models for each process, and compared predictions of these models to our experimental data. We find that PCR stochasticity is the major force skewing sequence representation after amplification of a pool of unique DNA amplicons. Polymerase errors become very common in later cycles of PCR but have little impact on the overall sequence distribution as they are confined to small copy numbers. PCR template switches are rare and confined to low copy numbers. Our results provide a theoretical basis for removing distortions from high-throughput sequencing data. In addition, our findings on PCR stochasticity will have particular relevance to quantification of results from single cell sequencing, in which sequences are represented by only one or a few molecules.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>02 December 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA sequencing technologies have improved rapidly during the last two decades. Due to decreased cost and increased speed, DNA sequencing is now a standard technique in molecular biology both for sequence determination and quantification.</p><p>Before a DNA sample can be sequenced, a sequencing library must be prepared from the sample. Although the steps in library preparation vary, the protocol almost always involves polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. However, PCR is imperfect; it introduces both skews and new hybrid or erroneous sequences into the pool of amplified DNA molecules. Our goal here is to obtain a quantitative understanding of various artifacts introduced by PCR.</p><p>Here, using pools of carefully designed amplicons and Illumina sequencing, we theoretically and experimentally investigate four processes known to cause sequence misrepresentation after PCR amplification. First, we studied the effects of PCR bias focusing on variable PCR amplification efficiencies as a function of the GC content of individual sequences. GC bias has often been considered a major source of sequence misrepresentation after PCR. It has carefully been measured in high-throughput sequencing data, and suggestions have been made as how to minimize GC bias (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Second, we studied the stochasticity with which each DNA molecule is amplified at each cycle of PCR. A large body of theoretical work has focused on the stochastic nature of PCR (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), mostly concerning its implications for quantitative PCR (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Few experiments have addressed stochasticity in PCR amplification, however, and we know of no work carefully considering the impact of the stochastic nature of PCR in sequencing data. Third, we studied template switching, a process by which two templates combine to form a novel chimeric product during amplification (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Template switching has previously received attention in the metagenomics community, and tools have been developed to detect and remove such chimeric sequences from pyrosequencing data (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). While elegant, these tools do not provide a quantitative model of how and when template switches occur, and therefore cannot inform future experimental designs. Finally, we studied polymerase errors and their impact on sequencing results. Again, polymerase errors have long been recognized as important, and tools have been developed to remove erroneous sequences from high throughput sequencing data sets; but little is known about the relative magnitude of polymerase errors compared with other unintended effects of PCR (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>For each of the four processes considered in this work, we formulated a mathematical framework, looked for signatures of the process in sequencing data, and compared our theoretical predictions with the experimental data. Our main conclusion is that PCR stochasticity is the most significant source of skewed sequence representation in our low-input, high-throughput sequencing data sets. Polymerase errors are the next most important source of error. However, erroneous sequences are limited to small copy numbers, and thus have only a small effect on overall sequence representation. GC bias and template switches have only minor effects on sequence representation after amplification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>DNA oligos and PCR</title><p>We ordered four <italic>ultramers</italic> from Integrated DNA Technologies: three different types of barcode pairs (BC1-BC1, BC2-BC2 and BC3-BC3) and an adapter oligonucleotide (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). BC1-BC1, BC2-BC2 and BC3-BC3 contain the Illumina P5-SBS3T sequence followed by a 20 nucleotide barcode, the PhiC31 phage Attachment site L (AttL) sequence and another 20 nucleotide barcode.

The adapter oligonucleotide is 5&#x02032; phosphorylated and contains a 15 nucleotide barcode. This barcode acts as a varietal tag (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and is used to count the absolute copy number of input sequences.

When molecule numbers are small, the binomial distribution is poorly approximated by a Gaussian distribution. It is therefore essential to explicitly calculate the binomial distribution of offspring molecules in the early cycles of PCR. However, later in PCR, when molecule numbers exceed around 20 copies, the binomial distribution is efficiently approximated by a Gaussian distribution (Law of large numbers). In our analysis we exactly calculated the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of copy numbers after PCR for the first 15 cycles, and then switch to a Gaussian approximation for computational ease.</p><p>To obtain the exact PDF for the first 15 cycles of PCR, we proceeded as follows. Let us use the vector <bold>S</bold> to denote the distribution of copies of a given barcode-pair after <italic>j</italic> cycles. Each element <bold>S</bold>(<italic>i</italic>) of <bold>S</bold> is the probability of having <italic>i</italic> &#x02212; 1 copies. Thus, <bold>S</bold>(1) is the probability of having 0 copies, <bold>S</bold>(2) of having 1 copy, etc. If <bold>S</bold>(3) = 1, it means the probability distribution is a delta function at exactly two copies; if <bold>S</bold>(2) = 0.5 and <bold>S</bold>(3) = 0.5, it means there is a 50-50 chance of having two or three copies. (Note that the largest nonzero element of <bold>S</bold> must in general be &#x02264;2<sup><italic>j</italic></sup>, so the length of <bold>S</bold> must be &#x02264;2<sup><italic>j</italic> + 1</sup>.)</p><p>Our approach is to find an updating matrix <bold>M</bold> such that the distribution of copies <bold>S</bold>&#x02032; on the next cycle is given by <bold>S</bold>&#x02032; = <bold>M</bold><bold>S</bold>.</p><p>This formulation exploits the Markovian nature of the process, namely it does not matter how we ended up with k copies on a given cycle; all that matters is we have k copies. To determine the elements of <bold>M</bold>, we first consider an easier problem. Suppose there are k copies on a given cycle; what is the expected distribution of copies on the next cycle? The number of new copies is given by a binomial distribution with parameters k and P; the distribution of total number of copies is k + the number of new copies. Thus, for cases of the distribution <bold>S</bold> where <bold>S</bold>(<italic>i</italic>) is a delta function (S(i)=1), we have <italic>B</italic>(<italic>i</italic>, <italic>P</italic>) = <bold>M S</bold>(<italic>i</italic>) where B(i,P) is a binomial shifted by i. This means that the <italic>i</italic><sup><italic>th</italic></sup> column of <bold>M</bold> is B(i,P).</p><p>The calculation of the PDF after 15 cycles can be found in <italic>exactpdf.m</italic>&#x000a0;in the Supplementary Data.</p><p>To approximate the PDF after more than 15 cycles, we used the exact PDF after 15 cycles as a starting point.

After ligation of a 3&#x02032; adaptor that allows single molecule counting (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), these barcode pairs are flanked by two constant sequences that are required for Illumina sequencing, and which also act as PCR primer binding sites during library preparation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> left).</p><p>We subjected about 5000 of the ligated oligonucleotides to 25 cycles of PCR, and sequenced the resulting library for two independent replicates (data sets ZL037 and ZL052; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). We chose 25 PCR cycles to avoid the plateau phase of PCR, while still ensuring sufficient PCR product to obtain a high quality sequencing library. We selected AccuPrime Pfx as PCR enzyme for its superior accuracy, specificity and robustness to GC rich sequences (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The relatively low number of input oligonucleotides ensures a high sequencing depth of all input sequences, such that sampling effects during sequencing can be ignored. We expect every input molecule to have a unique sequence, as we used very few input molecules and the combinatorial space of all possible barcode sequences is very large (40 random barcode nucleotides; 4<sup>40</sup> &#x02248; 10<sup>24</sup> possible combinations). This implies that every barcode pair is present at equal abundance in the input DNA pool (i.e. single copy) and should therefore be read out at approximately equal read counts in the sequencing results.</p><p>We plotted the experimental sequencing read counts for every barcode pair (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> right) sorted from the most abundant to least abundant barcode, that is by sequence rank, where rank 1 is the most abundant sequence. For each data set, we find that the most abundant barcode pairs are present at similar read counts, forming a plateau in the plot. This plateau is followed by a shoulder of barcode pairs with intermediate abundance and a long tail of low abundance barcode pairs.</p><p>Given an equal abundance of all sequences before amplification, we would have naively expected only a plateau. The presence of a shoulder and tail in the experimental data suggests that additional mechanisms are at play. Conceptually, there are a variety of potential artifacts that can be introduced by PCR, each of which will have a different impact on sequence representation after amplification (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">F</xref>). We will address each of these mechanisms in turn.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>Perfect PCR</title><p>We first considered the sequence distribution we should expect given perfect PCR amplification (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

Notwithstanding this caveat, the observed shoulder and tail in our data are unlikely to be formed by GC bias.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-4"><title>Stochastic amplification of low copy number amplicons</title><p>A second source of uneven amplification in PCR is stochasticity. If PCR were perfect, every single molecule would be replicated every cycle. However, PCR is imperfect, so each molecule undergoes replication with a probability of less than 1. For example, if <italic>P</italic><sub>amp</sub> = 0.9, then out of every ten molecules amplified per cycle, PCR will fail to replicate one. This is not particularly concerning when PCR is used on DNA mixtures where every sequence is present in high copy numbers. In this case, the expected 1 + 0.9*1 + 0.1*0 = 1.9 fold increase of molecule numbers of per cycle is sufficient to describe the behavior of PCR.</p><p>However, when sequences are present at very low copy numbers, stochastic amplification may have a significant impact on sequence representation. Consider an example. First, consider a <italic>lucky</italic> amplicon that undergoes replication on the first cycle, so that on cycle 2 there are 2 copies. Further suppose that both copies are <italic>lucky</italic> and again undergo replication, so on cycle 3 there are 4 copies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, red). Compare this to an <italic>unlucky</italic> amplicon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, blue), which fails to get copied both cycles (for <italic>P</italic><sub>amp</sub> = 0.9, this happens (1 &#x02212; <italic>p</italic>)<sup>2</sup> = 0.1<sup>2</sup> = 0.01 or 1% of the time). If their luck evens out and both amplicons get amplified equally during subsequent cycles, the lucky barcode will appear at a copy number of about four times more than the unlucky one. This suggests that the distribution of copy numbers for <italic>P</italic><sub>amp</sub> = 0.9 will range over more than a factor of four. Stochasticity in PCR could therefore explain the shoulder observed in the sequencing trace (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>PCR stochasticity.

This expression is equivalent to modeling PCR as a Galton-Watson process, a stochastic branching process. In this formulation, every node represents one copy of a certain sequence and can give rise to one or two new branches, corresponding to failure or success of amplification on a given cycle.</p><p>Assuming this branching model and a realistic <italic>P</italic><sub>amp</sub> = 0.9, we generated the exact PDF of the copy number <italic>n</italic> of a single sequence, starting with a single molecule at cycle 0. After 15 cycles of PCR, the PDF has a clear global maximum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>): as we would expect, most molecules are amplified most of the time. Interestingly, two further local maxima are discernible at copy numbers of 0.5 and 0.25 of the global maximum, corresponding to sequences that missed out on amplification during either one or two of the first two cycles of PCR. The relative heights of these peaks are determined by <italic>P</italic><sub>amp</sub>.</p><p>During the first few cycles of PCR molecule numbers are low, and stochasticity has a large effect. We therefore expected to find the origin of the observed local maxima in the early cycles of PCR. After one cycle of PCR, the PDF is trivial (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). After two cycles, the PDF still shows only one maximum corresponding to molecules amplified in both cycles. After three cycles, the PDF shows two peaks at <italic>n</italic> = 4 and <italic>n</italic> = 8. To reach copy number 8, the molecules have successfully been amplified at every cycle as 2<sup>3</sup> = 8. To reach <italic>n</italic> = 4, molecules must have failed to replicate during one cycle. The biggest contribution to the probability of <italic>n</italic> = 4 comes from paths where molecules missed out on the first amplification cycle. This fact is immediately obvious when one considers all of the trees giving rise to four branches after three cycles and keeping in mind that a failure to amplify is less likely than success. After 4 cycles, the same structure as observed after 15 cycles becomes apparent. The PDF shows a global maximum at copy number 16 and two local maxima at 0.5 (copy number 8) and 0.25 (copy number 4) of that copy number. When we explicitly calculated the probabilities for these copy numbers, the dominating terms are sequences that failed to amplify on either the first or first two cycles of PCR. A third local maximum is apparent at <italic>n</italic> = 12, which is smoothed out in later cycles. This reasoning confirms that the local maxima in the PDF after 15 cycles correspond primarily to molecules that did not amplify during the first or first two cycles of the PCR reaction.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that stochasticity early in the PCR reaction could generate the observed shoulder in the sequence trace, we approximated the PDF of copy numbers after 25 cycles of PCR with a set of constant PCR efficiencies. We sampled from the resulting PDFs to create a profile of read counts vs sequence rank. With a simulated PCR input of 2900 different sequences, we were able to reproduce a shoulder similar to the one observed in experimental data, with the best fit for <italic>P</italic><sub>amp</sub> = 0.9 (average correlation coefficient of <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.8925 to the three data sets; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). However, the smooth transition of shoulder to tail present in experimental data is missing.</p><p>In conclusion, PCR stochasticity has a large impact on sequence representation after PCR amplification and could give rise to most of the experimentally observed shoulder but not the tail.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>Template switching</title><p>We next investigated processes producing <italic>new</italic> sequences during library preparation. If a new species is generated during PCR amplification, it will likely be amplified in subsequent PCR cycles like one of the original input sequences. It will, however, lag behind these original sequences by at least one cycle, and will thus be observed less frequently after amplification than most input sequences. Generation of new sequences during PCR could therefore contribute to the shoulder and tail of the sequence trace.</p><p>PCR template switching produces hybrid sequences of two sequences already present in the input (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). DNA polymerase can jump from one template to another in a region of complementarity without aborting the nascent DNA strand during PCR. This nascent strand therefore has a new hybrid sequence, where one piece is complementary to the old template and the other piece is complementary to the new template. Similarly, nascent transcripts can be aborted before completion and then might act as primers in a subsequent cycle of PCR, again resulting in a new hybrid species (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Template switching.

Accordingly, template switches will become increasingly common in late cycles of PCR, but will not accumulate to levels comparable to the original input sequences, and should be detectable mostly in the tail of the sequence distribution.</p><p>To test this prediction experimentally, we searched for signatures of template switching in the sequencing results. Our barcode libraries contain two different classes of barcodes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Barcodes of type 1 (BC1) are different from barcodes of type 2 (BC2) at six positions at which the sequence is restricted to either a purine (R=A,G) or a pyrimidine (Y=C,T) base. Based on these anchors, BC1 and BC2 can be reliably distinguished from each other. We started the PCR reaction with a pool of barcode pairs that were either BC1-BC1 pairs or BC2-BC2 pairs for data sets ZL037 and ZL052. Note that BC3-BC3 pairs in the high GC data set ZL053 are lacking the anchor structure present in BC1 and BC2 and were therefore excluded for this analysis. In the absence of template switching, we would expect to observe only the initial barcode pair types in the sequencing data set. However, when we detect a BC1-BC2 or BC2-BC1 pair, this barcode pair must have arisen from a template switch across the constant region between the two barcodes. Using this detection method, we are able to detect half of all template switches.</p><p>We find that template switched reads are present only at low read counts in the tail of the experimental sequence distribution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>), and that their distribution significantly departs from a uniform distribution (<italic>P</italic>-values of 0 for all three data sets by bootstrapping). This is in agreement with the our prediction that template switched sequences are created late in PCR. Accordingly, template switches, as detectable by this metric, produce many new sequences (1234, 16190 and 48153 in ZL037, ZL052 and ZL053, respectively), but make up only a small fraction of all reads (8.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, 7.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> and 2.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>).

During synthesis of a new DNA strand, DNA polymerase makes errors including single nucleotide substitutions and, at a lower rate, small insertions or deletions (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Polymerase error rates strongly depend on experimental conditions, and estimates of error rates vary with the method used to determine polymerase errors. Wild type Taq polymerase is the best studied polymerase used in PCR and is generally used as a relative standard for polymerase fidelity.

Thus on average, out of every 6250 molecules, a new molecule with at least one error will be produced. These new sequences are subsequently amplified during the remaining cycles of PCR just like any other DNA molecule. However, because, by definition, they lag by at least one cycle of PCR, they are less abundant than original sequences. Moreover, the probability of producing new sequences due to polymerase errors is linearly dependent on the number of amplified molecules, and thus increases exponentially during PCR. Taken together, these considerations suggest that polymerase errors are responsible for part of the shoulder but become increasingly more abundant with low copy number. We therefore predict that the lower part of the shoulder and parts of the tail are formed by polymerase errors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Polymerase errors.

The polymerase error rate used for the simulation was independently estimated from the data.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkv717fig6"/></fig><p>To test this prediction experimentally, we used a Hamming distance metric to identify sequences that arose from polymerase errors. The Hamming distance between two sequences is defined as the number of substitutions necessary to go from one to the other. For example, a sequence with a single PCR error will have a Hamming distance of one to its original parent sequence. Using this metric, we cannot directly differentiate between polymerase errors and Illumina sequencing errors. However, if a sequence appears more than twice in our data set, it is unlikely that it arose due to an Illumina sequencing error and therefore is either real or result of a template switch or a polymerase error: at a lower bound quality score of <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>phred</italic></sub> = 30, that is a base calling error rate of 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> per nucleotide, the probability of introducing the <italic>same</italic> sequencing error three times into different copies of the same 40nt barcode pair is 40*0.001<sup>3</sup> = 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>. At a coverage on the order of 10<sup>4</sup> for <italic>real</italic> sequences&#x02014;that is, reads from the plateau of the sequence trace&#x02014;this implies that the probability of introducing the same sequencing error three times into a real barcode pair is 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>*10<sup>4</sup> = 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>. With only roughly 5000 real barcode pairs, sequencing errors in sequences present three or more times are negligible. At fewer than three counts per sequence, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the observed mismatches arise from sequencing errors, especially in the singlet region.</p><p>To further reduce the contribution of sequencing errors to our data set, we sequenced using paired end reads that each span the entire length of the barcode pair, so that every base was sequenced twice. We then determined the consensus sequence of paired end reads using the PEAR tool (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), analyzing only those reads for which a consensus over the whole molecule could be found. Assuming independence of paired end reads, this procedure eliminates the majority of sequencing errors. Taking both read quality and paired end matching arguments into consideration, we will assume that errors identified by the Hamming distance metric arise exclusively from polymerase errors if the sequences have a copy number of more than 2.</p><p>We defined the plateau sequences from scaled rank 1 to 2900 as original parent sequences, and find that we can account for about 84% of all other sequences by a single nucleotide substitution in these original sequences. In contrast, the minimum Hamming distances between all the parent sequences are significantly different from each other, such that they could not be related to each other by polymerase errors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Due to the length of the tail observed in the data, these findings suggest that the vast majority of all unique sequences in the data sets are actually errors, but all occur at low abundance. Indeed we find that while most of the tail sequences are the product of errors, only roughly 1% (1.1%, 1.6%, 1.5% for ZL037, ZL052 and ZL053, respectively) of all reads derive from errors.</p><p>To obtain an independent estimate of the polymerase error rate that does not depend on identifying parent sequences, we quantified polymerase errors by scoring deviations from the expected sequence features of BC1 and BC2 sequences. Each of the defined anchors in BC1 or BC2 is a pair of two purines or two pyrimidines. Any mixed anchor sequence, e.g. AT or CG, therefore must be the result of a substitution. Using these mismatches as measure of polymerase errors, we find that polymerase errors are depleted in the plateau region of the experimental sequence trace (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). The distribution of polymerase errors in this window significantly differs from a uniform distribution as assessed by bootstrapping (<italic>P</italic>-values=0 for ZL037, ZL052 and ZL053 after removal of high GC spike-ins).</p><p>To further quantify the effects of polymerase errors, we estimated the error rate of Accuprime Pfx using our experimental data.

For the three data sets ZL037, ZL052 and ZL053 we obtained values of 0.0008, 0.0012 and 0.0011 respectively.

Studying four processes in the same system allowed us to compare their relative importance directly. Using a carefully designed set of amplicons and mathematical models, we find that PCR stochasticity in the first two or three cycles of PCR greatly affects sequence representation of low copy number sequences after amplification. Polymerase errors, and to a lesser extent template switches, generate new sequences which occur predominantly at low read counts, producing the observed tail in the read distribution. GC bias makes only a minor contribution to the observed sequence misrepresentation in the data.</p><p>Our findings provide a framework for understanding PCR-induced misrepresentations in sequencing data. Our results on PCR stochasticity have direct relevance for any high-throughput sequencing assay with limited starting material, and are of particular relevance to the single cell sequencing community, where the copy number of target sequences is often equal to one. Our findings emphasize the limits imposed by counting statistics in the low input limit on the quantification of RNA or DNA sequences through sequencing. Stochastic amplification in the first rounds in PCR amplification may contribute to the uneven coverage observed in copy number analyses of single cells (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) or variation of transcript abundance in single cell RNAseq (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Indeed, variation of transcript abundance increases with decreasing copy number (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>To overcome the limits imposed by stochasticity, a number of quantitative tools have been developed to assess and even deconvolve technical and biological noise in single cell RNAseq studies (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In parallel to these computational efforts, experimental techniques have been developed to minimize PCR induced distortions in low input sequencing experiments. Techniques like multiple displacement amplification (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), antisense RNA amplification (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) or multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) aim to minimize the use of PCR. These approaches exploit linear or quasilinear amplification to minimize the rapid accumulation of errors and biases that arise during exponential PCR amplification and therefore allow for better post-amplification quantification of nucleic acids. In contrast, single molecule barcoding techniques (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) still rely on PCR, but compensate for misrepresentations after sequencing. Individual molecules are uniquely labeled before amplification, so that the number of input molecules can be precisely quantified. Our results underscore the importance of such strategies in cases where copy numbers &#x0003c;8 must be quantitatively resolved.</p><p>The introduction of new sequences, through polymerase errors or template switches, are of particular interest in environmental genomic applications where the 16S rRNA gene from a diverse pool of microbes is sequenced to determine the composition of the population. These studies aim to to determine the true number of different 16S rRNA sequences in the data set, which act as a measure of the number of distinct microbial species in the pool. Algorithms have been developed to remove single nucleotide polymerase and sequencing errors (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), as well as chimeric sequences (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), from high-throughput data. However, because the goal of these algorithms is to identify and remove errant sequences, they do not quantitatively address the distortions in the representation of single molecules that arise from high-throughput sequencing. Our work aims to close this gap, and to provide a quantitative and mechanistic basis for updated experimental designs and analyses. Our data suggest that polymerase errors have a clear signature and, given sufficient sequencing depth, are easily distinguished even from rare input sequences by abundance after amplification. We were further able to measure the critical parameter for a model of template switching, so that we can predict how much we have to dilute our input samples to limit chimeric sequences to an acceptable level. We note, that single molecule barcoding strategies should help to experimentally mitigate the problems caused by erroneous sequences introduced during PCR (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Although GC bias has previously been reported to introduce misrepresentations into sequencing data (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), we find that it explains little of the observed sequence misrepresentation under our conditions. One reason for this discrepancy may be that effects of GC bias are minimized in our experimental system by the short length of our barcodes. Additionally, we expect that the use of Accuprime polymerase, and of a thermocycler with relatively slow ramp rates (2.5 deg/s), further diminishes the detrimental effects of GC bias (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>We designed the experimental system used in this study to disentangle different sources of PCR induced misrepresentation in sequencing data sets. The artificial design of our PCR amplicons allowed us to carefully measure the magnitude of different distorting effects in PCR in a well controlled setting. At the same time, however, this design means that our system differs from many real world applications of high throughput sequencing, so further work will be needed to assess how our findings generalize.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SEC5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkv717/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p>
