The aim was to identify the extent of altered gene expression in term placentas from pregnant women with late-onset PE and GDM compared to controls. RNAseq identified few significantly differentially regulated genes in placental biopsies between PE, GDM, or uncomplicated pregnancy (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10 each group). Five genes were altered in placentas from PE including 4 non-coding genes and Angiopoietin 2 (<italic>ANGPT2</italic>). No genes were significantly regulated by GDM. In contrast, many genes were significantly regulated by fetal, maternal and delivery-specific variables, particularly spinal and epidural anesthesia. We selected <italic>ANGPT2</italic> and Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 14 (<italic>CXCL14</italic>) to test with qPCR in a larger set of placentas (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;475) and found no differences between the groups. However, regression analysis revealed a stronger association between placental <italic>ANGPT2</italic> and <italic>CXCL14</italic> mRNA expression and fetal, maternal and delivery-specific variables than diagnostic group. To conclude, the gene expression in term placentas are highly affected by fetal, maternal and delivery specific variables. Few regulated genes were found in late-onset PE and GDM placentas, which may suggest that these conditions could be more affected by maternal factors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The placenta is a composite structure of embryonic and maternal tissues that supplies nutrients and removes waste products from the developing embryo. It also has critical endocrine and immuno-modulatory properties. Up to 10% of pregnancies suffer from abnormal placental development and, as such, are at high risk for complications such as miscarriage, pre-eclampsia (PE), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), fetal growth restriction and preterm birth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.</p><p>Pre-eclampsia is characterized by new-onset hypertension and end-organ damage after 20 weeks of gestation and affects 3&#x02013;5% of all pregnancies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. PE has a multifactorial etiology and includes several subtypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Early-onset PE generally involves poor placental development, whereas late-onset PE is believed to arise from the interaction between a normal placenta and a damaged maternal microvasculature due, for example, to chronic hypertension or diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The late-onset form of PE may thus be more similar to GDM, in which pregnancy serves as a stress test in predisposed women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. GDM is defined as glucose intolerance of variable degrees first recognized during pregnancy. It may affect up to 20% of pregnant women depending on ethnicity and the diagnostic criteria used<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>The exact mechanisms behind GDM and PE are unclear. Previously, PE and other placental disease-related complications were considered pregnancy-specific and were thought to resolve hours or days after delivery of the placenta. More recently it has become clear that such diseases may contribute to the development of future cardiovascular disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, providing additional need to understand the role of the placenta in the etiology of these disorders. Thus, identifying genes critical for placenta function may serve as a basis for revealing mechanisms underlying both normal and pathologic pregnancies. Gene expression in PE placentas has been extensively studied using microarrays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> and RNA sequencing (RNAseq)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and to a lesser extent in placentas from GDM women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. However, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in these studies vary greatly, likely due to the phenotypic and etiologic heterogeneity of PE and the different diagnostic criteria used for GDM. Furthermore, some factors that may affect placental gene expression and add further heterogeneity between the studies (such as offspring sex and delivery specific variables)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> are rarely acknowledged or accounted for.</p><p>This study investigates the potential of RNAseq to discover novel genes that may encode the prediction and management of PE and GDM. Our aims were: (1) to examine DEGs in placentas from pregnant women with late-onset PE and GDM compared to normal placentas by RNAseq; (2) to identify DEGs in relation to maternal, fetal and delivery-specific variables by RNAseq; and (3) to validate our DEGs identified by RNAseq using RT-qPCR in a larger sample set and to control for the influence of maternal, fetal and delivery-specific variables.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Clinical characteristics</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> shows the characteristics of the study population chosen for RNAseq (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) and validation with RT-qPCR (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;475). In the RNAseq cohorts, as expected, women with GDM had a significantly higher BMI and placental weight and women with PE had a higher DBP at visit 4. In the validation cohort, GDM and PE women had higher BMI, BP, more frequent induction of labor, and shorter duration of labor. In addition, GDM women were older, had higher birth weight and placental weight, had more cesarean deliveries, and were more often nulliparous. Gestational age was shorter in PE women. Women with PE had no indication of poor placental function based on birth weight and the relatively long gestational age underlining the mildness of the phenotype. Blood pressure in the PE patients were higher than 140/90, but we did not have access to exact values after visit 4, and we could therefore not include severity of PE women based on blood pressure. Using World Health Organization (WHO) as opposed to International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria for the diagnosis of GDM, the differences with controls were somewhat attenuated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table 2</xref> compares some maternal, fetal and delivery specific variables between women with and without epidural or spinal anesthesia demonstrating that these groups were comparable for most variables.

Many placental-specific genes were also highly expressed, i.e. the placental lactogens (<italic>CSH1</italic> and <italic>CSH2</italic>), placenta specific glycoproteins (<italic>PSG1</italic>, <italic>PSG3</italic> and <italic>PSG4</italic>, <italic>PSG5</italic> and <italic>PSG9</italic>), pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (<italic>PAPPA</italic>), hCG alpha subunit (CGA), estrogen synthase (<italic>CYP19A1</italic>), ADAM metallopeptidase domain 12 (<italic>ADAM12</italic>), tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (<italic>TFPI2</italic>), and placenta specific 4 (<italic>PLAC4</italic>).

Investigating maternal confounding variables using all 30 samples, 16 DEGs were detected between primiparous compared to multiparous women. Of these, 15 were downregulated and 1 was upregulated in the multiparous women (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Some of these genes are involved in placentation and inflammation, i.e. pentraxin 3 (<italic>PTX3</italic>), chemokine (C-X3-C motif) receptor 1 (<italic>CX3CR1</italic>), and TSC22 domain family, member 3 (<italic>TSC22D3</italic>). Nine DEGs were detected between low and high BMI patients at visit 4.

Women who received general anesthesia (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) and pudendal block (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) were excluded from these analyses. Some DEGs were similar between epidural and spinal anesthesia (e.g., keratins), but there were also specific differences in the gene signature depending on the anesthesia type. In particular, 9 transcripts for heat shock proteins (Hsp) belonging to the Hsp70 and Hsp40 family were abundantly expressed and increased in placentas from women who received epidural anesthesia. In addition, myeloperoxidase (<italic>MPO</italic>), a marker of neutrophil activation, was enhanced in women who received epidural anesthesia. In women who received spinal anesthesia, genes involved in the regulation of immune responses including several immunoglobins (e.g. <italic>IGHG2, IGJ, IGCL2, MARCH1</italic>) and chemokines (<italic>CXCL9/10</italic>) were differentially increased. With regard to differences relating to type of delivery, 1 DEG was downregulated in the women who delivered by cesarean, and 7 DEGs were upregulated in the placentas of women with a longer duration of labor, while no DEGs were associated with induction of labor.</p><p>For fetal confounding variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), 51 DEGs were associated with offspring&#x02019;s sex. Thirty-seven were upregulated and 14 were downregulated when using males as the reference. Most of these were sex-specific chromosomal genes. We found 4 DEGs between the median high and low placental weights. Three were upregulated and 1 was downregulated in those with the highest placental weight.

Using this approach, few genes were differentially expressed between these groups. In contrast, maternal, delivery-specific, and fetal variables were associated with altered expression of multiple genes in the term placenta. In particular, spinal and epidural anesthesia were unexpectedly associated with a significant upregulation of heat shock protection and immunomodulatory genes. When using qPCR in a larger cohort to validate the most highly differentially regulated genes in late-onset PE and GDM placentas identified in the RNAseq experiment (namely, <italic>ANGPT2</italic> and <italic>CXCL14</italic>), we noted that maternal, delivery-specific, and fetal variables were stronger predictors of gene expression than the diagnostic group. These results suggest that maternal, delivery, and fetal variables substantially contribute to placental gene expression and should be considered when designing and evaluating such studies.</p><p>Samples chosen for RNAseq were well matched by clinical criteria and the RNA was of acceptable quality with a small percentage of contamination by maternal decidual and nucleated blood cells (~2%). This is similar to data published by S&#x000f5;ber <italic>et al</italic>. following a single wash with phosphate buffer saline and stabilization in RNA-later solution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Furthermore, the most abundantly expressed genes identified in the term placenta were ones known to be involved in placental function, with good overlap with transcripts identified in previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. For the sex specific genes, 15 and 19 of the DEGs identified in the current study corresponded with prior publications by S&#x000f5;ber <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and Buckberry <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, respectively. Other DEGs associated with offspring sex in the current study were either non-functional genes expressed at low levels or sex specific genes (i.e. <italic>TSIX, TXNLGY, DDX3X, TTTY14, TBL1X</italic>, <italic>TBL1Y</italic> and <italic>TTTY10</italic>) not reported in the prior manuscripts. Totally from the 51 DEGs, 28 were located on the Y-Chromosome while 12 were located on the X-Chromosome. Taken together, the similarities in gene expression, related to abundance and offspring sex, with previous studies as well as the low maternal contamination supports the validity of our placental RNA samples.</p><p>A major finding in this study was the significant impact of epidural and spinal anesthesia on placental gene expression. To our knowledge, this has not been previously reported. Since women receiving epidural may be more likely to experience hyperthermia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, the increased expression of mRNAs coding for members of the HSP family could reflect the heat shock response, a switch in transcription and translation to preferentially express HSP&#x02019;s that may preserve essential proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Other relevant causes of increased HSP expression due to different kinds of stress could be infection, inflammation, hypoxia, injury and also adrenaline, which is a component in epidural anesthesia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In particular, we identified a higher expression of the genes encoding HSP70, a HSP frequently studied in placental disease that may also confer harmful effects on binding to toll-like receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Of note, increased expression of HSP70 protein has been demonstrated in the placenta of women with PE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and in relation to delivery-specific variables, such as preterm labor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. In contrast, we found no significant association between HSP expression and mode of delivery, induction and duration of labor, or presence of PE. Several studies suggest that underlying maternal inflammation may confer increased risk of fever following epidural anesthesia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. However, apart from increased <italic>MPO</italic> mRNA levels in women receiving epidural, possibly reflecting neutrophil activation during the hyperthermic response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, few inflammatory genes were differentially regulated. In contrast, the use of spinal anesthesia was associated with enhanced mRNA expression of several inflammatory genes, including <italic>IGJ, CXCL9</italic> and <italic>CXCL10</italic>, all chemokines specific for T cell signaling through the CXCR3 receptor. Activation of CXCR3 signaling has been implicated in the onset of labor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Raman <italic>et al</italic>. identified enhanced IGJ expression as the most distinguishable feature of chronic placental inflammation in addition to CXCL9 and other inflammatory components from T and B cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Activation of opioid receptors increases the expression of CXCL10 in circulating immune cells <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> and in the spinal cord in experimental animal models <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The use of anesthesia may reflect underlying obstetric conditions and we cannot excluded that the differences in mRNA expression observed for use of epidural and spinal anesthesia may results from longer acting mechanisms and systemic stress responses of the mother.</p><p>For maternal confounding variables, the expression of genes involved in inflammation and placentation (i.e., <italic>CX3CR1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, <italic>TSC22D3</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> and <italic>PTX3</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> were associated with parity, indicating that women who have had a prior pregnancy may respond differently to the presence of invading trophoblast compared to nulliparous women. Adipsin expression, which is shown to be abundant in adipose tissue, was increased in the placentas of women with high BMI at term, and placentas from obese women have been shown to secrete higher levels of adipsin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.</p><p>Surprisingly few genes were differentially expressed in the placentas of women with late-onset PE at term and none in the placentas of women with GDM.

The result of two recent meta-analyses found few common genes regulated in PE placentas compared to controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Using unsupervised clustering of 7 microarray data sets, Leavey <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> found a large degree of co-clustering of PE and control samples suggesting no distinct gene signature in PE. Direct comparison with previous studies is difficult since these mainly have focused on early-onset PE, a separate entity from late-onset PE as demonstrated in a recent micro-array study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.

For one specific DEG, ZDHHC8P1, we found increased expression in late-onset PE patients which were in contrast to their results were it was downregulated in their late-onset PE.

This could imply that milder forms of preeclampsia that meet diagnostic criteria may in fact involve no underlying placental pathology and therefore may technically represent gestational hypertension with concomitant kidney dysfunction. It&#x02019;s possible these cases may respond well to standard antihypertensive therapy and not require the termination of pregnancy.</p><p>As for GDM, previous studies evaluating gene expression have been performed in mixed cohorts (i.e. women with both PE in addition to GDM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, in women on insulin therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, using different diagnostic criteria, or with very small sample numbers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, making comparisons difficult. Since our patients were not on insulin, it may be reasonable to assume that they have a milder GDM phenotype compared to other studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Importantly, excluding some differences in BMI and placental weights (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), the major confounding maternal, delivery-specific and fetal variables were similar between our three comparison groups (late-onset PE, GDM and controls). Furthermore, when validating <italic>ANGPT2</italic> and <italic>CXCL14</italic> gene expression in the larger cohort, maternal, fetal and delivery-specific covariates were by far the strongest determinants of their expression. Since the objective of expression analysis is to identify unique expression patterns for distinct disease entities and not necessarily the effect of confounding conditions, our results highlight the importance of well characterized phenotypes to allow for accurate matching and relevant comparison between groups.</p><p>Several limitations of this study should be emphasized. The quality of the RNA could have been better. Five out of 30 RNAseq samples had RIN values below 7, and additional 8 samples had values below 8. However, we judged them to be of acceptable quality as judged by electropherograms. The placenta is a heterogeneous tissue and the biopsy was taken from the placental parenchyma. Other parts and specific cells of the placenta may be more important when investigating genes regulated in PE and GDM. Only one biopsy was taken from each placenta and the collection was performed by different individuals. While the technique for placental biopsy was standardized, we cannot exclude the possibility that biopsies were taken at different sites and that regional differences may have accounted for differences in DEGs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Also, only term placentas were used in our analysis. While this ensures that appropriate control placentas will be available for comparison, it does represent the endpoint of a chronic disease state. It is likely that mRNA expression profiles at an earlier stage will be more reflective of the origin and pathogenesis of the disease and may be more likely to yield a distinctive fingerprint. This is especially true of PE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Also, as we studied late-onset PE, our results cannot be applied to the spectrum of PE. Finally, we have incomplete information about the precise timing from when the placenta was delivered to when the biopsy was taken and the tissue stored at &#x02212;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.</p><p>In conclusion, the current study shows that confounding variables have a greater influence on gene expression in term placenta than do underlying disease states (such as late-onset PE and GDM). We found few genes significantly differentially regulated between late-onset PE, GDM and control placenta, suggesting that maternal factors may be more important than placental (fetal) factors, in the genesis of these pregnancy-specific conditions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study population</title><p>The STORK study was a prospective cohort study with a longitudinal design in which 1031 low-risk women of Scandinavian heritage who planned to deliver at Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, between 2002 and 2008 were followed throughout their pregnancy.
