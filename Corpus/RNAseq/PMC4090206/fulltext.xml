It has important functions during embryonic development, is involved in cancer stem cell maintenance, and is often deregulated in cancer. The mechanism of <italic>SOX2</italic> regulation has yet to be clarified, but the <italic>SOX2</italic> gene lies in an intron of a long multi-exon non-coding RNA called <italic>SOX2 overlapping transcript</italic> (<italic>SOX2OT</italic>). Here, we show that the expression of <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>SOX2OT</italic> is concordant in breast cancer, differentially expressed in estrogen receptor positive and negative breast cancer samples and that both are up-regulated in suspension culture conditions that favor growth of stem cell phenotypes. Importantly, ectopic expression of <italic>SOX2OT</italic> led to an almost 20-fold increase in <italic>SOX2</italic> expression, together with a reduced proliferation and increased breast cancer cell anchorage-independent growth. We propose that <italic>SOX2OT</italic> plays a key role in the induction and/or maintenance of <italic>SOX2</italic> expression in breast cancer.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding for this work was obtained from the New Zealand Breast Cancer Foundation, the Maurice and Phyllis Paykel trust, Auckland Medical Research Foundation, and the Robert McClelland Trust.

However, TamC3 and TamR3 exhibit strongly reduced mTOR signaling <xref rid="pone.0102140-Leung1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, together with decreased glycolysis rates and increased sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs (unpublished data), suggesting that <italic>SOX2</italic> expression is coupled to mTOR pathway utilization. This is consistent with the results of Corominas-Faja <italic>et al</italic> suggesting that low utilization of the mTOR pathway is associated not only with low <italic>SOX2</italic> expression but also with reduced stem cell properties <xref rid="pone.0102140-CorominasFaja1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, and inhibition of mTOR disrupts pluripotency and represses <italic>SOX2</italic> expression <xref rid="pone.0102140-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. It is possible that decreased mTOR pathway utilization in TamC3 and TamR3 has contributed to the repressed <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>SOX2OT</italic> expression observed. Hence, we compared the ability of these lines to form mammospheres. The resistant line TamR3 was found to be less efficient than MCF-7 parental cells in mammosphere formation and they formed only compact spheroids (data not shown). This supports the hypothesis that <italic>SOX2</italic> expression, mTOR pathway utilization and stem cell functions have mechanistic relationships.</p><p>In conclusion, an earlier observation that the <italic>SOX2OT</italic> locus has complex architecture and is important during vertebrate development in a number of systems <xref rid="pone.0102140-Amaral1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> has been extended in this study to a series of human breast cancer lines. The previous suggestion that <italic>SOX2OT</italic> plays a role in regulating chromatin structure <xref rid="pone.0102140-Amaral1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> has been extended, to demonstrate a specific effect of <italic>SOX2OT</italic> on <italic>SOX2</italic> regulation, using both expression arrays from human breast cancers, a series of breast cancer cell lines and a single line exhibiting ectopic expression of <italic>SOX2OT</italic>. The results add to the growing picture that emphasizes the importance of non-coding RNA in tumor cell properties.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0102140.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title><bold>Relative expression of </bold><bold><italic>SOX2</italic></bold><bold> and </bold><bold><italic>SOX2OT</italic></bold><bold> in different breast cancer cell lines.</bold> A and B) Relative expression of <italic>SOX2</italic> (A) and <italic>SOX2OT</italic> (B) to <italic>GAPDH</italic> and <italic>HPRT</italic> were measured by qRT-PCR in different breast cancer cell lines.
