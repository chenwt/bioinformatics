The most common biosynthetic route involves trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) synthase OtsA and T6P phosphatase OtsB that generate trehalose from ADP/UDP-glucose and glucose-6-phosphate. In order to assess the drug target potential of T6P phosphatase, we generated a conditional mutant of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> allowing the regulated gene silencing of the T6P phosphatase gene <italic>otsB2</italic>.

By contrast, <italic>otsB2</italic> is not essential for the chronic infection phase in mice, highlighting the substantial remodelling of trehalose metabolism during infection by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>. Blocking OtsB2 resulted in the accumulation of its substrate T6P, which appears to be toxic, leading to the self-poisoning of cells. Accordingly, blocking T6P production in a &#x00394;<italic>otsA</italic> mutant abrogated <italic>otsB2</italic> essentiality. T6P accumulation elicited a global upregulation of more than 800 genes, which might result from an increase in RNA stability implied by the enhanced neutralization of toxins exhibiting ribonuclease activity. Surprisingly, overlap with the stress response caused by the accumulation of another toxic sugar phosphate molecule, maltose-1-phosphate, was minimal. A genome-wide screen for synthetic lethal interactions with <italic>otsA</italic> identified numerous genes, revealing additional potential drug targets synergistic with OtsB2 suitable for combination therapies that would minimize the emergence of resistance to OtsB2 inhibitors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Trehalose biosynthesis is considered an attractive target for the development of new drugs against various microbial pathogens including <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>.

It is required for the viability and/or virulence of several fungal, helminthic and bacterial pathogens, including <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, but not mammals, and is thus considered an attractive target for the development of antimicrobial drugs [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Among other functions in mycobacteria, trehalose provides the sugar scaffold of glycolipids such as trehalose-6,6'-dimycolate (TDM, also known as cord factor) or trehalose-6-monomycolate (TMM). These molecules fulfil crucial roles in the formation of the mycolic acid cell wall layer, either as a structural component (TDM) or as a carrier molecule (TMM) that shuttles mycolic acids from their site of biosynthesis in the cytoplasm to the periplasm, where they serve as substrates of the antigen 85 complex [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Based on bioinformatic analyses and enzymatic <italic>in vitro</italic> characterizations, it appeared that three alternative pathways for trehalose biosynthesis are potentially present in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>: the OtsA-OtsB2, the TreY-TreZ and the TreS pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, we recently demonstrated that trehalose biosynthesis is mediated in mycobacteria only by the OtsA-OtsB2 and TreY-TreZ pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], whereas TreS is involved in the conversion of trehalose to alpha-glucans and therefore consumes, rather than produces, this disaccharide [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the OtsA-OtsB2 pathway, the trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) synthase OtsA catalyzes the transfer of nucleoside diphosphate-activated glucose (ADP-glucose and, to a lesser extent, UDP-glucose [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]) to glucose-6-phosphate to yield T6P with the release of ADP/UDP. Subsequently, T6P phosphatase OtsB2 dephosphorylates T6P to trehalose. The TreY-TreZ pathway releases trehalose from glucose storage polymers using first the maltooligosyltrehalose synthase TreY that converts the terminal &#x003b1;-1,4-glycosidic linkage at the reducing end of an &#x003b1;-1,4-glucan into an &#x003b1;-1,1-bond yielding maltooligosyltrehalose. Maltooligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase TreZ then hydrolytically liberates trehalose. The OtsA-OtsB2 and TreY-TreZ pathways do not contribute equally to trehalose production. A &#x00394;<italic>otsA</italic> (Rv3490) gene deletion mutant was significantly attenuated for <italic>in vitro</italic> growth in trehalose-free medium and in a mouse infection model [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], indicating that the OtsA-OtsB2 pathway is the dominant route for trehalose formation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Surprisingly, in contrast to the genetic dispensability of <italic>otsA</italic> and the growth defect of the &#x00394;<italic>otsA</italic> mutant, the <italic>otsB2</italic> gene (Rv3372) is strictly essential in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> because the gene could not be inactivated even in the presence of exogenous trehalose to chemically complement the biosynthetic defect [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The OtsA-OtsB pathway for trehalose biosynthesis (referred to as TPS-TPP or TPS1-TPS2 in other organisms) is widespread in nature and also conserved in other pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. T6P phosphatase has been shown to contribute to virulence in the pathogenic yeasts <italic>Candida albicans</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and <italic>Cryptococcus gattii</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the filamentous fungi <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, while gene deletion mutants exhibit some growth deficiencies, T6P phosphatase is not strictly required for viability in these organisms under normal <italic>in vitro</italic> culture conditions in contrast to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>.

This promoter cassette (P<italic>myc1</italic>-4&#x000d7;<italic>tetO</italic>) was further engineered to include a hygromycin resistance gene for positive selection and was site-specifically inserted immediately upstream of the start codon of <italic>otsB2</italic> in the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> chromosome via specialized transduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006043.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The resulting knock-in mutant <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> c-<italic>otsB2</italic>-4&#x000d7;<italic>tetO</italic> was subsequently transformed with the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> Tn<italic>10 tetR</italic> gene provided on an episomal plasmid, yielding strain <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> c-<italic>otsB2</italic>-4&#x000d7;<italic>tetO</italic> pMV261::<italic>tetR</italic>-G. In this conditional mutant, hereafter referred to as the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> c-<italic>otsB2</italic>-tet-on mutant, expression of the target gene is repressed in the absence of the inducer anhydrotetracycline (ATc). As expected, growth of the c-<italic>otsB2</italic>-tet-on mutant on solid medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006043.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) and in liquid culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006043.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) was strictly dependent on presence of ATc, with the growth rate in liquid culture being modulated by ATc in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, growth of a vector control strain (i.e. the c-<italic>otsB2</italic>-4&#x000d7;<italic>tetO</italic> knock-in mutant transformed with an empty vector) that expresses <italic>otsB2</italic> constitutively, was not influenced by ATc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006043.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Next, as the integrated synthetic promoter cassette might have polar effects on neighboring genes, we complemented the c-<italic>otsB2</italic>-tet-on mutant with a second copy of the <italic>otsB2</italic> gene under control of the Hsp60 promoter provided on an integrative single-copy plasmid. In this complemented <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> c-<italic>otsB2</italic>-tet-on mutant, which carries a constitutively expressed merodiploid <italic>otsB2</italic> allele, silencing of the endogenous <italic>otsB2</italic> allele in the absence of ATc had no effect on growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006043.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Together these data demonstrate that OtsB2 is strictly required for viability of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> and rule out polar effects or inadvertent secondary mutations that could influence the silencing phenotype. Growth kinetics of the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> c-<italic>otsB2</italic>-tet-on mutant in liquid cultures showed that silencing of <italic>otsB2</italic> was bactericidal and resulted in a moderate killing of ca. 1.5 logs within 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006043.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). An apparent increase of viability of silenced cells after this time point was due to the outgrowth of suppressor mutants, which might have acquired spontaneous or stress-induced mutations compromising the function of the TetR protein or, more likely, the <italic>tet</italic> operator sites, leading to constitutive expression of the target gene and growth of the mutants independent from ATc. Furthermore, also loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>otsA</italic> gene might have given rise to mutants that can grow in absence of ATc as will be discussed below.</p><fig id="ppat.1006043.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1006043.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>OtsB2 is essential for <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>.</title><p>(A) The c-<italic>otsB2</italic>-tet-on mutant strain and a non-regulated vector control strain were grown on Middlebrook 7H10 agar with or without 5 &#x003bc;g/ml ATc.

In addition to tRNAs, several non-coding RNAs were among the most abundant transcripts present in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006043.s011">S1 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006043.s016">S1 Dataset</xref>). One of these highly expressed non-coding RNAs, Rvnc0036a (= MTS2823), was one of the few genes significantly downregulated in response to T6P stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006043.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006043.t001">Table 1</xref>). While its expression appears to correlate with different stresses, its function is unknown [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, the ultrahigh abundance in fully induced cells suggests an important physiological role under the tested culture conditions, and its depletion in partially silenced cells might contribute to the inability to tolerate the toxic effects of T6P accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>OtsB2 is essential for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> to establish an acute infection in mice</title><p>T6P is formed from intermediates of primary sugar metabolism (i.e. glucose-6-phosphate and ADP/UDP-glucose).

To address this question, silencing experiments in a mouse infection model were necessary.</p><p>With the genetic system described here, regulated gene expression relies on the presence of the episomal TetR expression plasmid. Loss of this plasmid would abrogate regulation and result in constitutive expression of the target gene. For stabilization of the episomal TetR expression plasmid in the absence of antibiotics <italic>in vivo</italic>, we employed auxotrophy complementation of the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> &#x00394;<italic>panCD</italic> mutant, which requires pantothenic acid supplementation for <italic>in vitro</italic> growth.

Thus, genetic complementation of the &#x00394;<italic>panCD</italic> deletion from the episomal TetR expression vector should ensure plasmid stabilization during growth in a pantothenic acid-free environment even in the absence of antibiotic pressure.

We therefore performed a genome-wide screen to unravel synthetic lethal interactions with OtsA for the identification of additional targets, which would prevent resistance and result in synergistic killing when inhibited in combination with an OtsB2 inhibitor.

The present study exemplifies that not only is <italic>in vitro</italic> gene essentiality a poor predictor of drug target suitability <italic>in vivo</italic> but also that the vulnerability of a target can change dramatically during the course of an infection. Thus, knowledge of the consequences of inactivation of potential targets during all relevant infection phases is imperative to make realistic predictions of target suitability and efficacy. Accordingly, we assessed OtsB2 as a drug target candidate in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> employing conditional gene silencing <italic>in vitro</italic> and in mice. Despite technical advances in recent years, the study of strictly essential genes in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> using conditional mutants is still a challenging endeavour, particularly in the context of animal infection models. So far, only 13 conditional <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> mutants have been studied in mice (reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]), but just seven of them were made for genes being strictly essential for <italic>in vitro</italic> growth. Six of these essential genes have been shown to be required during both the acute and the chronic infection phase in mice (<italic>nadE</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], <italic>carD</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], <italic>pptT</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], <italic>pimA</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], <italic>bioA</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], <italic>glmU</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]), while <italic>ideR</italic> is also essential for acute infection, but has not specifically been silenced during the chronic phase [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As revealed in this study, <italic>otsB2</italic> is the first example of an essential <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> gene shown to be specifically required only during the acute infection phase in mice.</p><p>Differential OtsB2 essentiality during two infection stages indicates that trehalose metabolism of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> is substantially remodeled <italic>in vivo</italic>. The OtsA-OtsB2 pathway for trehalose biosynthesis dominates in culture and during the acute infection phase. In contrast, this pathway is surprisingly dispensable to maintain viability of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> during the chronic infection phase. This implies that flux through the OtsA-OtsB2 pathway is significantly reduced at later infection stages. This could be achieved by downregulating trehalose production altogether. However, there is evidence that the chronic infection phase in mice does not represent a static equilibrium of slow or nonreplicating bacilli. Rather, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> seems to continue replicating at least at basic level, while counteracting immune killing results in no net increase in organ burden of viable bacteria [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Since trehalose is essential for cell wall assembly during mycobacterial replication, trehalose biosynthesis probably continues at some rate also during chronic infection. Thus, it is more likely that the alternative TreX-TreY-TreZ pathway becomes activated during chronic infection to release trehalose from intracellular &#x003b1;-glucan storage molecules.</p><p>Silencing of <italic>otsB2</italic> in culture has a bactericidal effect whereas it is bacteriostatic <italic>in vivo</italic> during the acute infection phase. A likely explanation for this is a reduced flux through the OtsA-OtsB2 route <italic>in vivo</italic> compared to <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions, so that the level of toxic T6P that accumulates is somewhat less <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, while the OtsA-OtsB2 route clearly dominates during the acute infection phase, the alternative TreX-TreY-TreZ pathway might be already more active early during infection than under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. This is not unusual as we have recently described a similar <italic>in vitro</italic>-<italic>in vivo</italic> difference in flux through alternative sugar metabolic pathways for biosynthesis of maltose-1-phosphate in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Our data conclusively show that essentiality of OtsB2 relies on direct or indirect toxic effects associated with OtsA-mediated T6P accumulation.

Two notable examples of a common signature in T6P- and M1P-stressed cells were the global upregulation of the <italic>arg</italic> operon required for <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis of L-arginine and induction of DNA damage-responsive genes including those of the SOS regulon [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Induction of arginine production has been described as a stress response upon hyperosmotic stress in yeast [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and upon internalization of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> cells by macrophages [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

Therefore, it is conceivable that arginine may play a role as a general small-molecule stress protectant in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, very similar to trehalose [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], to counteract various stresses that may be encountered in the host during infection. However, arginine could not confer any noticeable protective effects during stress associated with T6P accumulation, so this could represent a general, unspecific stress response that provides no advantage in this particular case. Further experiments involving <italic>otsB2</italic> silencing in arginine auxotrophic mutants are needed to address the role of arginine biosynthesis in phosphosugar stress response. T6P stress led to a strong upregulation of the putative efflux pump Rv1258c, which has been implicated in antibiotic resistance. However, this did not lead to a decreased susceptibility of stressed <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> cells to the first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol. While it cannot be ruled out that this efflux pump might be specific for other antibiotics, this suggests that OtsB2 inhibitors could be included in tuberculosis chemotherapy without impairing the efficacy of standard drugs. Whether upregulation of Rv1258c represents a specific mechanism to alleviate T6P stress or not is unknown. However, it is tempting to speculate that this could mediate efflux of T6P or downstream products to decrease the intracellular concentration. While we have not tested for potential secretion of T6P in silenced cells, the high levels of intracellular T6P accumulation implies that T6P cannot be exported at a substantial rate. Although not being overrepresented among the many genes induced in T6P stressed cells, upregulation of several DNA damage-inducible genes including those of the SOS regulon indicates that T6P accumulation might lead to DNA damage in a direct or indirect way, very similar to that described for M1P. While this probably explains the bactericidal effect of both T6P and M1P accumulation in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, the molecular mechanisms of phosphosugar-mediated DNA damage are unclear in each case. Two intriguing features of the T6P-elicited transcriptome profile are the upregulation of <italic>vapB</italic> antitoxin genes, which might cause increased RNA half-life via enhanced neutralization of the RNase activity of VapC toxins whose specific RNA substrates have yet to be identified, and downregulation of highly-abundant non-coding RNAs of unknown functions. Whether these features contribute to the loss of viability upon OtsB2 inactivation or constitute responses that aim to mitigate and/or counteract the T6P stress needs to be addressed in the future.</p><p>The strict essentiality of OtsB2 to establish an acute infection in mice highlights that it might represent a new potential drug target candidate. However, conditional gene silencing <italic>in vivo</italic> has revealed several limitations of OtsB2 in terms of its suitability as a potential drug target. First, although the efficacy of gene silencing <italic>in vivo</italic> is unclear, it appears that inhibition of OtsB2 can maximally achieve bacteriostatic growth inhibition in the lung. Thus, monotherapy with OtsB2 inhibitors would not be sufficient to eradicate the pathogen, necessitating combination therapy with other drugs. Second, loss-of-function mutations in OtsA would abolish the efficacy of OtsB2 inhibitors by preventing T6P accumulation, thereby readily giving rise to resistance. And third, OtsB2 inhibitors would only be appropriate to treat acute infections because they become ineffective during the chronic infection phase. Nevertheless, a genome-wide screen for synthetic lethal interactions with OtsA has revealed several opportunities for the design of combination therapies that would suppress resistance and boost the efficacy of drugs targeting OtsB2. Since, in the absence of the OtsA-OtsB2 pathway, trehalose is synthesized via the TreX-TreY-TreZ pathway from &#x003b1;-glucans, targeting either the TreX-TreY-TreZ pathway or reactions required for &#x003b1;-glucan formation (e.g. GlgC, GlgA) in a combination therapy will prevent resistance that might arise through loss-of-function mutations in OtsA. Additionally, targeting both trehalose synthesis pathways simultaneously will likely enhance the growth inhibitory effect during the acute infection phase and might render <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> cells susceptible towards OtsB2 inhibitors also during the chronic infection phase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p>Cells of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv were grown aerobically at 37&#x000b0;C in Middlebrook 7H9 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) OADC enrichment (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems), 0.5% (v/v) glycerol and 0.05% (v/v) Tyloxapol.

The template counts in the samples were normalized using the TTR method (trimmed total read-count), the difference in reads for each gene was compared to a null-distribution from 10,000 samples (permutations of the counts between the conditions) to derive a p-value, and the results were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Genes with significant differential essentiality were defined as those with an adjusted p-value less than 0.05.</p><p>A comparative analysis of the differentially essential regions in the &#x00394;<italic>otsA</italic> library grown with versus without trehalose was performed as follows. Two Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were used. One was designed to identify regions where there is a clear difference in that the TA sites have insertions in one condition but not the other. The second HMM was designed to identify regions of quantitative differential essentiality, in that the relative level of insertion counts is significantly lower (but not necessarily zero) in one condition than the other. The advantage of using HMMs to analyze Tn-seq data is that differentially essential regions can be identified in a non-gene-centric way, i.e. not restricted to ORF boundaries. First, a 3-state HMM was run on each dataset (independently) to label each TA site as either Essential (ES), Non-essential (NE), or Missing (MI). The objective of this HMM is to distinguish sites with zero insertions that are legitimate (i.e. due to biological selection) versus those that are likely missing from the library. The intended interpretation of the MI state is for isolated TA sites where no insertions were observed in the middle of otherwise non-essential regions. The HMM was implemented in Python using the Scipy library. The parameters of the HMM (priors, likelihood functions, transition probabilities) are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006043.s010">S1 Text</xref>. Given a sequence of insertion counts at TA sites, the Viterbi algorithm is used to extract the most probable sequence of state labels for each site [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The sequence of TA sites in each dataset was then segmented into regions by comparing the state labels between the two conditions (with and without trehalose). "Type 1" segments were defined as regions labeled consecutively as essential (ES) in one dataset but not the other. A second HMM was implemented to detect regions of differential essentiality where there was a quantitative difference in the counts between the two conditions. The counts for the two datasets A[1..n] and B[1..n] were compared to produce an integer sequence as follows: +1 if A[i]&#x0003e;B[i], -1 if A[i]&#x0003c;B[i], else 0 (i.e. sgn(A[i]-B[i])). The objective of the second HMM was to identify regions where the counts were consistently biased toward one condition or the other by assigning unobservable state labels at each site, effectively smoothing over these discretized directional values. The directional HMM has 3 states: S1 for regions where counts in A are generally greater than B, S3 for regions where counts in A are generally less than B, and S2 for regions where A and B are either equal or alternate frequently. The parameters for this HMM are also given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006043.s010">S1 Text</xref>. The Viterbi algorithm was used to extract the state labeling for each site based on the most probable state sequence. "Type 2" segments were defined as maximal runs of consecutive TA sites labeled as S1 or as S3 by this HMM. To determine the statistical significance of the difference in counts between the two datasets in each of the type-1 and type-2 segments identified above, a permutation test was performed [<xref rid="ppat.1006043.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Insertion counts at TA sites in each segment were randomly permuted between the datasets 10,000 times to generate a null-distribution for the difference in the sum of the counts between the two datasets, and a p-value for the observed difference was calculated from this. The p-values were then adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, and a threshold of adjusted p values &#x0003c;0.05 was applied.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Mouse infections</title><p>Aerosol infection of seven week old female C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory) was performed using an inhalation exposure system from Glas-Col and early log phase <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> cultures prepared as single-cell suspensions in PBS to deliver 100&#x02013;200 bacilli per mouse.
