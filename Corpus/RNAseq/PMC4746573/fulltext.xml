Here we report the draft genome, variome, and developmental transcriptome of <italic>D. viviparus</italic>. The genome (161&#x02009;Mb) is smaller than those of related bursate nematodes and encodes fewer proteins (14,171 total). In the first genome-wide assessment of genomic variation in any parasitic nematode, we found a high degree of sequence variability in proteins predicted to be involved host-parasite interactions. Next, we used extensive RNA sequence data to track gene transcription across the life cycle of <italic>D. viviparus</italic>, and identified genes that might be important in nematode development and parasitism. Finally, we predicted genes that could be vital in host-parasite interactions, genes that could serve as drug targets, and putative RNAi effectors with a view to developing functional genomic tools. This extensive, well-curated dataset should provide a basis for developing new anthelmintics, vaccines, and improved diagnostic tests and serve as a platform for future investigations of drug resistance and epidemiology of the bovine lungworm and related nematodes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Parasitic roundworms (nematodes) of domestic animals are responsible for substantial economic losses as a consequence of poor production performance, morbidity, and mortality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Diseases caused by these worms cost livestock industries billions of dollars and lead to a significant reduction in global food production each year<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Lungworms of the genus <italic>Dictyocaulus</italic> (Strongylida: Dictyocaulidae, nematode clade V) are parasites of major agricultural significance that cause parasitic bronchitis (or dictyocaulosis) in cattle, particularly in young animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The clinical manifestation of dictyocaulosis vary from mild respiratory signs to emphysema and pneumonia, and can result in rapid death in severely affected animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Respiratory symptoms are accompanied by a reduction in growth, fertility and/or milk production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> such that outbreaks result in major financial losses to farmers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>Unlike other trichostrongylid nematodes that live in the upper alimentary tract, <italic>D. viviparus</italic> resides in the bronchi and bronchioles of the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Ovo-viviparous females release eggs that are coughed up and swallowed. The eggs hatch as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract, and first stage larvae (L1) are shed in the faeces. Larvae moult twice on the pasture to develop into infective third-stage larvae (L3s). This development can occur within four to six days under favorable environmental conditions. During this time, they must move from faeces to grass to be accessible to a host, and often take advantage of sporulating <italic>Pilobilus</italic> fungi for dispersal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Upon ingestion by the bovid, L3s exsheath, penetrate the intestinal wall, migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes and moult to the fourth larval stage (L4s). L4s are carried to the lung in circulating blood and/or lymph, and undergo a final moult to reach the L5, pre-adult stage (also referred to as immature adults). Although this is the last moult, further growth and development are required to reach sexual maturity. Most adult worms will be cleared by 30 days post-infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>; however, larval stages can undergo arrested development (hypobiosis) in the host lungs for up to five months if they were exposed to cold conditions prior to ingestion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Hypobiosis is a crucial aspect of lungworm epidemiology and acts as a key factor for year-to-year survival in temperate climates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>Farmers need to take routine measures to protect their livestock from lungworm infection due to the severe impact of dictyocaulosis on bovine health. An irradiated larval vaccine was introduced in the 1950&#x02018;s; it is highly effective, but has a short shelf-life and, more importantly, booster infections or vaccination are necessary to confer immunity beyond six to 12 months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Recombinant vaccines have been attempted, but failed to achieve adequate levels of protection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. <italic>D. viviparus</italic> is susceptible to several classes of drugs, including macrocyclic lactones and benzimidazoles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>; thus, anthelmintic drugs have superseded vaccination as the preferred preventative method. However, prophylactic treatment of calves impedes the development of protective immunity that would shield them from disease later in life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In addition, excessive and widespread drug use promotes resistance in nematode populations, and there are reports of resistance developing in <italic>D. viviparus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The discovery of new interventions has been challenging due to a limited understanding of the biology this parasite.</p><p>In the present study, we characterize the draft genome, population variome and developmentally-staged transcriptome of <italic>D. viviparus</italic> in order to substantially improve our understanding of this pathogen at the molecular level across all defined life cycle stages and its relationship with the bovine host. The Hannover Dv2000 field isolate, a temperate strain from Northern Germany, was selected for this investigation because it has been the subject of previous recombinant vaccine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and gene expression studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, serves as the basis for the lungworm-MSP-ELISA diagnostic assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, and (unlike the strain used for producing live vaccine) is capable of undergoing hypobiosis.

The resultant polycistronic mRNAs are cleaved into single-gene units (cistrons), which are trans-spliced to spliced leader (SL) sequences. Usually, a well-conserved SL1 sequence is attached to the 5&#x02032;-end of the first cistron in the operon, and a less-conserved SL2 sequence is attached to the 5&#x02032;-end of subsequent cistrons (though SL1s are also known to be attached to subsequent cistrons). In total, 363 operons containing 793 genes were identified in <italic>D. viviparus</italic> based on orthology to known <italic>C. elegans</italic> operons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>); 188 operons had a conserved order and orientation, whereas 175 were partly conserved, with missing genes or an altered order or orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). As expected, RNA-seq data confirmed the co-transcription of operon genes as compared non-operon genes, even accounting for gene proximity (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).

A total of 4,769 unique InterPro protein domains were predicted from 9,198 (64.9%) <italic>D. viviparus</italic> proteins, which were associated with 1,388 unique gene ontology (GO) terms. Likewise, 8,442 (59.6%) proteins matched 4,102 unique KEGG orthologous groups, which were further assigned to 324 enzymatic pathways and 242 pathway modules. The majority (91.0%) of <italic>D. viviparus</italic> proteins had at least one BLAST match (e-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) in the NCBI non-redundant protein database (nr), with most corresponding to proteins from other strongylid nematodes.</p><p>BLAST searches against nr identified 55 <italic>D. viviparus</italic> proteins with isolated regions of similarity to sequences from <italic>Wolbachia</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). <italic>Wolbachia</italic> are obligate bacterial endosymbionts of some arthropods and filarial nematodes and are implicated in the transfer of DNA to host nuclear genomes. While <italic>D. viviparus</italic> does not presently host <italic>Wolbachia</italic> endobacteria, the bacterial sequences in its nuclear genome suggest that it (or an ancestral species) was infected in the past. These inserts have been thoroughly described in a report based on the genome of a <italic>D. viviparus</italic> strain from Cameroon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The focus of this report was the <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-like sequence inserts, not the <italic>D. viviparus</italic> genome itself, so the genome and gene complement of the nematode were only briefly described and little functional annotation was provided (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> for a brief comparison of the two assemblies). Although the previous report claimed little evidence of transcriptional of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, 53 of the 55 protein coding genes with <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-like sequences showed evidence of transcription based on our extensive RNA-seq data. However, they were transcribed at low levels compared with other genes (average peak expression of 77.7 FPKM compared with 3,356.6&#x02009;FPKM for other genes; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup>, t-test using log-scale FPKM values; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>), and did not exhibit any distinct expression pattern across the parasite life cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). A majority of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-like genes identified in other <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free species show limited transcription and no detectable protein expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.

The &#x0201c;birth&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;death&#x0201d; of OPFs throughout evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) was consistent with previously described patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, where OPF births outnumbered deaths in the major lineages such as Nematoda.

Following variant calling and quality filtering, we identified 3,694,482 high-confidence single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Overall, the average genetic distance was less among the females as compared with males for the Hannover population (<italic>&#x003c0;</italic><sub>female</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0070; <italic>&#x003c0;</italic><sub>male</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0084; <italic>&#x003c0;</italic><sub>total</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0074), and there was little partitioning of the genetic diversity between the genders (Weir and Cockerham mean <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>ST</italic></sub> estimate&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0006; weighted <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>ST</italic></sub> estimate&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0085), consistent with the nested population structure depicted in the MDS plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>).

In contrast, positive Tajima&#x02019;s D could be indicative of either (1) balancing selection or (2) a partial selective sweep. We used &#x003c0;<sub>N</sub>/&#x003c0;<sub>S</sub> to help distinguish between these two possibilities, as &#x003c0;<sub>N</sub> and &#x003c0;<sub>S</sub> are expected to increase proportionally prior to fixation of a favorable allele. Some 16 genes were found to have high Tajima&#x02019;s D (top 5%) and positive log(&#x003c0;<sub>N</sub>/&#x003c0;<sub>S</sub>) values, suggestive of balancing selection.
