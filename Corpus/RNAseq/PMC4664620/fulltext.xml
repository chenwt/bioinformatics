Up to now, in the <italic>Ascochyta</italic>-legume pathosystem most studies focused on the identification of resistance genes in the host, while very little is known about the pathogenicity factors of the fungal pathogen. Moreover, available data were often obtained from fungi growing under artificial conditions. Therefore, in this study we aimed at the identification of the pathogenicity factors of <italic>Ascochyta rabiei</italic>, causing ascochyta blight in chickpea. To identify potential fungal pathogenicity factors, we employed RNA-seq and Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE) to produce comprehensive expression profiles of <italic>A. rabiei</italic> genes isolated either from the fungus growing in absence of its host or from fungi infecting chickpea leaves. We further provide a comprehensive <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the <italic>A. rabiei</italic> transcriptome comprising 22,725 contigs with an average length of 1178 bp. Since pathogenicity factors are usually secreted, we predicted the <italic>A. rabiei</italic> secretome, yielding 550 putatively secreted proteins. MACE identified 596 transcripts that were up-regulated during infection. An analysis of these genes identified a collection of candidate pathogenicity factors and unraveled the pathogen's strategy for infecting its host.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>MACE</kwd><kwd>RNA-Seq</kwd><kwd><italic>Ascochyta rabiei</italic></kwd><kwd>pathogenicity factors</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">European Commission<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000780</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">FP7-PEOPLE-2011-IEF-300235 &#x0201c;AscoTransSeq&#x0201d;</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="54"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="9842"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Legume crops are a versatile and inexpensive source of protein for animal feeding and human consumption. Furthermore, legumes sustain agriculture by functioning as powerful natural soil fertilizers. They supply important added value to the crop by fixing atmospheric nitrogen, thus they reduce the need for artificial nitrogen fertilizer and help to minimize the adverse impact of agriculture on the environment. However, legumes are affected by many foliar and root diseases. The most important foliar diseases in legumes worldwide are ascochyta blights (Rubiales and Fondevilla, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>Health or disease is the result of a battle between plants and their pathogens. Fungal pathogens use their &#x0201c;pathogenicity factors&#x0201d; to attack the plant, while recognition of the pathogen by the plant triggers defense responses. However, pathogens use effectors to suppress host immunity and some of these effectors induce host immunity upon recognition by the host's resistance gene(s) (Thakur et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Therefore, plant resistance or susceptibility depends on the genetic background of both, pathogen and host. In the <italic>Ascochyta</italic>-legume pathosystem, most studies focused on the identification of resistance genes in the host (for a review see Rubiales and Fondevilla, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), while very little is known about the pathogenicity factors of <italic>Ascochyta</italic> spp. This study therefore aimed at the identification of pathogenicity factors of ascochyta blight pathogens using <italic>Ascochyta rabiei</italic> as a model.</p><p><italic>A. rabiei</italic> (Pass.) Labrouse [teleomorph <italic>Didymella rabiei</italic> (Kovachevski) v. Arx] is a member of the dothideomycetes class of filamentous fungi. <italic>A. rabiei</italic> conidia germinate producing a germ tube and subsequently form an apressorium. Penetration occurs directly through the cuticle and some stomata. The penetration hyphae enter the plant tissue between two epidermal cells and then spread subepidermally inside the leaf and stem. Hyphae initially grow between epidermal and palisade parenchyma cells and proceed through the middle lamellae in parenchyma tissues from the leaflet through the petioles to the stem. This necrotrophic fungus kills host cells, producing necrotic lesions where pycnidia are formed (Ilarslan and Dolar, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Jayakumar et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>Very little is known about the pathogenic determinants of <italic>A. rabiei</italic>. For penetration of the host tissue and growth, <italic>A. rabiei</italic> produces cell-wall degrading enzymes such as a cutinase, xylanase and exopolygalacturonase (Tenhaken and Barz, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">1991a</xref>; Tenhaken et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Bruns, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). The pathogen also generates the phytotoxins solanapyrones A, B, and C, an unknown proteinaceous phytotoxin and Cytochalasin D (H&#x000f6;hl et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Latif et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Chen and Strange, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). <italic>A. rabiei</italic> is also able to degrade antimicrobial isoflavones and pterocarpan phytoalexins from chickpea (Kraft et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Tenhaken et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1991b</xref>). Furthermore, the fungus produces a suppressor that inhibits the accumulation of antimicrobial compounds in chickpea (Kessmann and Barz, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). Although it has been demonstrated that the fungus generates these compounds in different media, it is unknown, whether it synthesizes them also during the infection process. Also, the role of these compounds in pathogenicity is unknown, except for the solanapyrone phytotoxin, which is not needed for pathogenesis, as mutants unable to produce the toxin did not show reduced virulence (Kim et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Therefore, further studies are required to prove whether these already reported putative pathogenicity determinants are really induced during infection and contribute to pathogenicity.</p><p>Equally, little information about <italic>A. rabiei</italic> is available at the genomic level. Knowledge of the genome structure of <italic>A. rabiei</italic> is currently limited to a few genetic linkage maps containing few markers and a karyotype study (Lichtenzveig et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Phan et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Akamatsu et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). <italic>A. rabiei</italic> sequences are also limited since only 128 EST and 116 nucleotide sequences were available in NCBI database as per April 2015.</p><p>Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) enables the low-cost sequencing of whole genomes and transcriptomes and enormously increased the available sequence information for non-model organisms. Due to its unprecedented accuracy and specificity in quantifying differentially expressed genes, NGS also is a powerful tool for transcriptomic studies.</p><p>Here we used NGS for the <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing of the <italic>A. rabiei</italic> transcriptome, and to identify genes differentially expressed by the fungus during infection of chickpea leaves in comparison to the same fungus growing under artificial conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec><title>Histological study to define the time course of the infection and select time sampling</title><p>A detailed histological study of the <italic>A. rabiei</italic>-chickpea pathosystem was performed prior to the start of the experiment to standardize the experimental conditions and define the timing of relevant steps of the <italic>A. rabiei</italic> infection process (spore germination, host's epidermis penetration, development of necrotic lesions in the host's mesophyll). Seeds from the susceptible chickpea cultivar &#x0201c;Blanco Lechoso&#x0201d; were individually sown in plastic pots containing 250 cm<sup>3</sup> of a 1:1 sand-peat mixture. Plants were maintained at 20&#x000b0;C in a growth chamber with a 12 h light/12 h dark photoperiod until they reached the five-leaf stage.</p><p>Inoculations were performed on cut leaves placed into Petri dishes, in order to standardize the level of humidity, which greatly influences the speed of the development of the infection. For inoculation, the 3rd and 4th leaves of each plant were cut and placed on technical agar (4 g/l) in Petri dishes and inoculated by spraying them with a suspension of <italic>A. rabiei</italic> spores containing 12 million conidia/ml. The spore suspension was obtained by flooding the surface of 14 days old V8 cultures with sterile water, scraping the colony with a needle and filtering the suspension through two layers of sterile cheesecloth. The concentration of spores in the solution was determined with a haemocytometer. Finally, Tween-20 (120 &#x003bc;l per 100 ml of suspension) was added as a wetting agent. <italic>A. rabiei</italic> isolate P4, representing pathotype 4, was used for the experiments. This pathotype is the most virulent of the four described for the species, and chickpea accessions resistant to it are not available so far (Imtiaz et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Isolate P4 originated from Kaljebrin, Syria and was kindly provided by Dr. Seid-Adhmed Kemal (ICARDA).</p><p>For histological studies samples were taken at 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 h after inoculation (hai). Cut leaflets were laid, adaxial surface up, on filter paper moistened with a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of glacial acetic acid: absolute ethanol for fixation and discoloration. To quantify the percentage of germinated spores, leaflets were mounted on lactoglycerol and stained by placing a drop of 5% aniline blue over them. For every leaf, the percentage of germinating spores was calculated by scoring in a light microscope each of 100 conidia for the presence of a germ tube. As this staining was not suited to reveal fungal structures within leaflets, the penetration into the epidermis and the formation of necrotic lesions in the mesophyll were quantified by first staining discolored leaflets by boiling in 0.05% tripan blue in a (1:2, v:v) lactophenol-ethanol mixture for 10 min. Leaflets were then moved into a solution of chloral hydrate (5:2, p:v) to clarify the tissues. One hundred germinated spores were examined and classified according to whether they had each formed a germ tube but not penetrated the epidermis, had penetrated the epidermis but not reached the mesophyll or had started to colonize the mesophyll and produce necrotic lesions. The experiment was replicated four times and for each histological variable one leaflet per replicate and time point was examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Fungal material used for RNA extraction and sequencing</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Mycelium of <italic>A. rabiei</italic> isolate P4 growing in the absence of its host (&#x0201c;<italic>in medium</italic>&#x0201d;): the fungi was grown for 1 week in PDB shaking media containing ampicillin and kanamycin (50 mg/ml each) in darkness at 20 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C.

Here, three replicates were performed.</p></list-item></list><p>RNA was extracted separately for each of the treatments and replicates using TRISure (Bioline, London, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Integrity of total RNA was checked on agarose gels and its quantity and purity was determined using a NanoDrop ND1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Wilmington, USA). Potential residual genomic DNA was removed using RQ1 RNase-Free Dnase (Promega, Madison, USA). RNA was further purified using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>Library preparation and sequencing for RNA-Seq</title><p>For sequencing, the RNAs from the two replicates of the fungus grown &#x0201c;<italic>in medium</italic>&#x0201d; were mixed, while the RNAs from the tree replicates of the &#x0201c;<italic>in planta</italic>&#x0201d; treatment were sequenced separately. RNA-seq libraries were generated from 5 &#x003bc;g of total RNA by first capturing the mRNA using Oligo dT(25) beads (Dynabeads; life Technologies). The purified mRNA was then randomly fragmented in a Zn2+ solution and Illumina sequencing adapters were ligated to the RNA. cDNA was then generated using a p5 oligonucleotide for priming and the library was finally amplified with 10 cycles of PCR. Illumina HiSeq2500 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used for paired-end sequencing (2 &#x000d7; 100 bp).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation and sequencing of massive analysis of cDNA ends (MACE) libraries</title><p>MACE libraries were produced for each replicate and treatment separately. The libraries were constructed from &#x02248;5 &#x003bc;g of total RNA using the &#x0201c;MACE-Kit&#x0201d; (GenXPro GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) according to the supplier's manual. The technique analyzes 3&#x02032;-biotinylated cDNA ends of 300&#x02013;500 bp long, fragmented cDNA. These fragments are sequenced from their 5&#x02032;-ends, thereby generating a single sequence from each transcript. In order to avoid bias during the PCR amplification steps included in the library preparation, GenXPro's PCR-bias-proof technology &#x0201c;TrueQuant,&#x0201d; implemented in the MACE kit, was employed allowing distinguishing PCR copies from original transcripts. For each library, 94-bp tags were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 machine (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Preprocessing and mapping of illumina reads</title><p>The Illumina-derived sequence reads were processed with GenXPro's online in-house MACE analysis pipeline. Briefly, libraries were sorted according to their respective index, followed by elimination of duplicate PCR-derived tags identified by TrueQuant technology. Additionally, homopolymer filtering, quality filtering, removal of sequencing adapter primers and cDNA synthesis primers was performed. To distinguish <italic>A. rabiei</italic> reads from those originating from chickpea, reads derived from infected leaves were mapped against our own preliminary <italic>A. rabiei</italic> genome assembly (manuscript in preparation) and against the chickpea transcriptome reported by Hiremath et al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) using the TopHat2.0.3 software (Trapnell et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). This draft <italic>A. rabiei</italic> genome assembly was obtained by sequencing <italic>A. rabiei</italic> isolate P4 using the Illumina platform. It consists of 913 scaffolds spanning 38.6 Mb with an N50 of 72 Mb. Reads mapping to the <italic>A. rabiei</italic> genome but not to the chickpea transcriptome were considered to originate from <italic>A. rabiei</italic> and selected for further analysis. In addition, to avoid any possible contaminant or artifacts, the sequences coming from the fungus growing in PDB medium were also mapped against the <italic>A. rabiei</italic> genome and only those that mapped there were used for the next steps.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>A. rabiei</italic> transcriptome sequencing and characterization</title><sec><title>Transcriptome assembly</title><p>A summary of the workflow followed for the assembly of the <italic>A. rabiei</italic> transcriptome from RNA-Seq and MACE sequences is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. RNA-Seq and MACE reads were first separately assembled using the Trinity software (Grabherr et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), indicating that the reads were strand-specific for improving the quality of the assembly. To reduce sequence redundancy, the scaffolds obtained from these separate assemblies were combined by the CAP3 software using default parameters (Huang and Madan, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Both, the resulting contigs and singletons, were retained and sequences smaller than 200 bp were discarded. This set of sequences is called the <italic>A. rabiei</italic> transcriptome along the paper. To further remove redundant transcripts, singletons displaying &#x0003e;80% sequence similarity to CAP3-derived contigs were eliminated.

Transcripts without homology to these sequences were subsequently annotated to the non-redundant nucleotide NCBI database (nr) by BLASTN using an <italic>e</italic>-value of 0.001 as a threshold. In order to favor informative hits, modified UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, UniProtKB, RefSeq_protein, and nr databases were used for the BLAST.

Contrary to RNA-Seq (Nagalakshmi et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), in which for every transcript several sequences may be generated, in MACE each cDNA molecule is represented by one sequence (the tag) of 94 bp, originating from a region around 100&#x02013;500 bp from the 3&#x02032; (poly-A) end of the transcript. High-throughput sequencing of tags provides numerical gene expression values and reveals the expression of even lowly abundant transcripts beyond the scope of microarrays and RNA-Seq, if sequenced at similar depth (Zawada et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Nold-Petry et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Thus, MACE is ideally suited to identify even rare fungal transcripts in a high background of plant mRNAs as e.g., in leaves of chickpea early after infection. Since after assembly of the tags, MACE sequence assemblies comprise only around 500 bp from each transcript species, we performed full-length RNA-Seq to obtain longer sequence assemblies that could be used as a reference for the annotation of the MACE tags.</p><p>To identify the <italic>A. rabiei</italic> genes specifically involved in host infection, we compared the gene expression profiles of the &#x0201c;<italic>in medium</italic>&#x0201d; with the &#x0201c;<italic>in planta</italic>&#x0201d; growing pathogen at three relevant steps of the infection process.

The largest number of up-regulated transcripts (431) was up-regulated at the earliest steps of infection at 12 hai, while 353 and 342 were up-regulated at 36 and 96 hai, respectively. A total of 179 transcripts were up-regulated under all infection conditions. A heat map showing nine clusters describing the expression pattern of these up-regulated transcripts at the different time points is shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">7</xref>.

In our study also several transcripts that were up-regulated during infection showed homology to genes involved in aflatoxin and tricothecene toxin metabolism from other fungi. In their genomes these toxin synthesis genes are clustered. Therefore, we searched in <italic>A. rabiei</italic> for orthologs of the genes involved in the synthesis of these toxins and their corresponding gene clusters.</p><p><italic>A. rabiei</italic> transcripts for proteins with high identity (&#x0003e;90%) to those encoded by genes located on the solanapyrone biosynthesis gene cluster of <italic>A. solani</italic> (Kasahara et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) were identified for all the genes of the cluster except <italic>sol3</italic> (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">10</xref>).

Thus, currently neither their genomic position nor their sequence identity allows the unambiguous identification of orthologs of these genes in <italic>A. rabiei</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite the high relevance of <italic>Ascochyta</italic> spp. as plant pathogens, very little was known until now about their pathogenicity factors and only a few molecular sequences were available for these species. This scenario has now changed drastically with the present paper in which we report a comprehensive <italic>A. rabiei</italic> transcriptome and identify several putative pathogenicity factors specifically induced during infection.</p><p>This detailed analysis was possible due to the high sequencing depth and the accuracy of our gene expression measurement. Studying the gene expression profile of pathogens during host infection is not an easy task. As only a small number of plant cells are invaded by the pathogen, the proportion of fungal cells compared to plant cells is very low, especially in the early phases of infection. This makes it difficult to detect fungal transcripts that are specifically expressed during infection in the mixed RNA from plant and pathogen and, especially, to retrieve a number of fungal sequences sufficient to perform an accurate expression analysis across replicates. This was achieved in our study where we exploited the advantages of MACE to produce precise genome-wide transcription profiles even in the infected tissue at reasonable costs. Up to 6,567,402 MACE sequences from the fungus representing the same number of transcripts were obtained from the infected tissue. This corresponds to around 2.4% of the total number of sequences from the &#x0201c;<italic>in planta</italic>&#x0201d; materials. An additional 1,284,224 fungal sequences (0.73% of the total sequencing reads), were recovered by sequencing RNA from the infected tissue with RNA-Seq. All together, we analyzed more than 152 million sequences from &#x0201c;<italic>in medium</italic>&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;<italic>in planta</italic>&#x0201d; material. This high coverage, together with a restrictive statistical analysis, allowed us the identification of genes consistently differentially expressed during the early infection process across three independent replicates.</p><p>Due to the depth of our analysis we predict the <italic>A. rabiei</italic> transcriptome to contain between 20,639 to 22,725 transcripts. The mean contig length of the assembled transcriptome was around 1172 bp. This length fits well to the length of transcripts expected for Dothideomycetes (Rouxel et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), highlighting the good quality of the transcriptome. This transcriptome will clearly enlarge the genomic resources available for <italic>A. rabiei</italic> and will be a useful repository to identify genes of interest in this and related species. As an example, we identified the transcripts from the solanapyrone biosynthesis gene cluster from <italic>A. rabiei</italic>. We further predicted the <italic>A. rabiei</italic> secretome comprising 550 putatively secreted proteins. Such proteins are crucial for successful colonization of the host by phytopathogens, since they depolymerize plant cell constituents, kill the cells or suppress the host's defense.</p><p>We here not only report a collection of genes which - according to their annotation&#x02014;may have a putative role in pathogenesis but, more interestingly, identify which of them are specifically induced or up-regulated during infection. Moreover, we could predict which of these infection-specific genes may be secreted as additional evidence for their importance for pathogenesis. In the following we will discuss a collection of putative pathogenicity factors that we identified, that could be major constituents of the fungal war machinery.</p><sec><title>Plant tissue degrading enzymes</title><p>Our results show that <italic>A. rabiei</italic> produces a battery of degrading enzymes, probably needed to penetrate and colonize its host. The first barrier for the pathogen to infect its host is the cuticle. Aerial plant organs are protected by a cuticle composed of i.a. the insoluble polymere cutin, a hydroxyl, and hydroxyepoxy fatty acid polyester (Ettinger et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). Until now only a cutinase, encoded by the <italic>cut</italic> gene, has been reported for <italic>A. rabiei</italic> (Tenhaken et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Besides this gene (corresponding to MACE_comp207687_c0_seq1) we identified five additional transcripts for proteins harboring a cutinase domain. The <italic>cut</italic> gene transcript was not differentially expressed during infection in our study. However, a &#x0201c;cuticle degrading protease&#x0201d; transcript was up-regulated during infection and two cutinase transcripts were only expressed in the &#x0201c;<italic>in planta</italic>&#x0201d; material and could therefore be important for the first step of infection.</p><p>After crossing the cuticle barrier, plant pathogens need to breach the host cell-wall, and therefore produce degrading enzymes such as cellulases, polygalacturonases, xylanases, proteinases (Annis and Goodwin, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), and others to macerate the tissue and produce soft rot. An arsenal of genes encoding degrading enzymes where over-expressed or only expressed during infection in our study (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">9</xref>). The only known <italic>A. rabiei</italic> xylanase (encoded by the <italic>abieixyl1</italic> gene), was not over-expressed during infection in our experiment. Instead we identified two transcripts for &#x0201c;1,4-beta-xylosidase,&#x0201d; an enzyme involved in xylan hydrolysis.</p><p>Furthermore, one GO functional categories most represented in the <italic>A rabiei</italic> transcriptome was &#x0201c;hydrolase activity, acting on glycosyl bonds.&#x0201d; This functional category was also over-represented in the subsets of mRNAs up-regulated during infection and in the secretome (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Glycoside hydrolases that participate in the degradation of host cell walls also play a role in degrading the fungal cell wall during cell division, growth and morphogenesis (Kawahara et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), crucial processes for developing the specific fungal structures needed to colonize the host.</p><p>&#x0201c;Peptidase&#x0201d; was another over-represented functional category in the subset of <italic>A. rabiei</italic> secreted proteins. Secreted pectic enzymes cleave internal glycosidic bonds in structurally important pectin polymers in the middle lamella and primary cell walls of plant tissues, resulting in tissue maceration and plant cell death (Schneider and Collmer, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Genes encoding enzymes belonging to this group and over-expressed during infection were also identified in our study.</p></sec><sec><title>Protection against fungitoxic compounds</title><p>To survive in its host the pathogen needs to counteract the toxic compounds produced by the plant as a defense. These include reactive oxygen species (ROS) and fungitoxic secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids, terpenoids, phytoalexins, and glucosinolates. Oxidoreductases detoxify ROS and thereby protect the pathogen against the aggressive environment created by the plant. Accordingly, &#x0201c;Oxydoreductase activity&#x0201d; was one of the most enriched GO functional categories in the <italic>A. rabiei</italic> transcriptome and was also enriched in the subset of genes up-regulated during infection and in the secretome. A syntenic block of genes including oxidoreductases is conserved in most Dothideomycetes and also up-regulated during infection in <italic>Lepstosphaeria maculans</italic> (Ohm et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). As additional evidence for their protective role against ROS in the <italic>A. rabiei</italic>-chickpea compatible interaction, two of the transcripts over-expressed during infection, Contig464 (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 6), and Contig8395, corresponded to two <italic>A. rabiei</italic> genes, <italic>Ar125</italic>, and <italic>Ar126</italic> respectively, identified in response to oxidative stress before by Singh et al. (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Phytoalexins are low molecular weight antimicrobial compounds produced by plants in response to pathogen attack. Several fungal plant pathogens are able to detoxify phytoalexins and numerous studies have demonstrated a link between the ability to detoxify phytoalexins and pathogenicity (Enkerli et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Our results suggest that the detoxification of phytoalexins produced by chickpea also plays a role in <italic>A. rabiei</italic> pathogenicity as the predicted protein of one of the transcripts expressed only during infection (comp21970_c0_seq1) share high sequence identity (49%) with that encoded by the <italic>MAK1</italic> gene that degrades the chickpea phytoalexin maackiain (Enkerli et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Furthermore, two other up-regulated transcripts coded for &#x0201c;pisatin demethylase.&#x0201d; Though pisatin is the predominant phytoalexin of pea, the presence of two related transcripts up-regulated by <italic>Ascochyta</italic> in chickpea suggests that the respective proteins may also have the capability to detoxify chickpea phytoalexins.</p><p>Complementing the detoxification of toxins, another fungal protection mechanism is the transport of the toxins out of the cell. Several transcripts up-regulated during infection may have this function as their corresponding proteins belonged to &#x0201c;ABC transporters&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Major facilitator superfamily transporter&#x0201d; (MFS) families, both involved in the transport of drugs and other compounds. MFS are also involved in self-protection against own toxins and the secretion of these toxins into the host (Pitkin et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Choquer et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), additional crucial processes for a successful pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Production of toxins and other phytotoxic secondary metabolites</title><p>Besides their defense against plant toxins, necrotrophic fungi, such as <italic>A. rabiei</italic>, produce toxic compounds themselves to kill host cells. These include several secondary metabolites which may also exert a role in <italic>A. rabiei</italic> pathogenicity, as the functional category &#x0201c;secondary metabolic process&#x0201d; was over-represented in the subset of genes up-regulated during infection.</p><p>The solanapyrone-producing genes that we discussed already belong to this category though they are probably no virulence factor in <italic>A. rabiei</italic>, as mutants unable to produce the toxin do not show reduced virulence (Kim et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Our results agree with this observation as none of the solanapyrone transcripts were differentially expressed during infection. By contrast, many transcripts putatively involved in toxin production were only expressed during infection (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">9</xref> for a detailed description). Among these were five genes encoding &#x0201c;Nonribosomal peptide synthetases&#x0201d; (NRPSs) and two encoding &#x0201c;Polyketide synthases&#x0201d; (PKS). NRPSs are modular enzymes that synthesize a diverse set of secondary metabolites, including the dothideomycete host-specific toxins AM-toxin, HC-toxin, and victorin from <italic>Alternaria</italic> and <italic>Cochliobolus</italic> species (Hane et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). PKS are a family of proteins involved also in the synthesis of several mycotoxins and other secondary metabolites (Yun et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Baker et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Up to now only two <italic>A. rabiei</italic> genes encoding PKS, <italic>pks1</italic>, and <italic>pks2</italic>, were described (White and Chen, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Akamatsu et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). We identified 12 proteins harboring the PKS domain in <italic>A. rabiei</italic> and two of their corresponding transcripts were up-regulated during infection, including <italic>pks2</italic>, but not <italic>pks1</italic>. In agreement with that, <italic>pks1</italic> was shown to be involved in 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin pigment biosynthesis in <italic>A. rabiei</italic> and not needed for pathogenicity, while the <italic>pks2</italic> is in the same clade as <italic>pksCT</italic> which is responsible for biosynthesis of the nephrotoxic mycotoxin citrinin in <italic>M. purpureus</italic> (Akamatsu et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>In addition to those mentioned above, a number of other genes only expressed during chickpea infection encoded proteins with homology to enzymes involved in toxin metabolism in other pathogens. Two of these predicted proteins had homology to <italic>AFT1</italic> and <italic>AFT3</italic> proteins involved in the synthesis of host-specific toxins in <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> (Hatta et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), while others had homology with enzymes acting in aflatoxin and tricothecene metabolism in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>parasiticus</italic> and <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic>, respectively. However, we could not identify unequivocal orthologs of these genes in <italic>A. rabiei</italic> since the percentage of identity between the predicted protein of <italic>A. rabiei</italic> genes and those of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>parasiticus</italic> and <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic> was only moderate and mapping of these genes onto our draft <italic>A. rabiei</italic> genome did not reveal any clear cluster. Previous attempts based on reciprocal BLAST analyses to identify orthologs of aflatoxin synthesis-related genes in <italic>Dothideomycetes</italic> concluded that these fungi seemingly do not harbor orthologues of these genes. However, the abundance of non-reciprocal matches suggests the presence of paralogues for many of the genes (Ohm et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In conclusion, we can not specify which toxins are produced by <italic>A. rabiei</italic> during infection, but the presence of genes with homology to toxin biosynthesis genes from other pathogens that were only expressed during host infection suggests that <italic>A. rabiei</italic> produces unknown toxins or secondary metabolites other than Solanapyrones and that these may be involved in pathogenicity. The identification of transcripts encoding potential toxin biosynthesis enzymes is an important result of our study and a relevant step to identify such toxins.</p></sec><sec><title>Signaling during infection</title><p>Other pathogenesis-related genes up-regulated during infection include those involved in signaling. Cell-surface receptors perceive environmental signals that are transduced by G proteins into the cell and activate intracellular signaling pathways regulating i.a. host-pathogen interactions. We identified several transcripts of this signaling cascade putatively involved in infection-specific development. Thus, seven up-regulated transcripts encoded putative integral membrane proteins. Other up-regulated transcripts encoded putative members of the Rho family of G protein GTPases, or proteins acting in Rho protein activation or regulation. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling, together with Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, play critical roles in the pathogenesis of several fungal pathogens (Yamauchi et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and we found several up-regulated transcripts from this pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We here report the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, annotation and characterization of the transcriptome of <italic>A. rabiei</italic> and predict the secretome of this devastating pathogen.
