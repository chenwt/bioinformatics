To find underlying molecular differences in PRRS susceptible versus more resistant pigs, 100 animals with extremely different growth rates and viremia levels after PRRSv infection were selected from a total of 600 infected pigs. A microarray experiment was conducted on whole blood RNA samples taken at 0, 4 and 7&#x000a0;days post infection (dpi) from these pigs. From these data, we examined associations of gene expression with weight gain and viral load phenotypes. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker WUR10000125 (WUR) on the porcine 60&#x000a0;K SNP chip was shown to be associated with viral load and weight gain after PRRSv infection, and so the effect of the WUR10000125 (WUR) genotype on expression in whole blood was also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Limited information was obtained through linear modeling of blood gene differential expression (DE) that contrasted pigs with extreme phenotypes, for growth or viral load or between animals with different WUR genotype. However, using network-based approaches, molecular pathway differences between extreme phenotypic classes could be identified. Several gene clusters of interest were found when Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was applied to 4dpi contrasted with 0dpi data. The expression pattern of one such cluster of genes correlated with weight gain and WUR genotype, contained numerous immune response genes such as cytokines, chemokines, interferon type I stimulated genes, apoptotic genes and genes regulating complement activation. In addition, Partial Correlation and Information Theory (PCIT) identified differentially hubbed (DH) genes between the phenotypically divergent groups. GO enrichment revealed that the target genes of these DH genes are enriched in adaptive immune pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There are molecular differences in blood RNA patterns between pigs with extreme phenotypes or with a different WUR genotype in early responses to PRRSv infection, though they can be quite subtle and more difficult to discover with conventional DE expression analyses. Co-expression analyses such as WGCNA and PCIT can be used to reveal network differences between such extreme response groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-015-1741-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pig</kwd><kwd>PRRS</kwd><kwd>Microarray</kwd><kwd>Transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>WGCNA</kwd><kwd>PCIT</kwd><kwd>Immune response</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>In the United States, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically devastating diseases currently in the swine industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. PRRS affects all production stages, manifesting reproductive losses (infertility, abortions, and stillborn and mummified fetuses), and piglets show a higher pre-weaning morbidity and mortality rate, persisting with a reduced thrift throughout the entire grow-finishing period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The disease is caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSv), an enveloped, single stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Arteriviridae family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. PRRSv uses complex strategies to evade both the innate and adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Because these immune evasion mechanisms are not fully understood, a sustainable treatment is difficult to find. The ease with which PRRSv moves from farm to farm further complicates control strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, the virus is genetically highly heterologous and vaccination based on a single PRRSv strain is not necessarily sufficient to protect against other strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>One way to minimize the economic loss caused by PRRS is to improve disease resistance of the host. The PRRS Host Genetics Consortium (PHGC) was founded to examine the genetic basis of host responses to PRRS and understand its overall impact on pig health and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As part of the PHGC, infection trials are conducted on approximately 200 weanling pigs each. All pigs in these studies are infected with PRRSv, and weight gain and viremia levels are measured on 0, 4, 7, 11, 14, 19/21, 28, 35&#x000a0;days post infection (dpi) to day 40/42, when the trial is terminated. In 2012, using a genome-wide association study on the first three infection trials, Boddicker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] reported a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 4 (SSC4) that explained a large proportion of the genetic variance for viral load and, to a lesser extent, weight gain. In that region on SSC4, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker WUR10000125 (WUR) on the porcine 60&#x000a0;K SNP chip was shown to capture most of the effect in this region. The effect of the SSC4 region, and of WUR in particular, was successfully validated in additional trials on animals with a different genetic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For WUR, the B allele is the favorable allele when compared to the A allele, but the B allele has a low frequency in these challenge populations. Fortunately, the SNP marker works in a dominant manner, giving similar protective phenotypes for AB and BB animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In the last couple of years, several porcine gene expression studies, primarily at the cell culture infection level, have been executed in an attempt to unravel the porcine immune responses evoked by the PRRS virus. Of these whole genome PRRS expression studies, some focused on expression differences as response to virus strains with different pathogenicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], others calculated expression differences between infected and control (uninfected) pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] or <italic>in vitro</italic> between infected and control cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and two measured whole genome expression differences due to breed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These latter experiments compared breeds that are more resistant to PRRS with breeds that are more susceptible to it, and were focused on understanding immunological differences to explain phenotypic differences. Thus, these experiments reported on gene expression in dissected tissue, a method that would be difficult and costly to implement in a practical selection process. In the current PHGC gene expression study, all animals were infected and comparisons were made between susceptible and more resistant pigs within breed. The difference in susceptibility was indirectly measured by growth rate post-infection and viremia levels in the blood. Bates et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] earlier reported a similar study using infected susceptible pigs, that showed a high PRRSv burden (high responders, H) and infected but tolerant or resistant animals with a low PRRSv burden (low responders, L). At 14 dpi, lungs and bronchial lymph nodes were collected and several genes such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding &#x003b4; protein (CEBP&#x003b4;) and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), with a differential expression (DE) level between H and L in one or both tissues, were found using the 13&#x000a0;K Qiagen-NRSP8 porcine oligo array [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A follow-up study using the 20&#x000a0;K Pigoligoarray on the same samples confirmed the DE of several of these candidate genes, as well as additional immune response candidate genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>In gene expression studies conducted on pigs within the PHGC trials, the blood transcriptome is examined because of its collection ease, the large number of animals that can be sampled, the possibility of repeated sampling of the same individual, and, ultimately, the chance to develop biomarkers for selection purposes. In 2013, an initial gene expression study performed on the first PHGC trial was published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In this study, twelve animals that represented all four combinations of two extreme phenotypes regarding weight gain (high growth rate versus low growth rate) and viral load (high viral load versus low viral load) were selected for study. The blood transcriptome of these twelve pigs on several dpi was compared using the Pigoligoarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], the annotation used was the current NCBI RefSeq annotation. Array probes and their annotation can be downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.animalgenome.org/pig/projects/oligoAnnot/2014/">www.animalgenome.org/pig/projects/oligoAnnot/2014/</ext-link> (see GPL7435 array). One main goal of the Arceo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] study was to determine an adequate sample size and to decide which dpi were the most informative with regard to future PRRS response expression studies in the blood. The study described herein is an expansion to that study, investigating the expression profile of sufficient numbers of blood samples as proposed by Arceo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Samples were taken at three early time points (0, 4 and 7 dpi) for at least 20 infected animals per phenotypic group. A linear modeling approach was used to find DE genes between phenotypic extremes or different WUR genotypes. Besides annotation analyses of DE gene lists, weighted gene co-expression network analyses (WGCNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and partial correlation and information theory (PCIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] were used to explore these expression datasets. Co-expression changes that look at how clustering or correlations change in response to treatment are more sensitive to detect pathway signaling differences between such treatments. In this way, co-expression analyses may be more sensitive at detecting biologically interesting effects than differential expression analyses. The WGCNA and PCIT approaches allow us to go beyond lists of individual DE genes and identify gene expression networks correlated with relevant phenotypes or WUR genotype.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and phenotypic groups</title><p>This study was conducted as part of the PHGC project. Experimental design, details of the infection and tissue collection procedures are described in Lunney et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and Rowland et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Briefly, in each PHGC trial, approximately 200 pigs were transported at weaning age to the biosecure testing facility at Kansas State University and allocated in pens of 10 to 15 pigs per pen. All animals came from PRRSv, <italic>Mycoplasma hyopneumonia</italic>e and swine influenza virus free high health farms. After a one-week acclimation, pigs were intramuscularly and intranasally infected with a known isolate of PRRSv (10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of NVSL 97&#x02013;7985). Blood samples were taken at 0, 4, 7, 11, 14, 19/21, 28, 35 and 40/42 dpi. Viremia levels on these dpi were measured in the serum using qRT-PCR, as described by Boddicker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Weight was measured at day 0 and weekly thereafter. Pigs were euthanized at 42&#x000a0;dpi. Viral load (VL) was measured as area under the log curve of these viremia levels from 0 to 21 dpi. Weight gain (WG) was measured from 0 to 42 dpi. Animals used in this study were part of trials 1, 3 and 4. Pigs used in PHGC trial 1 (PHGC1) and PHGC3 were the offspring of Landrace boars and Large White sows, and the average viremia levels on 4, 7, 11, 14 and 21dpi, VL over 21dpi and WG over 21 and 42dpi of these animals can be found in Boddicker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Pigs in PHGC4 came from Duroc sires crossed with Large White/Landrace/Yorkshire sows. Additional details on VL and WG for these animals is reported in Boddicker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Animals were assigned to four phenotypic groups according to VL and WG, as described by Arceo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], with minor variation: the criteria for selection was that the normalized weight and viral load were larger than 0.25 standard deviations (SD) of the mean instead of 0.5 SD of the mean. The groups were defined as follows: high VL with maximal WG, referred to as HvHg; high VL with reduced WG or HvLg; low VL with maximal WG, or LvHg; and low VL with reduced WG, or LvLg (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). An overview of the animals used is given in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Besides collecting blood for viremia measurements, 3&#x000a0;mL of blood samples were also collected into Tempus&#x02122; Blood RNA tubes (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 0, 4, and 7dpi. Total RNA was extracted using Tempus&#x02122; Spin RNA Isolation Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol.

A block reference design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] was followed to allocate samples to slides with each individual pig&#x02019;s 0dpi-sample serving as reference for the other two samples from the same animal. Reference sample dye flipping was performed across replicates within phenotypic groups to allow separation of dye and 0dpi effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Fluorescent images and fluorescence intensity data were collected as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

Several contrasts were computed: 1) WUR genotypes, 2) interaction between growth and viral load groups, 3) effect of viral load within growth group, 4) effect of growth within viral load group and 5) 4dpi or 7dpi versus 0 dpi. To account for multiple testing, the false discovery rate (FDR: q-value) procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] was used to adjust p-values obtained for each contrast.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Validation of the microarray results using RNAseq</title><p>Validation of DE gene lists of genes with a <italic>q</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05 was done using log normalized and model adjusted expression values obtained from an RNAseq experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In short, the RNAseq experiment was performed on 16 animals of PHGC3, 7 of which were among the 100 animals used in the microarray experiment, the expression profiles of the remaining 9 animals are independent. To normalize the RNAseq data, the Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) method was used (edgeR package version 3.4.2). Data for lowly expressed genes, whose maximum TMM expression value across samples was less than 10, were removed, and model adjustments were made for pre- and post-globin reduction RNA Integrity Number, and 5&#x02032;-3&#x02032; read skewness. In all, 8,997 annotated genes were retained. For the 4dpi-0dpi microarray dataset, 31 of the 67 genes from the DE list at a q-value of&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05 were among those 8,997 genes. For the 7dpi-0dpi, 15 of 34 were annotated in both the microarray and RNAseq experiment. Those common 31 and 15 genes were used to test validation of the 4dpi-0dpi and 7dpi-0dpi microarray experiment, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>WGCNA analysis and module stability</title><p>The WGCNA R package was used to cluster highly correlated genes and find clusters whose expression was correlated with the traits examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. WGCNA was carried out on data from all 19,981 oligonucleotides of the 4dpi-0dpi dataset for all 100 animals. An adjacency matrix based on expression correlation was created using a soft threshold procedure to allow a scale free topology. The clusters created by WGCNA are called modules, and the minimum number of genes in a module was set to 30. Genes not classified in a correlated module were grouped in a grey &#x02018;rest of data&#x02019; module. To see whether modules were stable for each dataset, the module stability was examined using the module stability analysis embedded in the WGCNA package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Once the modules were created, the animals&#x02019; phenotypic information was correlated with the module eigengene (ME). The eigengene of a module&#x000a0;is defined as the eigenvector associated with the first principal component of the expression matrix and is used as a &#x02018;supergene&#x02019; or a linear combination of expression from all genes in the module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Phenotypes to analyze in our experiments were WG, VL and WUR genotype. For WG and VL, the raw values were adjusted for trial mean effects by computing the residuals of a linear model that included the categorical effect of trial. These adjusted values will be referred to as WG residual and VL residual. Because the desired values of WG (higher) and VL (lower) are opposite in direction, a Desirability coefficient (Des coef) was calculated to combine the WG and VL variables as follows: <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}				\usepackage{amsmath}

The significance of a partial correlation between a target and hub gene was determined using an information theory approach that sets the significance threshold based on the direct and partial correlation for all tests performed in the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In this way, the significance of an edge in the network is determined by the information in a specific dataset.

Animals with specific genotypes at this locus have been shown to have different infection response phenotypes in other PHGC studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For example, in the current dataset, we found that viremia levels were already significantly different between AA (1461.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;175.6) and AB animals (561.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;82.3) at 4dpi (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005). A microarray analysis was then performed on RNA prepared from whole blood collected at 0, 4 or 7 dpi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>First, a linear model analysis was used to identify significant gene expression differences due to a PRRSv infection over time. Blood RNA levels at 4dpi versus 0dpi, or 7dpi versus 0dpi were compared. Significant DE was found in 67 and 239 genes between 4dpi and 0dpi at an FDR of 0.05 and 0.10, respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

GO term analyses were performed at an FDR of 0.10.

However, enrichment scores for these GO terms were only marginally significant and therefore did not indicate a strongly upregulated pathway (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). mRNA binding, translation initiation factor activity and mRNA processing activities were downregulated after infection.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Numbers of DE genes for the different comparisons</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Comparison</th><th># of DE genes (FDR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.10)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="4">WG effect</td><td>HvHg-HvLg contrast on 4dpi</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>HvHg-HvLg contrast on 7dpi</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>LvHg-LvLg contrast on 4dpi</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>LvHg-LvLg contrast on 7dpi</td><td>709</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">VL effect</td><td>HvHg-LvHg contrast on 4dpi</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>HvHg-LvHg contrast on 7dpi</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>HvLg-LvLg contrast on 4dpi</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>HvLg-LvLg contrast on 7dpi</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">WG and VL interaction effect</td><td>(HvHg-HvLg)-(LvHg-LvLg) contrast on 4dpi</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>(HvHg-HvLg)-(LvHg-LvLg) contrast on 7dpi</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">day effect</td><td>4dpi-0dpi contrast</td><td>239</td></tr><tr><td>7dpi-0dpi contrast</td><td>165</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">genotype effect</td><td>genotype (AB vs AA) contrast on 4dpi</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>genotype (AB vs AA) contrast on 7dpi</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Comparisons were made for a WG, VL, day and genotype effect.

Only the comparison between LvHg and LvLg animals on 7dpi showed sufficient DE genes (709) at an FDR of 0.10 to permit annotation enrichment analysis (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). GO terms showed enrichment of the Toll-like signaling pathway in this contrast but, as above, this enrichment was only marginally significant.

For this approach, the clustering tool WGCNA was used to analyze the 4dpi-0dpi dataset. To create the WGCNA modules, a soft threshold power of 3 was chosen, as suggested by the software as being the best threshold to create a scale free topology, while still giving a suitable amount of node connectivity. WGCNA created 18 modules based on the correlation of 4dpi-0dpi expression ratios across the 100 samples and they were assigned a color label. All uncorrelated genes were assigned to a grey module (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The correlations of all MEs with trial were examined and shown to be non-significant, as expected in trial-corrected data (data not shown). The correlations of MEs with WG and WG residuals or with VL and VL residuals were similar, so only correlations with WG and VL are further discussed. Four modules had MEs that were significantly correlated (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.1) with VL (midnightblue, blue, lightcyan and yellow), while three MEs were significantly correlated with WG (red, lightgreen and cyan). Two of those three (red and cyan) were significantly correlated with WUR genotype as well. Furthermore, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S1 shows the correlations between these modules and weight or serum viremia on specific days.

GO enrichment analysis for modules significantly correlated with VL was not very informative. The blue module (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.08), which contained over 2300 genes, was enriched in annotation for very broad terms such as transmembrane, amino acid transmembrane transporter and ion transport.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The light green module, which contained only 49 genes, did not show any significant enrichment. The cyan module contained 127 genes and was annotated as a module important for RNA processing, chromosomal organization and DNA replication. The red module, containing 506 genes, was most immunologically relevant, with GO terms such as innate immune response, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and complement activation.</p><p>To see if a significant correlation of the modules was primarily due to an up- or downregulation of expression of genes in that cluster, or whether it could be partly explained by specific cell types, a cell type enrichment analysis was performed on both datasets using the web-based tool CTEN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

Genes shown to have significant differences in connections between groups with a distinct set of genes are called hub genes and could identify a difference in gene regulation between these groups. In this study, the phenotypic contrasts provided to PCIT were Hg versus Lg, Hv versus Lv, High Des coef (&#x0003e;0.5) versus Low Des coef (&#x0003c;0.5), and AA versus AB WUR genotype. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Table S5 shows for each contrast the top 10 differentially connected hub genes, their annotation and the difference in number of correlates between the two contrasts. For these PCIT analyses, Information Theory was used to determine the significance of correlation in these PCIT analyses. This approach considers the total number of correlations calculated for the entire dataset and only the partial correlation values that achieve the significance threshold for the entire dataset are retained to define the connectivity between a target and hub gene. To explore the effect of these differences, all correlates of the 10 extreme DH genes were combined and the resulting gene list examined for GO term enrichment. In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, significant GO annotation terms are shown for the correlates that were only present in the Lv group or more strongly connected to at least one of the top 10 extreme hub genes in the Lv group when compared to the Hv group.

Although a substantial number of animals that represented each of the four extreme phenotypic groups were evaluated in a linear model based approach, few differentially expressed genes were found. The linear model declared a relatively small number of genes upregulated at 4dpi and 7dpi when compared to 0dpi, while DE genes were found in a single phenotypic group comparison, and this only when looking at the 7dpi expression profiles. GO annotation enrichment analyses of these lists did illustrate some upregulated immune responses after infection for both 4dpi and 7dpi, and in the Lg group compared to the Hg group at 7dpi. Nevertheless, this analysis found few terms were enriched within these gene lists, and therefore a limited amount of biological insight could be gleaned from these analyses.</p><p>In addition, after trying to validate the gene expression pattern differences measured by the microarray between 4dpi or 7dpi and 0dpi, it became clear that the 7dpi-0dpi dataset was difficult to validate, as was also seen earlier by Arceo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. To validate these data, RNAseq data from blood taken from an independent set of animals was used. Although both RNAseq and microarray analyses measure the transcriptome, studies report different genes as DE using one method or the other, even when using the exact same samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In addition, the difficult validation of the 7dpi dataset may also be due to the fact that different groups of animals were analyzed by the two techniques, and at 7dpi, the virus is still replicating in some animals while in others the adaptive immune response might already be ramping up. Thus, significant variation is likely present in the response to PRRSv observed at 7dpi across experimental groups. For these reasons, we decided to only examine the 4dpi-0dpi dataset in further analyses.</p><p>The main goal of this study was not to investigate differences due to infection, but to explore whether there were differences between the phenotypic groups that diverged after infection. Therefore, other more sensitive analyses were performed. These more sensitive co-expression analyses emphasize differences in gene network up- or downregulation rather than individual gene expression differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>The red module is related to inflammation and its average expression is negatively correlated with weight gain after a PRRSv infection</title><p>The red module, with 506 genes, was enriched for several immune response terms and could therefore contain genes of great importance in a PRRSv infection. An overview of the genes in the red module at 4dpi-0dpi is shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Table S6. The CTEN analysis revealed that the red module genes were enriched in genes specifically expressed in CD33+ myeloid cells and CD14+ monocytes. This could indicate that the expression patterns of the genes in this module were not solely due to transcriptional changes but possibly also due to a difference in monocyte recruitment into the blood. It has been described that PRRSv infection causes an increase in CD14+ expression throughout the early stage of infection, due to a rise in CD14+ monocytes that differentiate to macrophages and migrate to bronchoalveolar spaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The red module contained several anti-apoptosis members of the BCL2 family (<italic>BCL2A1</italic>, <italic>BCL2L14</italic>, <italic>BCL2L15</italic>, <italic>MCL1</italic>) earlier reported to be upregulated after PRRSv infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Anti-apoptosis is often seen in the early stage of a PRRSv infection: this is beneficial for the virus since anti-apoptosis expands time for viral replication in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Only later in the infection do PRRSv infected macrophages die by apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. A large portion of genes present in the red module encodes pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (<italic>TLR2</italic>, <italic>TLR4</italic>) and the CD14 co-receptor for TLR4 (<italic>CD14</italic>), C-type lectin receptors (<italic>CLEC2B</italic>, <italic>CLEC2D</italic>, <italic>CLEC4E</italic>, <italic>CLEC7A</italic>) and RIG-1-like receptors (<italic>DDX58</italic> or <italic>RIG1</italic>, <italic>MDA5</italic> or <italic>IFIH1</italic>).

Many of these genes where also found in the type I interferon/cytokine mediated immune response cluster found by the Immune Response Annotation Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, genes, seen to have a specific PRRS response expression pattern, elicited by macrophages or lymph nodes, were not clustered in this red module, nor in any other cluster. Type I interferons induce an innate antiviral response, and PRRSv infection has been observed to dampen or delay the type I interferon transcriptional response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Ait-Ali et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] described a difference in PRRS susceptibility between macrophages isolated from Landrace versus Pi&#x000e9;train pigs. The main difference was the rate with which type I interferon transcriptional changes occurred: they suggested this as the underlying reason for breed differences in PRRS susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Souza et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] reported that IFN&#x003b1; levels in serum increased rapidly after a PRRS infection. However, after 4dpi, the best animals (LvHg group) had the fastest return to basal levels; as early as 7dpi, the IFN&#x003b1; levels were significantly lower in this group compared to other phenotype quadrants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In our study, the red module, that contained several interferon-stimulated genes, was found to be negatively correlated with WG and positively with WUR genotype, which meant that animals with a lower weight at 42dpi or animals with the unfavorable genotype for WUR expressed higher levels of these genes at 4dpi. Because a significant difference in viremia was noticeable between the two WUR genotype groups already at 4dpi in these pigs, we propose that the effect of genotype on phenotype is already present by this time. Since the red module was positively correlated with viremia at 4dpi, our hypothesis is that the resistant AB animals control virus replication through red module interferon-stimulated genes prior to 4dpi. This earlier, and possibly more effective response, is supported by IFN&#x003b1; data on similarly challenged PHGC cohorts, which shows that LvHg animals more quickly bring down their IFN&#x003b1; serum levels. This drop is significantly faster and to lower levels for these LvHg animals compared to the other groups, indicating a faster initiation of the resolution of the anti-viral response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Hulst et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] showed that type I interferon expression in the blood can differ between susceptible and more resistant pigs to a classical swine fever infection. In their study, no significant pathways involved in the induction of the antiviral IFN type I response were upregulated in chronically diseased pigs at 4dpi or 8dpi, while in pigs that recovered rapidly, these pathways were already significantly upregulated at 4dpi until recovery at 10-12dpi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], which supports our theory that better adapted animals induce the interferon type I response faster. We further speculate that susceptible AA animals demand more energy by keeping their immune system active longer (higher expression in blood of red module genes at 4 dpi), which could manifest in poor growth in the long run [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p>Besides interferon-stimulated genes, other inflammatory response genes were found in the red module. Miller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] recently described the infection response in tracheobronchial lymph nodes to two PRRSv strains, a Chinese highly pathogenic rJXwn06 strain and the US VR-2332 strain. They found that the RNAs for serum amyloid A2 acute phase proteins, <italic>S100A8</italic>, <italic>S100A9</italic> and <italic>S100A12</italic>, were amongst the top upregulated genes in animals inoculated with these strains compared to sham inoculated pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. <italic>S100A8</italic> and <italic>s100A12</italic> are found in the red module. Another gene in this module was <italic>TREM1</italic>, known to trigger release of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, and found by Miller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and Badaoui et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] to be highly induced after PRRSv infection. Furthermore, <italic>NLRP3</italic>, <italic>CASP1</italic>, <italic>IL1B</italic> and <italic>IL18</italic> were also found in the red module. The inflammasome gene <italic>NLRP3</italic> is known to activate <italic>CASP1</italic>, which leads to the activation of <italic>IL1B</italic> and <italic>IL18</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]; all have been previously shown to be upregulated after PRRSv infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. These inflammatory responses are of interest with regard to the different WUR genotypes, since the region near the WUR SNP in the SSC4 region contains several immune-related genes such as members of the Leucine Rich Repeat Containing protein 8 (<italic>LRRC8</italic>) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] and genes belonging to the Guanylate Binding Protein (<italic>GBP</italic>) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Recently, a putative causal mutation for the SSC4 PRRS host response QTL associated with WUR was identified in <italic>GBP5</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Since <italic>GBP5</italic> directly regulates <italic>NLRP3</italic> inflammasome assembly, it is interesting that the red module includes <italic>NLRP3</italic> and several of the inflammatory genes that it regulates. Finally, Wysocki et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] have described the importance of the complement cascade during PRRSv response, and the red module contains genes encoding several complement regulatory proteins such as C4BPA, the decay-accelerating factor (DAF) CD55, the membrane cofactor of proteolysis (MCP) CD46 and the C1 inhibitor SERPING1, all inhibitors of complement activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. This points to a difference in complement regulation in the slower growing animals, or those that have the unfavorable WUR genotype.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>PCIT analysis clearly indicates immune network differences between phenotypic divergent animals early after PRRSv infection</title><p>In a next step, PCIT was used to explore the regulatory networks that changed between animals with different phenotypes or genotypes at 4dpi. The largest difference in GO terms enriched in the group of correlates could be seen in those for lymphocyte activation, and this effect was strongest when the viral load phenotypes were contrasted. In other words, animals that belonged to the Lv group had top hub genes with tighter connections to genes in the immune activation pathways than did the Hv group at 4dpi. This difference was also noticeable when looking at the GO term enrichment of the correlates of the 10 extreme hub genes in the Hg and Lg groups, where animals showed tighter connections to immune genes in the Lg group. As discussed previously, this result can be explained by the allocation of energy to immune response activation rather than growth. Thus, the Lg animals may partition more energy to immune response and have less energy to put towards weight gain. The difference in connection to the immune genes disappeared when looking at the Low Des coef animals, that had high viremia levels and had a reduced growth, in comparison to the better High Des coef animals. There are only small differences between the unfavorable AA animals and the favorable AB animals, with the most apparent difference in enriched B cell and T cell differentiation GO terms in the AA animals. The top different hub genes in the networks between the most and least desirable phenotype (LvHg versus HvLg, respectively) or genotype (AB versus AA, respectively) did not differ greatly in their connection to immune genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Do WGCNA and PCIT methods agree with one another?</title><p>As seen earlier, the red module from the WGCNA analysis, annotated as a highly immune gene rich module, was negatively correlated with weight gain and more highly expressed in the AA animals. This agrees with the PCIT results, where immune response GO terms were more enriched in the correlates of the Lg over the Hg group and, to a lower extent, the AA versus AB animals. However, it is not predominantly the genes in the red module that were more tightly correlated in the PCIT analyses. Combining results across these analyses, it is clear that the immune response pathways regulated at 4dpi play a substantial role when defining the pig&#x02019;s long-term phenotypic response to a PRRSv infection, as affirmed by Boddicker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> it can be seen that modules of co-expressed genes are correlated with weight gain, viral load or neither of these two, but never with weight gain and viral load simultaneously. A significant correlation of the Des coef with the ME in the magenta and lightcyan module was driven by only one of the two phenotypes. The PCIT results indicated that in this 4dpi-0dpi dataset it is more difficult to find co-expressed gene clusters correlated with both phenotypes in a desired direction. From the earliest PHGC trials it was clear that VL and WG were only poorly correlated; however, the SSC4 allele perfectly negatively correlated WG with VL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Other genomic influences would be predicted to influence just one not both traits. The greatest difference in GO term enrichment of the correlates of top 10 hub genes for both VL and WG are both immune response terms: they are more strongly connected with the desired phenotype for VL, but at the same time, also with the undesired phenotype for WG.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, it became clear that a gene-by-gene linear modeling analysis was not sufficiently sensitive to find expression differences in the blood early after infection between animals with a different weight gain or viral load after a PRRSv infection or between animals with the favorable and unfavorable WUR genotype. However, the network-level approaches WGCNA and PCIT successfully found co-expressed immune response genes at 4dpi when compared to 0dpi to be correlated as a group with weight gain, viral load or WUR genotype. Thus these genes can be useful targets in future efforts to select for disease-resistant pigs.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Availability of supporting data</title><p>All microarray experimental data are MIAME compliant and have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with the accession number: GSE69515 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69515">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69515</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12864_2015_1741_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>List of DE genes (FDR&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.10) between 4dpi and 0dpi.
