Based on their role as modulators, it has been postulated that microRNAs canalize development and provide genetic robustness. Here, we uncover a novel regulatory layer of chemokine signaling by microRNAs that confers genetic robustness on primordial-germ-cell (PGC) migration. In zebrafish, PGCs are guided to the gonad by the ligand Sdf1a, which is regulated by sequestration receptor Cxcr7b. We find that miR-430 regulates sdf1a- and cxcr7-mRNAs. Using Target Protectors, we demonstrate that miR-430-mediated regulation of endogenous <italic>sdf1a</italic> and <italic>cxcr7b</italic> (i) facilitates dynamic expression of <italic>sdf1a</italic> by clearing its mRNA from previous expression domains, (ii) modulates the levels of the decoy receptor Cxcr7b to avoid excessive depletion of Sdf1a and (iii) buffers against variation in gene dosage of chemokine signaling components to ensure accurate PGC migration. Our results indicate that losing microRNA-mediated regulation can expose otherwise buffered genetic lesions leading to developmental defects.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Biological systems can compensate for genetic and environmental perturbations. Genetic buffering allows invariance of the phenotype in the face of perturbations. This endows the organism with reduced susceptibility to mutations and results in robustness<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. External perturbations may arise from changes in the environment while internal factors derive from inexact processes within a cell, such as transcriptional bursts, changes in gene dosage, and leaky transcription<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. This variation in gene expression may lead to fluctuation in activity, limiting the accuracy of specific cellular processes. In order to prevent these fluctuations from having a severe impact on the phenotype, several mechanisms for providing robustness have evolved. First, creating networks of feed-back and feed-forward loops can reduce the effects of variation by stabilizing different phenotypic states, such that minor variation will not be sufficient to alter the current state<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Second, functional redundancy within regulatory networks provides stability because multiple changes need to occur to perturb the system<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Third, genetic buffering prevents small changes at the genetic level from influencing the phenotype. For example, the chaperone protein HSP90 facilitates proper folding of mutant proteins, masking the effects of these mutations by preventing variation in expression and activity<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Finally, additional mechanisms might be in place at the RNA level to provide robustness and guard against transcriptional fluctuations. It has been proposed that high levels of transcription coupled with inefficient translation can lower intrinsic noise in protein output<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. This is supported both by theoretical models and experimental evidence in unicellular organisms<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Because of their ability to regulate a wide variety of genes<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, their function as rheostats that modulate the mRNA and protein output of their target genes<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, and their position within network motifs (reviewed in<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) it has been postulated that microRNAs (miRNAs) may play an important role in buffering biological systems against genetic variation. A prominent example in Drosophila is miR-7, which functions within a feed-forward loop to guard against the consequences of temperature fluctuation to stabilize a phenotypic state<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. However, few studies have experimentally addressed the role of miRNAs in genetic robustness in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Loss of miRNAs leads to mislocalized PGCs</title><p id="P3">In this study we investigate the role of miRNAs in buffering against genetic variation in vertebrates using long-distance cell migration as a model. In this context, slight perturbations in protein levels or distribution of guidance cues might lead to erroneous cell migration because the chance that such small fluctuations will affect cell migration accumulates with the distance the cells need to migrate. Primordial germ cell (PGC) migration in zebrafish is a prominent example of such a long-distance migratory process that is likely evolutionarily reinforced (reviewed in<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). PGCs express the chemokine receptor Cxcr4b and follow the shifting expression domain of its ligand Sdf1a (Cxcl12a) as they migrate through the gastrulating embryo to reach the site of the future gonad. The dynamic expression of the ligand in the somatic tissues plays a crucial role in determining the migratory path and must be tightly regulated at the protein and the mRNA levels (reviewed in<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). It has been proposed that the Sdf1a protein gradient is refined by Cxcr7, a &#x0201c;decoy&#x0201d; receptor that is thought to act as an Sdf1a sink<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. At the mRNA level, new transcriptional domains must be coupled to rapid removal of the transcripts that remains in previous domains of expression, yet the mechanisms underlying this regulation are elusive. One possibility involves rapid removal of <italic>sdf1a</italic> transcripts from tissues where they are no longer needed through miRNA-mediated degradation. To test this idea, we examined PGC localization in the absence of miRNAs. We have generated mutant embryos lacking both the maternal and the zygotic contribution of the miRNA-processing enzyme dicer (MZ<italic>dicer</italic>)<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Intriguingly, in such embryos we find that PGCs are frequently mislocalized. This mismigration is not due to disruption of the migratory path, as these somatic tissues are properly specified in MZ<italic>dicer</italic>. Importantly, re-introducing miR-430 or one of its mammalian homologues, miR-302, into MZ<italic>dicer</italic> mutants rescued the localization of PGCs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). These results suggest that miR-430-mediated repression of specific targets mRNAs may play a role in PGC migration.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>miR-430 can regulate expression of chemokine signaling genes</title><p id="P4">Because miRNAs accelerate the decay of their target mRNAs, we have previously used microarrays to identify miRNA targets by comparing gene expression in wild type, MZ<italic>dicer</italic> and MZ<italic>dicer</italic> injected with miR-430<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Analysis of these data revealed that <italic>sdf1a</italic> and <italic>cxcr4b</italic> might be repressed by miR-430 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). To determine whether additional genes in the chemokine signaling pathway are directly regulated by miR-430, we searched their 3&#x02032;UTRs for sequences complementary to the miR-430 &#x0201c;seed&#x0201d; sequence (reviewed in<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This analysis revealed that 3&#x02032;UTRs of both ligands (<italic>sdf1a</italic> and <italic>sdf1b</italic>) and receptors (<italic>cxcr4a</italic>, <italic>cxcr4b</italic>, <italic>cxcr7a</italic>, and <italic>cxcr7b</italic>) contain putative miR-430 target sites (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2 and 3</xref>). If these transcripts are regulated by miR-430, then the target site in each 3&#x02032;UTR should influence their translation. To test this hypothesis, we co-injected reporter mRNAs encoding the GFP ORF and each full length 3&#x02032;UTR with a dsRed control mRNA (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). To analyze the level of regulation of each target, we quantified the fluorescence of the GFP reporter relative to the dsRed control in the presence or absence of miRNAs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). These 3&#x02032;UTRs conferred repression of GFP in wild type but not in MZ<italic>dicer</italic> mutants that lack mature miR-430 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c, d</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Next, we tested whether miR-430 sites play a direct role in the regulation. Mutating the miR-430 sites in each 3&#x02032;UTR (GCACUU to GCUGAU) prevented miRNA-mediated repression of reporter mRNAs in wild type embryos (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c, d</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). To further characterize the regulation of the <italic>sdf1a</italic> 3&#x02032;UTR, we mutated individual target sites in this reporter. We found that mutation of the first target site was necessary and sufficient to relieve repression of the GFP reporter. However, mutating the second or third target site did not affect regulation of the reporter (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). These results indicate that the ligand (<italic>sdf1a</italic>) and the decoy receptors <italic>cxcr7a/b</italic> are more strongly regulated by miR-430 (&#x0003e;2-fold) than <italic>cxcr4a/b</italic> and <italic>sdf1b</italic> (&#x0003c;2-fold). On the basis of the regulation provided by the <italic>sdf1a</italic> and <italic>cxcr7</italic> 3&#x02032;UTRs and their essential role in PGC migration, we focused our analysis on these genes.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Target Protectors specifically relieve miR-430-mediated repression</title><p id="P5">The analysis of individual miRNA-mRNA interactions in animals that are depleted of most miRNAs poses a challenge because many miRNA targets are misregulated<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. To investigate the physiological function of miR-430-mediated regulation of <italic>sdf1a</italic> and <italic>cxcr7a/b</italic>, we employed Target Protectors (TPs). TPs are morpholino antisense oligonucleotides that are complementary to the miRNA recognition site in the transcript and interfere with miRNA-mRNA interactions, thus protecting a specific target from its miRNA (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>)<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Three lines of evidence indicate that TPs interfere with the regulation of <italic>sdf1a</italic> and <italic>cxcr7</italic> by miR-430. First, TPs for <italic>sdf1a</italic>, <italic>cxcr7a</italic> and <italic>cxcr7b</italic> restore expression of the GFP reporter to a level similar to that observed in the absence of miR-430-mediated repression (mutated reporter; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, c</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3 and 4</xref>). Individual TPs for each target site in the <italic>sdf1a</italic> 3&#x02032;UTR were injected. Consistent with the results obtained during the mutagenesis of individual target sites, injection of a TP complementary to the first site (TP1) was sufficient to relieve repression to the level of the mutated reporter (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Conversely TPs for the second and third sites did not have a noticeable effect, suggesting that the first miR-430 target site in <italic>sdf1a</italic> confers most of the regulation. Thus in all following experiments sdf1a-TP refers to the TP complementary to the first target site in <italic>sdf1a</italic>. Second, injection of the TPs into MZ<italic>dicer</italic> mutants did not affect the expression level of the endogenous target mRNA compared to control MZ<italic>dicer</italic> mutants (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), suggesting that each TP does not cause stabilization of the target mRNA independent of the miRNA. Third, a TP designed to bind to a region of the <italic>sdf1a</italic> 3&#x02032;UTR approximately 200 bases downstream of the first miR-430 binding site (sdf1a-control-TP) did not affect repression of the reporter, indicating that target protection depends on the overlap with the miRNA target site (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). These results indicate that sdf1a-TP, cxcr7a-TP, and cxcr7b-TP provide specific tools to interfere with miRNA-mediated regulation of endogenous <italic>sdf1a</italic> and <italic>cxcr7a/b</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="background"><title>Regulation of <italic>sdf1a</italic> and <italic>cxcr7b</italic> by miR-430 promotes accurate PGC migration</title><p id="P6">To investigate the physiological role of each miRNA-target interaction, we quantified PGC localization in TP-injected embryos. Blocking miR-430 regulation of <italic>sdf1a</italic> or <italic>cxcr7b</italic> by injection of sdf1a-TP or cxcr7b-TP but not cxcr7a-TP increased the percentage of embryos with mislocalized germ cells at 24 hpf (from 30% in wild type to more than 60%)(<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Injection of sdf1a-TP resulted in an increase in germ cells that were outside the location of the future gonad (bracket, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>) and remained in the posterior pronephric regions (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Blocking the regulation of <italic>sdf1a</italic> by miR-430 increased both the number of mislocalized cells and the fraction of embryos with mislocalized cells posterior to the future gonad. Conversely, protecting <italic>cxcr7b</italic> from miR-430 regulation caused mislocalization of a significantly higher number of cells to ectopic positions in the tail (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). These results are consistent with a model in which misregulation of Cxcr7b depletes the Sdf1a protein, causing the PGCs to lose the correct migratory path. Two controls support the specificity of these effects. First, injection of sdf1a-control-TP did not significantly increase the percentage of embryos with mislocalized PGCs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, c</xref>). Second, we asked whether the TP phenotypes are caused by the binding of the TPs to their cognate target 3&#x02032;UTR rather than off-targets. Since TPs block the repression of the target by the miRNA, increasing the protein expression from the mRNA, we reasoned that if the TP phenotype is due to an increase in expression of the target gene, it should be rescued by lowering the translation of this target (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Indeed, a low level of a translation blocking morpholino complementary to <italic>sdf1a</italic> AUG start site<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> rescued the mislocalization seen upon injection of sdf1a-TP alone (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c, d, f</xref>). Similar results were observed for cxcr7b-TP and its AUG blocking morpholino<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>(<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c, e, g</xref>). These results suggest that miR-430 regulation of endogenous <italic>sdf1a</italic> and <italic>cxcr7b</italic> plays a role in PGC migration.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>miR-430 promotes clearance of <italic>sdf1a</italic> from previous domains of expression</title><p id="P7">Germ cell migration depends on the dynamic expression of the ligand Sdf1a that elicits local attraction of the PGCs to a series of intermediate positions before reaching the future gonad<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Guidance is therefore achieved in part by modifying the position of the attractive domain. This process requires tightly controlled expression of <italic>sdf1a</italic> in new domains and rapid degradation of <italic>sdf1a</italic> transcripts lingering in old expression domains. Initially, <italic>sdf1a</italic> is expressed along the lateral mesoderm region and later becomes restricted to the anterior domains to attract the cells to the future gonad (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this dynamic expression are largely unknown. Based on the germ cell mismigration observed in sdf1a-TP injected embryos we hypothesized that miR-430 could facilitate clearance of previously expressed transcripts and, therefore, sharpen the domain of ligand expression. Using in situ hybridization, we found that <italic>sdf1a</italic> 3&#x02032;UTR can enhance degradation of the GFP reporter mRNA, an effect that is dependent on the first miR-430 target site. (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). We then examined the impact of miR-430 on endogenous <italic>sdf1a</italic> transcripts in MZ<italic>dicer</italic> and TP-injected embryos. Throughout PGC migration, <italic>sdf1a</italic> expression is stronger in sdf1a-TP and MZ<italic>dicer</italic> embryos (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Consistent with our previously published microarray data (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>)<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, qPCR shows that <italic>sdf1a</italic> mRNA levels are increased in MZ<italic>dicer</italic> embryos (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref>). Interfering with miR-430 regulation resulted in an expansion of the <italic>sdf1a</italic> expression domain, with a failure to clear it from more posterior regions of the trunk mesoderm (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>). The regions that fail to clear <italic>sdf1a</italic> mRNA coincide with the position of mislocalized germ cells in sdf1a-TP injected embryos. Thus, miR-430 is required to modulate the amount of <italic>sdf1a</italic> RNA and to shape its expression pattern by clearing transcripts from old expression domains.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Cxcr7b and miR-430 negatively regulate <italic>sdf1a</italic></title><p id="P8">To test whether Cxcr7b and miR-430 function to regulate <italic>sdf1a</italic> in a partially redundant manner, we asked whether <italic>cxcr7b</italic> interacted genetically with miR-430-mediated regulation of <italic>sdf1a</italic>. Decreasing the level of <italic>sdf1a</italic> regulation by miR-430 enhanced the germ cell migration defect observed in a hypomorphic condition <italic>cxcr7b</italic> caused by injecting subthreshold levels of a <italic>cxcr7b</italic> translation blocking morpholino (cxcr7b AUG MO) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a&#x02013;c</xref>). This phenotype was more severe than the sdf1a-TP alone in regards to the number of embryos affected as well as the mislocalization of the germ cells to the tail and head regions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). A similar result was seen when injecting the cxcr7b-TP with an AUG MO for <italic>sdf1a</italic> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d&#x02013;f</xref>).

By dampening the expression of both the ligand and the decoy receptor, miR-430 may provide robustness to chemokine signaling. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the ability of miR-430 targeting to buffer against higher levels of <italic>sdf1a</italic> and <italic>cxcr7b</italic> (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Embryos injected with increasing amounts of <italic>sdf1a</italic> or <italic>cxcr7b</italic> mRNAs with the mut-3&#x02032;UTR, but not the wt-3&#x02032;UTR, show an increase in germ cell mismigration (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b&#x02013;e</xref>). For instance, injecting 15 pg of sdf1a-mut-3&#x02032;UTR significantly increases the percentage of embryos with mislocalized PGCs, but embryos receiving this amount of sdf1a-wt-3&#x02032;UTR show a wild type phenotype (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b, d</xref>). This suggests that repression by miR-430 is able to protect PGC migration from elevated levels of gene expression.</p><p id="P10">We then tested the role of miR-430 in compensating for decreases in expression. We began by eliminating miR-430-mediated regulation of chemokine signaling by co-injecting sdf1a-TP and cxcr7b-TP. This combination results in a wild-type phenotype, presumably because the increase in Cxcr7b can compensate for the increase in Sdf1a (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, No AUG MO). To mimic genetic variation, we co-injected a low level of a morpholino against the chemokine signal or either of its receptors in the presence (No TP) or the absence of miR-430 mediated regulation (sdf1a-TP and cxcr7b-TP). Reducing the gene dosage of <italic>sdf1a</italic>, <italic>cxcr7b</italic>, or <italic>cxcr4b</italic> increased PGC mismigration in the absence of miR-430 regulation (with 60% of the embryos presenting mislocalized germ cells) but not in wild type embryos (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).

The incidence of germ cell mismigration for either of these heterozygous mutant embryos is similar to wild type.

Together, these experiments indicate that miR-430 lowers expression of <italic>sdf1a</italic> and <italic>cxcr7b</italic> such that minor perturbations in gene dosage do not cause mismigration (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Upon specific removal of the miRNA regulation, the system is more sensitive to small changes caused by a reduction in protein level or gene copy number. Together, these observations suggest that miR-430 provides genetic robustness and protects against alterations in gene dosage.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P11">Secreted signaling molecules are potent developmental regulators, and therefore their expression must be tightly controlled.

This regulation is necessary for accurate PGC migration, since loss of miR-430 (MZ<italic>dicer</italic> mutants) or blocking miRNA target sites (Target Protectors) leads to an expansion of the <italic>sdf1a</italic> expression domain and mislocalized PGCs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). While regulation of <italic>cxcr7b</italic> and <italic>sdf1a</italic> explains some of the phenotypes observed in MZ<italic>dicer</italic>, the mismigration phenotype observed in these embryos is consistently stronger than that observed when the miRNA-mediated regulation of each individual target is blocked (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), suggesting that there might be additional targets and other miRNAs that regulate PGCs migration (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>).</p><p id="P12">mRNA degradation not only clears previous expression domains of <italic>sdf1a</italic> transcripts, but also facilitates spatial separation of different Sdf1a expression domains. Sdf1 signaling is used to guide multiple migratory events during early development, including migration of the trigeminal sensory neurons<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, the posterior lateral line primordium<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, vasculature<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and endoderm cells<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. Employing the same guidance cue for each of these migratory processes is possible because the embryo maintains spatially restricted expression domains. The separation of these domains confines the cells to their respective paths so that one type of migrating cell does not follow the path intended for another cell type. Preserving distinct Sdf1a regions is in part accomplished by sharpening of the protein expression by Cxcr7b<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Here we identify a novel regulatory mechanism, acting at the RNA level, in which miR-430 helps to maintain the separation between different migratory paths by (i) sharpening the expression domain of the ligand mRNA and by (ii) dampening the levels of the decoy receptor (Cxcr7b) to prevent excessive clearance of the guidance cue Sdf1a (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The interaction of Sdf1 with Cxcr4 and Cxcr7 is conserved among vertebrates including mice and humans<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. In addition to its roles in development, Sdf1 signaling is involved in tissue homeostasis by guiding immune cell migration<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, neo-vascularization<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, stem cell proliferation<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and homing<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. Because of their potent activities, misexpression of these molecules has been associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. miR-430 is a member of a large family of miRNAs, many of which are expressed in mammals (reviewed in <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Interestingly, human Sdf1 also contains a putative miRNA target site for the homolog of miR-430, miR-302<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, in its 3&#x02032;UTR (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). Indeed, our results indicate that miR-302 can rescue the germ cell migration in MZ<italic>dicer</italic> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), suggesting that this regulatory mechanism could be conserved in other vertebrate systems where it may regulate cell migration and contribute to metastasis.</p><p id="P14">By dampening the expression of both the ligand and its decoy receptor, miR-430 fine-tunes the amount of signaling. This interaction provides robustness by guarding against genetic variation that arises from increases or reductions in gene dosage. We observe that the embryo can withstand alterations in the levels of <italic>sdf1a</italic> and <italic>cxcr7b</italic> within a certain range, but this capacity is reduced when miR-430 function is compromised. miR-430 has previously been shown to regulate nodal signaling by dampening and balancing the expression of both the signal (<italic>nodal</italic>)<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and its antagonist (<italic>lefty</italic>)<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. As miR-430 plays a similar regulatory role in both of these contexts in the form of incoherent feed-forward loops, a more general function for miR-430 may be to balance and lower the expression of positive and negative signaling molecules, reducing the ability of perturbations to have a deleterious effect. The evidence presented here suggests that miRNAs can act as effective elements to buffer genetic variation and maintain homeostasis. Although this role of miRNAs has been proposed, supporting experimental evidence is limited, particularly in vertebrates. Several studies in invertebrates have shown a role of specific miRNAs in providing robustness based on (i) the integration of the miRNA within a network motif (feed-forward and feed-back loops)<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>; (ii) the stochastic nature of the loss-of-function phenotype<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> reviewed in<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. For example, in Drosophila, miR-263a/b regulates the proapoptotic gene hid in sensory organs to protect against the stochastic cell death that is triggered throughout the eye<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>; (iii) and the protection against environmental factors, as seen in the buffering effect of miR-7 protecting against the effect of temperature fluctuations during eye development<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Here we show that in addition to the stochastic nature of the phenotype in the TP-injected embryos, where few PGC fail to migrate to the gonad, miR-430-mediated regulation of <italic>sdf1a</italic> and <italic>cxcr7b</italic> buffers against genetic variation, providing robustness to the system.</p><p id="P15">Recent studies of the human genome have uncovered potential sources of genetic variation, most notably a large number of genetic lesions such as copy number variations, heterozygous, and homozygous mutations. Because many of these lesions have no immediately appreciable phenotype<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, regulatory mechanism must have evolved to maintain homeostasis. miRNAs are predicted to regulate over 70% of the protein coding genes in mammals, making them prime candidates for this role<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>. Based on our results, we propose that miRNAs like miR-430 might play a widespread role in buffering the genetic variation borne by common genetic lesions, providing biological robustness to the organism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Fish Strains</title><p id="P16">MZ<italic>dicer</italic> fish were generated as previously described<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>.

(a) Co-injecting sdf1a-TP and <italic>cxcr7b</italic> AUG MO causes significantly more mismigration that injection of sdf1a-TP or the same amount of the AUG MO alone (*, p=4.08&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>, sdf1a-TP + 45 fmol to 45 fmol alone; p=4.87&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>, sdf1a-TP + 90 fmol to 90 fmol alone; two-tailed Fisher&#x02019;s exact test), suggesting that miR-430 regulation of <italic>sdf1a</italic> mRNA can partially compensate for a reduction of <italic>cxcr7b</italic>. Similarly, co-injecting cxcr7b-TP and <italic>sdf1a</italic> AUG MO significantly enhances the mislocalization phenotype (*, p=8.93&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, cxcr7b-TP + 10 fmol to 10 fmol alone; p=0.016, cxcr7b-TP + 10 fmol to 10 fmol alone; two-tailed Fisher&#x02019;s exact test), suggesting that regulation of <italic>cxcr7b</italic> by miR-430 prevents excessive clearance of the <italic>sdf1a</italic>.
