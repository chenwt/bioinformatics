The latter phenotype is especially striking, as loss of SrbA results in complete loss of virulence in murine models of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). How fungal SREBPs mediate fungal virulence is unknown, though it has been suggested that lack of growth in hypoxic conditions accounts for the attenuated virulence. To further understand the role of SrbA in fungal infection site pathobiology, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used to identify genes under direct SrbA transcriptional regulation in hypoxia. These results confirmed the direct regulation of ergosterol biosynthesis and iron uptake by SrbA in hypoxia and revealed new roles for SrbA in nitrate assimilation and heme biosynthesis. Moreover, functional characterization of an SrbA target gene with sequence similarity to SrbA identified a new transcriptional regulator of the fungal hypoxia response and virulence, SrbB. SrbB co-regulates genes involved in heme biosynthesis and demethylation of C4-sterols with SrbA in hypoxic conditions. However, SrbB also has regulatory functions independent of SrbA including regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. Loss of SrbB markedly attenuates <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> virulence, and loss of both SREBPs further reduces <italic>in vivo</italic> fungal growth. These data suggest that both <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> SREBPs are critical for hypoxia adaptation and virulence and reveal new insights into SREBPs' complex role in infection site adaptation and fungal virulence.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Despite improvements in diagnostics and antifungal drug treatments, mortality rates from invasive mold infections remain high. Defining the fungal adaptation and growth mechanisms at the infection site microenvironment is one research focus that is expected to improve treatment of established invasive fungal infections. The <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> transcription factor SrbA is a major regulator of the fungal response to hypoxia found at sites of invasive fungal growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this study, new insights into how SrbA mediates hypoxia adaptation and virulence were revealed through identification of direct transcriptional targets of SrbA under hypoxic conditions. A major novel finding from these studies is the identification of a critical role in fungal hypoxia adaptation and virulence of an SrbA target gene, <italic>srbB</italic>, which is also in the SREBP family. SrbB plays a major role in regulation of heme biosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism early in the response to hypoxia.

Treatment options for invasive aspergillosis (IA) remain limited and associated mortality rates are high <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Willger1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Epidemiological studies suggest that over 200,000 cases of aspergillosis occur worldwide on an annual basis, and there is general consensus that disease caused by <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> is under diagnosed <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. It is clear that new insights into the pathophysiology of this too often lethal disease are needed to develop new diagnostic and treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes. Along these lines, investigating fungal growth <italic>in vivo</italic> at infection site microenvironments is an important area of research with significant therapeutic potential.</p><p>Observations from human IA cases and recent discoveries in murine models of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) indicate that the infection microenvironment is characterized in part by low oxygen availability (hypoxia) <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Grahl1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004487-Brock1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

One hypothesis is that hypoxia promotes fungal virulence through induction of a fungal metabolic, or bioenergetics, program that contributes to host damage. In support of this hypothesis, fungal genes required for hypoxic growth are generally critical for fungal virulence in murine models, and airway ischemia was recently shown to promote <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> invasion in an orthotropic tracheal transplant model of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> infection <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Grahl2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004487-Grahl3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>One fungal gene family required for hypoxia adaptation and growth is the sterol regulatory element binding protein family (SREBP) <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Bien1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. First identified in mammals, two distinct mammalian SREBP genes exist, SREBP-1 and SREBP-2. SREBP-1 produces two isoforms, SREBP-1a and SREBP 1-c, derived from alternative splicing of the first exon <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Hua1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. These SREBP-1 isoforms share the same DNA-binding domain, the sterol regulatory element (SRE), and have been shown to mainly regulate lipid metabolism, whereas SREBP-2 predominantly regulates cholesterol metabolism <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Horton1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Recent genomic approaches have yielded new insights into mammalian SREBP functions through identification of novel target genes. In mice, ChIP-seq analyses revealed that SREBP-1c binds upstream of genes associated with lipid biosynthesis, insulin dependent pathways, carbohydrate metabolism, and additional novel gene ontology (GO) categories including intracellular protein trafficking, cell proliferation and differentiation, and apoptosis <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Seo1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. ChIP-seq analysis of SREBP-2 target genes in murine hepatic chromatin revealed new roles for this protein in apoptosis and autophagy <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Seo2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Thus, it has been suggested that SREBPs are necessary for coordination of the cellular nutritional state and transcriptional activation by interacting with different cofactors in response to dynamic nutritional microenvironments <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>With regard to SREBP function in fungi, a seminal study in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> identified a molecular link between SREBP function and fungal hypoxia adaptation and growth <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Hughes1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In this organism, the SREBP bHLH domain containing protein, Sre1, has been identified as a primary regulator of anaerobic gene expression <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Todd1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Accordingly, an <italic>sre1</italic> deletion mutant is unable to grow in anaerobic conditions confirming an indirect molecular mechanism of oxygen sensing through Sre1 mediated monitoring of ergosterol levels <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Hughes1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Porter1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

In <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, microarray analyses of gene expression in the presence and absence of SrbA in hypoxic environments revealed significant changes in transcript levels of approximately 12% of the genes in the genome <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Willger2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004487-Blatzer1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Many of the gene transcript levels that are affected by SrbA are associated with biological processes induced by hypoxia in wild type <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> including: ergosterol biosynthesis, iron homeostasis, cell wall biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, general carbon metabolism, and the GABA shunt <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Barker1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. However it remains unclear which hypoxia induced genes are directly SrbA dependent.

In order to definitively delineate the SrbA hypoxia regulon, we utilized a multi-faceted approach to validate not only direct transcriptional targets of SrbA, but also the putative significance of these targets during an invasive pulmonary infection. In addition to identifying a role for <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> SrbA in direct transcriptional regulation of novel genes involved in the fungal hypoxia response, we identified and functionally characterized a second SREBP family member, designated SrbB, which is a direct transcriptional target of SrbA in hypoxia. Together, SrbA and SrbB regulate and co-regulate genes critical for fungal metabolism, virulence, and responses to antifungal drugs. These results place SrbA and SrbB as central transcriptional regulators of fungal metabolic responses required for <italic>in vivo</italic> fungal growth and host damage. Consequently, further characterization of the pathways and networks regulated by SrbA-SrbB is expected to promote a novel research direction aimed at inhibiting the function of this <italic>in vivo</italic> associated fungal genetic network to improve IPA prognosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ChIP-seq Analysis Identifies a Core Set of Novel SrbA Target Genes in Response to Hypoxia</title><p>The workflow for this study was informed by previous research that assessed the significance of SrbA in hypoxia growth and fungal pathogenesis <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Willger2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and subsequent studies looking at transcriptional changes associated with the <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> response to hypoxia <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Blatzer1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Barker1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Losada1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.

The SrbA DNA binding motif was identified as an 11-bp binding region predominated by ATCA in positions 1&#x02013;4, a cytosine in position 7, and an adenine in position 9. Other positions were more variable, with a predominance of cytosine residues. This DNA motif (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032; (A/G)TCA(T/C/G)(C/G)CCAC(T/C)-3&#x02032;</named-content>) is similar to a previously identified SrbA DNA binding motif that was discovered using bioinformatic tools, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-ATC(G/A)(T/G)(A/G)(C/T)(G/C)AT-3&#x02032;</named-content><xref rid="ppat.1004487-Linde1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.

Additionally in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, a motif was defined using MEME to be (A/G)(C/T)C(A/G/T)NN(C/T)(C/T/G)A(C/T), which contains similar conserved residues as our sequence <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Todd1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Recently, the bHLH transcription factor Hms1 in <italic>C. albicans</italic> was found to bind the consensus sequence <named-content content-type="gene">ATCACCCCAC</named-content>, which is strikingly similar to the identified motif for SrbA <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Perez1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.

Overall, approximately 35% of the SrbA target genes are not currently annotated. Consistent with our previous microarray-based transcriptome analysis, and known functions of yeast and mammalian SREBPs, SrbA is a direct regulator of genes involved in lipid, fatty acid and isoprenoid biosynthesis, which includes ergosterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004487.s007">Table S3</xref>). In addition, <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> SrbA target genes were associated with heme and oxygen binding and nitrate metabolic processes. Taken together, annotated SrbA direct target genes are associated with biological processes impacted by both oxygen and iron limitation that are critical for fungal virulence. These results thus indicate that SrbA is a major transcriptional regulator of fungal metabolism (bioenergetics) in response to hypoxia.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>RNA-seq and Transcript Analysis of &#x00394;<italic>srbA</italic> in Hypoxia Confirms SrbA Target Genes and Associated Biological Functions</title><p>To further define SrbA target genes and confirm SrbA regulation of genes with associated SrbA DNA binding events in their promoter regions, RNA-seq analysis of the hypoxia transcriptome of &#x00394;<italic>srbA</italic> was conducted pooling total RNA samples from independent biological cultures in triplicate.

Perhaps of interest, these 48 genes were enriched for functions involving post-translational modification of amino acids. Notably, genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis are generally unaffected at this time point in the absence of SrbA. However, at 30 minutes post-hypoxia exposure, loss of SrbA resulted in transcript level increases for 383 genes compared to wild type. Interestingly, these genes were enriched for degradation of the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine.

Importantly, the majority of SrbA direct target genes identified in our ChIP-seq analysis fall into this group of genes with reduced mRNA levels strongly suggesting that SrbA directly positively regulates their mRNA abundance in response to hypoxia. Conversely, 467 genes had a 4-fold or greater increase in transcript levels in the absence of SrbA compared to wild type. These genes were enriched in part for transcription factor activity, and as no enrichment of the SRE motif could be found in this dataset (P-value - 0.96 Fisher Exact test), we interpret the increase in transcript levels of these genes as indirect responses to the loss of SrbA activity in the cell, rather than SrbA acting as a transcriptional repressor of these genes. Alternatively, SrbA may positively regulate an unidentified transcriptional repressor(s). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that SrbA is a direct positive transcriptional regulator of genes required for adaptation to hypoxia.

Given the conservation of SrbA with mammalian SREBPs, uncovering the fungal specific functions of SrbA is important in order to yield potential mechanisms that can be targeted for therapeutic development. Support for this rationale comes from several elegant studies showing that targets of conserved transcription factors are often not shared between distantly related organisms and even closely related species <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Borneman1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004487-Tuch1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>.

Ninety-seven genes whose promoters were strongly bound by SrbA were identified in the ChIP-seq analysis. This number appears low considering the large number of genes differentially expressed in the absence of SrbA as detected here via RNA-seq and previously with microarray analysis <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Blatzer1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. However, a low overlap between transcript levels of genes affected by transcription factor loss and target genes identified in ChIP experiments appears to be the norm rather than the exception <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Hughes4" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Consequently, our results suggest that we may have herein underestimated our direct SrbA targets or, more likely, there is an extensive network of genes involved with SrbA that are indirectly regulated though other transcription factors, small molecules, and proteins. The identification of ergosterol biosynthesis genes as SrbA direct targets and the sequence conservation of the ChIP identified SRE DNA binding motif strongly support the robustness of our analyses.</p><p>A major novel finding from our study of SrbA target genes was the identification of SrbB and its genetic relationship with SrbA. Based on sequence similarity, Bien and Espenshade hypothesized that SrbB was an SREBP-like transcription factor <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Bien1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. While our amino acid sequence analysis of SrbB did not reveal the presence of transmembrane domains that are found in the prototypical SREBPs, SrbB contains the hallmark tyrosine residue in the bHLH domain characteristic of SREBP family members. Moreover, a <italic>srbB::GFP</italic> fusion protein was observed to localize solely to the nucleus on preliminary analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004487.s003">Figure S3</xref>) further suggesting that SrbB is not membrane bound like SrbA and other SREBP family members (though constitutive cleavage cannot currently be ruled out). Transcript levels of <italic>srbB</italic> were strongly induced in response to hypoxia, earlier and to a greater magnitude than <italic>srbA</italic>. Thus, transcriptional regulation of <italic>srbB</italic> mRNA levels appears to play a major role in regulation of its function. In hypoxia, SrbA was found to bind to the promoter region of <italic>srbB</italic> at three locations. Loss of SrbA, however, did not completely eliminate <italic>srbB</italic> transcript levels in hypoxia suggesting the presence of additional <italic>srbB</italic> transcriptional regulators that remain to be defined.</p><p>Consistent with increased transcript <italic>in vitro</italic> in response to hypoxia and strong induction of transcript levels <italic>in vivo</italic> in a murine model of IPA, loss of SrbB markedly attenuated hypoxia growth and virulence of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. Unlike loss of SrbA, loss of SrbB had a minor effect on susceptibility to triazole antifungal drugs. The lack of an azole drug phenotype is consistent with the observation that SrbB does not appear to regulate <italic>cyp51A/erg11A</italic> mRNA levels, at least under the conditions tested here. However, full expression of the ergosterol biosynthesis genes <italic>erg1</italic> and <italic>erg25A</italic> does require the presence of SrbB. In a similar manner, a major finding with regard to SrbB function is its clear importance for regulation of heme biosynthesis in normoxia and hypoxia.

First, data suggest that SrbA and SrbB have both mutually exclusive and co-regulated target genes in their regulons, and that they are involved in reciprocally regulating transcript levels. The increase in <italic>srbA</italic> transcript levels in the absence of <italic>srbB</italic> suggests that at some level SrbB could act as a transcriptional repressor. It is unclear if the effect on <italic>srbA</italic> transcript levels is direct and experiments to uncover direct SrbB target genes are ongoing in our laboratory. Analysis of SrbB DNA binding utilizing a SrbB:GFP fusion protein strongly suggests that SrbB can bind the SRE motif found in the <italic>srbA</italic> promoter region. It is likely, however, that the increase in transcript levels of several SrbA target genes in &#x00394;<italic>srbB</italic> is driven by increases in SrbA levels and activity. In this model, besides its role as a transcriptional activator of genes important for the hypoxia response, SrbB also functions in a negative feedback loop to modulate SrbA activity. Accordingly, persistence of high SrbA levels would at some point become detrimental to cellular homeostasis perhaps through increases in an SrbA dependent molecule(s) that become toxic to the cell. We note that genes associated with export of toxic molecules were enriched in the upregulated gene set in &#x00394;<italic>srbB</italic>.</p><fig id="ppat-1004487-g012" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1004487.g012</object-id><label>Figure 12</label><caption><title>Working models for transcriptional regulation of the hypoxia response by SrbA and SrbB in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>.</title><p><italic>A. fumigatus</italic> SREBPs, SrbA and SrbB have dependent and independent functions in regulation of hypoxic genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, heme biosynthesis, and nitrate assimilation. In response to hypoxia, <italic>srbB</italic> transcription is induced earlier than <italic>srbA</italic> (15 minutes in hypoxia) possibly by an unknown factor (marked as &#x02018;X&#x02019;). SrbA regulates <italic>srbB</italic> and its own transcript abundance. Similarly, SrbB regulates <italic>srbA</italic> and its own transcript abundance. qRT-PCR and ChIP-qPCR data presented in this study show that abundance of <italic>erg1</italic>, <italic>erg25A</italic>, <italic>hem13</italic>, <italic>niiA</italic>, and <italic>alcC</italic> is regulated by both SrbA and SrbB. In contrast, abundance of <italic>erg11A</italic>, <italic>erg3B</italic>, <italic>erg5</italic>, and <italic>niaD</italic> is dependent on SrbA.

It may be possible that genes co-regulated by SrbA and SrbB in response to hypoxia are regulated through heterodimer formation, while genes exclusive to the respective transcription factor are regulated in part by homo-dimer formation. Moreover, in mammals, SREBP homo-and heterodimers have different levels of transcriptional activity <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Datta1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. Thus, it is plausible that in &#x00394;<italic>srbB</italic>, SrbA homodimers are more potent activators of SrbA target genes such as <italic>srbA</italic> itself than an SrbA-SrbB heterodimer that is present in the wild type. It is well established that the ability of bHLH proteins to form multiple dimer combination based on availability of binding partners and environmental conditions is a critical and elegant form of gene regulation <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. Along these lines, genetic null mutants of fungal SREBPs alter the stoichiometric ratios of potential binding partners, which is further complicated by the fact that SrbA and SrbB are involved in regulating the other's expression. We also note that a third SREBP family member, SrbC, exists in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> and awaits further investigation. Whether a preferred dimer form exists for regulation of specific SREBP regulated genes has not been extensively studied. Together, our data suggest that transcriptional activity of SrbA homodimer is efficient to activate <italic>erg3B</italic>, <italic>erg5</italic>, <italic>erg11A</italic>, and <italic>niaD</italic>, and an SrbA homodimer might be a preferred or dominant dimerization form for regulation of these genes over SrbA-SrbB heterodimers. In contrast, <italic>erg1</italic>, <italic>erg25A</italic>, <italic>niiA</italic>, <italic>alcC</italic>, and <italic>hem13</italic> might be favorably regulated by SrbA-SrbB heterodimers rather than SrbA- or SrbB- homodimers. Another possibility is that the promoter of <italic>erg1</italic>, <italic>erg25A</italic>, <italic>niiA</italic>, <italic>alcC</italic>, and <italic>hem13</italic> might contain an SrbB-specific binding site(s) in addition to the identified SrbA SRE motif. Consequently, both SrbA and SrbB could simultaneously regulate these genes by binding at the separate promoter sites.</p><p>However, the utilization of genetic null mutants and over-expression strains in null mutant backgrounds has allowed us to pinpoint the contribution of SrbA and SrbB to expression of specific target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004487-g008">Figure 8</xref>). These target genes yield new additional insights into how <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> adapts and grows in the mammalian lung environment. Of particular interest is the strong reduction in &#x00394;<italic>srbB</italic> growth in the murine model that was similar to the reduction in growth observed in mice inoculated with &#x00394;<italic>srbA</italic>. The difference in murine survival between mice inoculated with the two strains could be due to increases in host damage caused by &#x00394;<italic>srbB</italic>. For example, as SrbB is the major regulator of the ethanol fermentation alcohol dehydrogenase AlcC, one would predict an increase in inflammation in &#x00394;<italic>srbB</italic> inoculated mice due to the immune suppressive effects of ethanol previously reported in our murine model <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Grahl1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Alternatively or in conjunction with increased immunopathogenesis, it may be plausible that host heme is utilized by &#x00394;<italic>srbB</italic> to promote growth and host death later in infection when host damage is more severe and free heme may be available as addition of hemin to &#x00394;<italic>srbB</italic> partially restored <italic>in vitro</italic> hypoxia growth. In addition, the further decrease in fungal burden observed in &#x00394;<italic>srbA</italic>&#x00394;<italic>srbB</italic> strain inoculated strongly suggests that the combination of decreased iron uptake and ergosterol biosynthesis, regulated by SrbA, and defects in carbon metabolism and heme biosynthesis, regulated by primarily by SrbB, consequently severely inhibit <italic>in vivo</italic> fungal growth. As all of these biological processes related to fungal metabolism/bioenergetics are impacted by oxygen availability, manipulation of <italic>in vivo</italic> oxygen levels may be a viable therapeutic strategy to reduce <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> growth <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In conclusion, while it is well established that fungal SREBPs are critical regulators of ergosterol biosynthesis and iron homeostasis, our analyses of SrbA and SrbB expand the known functions of these fungal virulence and antifungal drug-associated transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004487-g012">Figure 12</xref>). The major enrichment of genes involved in oxidoreductase activity, carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism, and heme biosynthesis in the regulons of SrbA and SrbB presents an exciting and important area for further investigation into how these processes affect hypoxia adaptation, fungal virulence, and responses to antifungal drugs. From the big picture of the SrbA-SrbB regulons, we propose that the SrbA-SrbB genetic network allows <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> to &#x0201c;reprogram&#x0201d; its bioenergetics to allow invasive growth to cause disease in the mammalian lung in the face of oxygen and iron limitation. Consequently, these fungal SREBPs are much more than regulators of sterol biosynthesis, rather they are global regulators of fungal bioenergetics potential/metabolism; also an emerging theme with mammalian SREBPs <xref rid="ppat.1004487-Shao1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>.
