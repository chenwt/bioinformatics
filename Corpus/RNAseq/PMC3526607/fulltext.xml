However, the ability of this approach to identify copy number alterations in primary tumor samples has not been fully addressed. Here we show that somatic copy number alterations can be reliably estimated using exome sequencing data through a strategy that we have termed <italic>exome2cnv</italic>. Using data from 86 paired normal and primary tumor samples, we identified losses and gains of complete chromosomes or large genomic regions, as well as smaller regions affecting a minimum of one gene. Comparison with high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays revealed a high sensitivity and a low number of false positives in the copy number estimation between both approaches. We explore the main factors affecting sensitivity and false positives with real data, and provide a side by side comparison with CGH arrays. Together, these results underscore the utility of exome sequencing to study cancer samples by allowing not only the identification of substitutions and indels, but also the accurate estimation of copy number alterations.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci&#x000f3;n-Spain, Fundaci&#x000f3;n &#x0201c;M.

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of several individuals has been already performed shedding new light on human variation, genome complexity and molecular mechanisms of certain hereditary diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Lupski1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Roach1">[2]</xref>. In addition, sequencing of cancer genomes has revealed a very complex landscape of somatic mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Ley1">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Pleasance2">[5]</xref> and has led to the identification of driver genes responsible for tumor initiation and growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Mardis1">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Chapman1">[9]</xref>. Despite the utility of WGS to understand human disease, this global approach is still economically unaffordable for most laboratories and does not allow the analysis of hundreds or even thousands of samples in a timely manner. In this regard, the development of technologies for the capture of specific regions of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Gnirke1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Hodges1">[11]</xref>, such as all coding exons or exome, followed by NGS, has proven very useful for the rapid and economic identification of mutations in different human hereditary diseases as well as in cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Gilissen1">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Wang1">[19]</xref>. Due to the high coverage obtained using exome sequencing, this technique constitutes an interesting approach for the identification of point mutations and small indels with high accuracy in both normal and tumor samples.</p><p>Point mutations and indels constitute the most frequent alterations present in a tumor genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Pleasance1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Pleasance2">[5]</xref>, and the ability to identify them using exome sequencing represents an important achievement in cancer genomics. However, cancer cells also present other type of mutations, including translocations, inversions or changes in copy number, which constitute important events for tumor development. For instance, copy number alterations (CNAs) due to either deletion or amplification of specific regions frequently lead to deletion of tumor suppressor genes or to the amplification of oncogenes, representing driver events during tumor development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Beroukhim1">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Stratton1">[22]</xref>. In addition, some hereditary diseases are caused not by point mutations but by CNAs resulting in the deletion or amplification of specific genes, exons or regulatory sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Merla1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Mefford1">[24]</xref>. In fact, a recent study using WGS has identified a novel CNA in <italic>TP53</italic> causing Li-Fraumeni syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Link1">[25]</xref>, reinforcing the importance of CNAs in human disease. A currently assumed limitation of exome sequencing is its inability to identify this type of structural variants, and the analysis of exome data is usually complemented with other technologies, such as comparative genomic hybridization arrays (aCGH) or high throughput sequencing at low coverage in order to identify CNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Robbins1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Campbell1">[27]</xref>, resulting in the requirement of additional sample material as well as increases in costs per sample. The importance of CNAs in human disease implies that the study of human pathologies by exome sequencing data must be complemented by other approaches in order to cover this type of variation.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that by using depth of coverage of individual exons, it is possible to identify copy number alterations in tumor and matched normal tissue exomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Sathirapongsasuti1">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Lonigro1">[32]</xref>. However, these methods can result in the identification of false positive CNAs due to the inherent variability of the capturing method and/or sequencing efficiency of certain regions. Therefore, to analyze the utility of this technique for cancer genomics and to define the limits of this type of analysis it is necessary to analyze exome sequencing data obtained from different individuals and processed at different times. Furthermore, a side by side comparison between exome and aCGH data is necessary to determine the sensitivity and specificity using primary tumors. In this work, we demonstrate that exome data can be used to detect tumor-specific CNAs with high accuracy and sensitivity by analyzing 86 paired normal and primary tumor samples, and show a high concordance with aCGH data. This work provides the opportunity to re-analyze existing datasets to extract this additional layer of information of great importance for human disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Samples</title><p>Sequencing and genotyping data for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients was obtained from the CLL-ICGC Consortium and are deposited at the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/</ext-link>), which is hosted at the EBI, under accession number EGAS00000000092.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Exome capture, sequencing and mapping</title><p>Three &#x000b5;g of genomic DNA were fragmented to 150&#x02013;200 bp and hybridized using a SureSelect Human All Exon 50 Mb Kit (Agilent) together with the Paired-End Sample Preparation Kit from Illumina following manufacturers' protocols.

Therefore, if there is a difference in copy number between two samples, the number of reads derived from that particular region should be different for both samples. However, the introduction of amplification steps during sample preparation and the limited number of bait probes which are added to the capture reaction could result in the saturation of the capturing probes, thereby hampering the identification of CNAs. In addition, the number of reads produced by different probes or in different experiments is highly variable due to several factors: i) the efficiency of the capturing procedure for a specific probe; ii) the sequencing efficiency for that particular region; iii) the total number of reads sequenced; and iv) the size of the target region. The first two factors are inherent to the technologies used for capturing and sequencing. However, they should not affect the comparison among samples, as probes with poor capturing efficiency or regions difficult to sequence should be equal for all samples processed using the same capturing protocol and sequencing technology. Regarding the last two factors, they can be easily normalized using a similar solution to that used for RNAseq experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Mortazavi1">[36]</xref>. Thus, for any given probe the number of reads mapped can be expressed as RPKMs (Reads mapped Per Kilobase of probe and per Million of reads mapped).</p><p>Taking into account these considerations, and in order to determine whether exome sequencing data could be used to identify copy number changes between different samples, we first checked whether read coverage in the X chromosome was different between normal samples derived from males (one copy) and females (two copies). We counted all sequence reads mapped in the target regions &#x000b1;50 bp with a mapping quality of more than 30. Following this scheme, we compared the average RPKMs for 55 males and 31 females. We found that the coverage (RPKMs) in the X chromosome (excluding the pseudoautosomal regions) was 12.11&#x000b1;0.19 for males and 23.4&#x000b1;0.57 for females, very close to the 1&#x02236;2 ratio expected. In contrast, the coverage in autosomes was almost identical between both groups (20.80&#x000b1;0.12 <italic>vs.</italic> 20.39&#x000b1;0.11).

We selected a total of 6,588 exons that were located in the X chromosome (excluding the pseudoautosomal regions) and were efficiently captured by this technology, as they had at least a minimum of two RPKMs in females. For each individual exon, we calculated the average RPKMs obtained in females, and used this value as the reference RPKMs for that particular exon in individuals with two copies of the X chromosome. Then, for each of the 566,568 exons analyzed in 86 individuals we calculated the ratio of RPKMs for each individual exon <italic>versus</italic> the reference value calculated before. There was a marked difference in this ratio between males and females for most individual exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051422-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In fact, 94% of exons from males had RPKM ratios which were at less than &#x02212;1.5 SDs from the female average for that particular exon, while only 6% of exons from females were at less than &#x02212;1.5 SDs. The sensitivity to detect this change in copy number increased as a larger number of consecutive exons were used, while the percentage of false positives decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051422-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

Thus, using the exome data we identified 387 CNAs out of the 549 detected by aCGH (70%). However, as previously shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051422-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and due to the variability of exon capture, it would be necessary to combine at least six exons to make a reliable CNA call. Using this cutoff for aCGH regions, only 44 out of the 162 aCGH regions not detected by <italic>exome2cnv</italic> fulfilled this criterion, suggesting that the <italic>exome2cnv</italic> sensitivity to detect tumor-specific CNAs is more than 89%. In agreement with these results, analysis of these 86 tumor-normal pairs with a previously described method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Sathirapongsasuti1">[28]</xref> resulted in the identification of 22,423 potential CNAs, with more than 18,000 of them corresponding to single-exon CNAs which were not supported by aCGH data. These calls likely constitute false positives due to differences in the capturing efficiency or to a batch effect. In fact, the introduction of a minimum number of six consecutive exons to make a call still resulted in more than 80% of calls not being supported by aCGH data. In this regard, a detailed examination of these calls revealed than in most cases they were supported by consecutive exons showing either small RPKMs, high GC content and high variability between different samples, suggesting poor reproducibility in the capture efficiency. Calls reporting a putative gain, an infrequent event in CLL with the exception of chromosome 12 trisomy, were particularly sensitive to this variability issue, with more than 95% of the calls not being supported by aCGH data. Together, these results reinforce the importance of establishing specific parameters affecting the performance of exome sequencing-based CNA estimation, such as minimum number of exons, and to take into account the RPKM variance across normal samples, which are used by the <italic>exome2cnv</italic> method described herein.</p><p>It is interesting to notice that as CLL cells derive from B-lymphocytes, which had undergone rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes during B-cell maturation, we were able to detect in almost all analyzed cases focal homozygous or heterozygous deletions in chromosomes 2p11, 14q32.33 and 22q11.22, where immunoglobulin genes are located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051422-g003">Figure 3</xref>). However, when these regions were omitted from the analysis, we obtained the same sensitivity, indicating that <italic>exome2cnv</italic> has enough sensitivity to detect most oncogenic CNAs. Furthermore, when we compared the number of exons included in CNAs affecting subchromosomal regions between the <italic>exome2cnv</italic> approach and aCGH data, we obtained a high correlation between both approaches (r<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.99) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051422.s003">Figure S1</xref>), suggesting that CNA boundaries detected by both methods are highly similar in terms of exons involved in the copy number change.</p><p>On the other hand, we found that more than 86% of the CNAs detected by <italic>exome2cnv</italic> overlapped with CNAs detected by aCGH (819/947). Although it is possible that some of the 128 regions detected specifically by the <italic>exome2cnv</italic> approach might constitute false positives, manual inspection of the aCGH data for these regions revealed that at least 16 of them could be considered CNAs present in a subpopulation of CLL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051422-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051422.s002">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051422.s004">Figure S2</xref>). Furthermore, another 37 of them were located in <italic>loci</italic> containing immunoglobulin genes and putatively representing real CNAs. Together, these data show that using the minimum threshold of six exons empirically determined before, more than 92% of identified regions might constitute <italic>bona fide</italic> somatic CNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Exome sequencing, using target capture strategies followed by NGS, is becoming a routine technique for the study of somatic mutations in tumor samples as well as for the identification of the genetic alterations responsible for numerous hereditary diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Chapman1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Ng2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Varela1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Puente2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Bell1">[40]</xref>. Due to the target capture approach, exome sequencing analysis has limitations to uncover the different types of variations present in a cancer genome, and its use is mostly limited to the study of substitutions and small indels. The results presented herein demonstrate that exome sequencing data can be also used to estimate copy number alterations with high accuracy, allowing the identification of somatic CNAs in tumor/normal samples from cancer patients.</p><p>The ability to detect CNAs using exome sequencing data has been recently proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Sathirapongsasuti1">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Lonigro1">[32]</xref>. However, the real utility of this approach for the study of cancer exomes requires the analysis of a larger number of primary tumors. In this study, we have used a liquid capture technique and the target regions which were initially designed by the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Hudson1">[41]</xref> to analyze CNAs in a total of 86 primary CLL cases using exome sequencing data. We performed a side by side comparison with traditional CGH technologies in order to determine the sensitivity of this novel approach. The results obtained in this initial approach demonstrate that <italic>exome2cnv</italic> has the potential to identify most CNAs affecting exon-containing regions. Based on our data, the <italic>exome2cnv</italic> approach would allow the identification of either long CNAs containing hundreds of genes, or small regions affecting up to a single gene or a single exon. In addition, we have determined the proportion of false positives of this approach, as most researchers would like to know how many regions identified by <italic>exome2cnv</italic> are <italic>bona fide</italic> CNAs, as well as the parameters affecting the number of false positives. We have shown that similar to other methods, there is a balance between sensitivity and false discovery rate, and by increasing the number of exons to call a CNA it is possible to reduce the number of false positives. Our procedure differs from other previously described methods in two basic aspects. First, we empirically determine a minimum number of exons to make a CNA call and only exons with a minimum coverage in the normal sample are used in the analysis. All described methods for the identification of somatic CNAs from exome-sequencing data, including the one described here, are able to detect CNAs affecting a single exon. However, due to the different efficiency in capturing of specific probes or sequencing of certain genomic regions, side by side comparison of two samples processed independently might lead to the erroneous classification of numerous exons as CNAs. In fact, a direct comparison of exon coverage using previously reported methods results in the identification of more than 200 single-exon CNAs per case not supported by aCGH data, suggesting that they constitute false positives. In our method this effect can be substantially reduced by using only exons with a good capture efficiency, defined here as more than 2 RPKMs, and by requiring at least a minimum number of consecutive exons to make a call, established here as 6 or more consecutive exons. The second difference with previously reported methods is the use of coverage data from normal samples. In fact, a common problem during the analysis of samples captured or sequenced at different times or in different centers is the inter-sample variability in capture efficiency in specific regions/probes. Although this variability has a minor effect in the identification of point-mutations and/or indels, it represents a common problem for the identification of CNAs, resulting in the identification of many false positives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Sathirapongsasuti1">[28]</xref>. In order to reduce the false discovery rate of this method, we have introduced a step that takes into account not only the different coverage between tumor and normal samples, but also the coverage distribution along all non-tumor samples available. Only those regions supported by exons whose coverage differ more than 1.5 SDs from the average coverage of those exons in non-tumor samples are considered as CNAs. Using this approach, we could confirm that more than 92% of the CNA regions identified using <italic>exome2cnv</italic> were also detected using CGH arrays, strongly supporting the utility of this method for the analysis of CNA in cancer exomes. Together, these filtering steps are able to reduce the number of false positives CNA regions identified by <italic>exome2cnv</italic>, while maintaining a sensibility of more than 89% to detect CNAs involving at least six exons. Although a lower number of exons could be used, this would likely increase the number of false positives. This approach can benefit the identification of somatic CNAs in tumor/normal samples from cancer patients, as they usually involve amplification or deletion of chromosomal regions containing several genes, facilitating their detection by <italic>exome2cnv</italic> approach. In fact, the sensibility to detect CNAs involving whole chromosomes or chromosome arms is almost 100%.</p><p>Despite the overall performance of the <italic>exome2cnv</italic> approach for the identification of tumor-specific CNAs, an inherent limitation of this approach when compared to aCGH data is the accurate determination of the CNA boundaries. Thus, the distribution of aCGH probes in high resolution arrays allows a precise estimation of CNA boundaries within kilobase resolution. However, the uneven distribution of exons throughout the genome results in less accurate boundaries in terms of genomic distances, but in a highly accurate determination of genes and exons involved in the copy number alteration. In this regard, an alternative approach that might be considered by the manufacturers of target-capture reagents is the introduction of additional probes in exon-poor regions. These extra probes would not help in the identification of substitutions in coding regions, but would improve the estimation of CNA length and boundaries.</p><p>Another aspect to take into consideration when using primary tumors is the presence of normal cell contamination in the tumor sample. Although the tumor samples used in this study had more than 95% tumor cell content, some of the CNAs detected by our method appeared to be present in a subpopulation of tumor cells. These data indicates that <italic>exome2cnv</italic> is suitable for the detection of CNAs in complex populations, as those present in most solid tumors, in which stromal cell contamination is usually present. Moreover, it is important to point out that copy number changes in the tumor also complicate the identification of somatic mutations, and a precise estimation of tumor copy number is necessary in order to adjust mutation calling algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0051422-Meyerson1">[42]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, we show that copy number changes can be accurately determined using exome sequencing, extending the application of this widely used technique for the study of human disease, and allowing the identification of variations outside of target regions used for capture. This application is of particular interest to the field of cancer genomics, as CNAs represent an important mechanism of mutation in most cancer types. The analysis of a large number of primary tumor exomes and aCGH data has allowed the first determination of the sensitivity and false discovery rate of this approach. Together, the procedure outlined here can be used to rapidly analyze existing datasets without additional experimental work, what will facilitate the identification of novel CNAs implicated in cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0051422.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Comparison of somatic CNAs detected by aCGH vs. exome2cnv to determine sensitivity.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0051422.s001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0051422.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>Comparison of somatic CNAs detected by exome2cnv vs. aCGH to determine false discovery rate.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0051422.s002.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0051422.s003"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of the number of exons involved in CNAs detected by exome2cnv and aCGH.</bold></p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0051422.s003.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0051422.s004"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p><bold>aCGH data showing two cases (A and B) with a deletion affecting the short arm of chromosome 18 which was detected by exome2cnv but not by aCGH because it is present in a subpopulation of tumor cells.</bold> For comparison, a case (C) with a deletion affecting all tumor cells and detected by both methods is shown.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0051422.s004.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. E.
