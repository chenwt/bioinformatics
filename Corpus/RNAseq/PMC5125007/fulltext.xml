Bacterial genomes and proteins are detected in brains from humans, nonhuman primates, rodents and other species in the absence of neurological disease. We investigated the composition and abundance of microbiota in frozen and fixed autopsied brain samples from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and age- and sex-matched nonMS patients as controls, using neuropathological, molecular and bioinformatics tools. 16s rRNA sequencing revealed Proteobacteria to be the dominant phylum with restricted diversity in cerebral white matter (WM) from MS compared to nonMS patients. Both clinical groups displayed 1,200&#x02013;1,400 bacterial genomes/cm<sup>3</sup> and low bacterial rRNA:rDNA ratios in WM. RNAseq analyses showed a predominance of Proteobacteria in progressive MS patients&#x02019; WM, associated with increased inflammatory gene expression, relative to a broader range of bacterial phyla in relapsing-remitting MS patients&#x02019; WM. Although bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and RNA polymerase beta subunit immunoreactivities were observed in all patients, PGN immunodetection was correlated with demyelination and neuroinflammation in MS brains. Principal component analysis revealed that demyelination, PGN and inflammatory gene expression accounted for 86% of the observed variance. Thus, inflammatory demyelination is linked to an organ-specific dysbiosis in MS that could contribute to underlying disease mechanisms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Resident microorganisms in different tissues of humans and other species are increasingly appreciated as important determinants of health and disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.

Quantitation of bacterial genomic (<italic>GroEL</italic>) DNA ranged from 1,200&#x02013;1400&#x02009;genomes per cm<sup>3</sup> (tissue) based on single gene copy detection per bacterium in both MS and nonMS white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>).

Phylogenetic assessment of bacterial sequences encoding the ribosomal 16s rRNA V3&#x02013;V5 domain cloned from a subset of samples was performed, which revealed alignment of brain-derived bacterial sequences from MS (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) and nonMS (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) patients with diverse bacterial species&#x02019; sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Proteobacteria represented the most abundant phylum in both clinical groups although more cloned bacterial sequences were obtained from MS samples. These findings highlighted the preponderance of bacterial sequences resembling Proteobacterial species in brains with reduced bacterial genomic molecular diversity in MS patients&#x02019; white matter.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>RNAseq analyses</title><p>Massively parallel (deep) sequencing (RNAseq) of total RNA permitted analysis of all RNA sequences in MS (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) and nonMS (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) white matter samples, revealing that bacterial RNA (ribosomal and non-ribosomal) sequences were detected in all nonMS and MS brain specimens, including MS patients with relapsing-remitting disease (receiving disease modifying therapy) (RR-MS, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) and progressive (untreated) MS (P-MS; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Greater than 60% of bacterial sequences were identified as unambiguously complementary to Proteobacteria sequences. While Actinobacteria was the second most abundant phylum in all cases, there was an enrichment of this phylum in RR-MS (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) relative to nonMS white matter with a marked reduction of Actinobacteria sequence proportions in P-MS brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Sequences matching bacteriophages with Proteobacteria hosts predominated in both clinical groups but were overrepresented in nonMS samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The apparent contraction of bacterial molecular diversity within P-MS brains was associated with increased expression of immune genes in P-MS white matter (e.g., <italic>CD3&#x003b5;, HLA-DRA, IL-10, CD11c</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>).

Conversely, expression of genes related to nervous system regulation, gene silencing, and cell proliferation were negatively correlated with Proteobacteria RNA tag abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>). These observations highlighted the predominance of Protobacteria-encoded RNA sequences in brains from MS and nonMS patients but also displayed variation in bacterial molecular diversity in relation to host immune responses.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Histopathology, immunohistochemistry and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization</title><p>As MS is a heterogenous disease in terms of clinical features as well as site and type of lesions, we used premortem MRIs to guide the selection of tissue samples when possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A,B</xref>) for neuropathological studies. From brains of MS (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) and nonMS (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) patients, serial brain sections were investigated based on the presence of lesions on MRI that showed gadolinium-enhancement (T1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A1</xref>) and/or evident on T2 images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A2</xref>). Strong LFB staining, indicative of intact myelin, was evident in nonMS white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B1</xref>) but was reduced in demyelinating MS lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B2</xref>). CD3&#x003b5;-immunolabeled T cells were occasionally detected in nonMS tissue sections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a1</xref>) but CD3&#x003b5;-immunopositive cells were evident in MS lesions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a2</xref>). CD68-immunopositive brain macrophages were minimally detected in nonMS white matter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b1</xref>) but were abundant in demyelinating MS lesions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b2</xref>). Bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) immunostaining was particulate, detected in sections from nonMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c1</xref>) and MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c2</xref>) brains but appeared to be more concentrated in MS lesions. This was in contrast to the lack of immunostaining apparent with the isotype control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). PGN immunodetection was co-localized with immunoreactivity to the astrocytic protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP in both MS and nonMS cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c1</xref> inset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b1,b2</xref>) and the microglial protein, Iba-1 (inset <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig 3a1,a2</xref>, respectively) with approximately 50% of each cell type associated with PGN immunopositive structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c,d</xref>). Bacterial RNA polymerase beta subunit immunoreactivity was also evident in both nonMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d1</xref>) and MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d2</xref>) brains together with <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization detection of bacterial 16s rDNA (insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d1</xref>). To verify these findings, neuropathological features were scored by a neuropathologist (JQL), unaware of the slide identity, in the same brain sections from MS and nonMS which showed significantly increased CD3&#x003b5; and CD68 immunodetection with reduced LFB staining in MS sections compared to nonMS brains. Concurrent semi-quantitative scoring of PGN immunoreactivity within each entire tissue section did not differ between clinical groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). These findings implied that in nonMS and MS brain tissues, bacterial genomes and proteins were detectable, recapitulating and extending earlier studies of bacterial detection in human brains with and without neurological disease. Despite obvious neuropathological differences, total PGN abundance per brain section was similar in MS and nonMS brains suggesting that overall bacterial burden did not distinguish MS from nonMS patients.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Quantification of demyelination PGN load and gene expression in tissue sections</title><p>The above findings prompted examination of the interactions between demyelination, host innate immune responses and PGN presence. Application of a second anti-PGN monoclonal antibody showed PGN immunolabelling in nonMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>) and MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>) brain sections with increased PGN immunoreactivity that was most evident in areas of reduced LFB staining in MS patients. Co-quantitation of myelination and bacterial quantity within each section revealed LFB staining was not correlated with the density of PGN immunolabelling in nonMS brain sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>) (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.09). In contrast PGN abundance was correlated with decreased LFB staining intensity within MS lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>) (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.319). Because of the inverse correlation between LFB intensity and PGN immunolabelling, we examined host gene expression in adjacent serial tissue sections by Nanostring transcript array in sections from each tissue block which disclosed induction of immune genes, <italic>NFKB1, RIPK1</italic> and <italic>IL-12A,</italic> in MS brains and showed the highest correlations with PGN expression. Pathway analyses using these transcript array findings in association with PGN expression revealed an integrated network (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis score&#x02009;=&#x02009;17) implicating other genes associated with MS pathogenesis (e.g., MHC Class II, ERK1/2, and immunoglobulin) as molecular hubs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) including linked PGN and transcript (<italic>NFKB1, RIPK1</italic> and <italic>IL-12A</italic>) expression as first (69% of variance) and second components (17% of variance) revealed clustering of nonMS white matter samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>) while MS samples were scattered, reflecting the heterogeneity of disease severity. These observations indicated that a key bacterial component (PGN) was concentrated within demyelinating MS lesions in association with innate immune gene activation.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The current study shows the presence of bacterial RNA and DNA sequences and proteins in human brain which are disrupted in conjunction with inflammatory demyelination in patients with MS. Proteobacteria represented the chief bacterial phylum detected in human brain with restricted molecular diversity in MS brains despite the increased density of bacterial glycoproteins within demyelinating lesions. Evidence for bacterial presence in human brains was verified by using several monoclonal antibodies that recognized specific bacterial proteins, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, PCR amplification and cloning of bacterial RNA and DNA sequences together with massively parallel sequencing of brain-derived RNA. The presence and type of bacteria in brain was associated with host immune gene expression, which were apparent using different methods. These findings indicated a strong interaction between bacterial presence and host responses involving NF&#x003ba;B-related signaling in demyelinating lesions, which is a pivotal pathway in neuroinflammation and MS pathogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p><p>As contamination of tissue specimens and experimental tools was a paramount concern in the present study, extensive precautions were implemented to mitigate this concern, given the relative low levels of bacterial burden observed in the present studies. Phylogenetic analyses of PCR-derived sequences displayed similarities to Propionibacterium, a common cutaneous and nasopharyngeal bacterium in a single MS patient which might reflect contamination during the autopsy process or alternatively <italic>in vivo</italic> transport from the nasopharynx via the cribriform plate, as reported for other bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. However, the correlations between peptidoglycan abundance and host neuroimmune responses, using both Nanostring and deep sequencing, argues against contamination, particularly the consistent preponderance of NF&#x003ba;B-associated transcriptional observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). Moreover, the presence of viruses in the brain inducing local immune responses was unlikely here because of the relative paucity of detectable viral genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Reduced molecular diversity among MS brain-derived 16s V3-V5 rRNA sequences as well as the increased density of PGN immunoreactivity associated with demyelination are also at odds with contamination as the sole explanation for the present observations. The present studies revealed the ratio of bacterium-encoded 16s rDNA to rRNA in matched brain samples to be ~1:2 in both white matter (and cortex, data not shown) with bacterial numbers of 1200&#x02013;1400&#x02009;genomes/cm<sup>3</sup> suggesting both bacterial burden and replication were low compared to active pathogenic infections in other tissues. The low bacterial rDNA:rRNA ratio and burden are not surprising given the sensitivity of the brain to bacterial molecules (e.g., endotoxin), which at high levels can lead to adverse effects on brain tissue. The reduced molecular diversity of bacterial RNA sequences in MS brains implies an overgrowth in select bacteria, perhaps Proteobacteria, as indicated by the current sequencing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) from progressive MS patients, which was diversified in relapsing-remitting MS patients receiving disease modifying therapies. These results recapitulate changes in microbial populations in other diseased organs and are reminiscent of a dysbiosis that can be resolved by increasing microbial diversity. The differential distribution of individual bacterial phyla consistently associated with clinical phenotype and immune activation, observed across multiple lots of reagents, collectively support the specificity of the current findings.</p><p>The detection of bacterial DNA and RNA sequences, proteins and cell wall components in human brains raises the question of how bacteria might enter the brain. The bacterial sequences detected in the present studies of human brain resemble those of environmental (soil-derived) bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, largely without human disease associations. Phagocytes including macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells can engulf live microbes or microbial compounds at different mucosal sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Polymicrobial species have been detected in human blood, particularly in leucocytes including neutrophils and macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, leukocytes enter the brain following activation in the lung<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, suggesting that lung epithelium also provides an interface for microbial translocation. Given that the present bacterial species&#x02019; sequences are similar to environmental bacteria, inhalation and phagocytosis with ensuing trafficking to the brain is a plausible route of CNS entry. The presence of bacteria or their components (e.g., PGN), even in a quiescent state and in low copy numbers in the brain, could exert effects on neurocognitive functions, inflammatory gene expression, and perhaps on neural cell (e.g., oligodendrocyte) survival. Potential consequences of resident bacteria in brain include altered myelin viability and repair as well as activation of host inflammatory genes with pathogenic or protective effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. These effects could be consequences of colonization by viable bacteria or the presence of bacterial PAMPs from non-viable bacteria. Our previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> in which we successfully transmitted human brain-derived bacteria to immunocompromised mice suggests that some of these organisms are viable as the persistence of residual RNA is not sufficient to explain the finding given the duration of those studies. Identifying the individual bacterial species and their impact on inflammatory demyelination might yield insights into MS prevention and treatment. Indeed, recent studies of minocycline treatment of MS (clinicaltrials.gov number NCT00666887) could also be interpreted within the context of the current study. Similarly the putative neurotoxic effects of antibiotics might be related to their actions on microbiota located in the brain (or gut) with potential adverse consequences for gut-brain interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Further delineation of the individual bacterial species in brain and other organs that contribute to neurological disease (or health) are warranted because they might offer new therapeutic approaches or targets for inflammatory degenerative neurological diseases.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The use of autopsied brain tissues with associated clinical data (age, sex, MS phenotype, EDSS, duration of disease) was approved by the University of Alberta Human Research Ethics Board (Biomedical, Protocol number 2291).
