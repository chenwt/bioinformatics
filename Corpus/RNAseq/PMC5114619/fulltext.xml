Among human pathogens, mycobacteria have evolved a genetically programmed mechanism of adapting to the stress of human infection by entering a quiescent state in which cell replication is halted or slowed in response to nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and other stresses encountered in the granulomas that characterize tuberculosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The mechanisms regulating the hypoxic response in mycobacteria have been extensively studied in members of the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) complex, including the Mtb surrogate, <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG. For example, hypoxia has been shown to modulate a transcriptional regulatory network that is predictive of changes in lipid metabolism caused by hypoxia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The modest predictive power of transcriptionally based models is likely due to the well-established poor correlation between levels of transcripts and proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> and points to the potential for translational regulatory mechanisms contributing to cell phenotype.</p><p>Here we show how translational mechanisms play an important role in the mycobacterial response to hypoxia. The basis for these studies lies in our observations in budding yeast, in which stress-specific alterations in dozens of modified ribonucleosides in transfer RNA (tRNA) coordinately regulate selective translation of codon-biased messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from families of stress response genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.

Among possible mechanisms linking environmental changes to codon-biased translation, recent studies have shown that the dozens of modified ribonucleosides in tRNA form a dynamic system that responds to cellular stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.

Given that these mechanisms have yet to be established in prokaryotes, much less shown to play any role in microbial pathogenesis, we identified a role of tRNA reprogramming and selective translation of codon-biased survival proteins in the hypoxia-induced non-replicative state of mycobacteria.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Hypoxia reprogrammes tRNA modifications in mycobacteria</title><p>We began this mechanistic analysis by characterizing the full repertoire of tRNA modifications in <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG and their behaviour under hypoxic stress. Using chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (LC-MS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, we identified 40 distinct ribonucleoside modifications in purified tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, parameters in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Next, we used dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (MRM; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> to quantify changes in the levels of these modifications as BCG entered and exited a non-replicating, persistent state in a Wayne-like gradual hypoxia model of non-replicating persistence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The measurements of tRNA modifications proved to be very precise, with variance among biological replicates differing by an average coefficient of variation of 17&#x000b1;3.8&#x00025; while differences in modification levels between time points varied with a coefficient of variation of 74&#x000b1;40&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). This validates the rigour of the method for quantifying significant hypoxia-induced changes in tRNA modification levels. Hierarchical clustering analysis of fold-change values for each modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>) distinguished the three classical phases of hypoxia-induced persistence: aerated growth and non-replicating persistence stages 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). However, this analysis of fold-change values on days 0&#x02013;21 of hypoxia (Log, H4&#x02013;21) and days 1&#x02013;6 of re-aeration (R1&#x02013;6) also distinguished two transitional phases at the entry (H4) and exit (R1&#x02013;3) of hypoxic bacteriostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). We termed these phases hypoxic transition (HT) and early resuscitation (ER), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Hypoxia thus induced distinct patterns of change in the 40 tRNA modifications in BCG, patterns that predicted the stages of hypoxic persistence and resuscitation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Hypoxia regulates tRNA modifications and tRNA isoacceptors</title><p>We next explored the link between hypoxia-altered modification patterns in the tRNA population and translation of codon-biased genes by defining hypoxia effects on wobble modifications in individual tRNA species. For example, levels of 5-oxyacetyl-uridine (cmo<sup>5</sup>U), noted for its ability to decode G-ending codons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, were found to increase by &#x0003e;350&#x00025; in early hypoxia in total tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, CmoB converts 5-hydroxyuridine (ho<sup>5</sup>U) to either 5-methoxyuridine (mo<sup>5</sup>U) or cmo<sup>5</sup>U depending upon the availability of S-carboxymethyl-S-adenosylmethionine (carboxy-SAM) produced from SAM by CmoA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. CmoM then methylates cmo<sup>5</sup>U to form mcmo<sup>5</sup>U (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). While this biosynthetic pathway has not been annotated in BCG, we found homologues of <italic>cmoA</italic> and <italic>cmoB</italic> in BCG: BCG_0612 (55&#x00025; coverage of CmoA, <italic>E</italic> value=4e<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> by blastp) and BCG_2975c (51&#x00025; coverage of CmoB, <italic>E</italic> value=2e<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> by blastp). In addition to finding ho<sup>5</sup>U, mo<sup>5</sup>U, cmo<sup>5</sup>U and mcmo<sup>5</sup>U in BCG tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, mo<sup>5</sup>U has been mapped to the wobble position of tRNA<sup>Thr(UGU)</sup> in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> while mcmo<sup>5</sup>U and cmo<sup>5</sup>U have been mapped to the same position in <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Thr(UGU)28</sup>. Building on these observations, we defined the wobble occupancy of tRNA<sup>Thr(UGU)</sup> in BCG and measured hypoxia-induced changes in the levels of 3 tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> isoacceptors in BCG by mass spectrometric sequencing and quantification of RNase U2-generated oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. There was a significant decrease in wobble ho<sup>5</sup>U in tRNA<sup>Thr(UGU)</sup> at H4 accompanied by a nearly complete shift from mo<sup>5</sup>U under aerobic conditions to cmo<sup>5</sup>U and mcmo<sup>5</sup>U at H4 and H9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). This could reflect a hypoxia-induced increase in CmoA-catalysed formation of carboxy-SAM to shift CmoB activity from mo<sup>5</sup>U to cmo<sup>5</sup>U; proteomic analyses discussed shortly support this model. This hypoxic increase in wobble cmo<sup>5</sup>U in tRNA<sup>Thr(UGU)</sup> was accompanied by a significant increase in number of copies of this tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>) and decreases in the levels of the other two Thr tRNA isoacceptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). All the changes reverted to Log levels during aerobic resuscitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). These results are consistent with coordinated up- and downregulation of specific tRNA wobble modifications and tRNA isoacceptor levels in response to hypoxia, which raises the question of a link to hypoxia-induced translation of mRNAs with biased use of the cognate codons for these tRNAs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Biased codon usage across the BCG genome</title><p>We next tested the hypothesis that the BCG genome was organized with biased use of synonymous codons, with codon biases linking persistence-related genes to hypoxia-reprogrammed tRNAs. Using a gene-specific codon counting algorithm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, we analysed codon usage patterns in the 3,951 protein-coding genes in BCG, with the heat map shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> revealing two groups of genes with significantly biased use of synonymous codons. In the 91 genes in Group 1, 21 members of the 48-gene Dos regulon, which controls the early hypoxic response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, were significantly biased with C- and G-ending codons, including higher than average ACG usage and lower than genome average ACC usage. Of these, nine <italic>dosR</italic> regulon genes show significant ACG/ACC biases after correction for gene length and global codon bias by z-transformation: BCG_0113, BCG_0114, BCG_0614, BCG_0615 (<italic>nrdZ</italic>), BCG_1772, BCG_1773c, BCG_2024c (<italic>fdxA</italic>), BCG_2013, and BCG_3156c (<italic>dosR</italic>). Considering that there are 3,952 genes in the BCG genome, the probability of picking the same nine genes with this exact feature from the two data sets by random chance is 7.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>, the gene for <italic>dosR</italic>, the transcription factor regulating activity of the Dos regulon, was found to be highly significantly enriched in Thr<sup>ACG</sup> codons and impoverished in Thr<sup>ACC</sup> codons.</p><p>These codon biases, along with the fact that G-ending codons in 4-fold degenerate codon boxes (Leu, Val, Ser, Pro, Thr, Ala) are read by modified wobble uridines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), become important in light of the observation that hypoxia leads to the upregulation of wobble cmo<sup>5</sup>U in tRNA<sup>Thr(UGU)</sup>. Indeed, cmo<sup>5</sup>U is noted for its ability to decode G-ending codons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Similarly, the putative CmoA homologue, BCG_0612, is heavily biased in ACA usage (<italic>Z</italic>=2.75, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01)&#x02014;a rare codon decoded solely by tRNA<sup>Thr(UGU)</sup> and its modified derivatives (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) and preferably read during the hypoxic transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, the BCG genome contains sets of genes with biased use of codons that are read by hypoxia-reprogrammed tRNAs, which raises the question of selective translation of proteins from these genes during hypoxia.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>tRNA modifications are linked to global protein expression</title><p>To test the hypothesis that the changes in the hypoxia-remodelled tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> pool correlate with translation of codon-biased mRNAs to affect expression of Dos regulon and other proteins, we performed iTRAQ proteomic analyses to compare changes in protein levels across the hypoxic time course at Log, H4, H6, H9, H14, H18, R3 and R6. By cross-validating protein identifications between SpectrumMill and X!tandem, we were able to match 122,546 spectra to 36,751 unique peptides that mapped onto 2,455 proteins (62&#x00025; proteome coverage at 4.9&#x00025; peptide FDR; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Of these, 965 proteins could be consistently quantified by two or more peptides in all samples across the time course (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01; protein FDR&#x0003c;0.01&#x00025;; no missing values) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>), with the proteins distributed across all major gene ontology categories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). A scores plot from a principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) revealed clustering of time points from the hypoxic time course, with the clustering precisely recapitulating the five stages of hypoxia-induced persistence and resuscitation defined earlier by the tRNA modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and hypoxic growth curve (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). This clustering behaviour was driven by groups of highly co-varying proteins that defined each time point and stage, as shown in the loadings plot of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>.</p><p>A mechanistic link between tRNA modification changes and changes in protein expression appears to arise in another striking feature that emerged from a partial least squares regression analysis of the most significantly up- or downregulated proteins (&#x0003e;2-fold change, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>) and the codon usage patterns in their genes: pairs of synonymous codons were significantly over- or under-represented in the highly up- and downregulated proteins across the hypoxia time course. For example, after 4 days of hypoxia (H4), the genes for upregulated proteins showed a highly significant preference for ACG over ACC and those for downregulated proteins reversed this usage (0.83&#x0003c;<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x0003c;0.91 for Factor-1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). This behaviour was recapitulated at other hypoxia time points, with codon choices between the synonymous pairs Asn<sup>AAT</sup>/Asn<sup>AAC</sup>, Asp<sup>GAT</sup>/Asp<sup>GAC</sup>, Cys<sup>TGT</sup>/Cys<sup>TGC</sup>, His<sup>CAT</sup>/His<sup>CAC</sup>, Lys<sup>AAA</sup>/Lys<sup>AAG</sup> and Tyr<sup>TAT</sup>/Tyr<sup>TAC</sup> distinguishing highly up- or downregulated proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). The link to tRNA modification changes is illustrated at H4 by the highly correlated increase in wobble cmo<sup>5</sup>U in the tRNA<sup>Thr(UGU)</sup> that reads ACG, the significant increase in the number of copies of tRNA<sup>Thr(UGU)</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>), and decreases in the levels of the other two Thr tRNA isoacceptors, including the tRNA<sup>Thr(GGU)</sup> that reads ACC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). These results support a model of stress-induced concerted reprogramming of tRNA modifications and translation of codon-biased mRNAs to affect phenotypic changes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The translation model in the context of gene expression</title><p>One question that emerges at this point is the extent to which transcriptional pressures and mRNA levels drive codon-biased translation. One could envision an extreme scenario in which hypoxia induces up- and downregulation of only those transcripts that possess the observed stage-specific codon biases in up- and downregulated proteins, with the tRNA reprogramming merely reflecting pressures for translating on ribosomes loaded with these codon-biased transcripts&#x02014;a purely transcription-driven mechanism. Here we demonstrate that this is not the case in hypoxic BCG based on two different pieces of evidence. First, we note that DosR protein levels significantly diverge from changes in <italic>dosR</italic> transcript levels, with mRNA levels dropping rapidly after H4 and maximal levels of DosR reached at H9 and maintained until re-aeration (post-H18; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>). In contrast, changes in levels of tRNA<sup>Thr(cmo5UGU)</sup> closely paralleled DosR expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>). Similarly, protein concentrations of putative CmoA homologue that synthesizes cmo<sup>5</sup>U in BCG increased up to 6.5-fold in early hypoxia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>), which is consistent with the shift from wobble mo<sup>5</sup>U to cmo<sup>5</sup>U in tRNA<sup>ThrUGU</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p><p>In a second more generalized analysis, we asked whether codon usage affects protein expression of co-transcribed genes in BCG operons. Since transcription of polycistronic mRNAs from operons in the mycobacterial genome leads to co-transcription of many genes, one would expect to see correlated translational up- and downregulation for all gene partners on an operon and no codon usage differences among translated proteins unless all operonic gene partners shared the same codon usage patterns. To test this idea, we mapped 229 of the 965 proteins detected in our analysis onto 86 operons with polycistronic mRNAs. Next, we compared the protein expression of these genes and their co-transcribed neighbours. In 254 pair-wise comparisons, 73 gene pairs show strong positive correlations (0.4&#x02264;<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02264;1) while 45 pairs are anti-correlated (&#x02212;1&#x02264;<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02264;&#x02212;0.4). Interestingly, on tallying the codon usage differences between correlated and anti-correlated pairs, we note that disproportionate use of Thr<sup>ACG</sup> in one member of a gene-pair relative to its neighbour is a contributor to anti-correlated protein expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). Gene pairs with one partner biased in using Thr<sup>ACG</sup> are 4.6 times more likely (confidence interval: 2.7&#x02013;8.1, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) to be anti-correlated in protein expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>). These results highlight the subtle but pervasive influence of synonymous codon usage on gene expression and support the idea of a link between stress-induced tRNA reprogramming and selective translation of codon-biased stress response proteins.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Codon re-engineering supports codon-biased translation</title><p>To further ascertain the importance of codon usage patterns in translation efficiency and survival in the BCG hypoxic response, we generated a series of recombinant BCG strains with <italic>dosR</italic> engineered to use only one of four possible Thr codons: ACA, ACC, ACG or ACU (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>).

In aerobic exponential phase growth, these synonymous Thr codon mutations were silent in terms of growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), <italic>dosR</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>), the ratio of transcription of <italic>dosR</italic> to its operon partner, <italic>dosS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>), and translation (relative to <italic>dosS</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Knocking out both genes (<italic>&#x00394;dosSR</italic>) is deleterious for mycobacteria during hypoxia and upon re-aeration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>, white bar), but their restoration in the <italic>&#x00394;dosSR</italic>::<italic>dosSR(WT)</italic> construct restored fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref> orange bar; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. However, upon induction of hypoxia, the translational efficiency of DosR in the synonymous Thr codon mutants is maximally enhanced by ACG and maximally reduced by ACC during hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>), while relative transcriptional efficiency of <italic>dosR</italic> and <italic>dosS</italic> are unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). This again points to a transcription-independent role for codon-biased translation in some cases. DosR protein levels were higher for ACG-biased mutants in hypoxia than WT, but lower in ACC- and ACT-biased mutants, possibly due to preferential paring of mcmo<sup>5</sup>U and cmo<sup>5</sup>U with G as in Thr<sup>ACG</sup> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). We also tracked DosR activity by measuring <italic>hspX</italic> expression. <italic>hspX</italic> is a prominent member of the <italic>dosR</italic> regulon, and its over-expression slows cell growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. We found that <italic>hspX</italic> expression mirrors that of DosR levels (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.75, <italic>P</italic>=3.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9c</xref>), which implies that all four synonymous Thr codon mutants produced functional DosR protein that was translated in a timely manner but with differing efficiencies that reflect the previously observed codon bias effects (enhanced with ACG, reduced with ACC). The results of the codon re-engineering studies thus support the model of hypoxia-induced tRNA reprogramming linked to codon-biased translation of critical hypoxia response proteins.</p><p>Two clear conclusions emerge regarding the effect of <italic>dosR</italic> codon engineering on BCG survival under hypoxic conditions: (1) <italic>dosS</italic> and <italic>dosR</italic> are critical for BCG growth and survival under hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>) and (2) <italic>dosR</italic> codon substitution with the most strongly up- and downregulating codons (ACG and ACC, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>) reduced BCG fitness during re-aeration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). However, in spite of the clear codon-dependent changes in the expression of DosR, the master regulator of hypoxic dormancy, the survival phenotypes of the <italic>dosR</italic> codon-engineered mutants did not behave in a predictable manner. The ACC and ACG mutants had significantly reduced viability during re-aeration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>), which could reflect the consequences of significantly over- or under-expressing DosR during recovery from hypoxia. The lack of a strong correlation between DosR expression levels and hypoxic fitness points to influences from other systems and pathways in BCG, such as contributions from protein turnover kinetics, other stress response pathways (for example, enduring hypoxic response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), changes in protein secondary modifications (for example, phosphorylation of DosR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) and other signalling pathways, as well as transcriptional changes, all integrating in the final phenotype. For example, given that Majumdar <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> suggest that levels of DosR can decrease by as much as 7.5-fold in Mtb and still support HspX expression, we surmise that the lowered levels of DosR in ACC mutants was still sufficient to induce WT levels of <italic>hspX</italic> expression. These phenotypic complexities point to the need to better understand the integration of the many systems involved in mycobacterial persistence, while the <italic>dosR</italic> codon re-engineering results support the mechanistic importance of codon usage patterns in the expression of proteins critical to the hypoxic response in BCG.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The totality of the results lead us to propose an integrated model for translational contributions to mycobacterial non-replicative persistence and to cellular stress response in general. Insights into the phenomenon of tRNA reprogramming and codon-biased translation, as well as the phenotypes of these synonymous Thr mutants, can be obtained by taking into account the interplay between codon usage, codon-tRNA pairings and changes in the tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> pool (copy number, modification levels), as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>. ACC&#x02014;the optimal codon&#x02014;and ACG are the two most abundant Thr codons in BCG and each is read by a single tRNA: tRNA<sup>ThrGGU</sup> and tRNA<sup>ThrUGU</sup>, respectively. That these two tRNAs change copy number in opposite directions in early hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>), accompanied by wobble reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2g</xref>) that amplifies ACG selectivity by tRNA<sup>ThrUGU</sup>, is consistent with hypoxia-induced upregulation of ACG-enriched proteins and downregulation of ACC-enriched proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). These conditions also explain the significantly enhanced expression of <italic>dosR</italic> in the hypoxic ACG-biased mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). Moreover, our results with the ACG-biased mutant <italic>dosR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>) and published observations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> link overexpression of <italic>dosR</italic> with delayed aerobic growth. The poor fitness of the ACC mutant upon aerobic recovery can be explained by the fact that ACC is read by a single tRNA<sup>ThrGGU</sup> isoacceptor that decreased significantly in copy number during HT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>), which reduced the translation of ACC-biased <italic>dosR</italic> and slowed DosR accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The delayed stress response encourages further growth in early hypoxia (H6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>) but led to a loss of viability that was evident upon resuscitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). The fact that biased use of minor Thr codons, ACA and ACU, does not lead to dramatic effects on DosR expression or survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d,e</xref>) may relate to the presence of two tRNA quasi-species that read each of these codons: tRNA<sup>ThrGGU</sup> and tRNA<sup>Thr(cmo5UGU)</sup> for ACU and tRNA<sup>Thr(cmo5UGU)</sup> and tRNA<sup>Thr(mo5UGU)</sup> for ACA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Opposing changes in copy number and modification in these pairs of tRNAs may negate any effect on expression of ACA- and ACU-biased <italic>dosR</italic> and thus survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that BCG schedules transcripts for translation by reprogramming tRNAs to better read specific codons over their synonymous counterparts. Critical genes, such as <italic>dosR</italic>, use a specific set of codons that are transiently prioritized during stress to enhance their translation. Factoring in our previous observations in yeast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, a general model emerges in which the balance of codon usage and timing of tRNA modification changes in a cell is tuned to allow appropriate translation of survival and adaptation proteins under the right conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). It is important to point out here that, although as we have demonstrated in yeast<sup>9</sup> and in the present studies, there is evidence for a disconnect between transcript levels and codon-biased translation, the model does not preclude contributions from transcriptional regulation. Indeed, this translational control system would cooperate with transcriptional mechanisms to provide a means to enhance the expression of critical proteins for which mRNA levels may not be optimal at the moment of a stress or for which transcript levels are abundant. With 3,000&#x02013;8,000 mRNA molecules in a bacterial cell at any moment in time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> and mRNA copy numbers as low as 0.6&#x02013;2 per gene, a translational control mechanism would compensate for non-optimal mRNA levels by scheduling the appropriate transcripts for translation under the pressure of a changing external environment. However, not all codon-biased transcripts are uniformly up- or downregulated, as illustrated by the fact that half of the proteins from ACG-enriched genes remain unchanged at any point in the hypoxia time course (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). This suggests that many factors contribute to stress-induced translational changes, such as mRNA abundance and other codon biases in the genes, with the observed stress-specific tRNA reprogramming and codon-biased translation enhancing translational efficiency as part of a larger network that regulates gene expression at all levels.</p><p>So what regulatory mechanisms lead to the tRNA reprogramming observed in mycobacteria in, for example, early hypoxia? There are clearly upstream transcriptional and translational events that are activated by hypoxia and precede the reprogramming and codon-biased upregulation of DosR, including an early increase in transcription of <italic>dosR</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>). The tRNA modification pattern on day 4 is clearly different from that of day 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), which points to changes in gene expression that precede activation of the Dos regulon. Further downstream, the sensors DosS and DosT, which detect redox changes, hypoxia, nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, are histidine kinases that regulate DosR's activity as a transcription factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. It is possible that these and other kinases affect earlier and later transcription and translation pathways, such as upregulation of the CmoA that converts wobble mo<sup>5</sup>U to cmo<sup>5</sup>U at day 9 of hypoxia in BCG. It is highly likely that the gradual changes in mycobacterial phenotype in response to hypoxic stress involve a cascade of regulatory events that includes stage-specific tRNA reprogramming and codon-biased translation. The codon usage, tRNA modification and proteomics data also support the idea that the tRNA modification reprogramming and codon-biased translation affect a larger network of proteins than just the DosR regulon in hypoxia and, more broadly, affect translation of other protein classes in other types of mycobacterial stress, such as nutrient deprivation. Of the 3,951 genes in BCG, 580 open reading frames possess codon usage patterns significantly deviating from the genome average (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), which presents a large number of genes that have the potential to be regulated in part by tRNA modification reprogramming during environmental changes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><p>Chemicals and reagents, bacterial strains, media and growth conditions are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification and quantification of tRNA modifications</title><p>RNA extraction and purification is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Method 2</xref>.

The HPLC-Chip configuration consisted of a 160&#x02009;nl enrichment column and a 150&#x02009;mm &#x000d7; 75&#x02009;&#x003bc;m analytical column (G4240-62001 Zorbax 300SB-C18). Mobile phases used were: 0.1&#x00025; formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1&#x00025; formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). A 120&#x02009;min long gradient LC separation was used with 10&#x02009;min for column wash and equilibration between runs.

Nine hundred and sixty-five proteins that can be reproducibly quantified form the iTRAQ experiment were mapped onto their respective operons using custom Matlab (R2015a) scripts while picking out operons with more than one gene member. We then manually validated whether these operons produced polycistronic mRNA by comparison with RNAseq reads (NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus study GSE66883). Pair-wise comparisons of protein expression of gene neighbours throughout the hypoxia time course were made and their <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> coefficient of regression statistic calculated. Gene pairs with <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> greater than 0.4 are set as correlated while those with R<sup>2</sup> less than &#x02212;0.4 are set as anti-correlated pairs. gene-specific codon counting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> was used to quantify the codon usage differences between partners within correlated and anti-correlated pairs. The difference in codon usage frequencies were then summed and visualized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). A codon is set to be over-represented in genes with anti-correlated protein abundance changes if its cumulative frequency is more than twice its cumulative frequency in correlated pairs and vice versa. The strength of the association between ACG codon usage and anti-correlated protein expression between gene pairs is then assessed using relative risk by assuming that codon usage of a gene is independent of protein expression correlation between operonic gene neighbour pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Gene pairs in which one partner was enriched with Thr<sup>ACC</sup> and the other with Thr<sup>ACG</sup> are 4.6 times (confidence interval: 2.7&#x02013;8.1, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) more likely to be anti-correlated in protein expression.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All the experiments involved triplicate cultures, repeated at least four independent times.

Conversely, genes using less abundant or rare synonymous codons are expressed to a lesser extent. For instance, tRNA<sup>Thr</sup><sub>mo5UGU</sub> can read the codons ACG, ACA and ACU, diluting available tRNA<sup>Thr</sup><sub>UGU</sub> isoacceptors. Exposure to hypoxia alters the tRNA pool by both affecting both tRNA copy numbers and their modification status. Decreases in specific isoacceptors such as tRNA<sup>Thr</sup><sub>GGU</sub> and tRNA<sup>Thr</sup><sub>CGU</sub> funnel translation towards tRNA<sup>Thr</sup><sub>UGU</sub> decoding. Concurrent alternation of wobble mo<sup>5</sup>U to cmo<sup>5</sup>U shifts translational selection towards ACG-biased codons.
