The disease appears in only 20% of the infections. Diversity in phenotypes may occur within the same infectious strain in the gut; for instance, parasites can be commensal (in the intestinal lumen) or pathogenic (inside the tissue). The degree of pathogenesis of clinical isolates varies greatly. These findings raise the hypothesis that genetic derivation may account for amoebic diverse phenotypes. The main goal of this study was to analyse gene expression changes of a single virulent amoebic strain in different environmental contexts where it exhibit different degrees of virulence, namely isolated from humans and maintained through animal liver passages, in contact with the human colon and short or prolonged <italic>in vitro</italic> culture. The study reveals major transcriptome changes in virulent parasites upon contact with human colon explants, including genes related to sugar metabolism, cytoskeleton rearrangement, stress responses and DNA repair. Furthermore, in long-term cultured parasites, drastic changes in gene expression for proteins with functions for proteasome and tRNA activities were found. Globally we conclude that rapid changes in gene expression rather than genetic derivation can sustain the invasive phenotype of a single virulent isolate of <italic>E. histolytica</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The parasite <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> is the etiological agent of amoebiasis, an infectious disease that affects the intestine and the liver of humans. Amoebiasis occurs at high incidence in large populations with limited modern sanitation systems. The infestation arises after ingestion of cysts contaminating water and food. Upon de-cystation, a vegetative cell, the trophozoite, is formed that colonizes the intestine or becomes invasive. During intestinal invasion, <italic>E. histolytica</italic> degrades the colonic mucosa and then interacts with the intestinal epithelium, crosses the basal lamina and disrupts the extracellular matrix (ECM). Trophozoites colonize the human gut mainly as commensals that feed on bacteria, these are able to invade the mucosa then initiating the acute phase of the disease. Intestinal amoebiasis has multiple clinical manifestations ranging from frequent mild diarrhoea to dysentery with blood and mucus in the stool. A major research interest on <italic>E. histolytica</italic> is driven by the observation that only one out of five infected persons develops the disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> while most reported infections are asymptomatic. The development of the disease has been associated with human factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, environmental conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and especially with trophozoite virulence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The amoebic invasive process can then induce an inflammatory response accompanied by disease-relevant cell death (for a review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). In some cases, subsequent to intestinal infection, or by direct acquisition through the blood, the parasite disseminates via the circulatory system, reaches the liver and induces hepatic abscesses that can be fatal for the infected person. Circulating trophozoites are confronted with the host&#x02019;s innate immune response, in particular with cytotoxic compounds, as well as with oxygen tensions higher than those usually found in the gut. In addition, trophozoites are exposed to other host defence mechanisms &#x02013; they are notably attacked by reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates produced by phagocyte cells, these compounds are highly concentrated in the infected tissue. For example, it has been shown experimentally that trophozoites invading the liver are highly sensitive to blood complement and tissue responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The diversity of human compartments that <italic>E. histolytica</italic> crosses during the infection combined with the variability of symptoms induced, suggest that this parasite expresses distinct transcriptional programs although the key components regulating gene expression remain to be described.</p><p>Following the sequencing and annotation of the <italic>E. histolytica</italic> genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, microarray approaches have been developed to analyse gene expression in this organism. The data obtained revealed important regulatory networks involved in strain phenotype differences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, colonic and hepatic invasion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, responses to stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, drug treatments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, metabolic changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and the encystation process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Overall, these studies have identified diverse pathogenic factors, new pathways for drug treatment and some elements of transcriptional gene regulation. Thus, transcriptome approaches opened solid avenues to investigate the mechanism supporting invasion and pathogenicity of <italic>E. histolytica</italic>. Since this parasite only targets humans and the gut is the main reservoir for the cyst form, it is difficult to experimentally study infections in the context of amoebic human natural host aiming to understand the molecular basis of amoebiasis. Human colon explants have recently been used as an alternative system, and experiments have provided new knowledge to understand the pathophysiological bases of intestinal invasion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. For instance, the role of amoebic proteinases and human metalloproteinases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> in the degradation of the ECM and activation of immune responses has been outlined. The comparison of the gene expression profiles of parasites isolated from an asymptomatic carrier (i.e. the non-virulent Rahman strain) and from a symptomatic patient (i.e. the virulent HM1:IMSS strain) in contact with human colon explants has provided a global view of gene expression changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. One remarkable feature of the virulent phenotype resides in the up-regulation of genes implicated in carbohydrate metabolism and processing of glycosylated residues of compounds building the intestinal barrier. However, it can be argued that trophozoites from the isolates used in these experiments have been in culture for decades and may harbour some genetic deviations influencing their virulence. In conjunction with the expression of genes encoding the so-called virulence factors, the infectious process also requires the expression of genes whose products are important for adaptation to different host responses and to counteract environmental factors of the invaded tissues.</p><p>In this work we hypothesized that for a given <italic>E. histolytica</italic> strain, changes in the environment (in particular those occurring during the interaction with the human host) trigger the major gene expression marks related to different degrees of virulence. To test this hypothesis, we applied high-throughput RNA sequencing to profile, for the first time, samples from the same isolate (HM1:IMSS) in contact with different environments. We harvested trophozoites from liver abscess experimentally induced in the hamster animal model, a condition enhancing amoebic virulence, and from these virulent parasites loaded in contact with human colon explants, reflecting the intestinal invasive process. Searching for factors that might be implicated in the aggravation of the disease, we first defined a set of genes specifically expressed in virulent trophozoites isolated from the liver that we further refined by studying trophozoites interacting with the human colon. In addition to stress responses and DNA repair, the expression of important cytoskeleton-related factors was the mark of cultured virulent parasites. Remarkably, virulent parasites change their profile upon interaction with the human colon by increasing the expression of genes related to metabolism of carbohydrates and glycosylated residues. The profiles established for virulent trophozoites were compared to those of long-term <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured parasites of the same strain that have acquired a virulence-attenuated phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The marks associated with virulence and intestinal invasion are lost in virulence-attenuated amoebae, which appeared highly active in proteasome activities and repressed in tRNA transfer enzymes. Based on our results we concluded that rapid and highly specific changes in the amoebic transcriptome, rather than genetic variation of the amoeba isolate, can account for the invasion of human colon by virulent <italic>E. histolytica</italic>.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Characterization of the transcriptome of <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> with different degrees of virulence</title><p>To analyse transcriptional changes in trophozoites of the same strain undergoing changes in virulence we used RNAseq.

Three replicates of each condition were performed resulting in 12 RNA libraries in total that were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (see Material and Methods). Data were processed, using bioinformatical and statistical workflows as already published<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.

These proteins belong to the actin-binding proteins category with filament crosslinking activities able to organize microfilaments in orthogonal and/or parallel networks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, including: filamin (EHI_104630, EHI_167130), villin (EHI_007480), gelsolin (EHI_009570), filopodin (EHI_080740), cortexillin (EHI_103430), Diaphanous-Formin (EHI_190990, EHI_192460, EHI_118260) Paxillin (EHI_069060, EHI_022960) as well as actin binders including coronin (EHI_083590, EHI_122800), Myosin II (EHI_110180), cofilin (EHI_186840) and a recently identified Arp related protein Arpv2 (EHI_048630) unique to <italic>E. histolytica</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.</p><p>Amylases, DNA repair and primary metabolism are the mark for VirColon. Several alpha-amylases (EHI_153100, EHI_152880, EHI_023360, EHI_129810) and beta-amylase (EHI_153590, EHI_009020, EHI_049700, EHI_058340, EHI_148800, EHI_035700) appeared represented. Previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> the beta-amylase EHI_192590 allele showed (in microarray experiments) a fold change up to 25 in the comparison between <italic>E. histolytica</italic> HM1:IMSS strain (virulent) and <italic>E. histolytica</italic> Rhaman strain (non-virulent) cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> or during their interaction with human colon explants. Here expression of the EHI_192590 allele didn&#x02019;t show any change probably because we are comparing only an unique virulent strain in different conditions; instead significant overexpression of four copies of beta-amylase encoding gene was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S13</xref>) strongly sustaining our conclusion on the role of beta-amylase in the infectious process.</p><p>Several genes encoding proteins with helicase activities involved in DNA repair and genome stability maintenance were up-regulated and overrepresented in trophozoites in contact with host colon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S13</xref>). The DNA damage response represents a survival mechanism that confers cellular protection against stresses induced by DNA-damaging agents, several classes of antibiotics, and oxidative agents that may attack amoebae during colon invasion. Two genes potentially involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) of DNA, namely ERCC2 (EHI_054240) and ERCC3 (EHI_088430), were significantly overexpressed. Both ERCC2 and ERCC3 are DNA helicase component of the core-TFIIH basal transcription factor involved in NER and RNA transcription by RNA polymerase II in human cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. We also found an increased expression of a gene (EHI_187240) with high homology to WRNIP1, a Werner DNA helicase interacting protein 1, which functions as a modulator for initiation events during DNA polymerase delta-mediated DNA synthesis and sensor of DNA damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. In addition, two genes homologous to genes coding for DNA replication licensing factors, MCM2 (EHI_117970) and MCM7 (EHI_158110), involved in DNA replication and cell division in higher eukaryotes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> were also up-regulated. Intriguingly, two genes (EHI_178520, EHI_035550) sharing homologies with regulator of nonsense transcripts 1 (UPF1) were up-regulated in virulent trophozoites. In human cells, UPF proteins have RNA-dependent helicase and ATPase activities required for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of mRNAs containing premature stop codons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Notably, NMD triggered by mRNA-mRNA interactions have been linked to cell migration and invasion of cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>.</p><p>The strikingly strong enrichment found among the up-regulated categories for ATT trophozoites concerned genes encoding E3 ubiquitin ligase (EHI_142060, EHI_158200, EHI_098590), a protein transferring ubiquitin to lysine residues of a protein to target it to the proteasome for degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S14</xref>). The U-ligases found here contain a Zinc finger domain (RING domain). Ubiquitin hydrolases (EHI_064460), Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (EHI_100110), several cysteine proteases and proteasome subunits were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S14</xref>). Among the down-regulated genes for the conditions Vir and VirColon, no significant overrepresentation of protein classes was found. In contrast, for the ATT condition numerous signalling molecules including small GTPases (PC 00022), serine/tyrosine protein kinase (PC00167) and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (PC00047) with glycyl, methionyl, isoleucyl, tryptophanyl and histidyl tRNA synthetases were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). These are enzymes that link the appropriate amino acid onto its cognate tRNA to allow mRNA translation into proteins.</p><p>Finally, in order to try to identify common potential regulatory elements enhancing gene expression we performed a gene clustering analysis for the UP regulated genes. This confirmed the major findings above described for the diverse treatments applied to <italic>E. hystolyica</italic> HM1:IMSS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The data provide gene identities useful for further bioinformatics and experimental analysis of 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; elements important for gene expression regulation in each condition.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>General Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, we used extensive comparative transcriptome analysis to determine the gene expression profiles of <italic>E. histolytica</italic> associated with virulence in the context of intestinal and liver infection. According to the read coverage obtained in the RNASeq approach we conclude that globally the entire genome appears to be transcribed in all tested conditions. The complete analysis of gene expression of highly virulent trophozoites freshly isolated from liver abscess and grown for only 16&#x02009;hours <italic>in vitro</italic> identifies for the first time important features implicated in this phenotype including actin cytoskeleton, heat shock response and RNA metabolism. Changes in stress responses have already been observed in precedent work but the analysis presented here is clearly more exhaustive. The analysis of one amoebic strain in diverse environmental conditions influencing pathogenicity revealed that modulation of the amoebic transcriptome is capital for parasite adaptation allowing survival, growth and invasive behaviour. We thus discovered the genes that rapidly responded to the contact of this parasite with human colon. The patterns of differentially expressed genes of amoebae originating from the same strain and challenged with different environmental conditions closely correlates to the gene responses identified during the comparison of two particular isolates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>: one from an asymptomatic carrier (<italic>E. histolytica</italic> Rhaman strain) and the other from a symptomatic patient (<italic>E. histolytica</italic> HM1:IMSS) and allows to conclude that only the contact of virulent trophozoites with the human colon triggers an unique gene transcription profile. The genes identified as significantly modulated in the process of human colon invasion confirm that metabolic processes including the activity of glycosylases, together with cytoskeleton and DNA repair activities, are the most important mechanisms underlying amoebic intestine invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). For the first time, we also highlighted two important phenotypic features of long-term cultured virulence-attenuated trophozoites, namely the activation of SUMO activity and the down-regulation of tRNA synthetases, suggesting that in these trophozoites the increase of proteasome activities and the down-regulation of the translational machinery may be involved in gene regulation, which is different from the virulent parasites.</p><p>The major conclusion of this work is that a rapid shift in gene expression is the most important phenomenon driving amoebic pathogenicity during its interaction with the human colon. In our working model, we consider several factors that may explain the shift of the intestinal amoebic phenotype. First, a change in the composition of the bacterial flora which should take place at any time. For instance, it is known that co-infection in the presence of some Enterobacteriaceae increases the virulence of the parasite<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Another plausible factor is the human immune response because the amoebae are chemoattracted by pro-inflammatory molecules such as tumor necrosis factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> and some intestinal resident cells behaving like a TNF reservoir (eg. mast cells) potentially activated at an early stage of infection. In a general view, thank to the impact of this work, the hypothesis that genetic variability sustains differences in pathogenicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> gain in precision and seems highly related to the lost of invasive ability of commensal parasites, a fact opening new avenues to investigate whether epigenetic mechanisms may sustain such commensal behaviour. Our findings provide the first insight into the molecular basis of gene expression variation of pathogenic <italic>E. histolytica</italic> according to the environmental conditions encountered during invasive infection.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> culture of <italic>E. histolytica</italic></title><p><italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> HM1:IMSS is a virulent strain isolated in 1967 from a colonic biopsy of rectal ulcer from adult human male with amoebic dysentery, Mexico City, Mexico.

To trigger the pathogenic process, the parasite nourishes upon degradation of the mucus layer, overcomes the various tissue stresses and moves into the deep layers of the intestine, all these fuctions are rapidly activated upon contact with the intestine. Trophozoites adapted to long-term culture are not able to trigger these reactions and instead, protein degradation is highly active as well as the reduction of amino acids supply to the ribosome for protein synthesis.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep35852-f8"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="t1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>GO terms
