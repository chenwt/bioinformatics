Unlike microarrays, RNA-seq can directly detect cDNA derived from mRNA transcripts at a single nucleotide resolution.

Few automatic software tools have yet been established to investigate large-scale RNA-seq data for bacterial transcript structure analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study, 54 directional RNA-seq libraries from <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovar Typhimurium (<italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium) 14028s were examined for potential relationships between read mapping patterns and transcript structure. We developed an empirical method, combined with statistical tests, to automatically detect key transcript features, including transcriptional start sites (TSSs), transcriptional termination sites (TTSs) and operon organization. Using our method, we obtained 2,764 TSSs and 1,467 TTSs for 1331 and 844 different genes, respectively. Identification of TSSs facilitated further discrimination of 215 putative sigma 38 regulons and 863 potential sigma 70 regulons.

RNA-seq can not only determine the absolute gene expression levels with lower variation compared to microarray technology, but can also be used to find new genes and resolve the structure of transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There are many tools for read mapping, gene expression normalization and comparison, most of which were originally designed for eukaryotic organisms but also useful for bacteria, e.g., Bowtie, BWA, edgeR, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For bacterial-specific transcript structure analysis from RNA-seq data, such as transcriptional start site (TSS) and transcriptional termination site (TTS) detection, operon identification, and small RNA identification, however, few studies have been performed to determine the technical feasibility, and fewer software tools have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Though most encoding genes and many non-coding RNAs have been identified for a large variety of bacteria, the gene structure and transcriptional unit organization are not clear. Understanding bacterial transcript structure is important for systems biology studies. The identification of TSSs and TTSs can help to define the downstream or upstream untranslated regions (5&#x02032;- or 3&#x02032;-UTRs, respectively), which often contain trans-acting regulatory DNA elements. In addition, after a TSS is determined for a transcriptional unit, the promoter can be delineated, which gives clues about gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Genes that are transcribed in a single operon often have similar or coordinated functions, and participate in related pathways or biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, operon organization analysis can aid in identifying the function of unknown genes. Despite its importance, the transcript structure has only been determined in detail for a few bacterial strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], while for many others, including <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, the transcript organization has been resolved for only select groups of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Recent studies have also revealed dynamic TSS and operon patterns in the same strains under different growth conditions, demonstrating the increased complexity of transcript structure analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Traditionally, identification of TSSs and TTSs was heavily based on experimental strategies, such as 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032;-RACE (Rapid-Amplification of cDNA Ends), primer extension, and S1 nuclease protection mapping assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These methods are highly accurate, but their efficiency is low and cannot keep pace with the urgent need for a systems level understanding of bacterial gene regulatory networks. Alternatively, there are a number of machine-learning software tools established for TSS and TTS prediction purely based on features of known TSSs or TTSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; however, the low prediction accuracy and reliability of these tools represent a severe problem. Moreover, most of the software tools were developed based on the features of <italic>E. coli</italic> and other model microorganisms, which may not reflect general properties for other bacterial TSSs and TTSs. To identify operons, the intergenic distances and co-expression coefficients are two major factors. However, it can sometimes be difficult to determine co-regulation between two adjacent genes in the same operon or between two adjacent operons. It is also not easy to identify alternative TSSs or TTSs within multiple-gene operons that are known to generate alternative transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Some groups have attempted to use RNA-seq to analyze TSSs in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. RNA-seq based TSS identification appeared more efficient than traditional experimental strategies and more precise than strictly bioinformatic methods. Most of these studies adopted the differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) method that enriches for primary mRNAs and degrades processing mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In these studies, a large number of TSSs were identified, but the TTSs and operon organization could not be determined. Moreover, the TSSs were often identified manually or semi-automatically, the standards were varied and subjective, and no statistical reliability scores were given for the results.</p><p>Most RNA-seq experiments are performed to achieve the goal of comparative analysis of gene expression. Strand-specific (or directional) RNA-seq is often employed for these experiments and the resulting data represent an untapped resource for bacterial transcript structure analysis. However, several problems remain to be solved before this information can be extracted. How are the mapped cDNA reads distributed along bacterial transcripts? How can transcript structure be resolved according to these mapping patterns? How accurate and reliable are the results? If the identification of structural features is not precise, are the errors caused by the RNA-seq technique itself or by the analytical methods employed? This study was designed to address these questions. We sequenced multiple <italic>Salmonella</italic> cDNA libraries, observed the distribution of mapped reads along transcripts, proposed an empirical TSS and TTS detection method along with appropriate statistical tests, and compared the performance with a classical Poisson distribution based method. The methods developed in this research can be widely used to automatically detect bacterial TSSs, TTSs and operon organization from directional RNA-seq data. In addition, we provide comprehensive gene transcript structure annotation for the 14028s strain of <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovar Typhimurium, an important human and animal pathogen.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Extraction of TSSs and TTSs based on real read mapping patterns</title><p>We developed an empirical method, based on the biased distribution of reads at the 5&#x02032; end of transcripts, to extract transcript structure information from standard bacterial RNA-seq data. Within our RNAseq dataset, we observed that known transcriptional units, either generally or individually, were enriched for their read coverage at 5&#x02032;-ends as well as upstream regions (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A and B). This agrees with Raghavan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], who first reported an increased distribution of cDNA reads mapping to the upstream region of genes. A similar biased distribution of reads has also been observed for eukaryotic mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A biased distribution is problematic because the existing methods for extracting transcript information from bacterial RNAseq data are based on Poisson distribution models, which assume a hypothetically even distribution across an entire transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We reasoned that if cDNA reads are not uniformly distributed across transcripts that it would limit the effectiveness of Poisson distribution-based methods. The new empirical method that we propose is based on the actual read mapping patterns at gene borders and is independent from any theoretical distribution model or the hypothesis of &#x02018;even distribution along the transcript&#x02019;.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Read distribution, mapping patterns, and TSS/TTS extraction strategies for <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium 14028s RNAseq analysis. <bold>(A</bold> and <bold>B)</bold> Average depth of mapped reads at different positions of encoding and flanking regions.

The Signal to noise ratio refers to the second number divided by the first number.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2015_1555_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The criteria and TSS/TTS retrieving strategies for our empirical method are outlined in Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C and D. If the borders between transcripts were clear or nearly clear (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C, Pattern 1 and Pattern 2), it was easy to distinguish the TSSs and TTSs. However, sometimes the borders were unclear and it was difficult to define the transcript structure (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C, Pattern 3). These regions could reflect sub-operons, where one gene or sequential genes within a known long operon can be transcribed as independent transcriptional units. Based on the property of biased read distribution, we detected TSSs in some of these areas (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C and D, Pattern 3), factoring in the signal to noise ratio (i.e., # reads mapping to 5&#x02032; region of Gene 2/# reads mapping to region downstream of Gene 1). The TSSs and TTSs obtained from Patterns 1, 2 and 3 were further classified into 6 Types (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). Type 1 TSSs and TTSs had multiple (&#x02265;2) read coverage at the TSSs/TTSs junctions and no reads upstream of the TSSs or downstream of the TTSs. Type 2 was classified as a situation with only single read coverage at the TSS/TTS junction and no reads upstream of the TSSs or downstream of the TTSs. Type 2 cases, therefore, were subject to more noise and had a greater chance that this was due to random sequence. Types 3, 4, and 5 belong to Pattern 2, but differed based on noise strength: for Type 3, 4 and 5, there was single, double, and 3&#x02013;10 read coverage upstream of the TSSs or downstream of the TTSs. For Type 6, the read coverage was &#x0003e;10 at positions adjacent to the TSS/TTS, which could represent part of other transcripts, as described above.</p><p>In our preliminary analysis, the resolution of Type 1 TSSs/TTSs was strikingly different from that of Types 2&#x02013;6; the number of Type 2, 3, 4, and 5 TSS/TTSs was decreasing but still high, while that of Type 6 was quite small, and therefore no additional types were defined. We tested different combinations of minimal coverage and signal-to-noise ratios (data not shown), but the final parameters were selected based on the best sensitivity, ensuring that most of the real TSSs and TTSs were captured (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Consistency of the TSSs and TTSs detected from directional RNA-seq libraries</title><p>Since few TSSs/TTSs have been validated for most bacterial strains, an alternative strategy for evaluating the reliability of prediction results is to test the overlap of TSSs/TTSs extracted from different RNAseq libraries. It is assumed that the most reliable transcript features will be consistent between libraries. The TSSs/TTSs of known encoding genes of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium 14028s identified from a single RNAseq library were summarized and then compared with those from replicated libraries (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). On average, from a single library, TSSs were captured from ~17% of the protein-encoding genes in the 14028s genome, with Type 1, Type 2, Types 3&#x02013;5 and Type 6 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C) representing 23%, 67%, 7% and 3% of the total, respectively. The remaining ~83% of genes without captured TSSs were either lowly expressed or not expressed, expressed as part of a long operon, or failed to satisfy the criteria for TSS analysis, such as read coverage or signal to noise ratio.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of TSSs and TTSs identified from a single RNA-seq library</bold>

Typhimurium SL1344 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Although there was no suggestion that SL1344 and 14028s had the same TSSs, since these strains are phylogenetically close and belong to the same species and serovar, we reasoned that the TSSs could be same for orthologous genes. Therefore, the TSSs identified from 14028s in this research were compared with those of SL1344. In total, 1075 protein-encoding genes (1075/1110, 97%) from Kr&#x000f6;ger SL1344 TSS list have orthologous counterparts in 14028s. Among them, 678 (678/1075, 63%) were also identified with TSSs in 14028s in this research (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Nearly 70% (533/678) of the TSSs had only a &#x000b1;20&#x000a0;nt difference between 14028s and SL1344 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The high consistency between the two sets of TSSs demonstrated the effectiveness of our empirical method. It should be pointed out that the TSSs detected in 14028s and SL1344 were seldom detected at exactly the same position, with the majority (~83%) of TSSs of SL1344 located upstream of 14028s TSSs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>F). This indicated the possible technical disadvantage of directional RNA-seq compared with dRNA-seq to cover the 5&#x02032;-ends of primary transcripts (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>&#x02009;F).</p><p>The 3&#x02032;-UTRs detected with our mapping pattern-based empirical method were typically short, with 56%, 66% and 75% with length shorter than 50&#x000a0;nt, 75&#x000a0;nt, and 100&#x000a0;nt, respectively (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>G). A single-parameter Poisson distribution-based model, such as used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], was also tested to extract the transcript borders from directional RNA-seq data. The 3&#x02032;-UTRs based on the Poisson distribution-based model were shorter than those with our empirical method (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>G). For 5&#x02032;-UTRs, ~60% identified with our empirical method were between 15 and 100&#x000a0;nt length while the average length calculated from the distribution-based model also appeared shorter (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>H). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the uneven distribution of mapped reads along a transcript could make the model-based border analysis inaccurate, and for these cases, an empirical strategy simply based on the mapping patterns could be a better choice.</p><p>To further confirm the general applicability of our empirical method on directional RNA-seq data of different species, three <italic>E. coli</italic> strain K-12 libraries were analyzed (see <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). In total, 1387 non-redundant TSSs and 1399 TTSs were detected (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Among the 630 predicted TSSs that had been experimentally validated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/">http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/</ext-link>), the median distance between the predicted and validated ones was 49-nt, and 31% were with a distance within 10-nt (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Considering that these <italic>E. coli</italic> datasets represent the responses to three different stresses, and the potential for many unknown and alternative TSSs due to dynamic operon organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], the actual TSS prediction performance could be better. We also re-implemented McClure&#x02019;s Poisson distribution-based method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For the 630 common TSSs, the median distance between the predicted results and the validated TSSs was 75-nt, and only 16% of them were with a distance within 10-nt (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Since the number of libraries analyzed was small, only read number based statistical tests could be performed. 145 TSSs and 53 TTSs were statistically significant without multiple testing correction (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), and only 85 TSSs and 22 TTSs were significant after correction (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). 70 of the 145 significant TSSs had been experimentally verified (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/">http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/</ext-link>); the median distance between the significant TSSs and the validated ones was 0, and 70% were within a distance of 10-nt (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). Therefore, although our empirical method loses sensitivity by taking the proposed statistical tests, the precision of transcript border identification is highly increased. Taken together, the results demonstrated the applicability of our empirical method for transcript border analysis on directional RNA-seq data of various bacterial species, from different sequencing platforms, and with more or few replicates. The method also had improved performance when compared with a Poisson distribution-based method.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Performance comparison of tools on TSS prediction from <italic>E. coli</italic> GAII RNA-seq data. <bold>(A)</bold> Distance distribution between validated TSSs and those predicted with the empirical method (blue) and the distribution-based McClure method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] (black). <bold>(B)</bold> The distance distribution between 70 TSSs predicted with the empirical method that had also been experimentally validated.

In contrast, sigma 38 is highly expressed during stationary phase and is the central regulator of the general stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

According to respective binding patterns, the promoter regions of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium 14028s chromosomal genes, defined by their identified TSSs, were screened for possible sigma 70 and sigma 38 binding motifs.

However, until now, no direct analysis has been performed to examine whether directional RNA-seq data can be used for transcriptional border identification. It remains to be clarified what is the best resolution possible for bacterial TSSs and TTSs identified from directional RNA-seq data. In this research, we tried to answer this question. Currently, there are two main methods applied for transcript border analysis from bacterial RNA-seq data - manual annotation and distribution model based methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For well-presented patterns (e.g., TEX-treated RNA-seq data, see later in this paragraph) or particularly interesting genes, a manual strategy can generate the most accurate and useful results. However, manual analysis of thousands of transcripts per library is an unwieldy process that is not suitable for large-scale analysis. On the other hand, the use of distribution-based models to analyze standard, non-TEX-treated RNA-seq data is also difficult. Since the transcript borders are not clear, the inclusion of any subjective or inconsistent criteria would lead to unreliable results. This is precisely what we observed for a Poisson distribution-based model, which makes the assumption that reads are evenly distributed along the transcript. In contrast, we observed a biased distribution of reads along a transcript. Non-uniform read distribution has also been found in eukaryotic RNA-seq data, and could be related with the sampling preference of secondary sequencing technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Alternatively, a large amount of immature mRNAs could also lead to the 5&#x02032;-biased read number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Based on this finding we proposed a new empirical method, which is independent of the theoretical distribution of reads along transcripts. A direct comparison of our empirical method with distribution model-based methods confirmed that our model achieved more accurate results. We determined that the best resolution of transcript borders retrieved from RNA-seq data was within &#x000b1;10-20&#x000a0;nt difference from experimentally determined borders. The difficulty in reaching single-nucleotide resolution was due to limitations in the directional RNA-seq technique itself and not because of limitations with our method. Several groups have reported difficulty in capturing 5&#x02032; ends of the primary mRNAs with standard library preparations and directional sequencing strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A terminator 5&#x02032;-phosphate-dependent exonuclease (TEX)-treated library-generating strategy has been frequently adopted to enrich for primary mRNAs. Although the TEX method has resulted in accurately defining a large number of TSSs in many bacterial species, it is much more expensive than normal library preparations and it does not enrich for the 3&#x02032; ends of transcripts. Moreover, TEX has only been used for a limited number of studies in comparison to standard RNA-seq analysis, which has been used for numerous bacterial species. Therefore, the automatic TSS and TTS detection method that we have described in this research should have wide application for bacterial transcriptome studies. A resolution of &#x000b1;10-20&#x000a0;nt is predicted to be sufficient for transcript unit recognition, promoter definition, motif finding, and the identification of new genes.</p><p>The resolution of TSSs and TTSs was improved as sequencing depth increased or more libraries were included in the analysis. For example, with 54 directional RNA-seq libraries, each averaging 20&#x000a0;M 75&#x000a0;bp reads with ~90% ribosome RNAs and transfer RNAs, we identified 2764 TSSs and 1467 TTSs for 1331 and 844 genes in <italic>S</italic>. typhimurium 14028s, respectively. The resolution appeared to reach a maximum threshold of &#x000b1;10-nt when compared to TEX-generated TSSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Within this maximal resolution limit, there will always be a trade-off between sensitivity of TSS/TTS detection and resolution when the size and number of libraries are fixed. For example, using a single library of 20&#x000a0;M total reads with ~90% rRNAs/tRNAs, we could detect the TSSs for ~900 genes and TTSs for ~800 genes at an average resolution of &#x000b1;50&#x000a0;nt. In general, there was a positive linear correlation between the number of TSSs/TTSs detected and the mRNA sequencing depth and/or the number of biological replicate libraries analyzed. Based on our observations, we suggest that statistical tests and the maximal resolution should be applied for TSS detection when &#x0003e;5 libraries are being analyzed, consisting of at least 10&#x000a0;M mRNA-mapping reads. When the number of libraries is smaller than 5 or the total number of mRNA-mapping reads is smaller than 10&#x000a0;M, we suggest that TSSs be detected with highest sensitivity, focusing on genes that have clear read-mapping borders (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C, Pattern 1). For TTSs, we suggest that the same criteria apply except with the high-resolution cutoff being 10 libraries and 20&#x000a0;M total mRNA-mapping reads. As noted above, both the sequencing depth and gene expression level can influence transcript border identification. To improve accuracy, in the default settings of our method, the genes with &#x0003c;70% whole coding region coverage were filtered out. Although transcript borders can still be identified with only a few libraries or low general sequencing depth (e.g., the <italic>E. coli</italic> TSSs and TTSs identified in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), integration of more RNA-seq libraries under different stresses is still recommended, which will increase both the prediction resolution and the number of borders identified.</p><p>For <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium 14028s, in addition to the 54 RNAseq libraries that we analyzed here, we are in the process of analyzing 12 other cDNA libraries. Together with the efforts being made by other research groups, we anticipate that more TSSs and TTSs will be delineated in the near future. As mentioned above, it will likely not be possible to reach a single-nucleotide resolution, but that should not influence the analysis of transcription unit organization, promoters, and even dynamic transcription structure under different conditions or stresses. The TSSs, TTSs and operons identified in this study represent the first version of a transcript structure profile in <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium 14028s. As more and more directional RNA-seq data (or even TEX-treated RNA-seq data) are available, the transcription structure information will be updated by simply re-implementing the methods, pipelines and statistical models developed in this study. The methods can also be applied to RNAseq datasets obtained from other bacteria.</p><p>We did not identify any nucleotide preference at TSSs or adjacent positions, but did observe C/G enrichment at the TTS as well as the 3&#x02013;4 adjacent positions upstream. The inconsistency of nucleotide composition bias at TSS between our results and previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] was most likely due to unmapped 5&#x02032; ends of primary mRNAs in our experiments. For C/G preference at TTS, it is consistent with previous observation on Rho-dependent transcription termination sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], implicating potential involvement of the Rho factor in transcription termination in <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium. There remains a need to determine whether the 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;nt downstream of TTSs also showed an apparent nucleotide composition bias as shown in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and to further understand the contribution of Rho-dependent and Rho-independent transcription termination in <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p><p>Finally, we detected putative sigma 38 binding motifs in the &#x02212;10 region of promoters from 215&#x02009;<italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium 14028 genes. Considering the slightly shorter 5&#x02032;-UTRs defined by the TSSs identified in this research, we searched the &#x02212;10 motifs within 0-35&#x000a0;bp upstream of TSSs. Many of the 215 putative sigma 38&#x02013;dependent genes were known to be part of the sigma 38 regulon, e.g., <italic>osmC</italic>, <italic>frdA</italic>, <italic>cfa</italic>, <italic>dps</italic>, <italic>galP</italic>, <italic>ldcC</italic>, <italic>proP</italic>, <italic>yohF</italic>, <italic>blc</italic>, <italic>yjgB</italic>, <italic>ygaU</italic>, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that any newly identified genes in this subset encode proteins that play active roles in <italic>Salmonella</italic> survival during stationary phase or stress responses. In addition to sigma 38 regulons, we also identified 863 possible sigma 70 regulons. The promoter regions for 172 of these genes had clear &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 motifs. For the remainder of genes, the &#x02212;35 motifs were not identified, most likely because of significant degeneration at this site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

Genes were excluded from empirical TSS and TTS detection based on the following three criteria: (1)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;70% whole coding region coverage, (2) average per-site read depth&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;3 along the coding regions, or (3) &#x0003c;10% coverage at 5&#x02032; ends (for TSSs) or 3&#x02032; ends (for TTSs). Remaining genes were analyzed with a single-nucleotide extension strategy beginning from the start codon and moving upstream for TSS or from the stop codon and moving downstream for TTS. For each nucleotide extension, the read depths at that position and the neighboring position (upstream for TSS and downstream for TTS) were compared using the identification standards shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, until the borders were identified or not found after 200 iterations.</p><p>The Poisson distribution-based model (McClure method) was implemented according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and compared with our empirical method. The McClure method makes the assumption that reads are randomly sampled within a gene region, including the untranslated regions for a protein-encoding gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Identifying the TSS and TTS of a gene is identical to determining the boundaries at which the gene starts to be transcribed while the distantly adjacent genomic regions are not transcribed or transcribed within neighbor genes. Repeated single nucleotide extension to a prior gene region is performed to determine the boundaries. Assume a protein-encoding gene, and the coding region <italic>G</italic> represents the prior gene region. The probability of the read number sampled within the region <italic>G</italic> can be fit with a Poisson distribution, <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}
