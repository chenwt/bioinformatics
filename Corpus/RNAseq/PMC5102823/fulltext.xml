Despite this, somatic activating mutations within <italic>erbB2</italic> in human breast cancers are rare. However, we have previously reported that a splice isoform of <italic>erbB2</italic>, containing an in-frame deletion of exon 16 (herein referred to as ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16), results in oncogenic activation of <italic>erbB2</italic> due to constitutive dimerization of the ErbB2 receptor. Here, we demonstrate that the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 is a major oncogenic driver in breast cancer that constitutively signals from the cell surface. We further show that inducible expression of the ErbB2Ex16 variant in mammary gland of transgenic mice results in the rapid development of metastatic multifocal mammary tumors. Genetic and biochemical characterization of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived mammary tumors exhibit several unique features that distinguish it from the conventional ErbB2 models expressing the <italic>erbB2</italic> proto-oncogene in mammary epithelium. Unlike the wild-type ErbB2 derived tumors that express luminal keratins, ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors exhibit high degree of intra-tumoral heterogeneity co-expressing both basal and luminal keratins. Consistent with these distinct pathological features, the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 tumors exhibited distinct signaling and gene expression profiles that correlated with activation of number of key transcription factors implicated in breast cancer metastasis and cancer stem cell renewal.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ErbB2</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>mouse model</kwd><kwd>splice variant</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Amplification and elevated expression of the <italic>erbB2</italic> proto-oncogene is observed in 20 to 30% of human breast cancers and is inversely correlated with the survival of the patient <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Direct evidence supporting a role for ErbB2 in mammary tumorigenesis derives from studies with transgenic mice expressing the <italic>erbB2</italic> proto-oncogene under the transcriptional control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter/enhancer. Mammary-epithelial expression of <italic>erbB2</italic> oncogene results in the rapid induction of multifocal mammary tumors <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. By contrast, mammary epithelial expression of the proto-oncogenic form of ErbB2 (herein referred too as wild-type ErbB2) resulted in induction of focal mammary tumors after a long latency period <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Tumor progression in these strains is associated with the activation of the ErbB2 tyrosine kinase activity due to the occurrence of somatic activating mutations in the transgene in a majority of the mammary tumors analyzed <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Significantly these mutations are confined to a cysteine rich region of the receptor located in a juxtatransmembrane domain and are comprised of either deletion or insertion of single cysteine residues. Further genetic and biochemical analyses has revealed that these cysteine alterations promote the formation intermolecular cysteine bridges between ErbB2 monomers, resulting in constitutive receptor dimerization and activation <sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Although comparable somatic mutations in <italic>erbB2</italic> have not been detected in human breast cancer, several studies have reported the expression of an alternatively spliced <italic>erbB2</italic> isoform (ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16) that carries a 16 amino acid in-frame deletion in the juxtatransmembrane domain that closely mimics the sporadic <italic>erbB2</italic> transgene mutations observed in the transgenic mice expressing the ErbB2 proto-oncogene <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Like sporadic transgene mutations, this <italic>erbB2</italic> splice variant is constitutively active due to its capacity to form disulfide-bonded dimers <sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. In addition to playing an important role in the oncogenic activation of ErbB2 receptor, it has been recently reported that the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 isoform is the principle target of the anti-ErbB2 therapeutic monoclonal Trastuzumab <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">To further validate the biological significance of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant in mammary epithelium, we established a transgenic mouse model that expresses the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant in an inducible fashion in the mammary epithelium. In contrast to the transgenic mice expressing the wild-type ErbB2 receptor in the mammary epithelium that developed focal mammary tumors after a long latency period, the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 strains rapidly developed multifocal mammary tumors that frequently metastasized to the lung. Remarkably, in contrast to the ErbB2 tumors that uniformly expressed the luminal keratin 8 marker, the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors exhibited a high degree intra-tumoral heterogeneity expressing both luminal and basal keratins. Consistent with basal origin of these tumors, gene expression analyses revealed that in contrast to luminal pattern for ErbB2, the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors possessed many features of basal breast cancer. Molecular and genetic analyses of these tumors further showed that basal molecular phenotype was due to selective signaling of the c-Src family and p38 kinases by the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant that in-turn resulted in activation of the Smad2, HIF1&#x003b1;, Stat3 and YB-1 transcriptional networks. Taken together, these observations suggest that the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 isoform possesses distinct signaling and cellular localization processes that may impact on its role in mammary tumor progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 isoform is expressed at different levels in a number of ErbB2 positive cell lines and confers transforming activity <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P5">To confirm the prevalence of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 isoform in ErbB2 positive category of breast cancer, we used a an RNA-seq approach to simultaneously measure the abundance of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 compared to wild type transcript ErbB2 transcript in a collection of established breast cancer cell lines representing the different breast cancer subtypes <sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The results revealed that the abundance of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 isoform varied considerably with the different ErbB2 positive cells lines. Although the low levels of ErbB2 spliced form were detected in the SKBR3 (1.8% of the total ErbB2 transcript), relatively high levels of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 were seen in the ZR7530 cells (12% of the total ErbB2 transcript) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Other ErbB2 cell lines maintained a modest level of the spliced variant (4&#x02013;5% of total ErbB2). Although the proportion of ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant varied in ErbB2 positive lines, due to amplification of ErbB2, the absolute levels of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant were high by comparison to other breast cancer cell lines representing the other breast cancer subtypes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Interestingly, the expression of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 form was not restricted to tumor cells. Using RT-PCR that allowed the simultaneous measurement of wild-type ErbB2 and ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 transcripts, we showed that the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant could be detected at variable levels (2&#x02013;10% of total ErbB2 transcript) in a variety of normal human tissues (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>). Together these observations indicate that both wild-type ErbB2 and ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 transcripts are expressed in both normal and malignant tumor samples and that breast cell lines possessing amplified ErbB2 possessed particularly elevated levels of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant.</p><p id="P7">Although these observations suggest that the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 transcript is expressed at elevated levels in ErbB2 amplified breast cancer cell lines, the biological significance of these observations was unclear. To directly test the transforming properties of this variant, we established independent clones of immortalized NMuMG mammary cells that expressed either constitutively active rat ErbB2 (NeuNT) <sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>, wild-type human ErbB2 or the human ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant at comparable levels (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2A</xref>). To evaluate whether cells expressing the ErbB2 variants exhibited differential tumorigenic potential, mammary cells derived from two independent clones expressing either wild-type ErbB2, activated ErbB2 (NeuNT) or ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 were injected orthotopically into immunodeficient recipient mice and their growth monitored (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2B</xref>). In contrast to the rapid onset of tumors seen in both clones expressing NeuNT and the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16, 2 independent clones of cells expressing the wild-type form of ErbB2 failed to form tumors (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2B</xref>). These observations argue that unlike the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 and activated forms of ErbB2 (Neu-NT), elevated expression of wild-type ErbB2 is not sufficient to convert these immortalized cells to the malignant phenotype.</p><p id="P8">While wild-type ErbB2 appears to be incapable of transforming immortalized epithelial cells, an outstanding question is whether this isoform is capable of maintaining a tumorigenic state. In order to test this, NMuMG cells were used to generate cell lines expressing a doxycycline-inducible ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16, isolating cells with tightly regulated induction (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). In the presence of doxycycline, robust ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 protein expression is observed as quickly as 24 hours after <italic>in vitro</italic> doxycycline administration (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). These cells were subsequently engineered to express wild-type ErbB2 as well, which were selected using FACS in the absence to doxycycline, in order to sort cells by robust wild-type ErbB2 expression. Cells were injected orthotopically into athymic nude mice, and the mice were treated with 2mg/ml doxycycline in the drinking water. Consistent with previous results, ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 induction drives rapid transformation and tumor outgrowth (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). However, when doxycycline is withdrawn, the tumors fail to express ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 but retain robust expression of wild-type ErbB2 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), leading to rapid regression of the established mammary tumors (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). These observations demonstrate that expression of wild-type ErbB2 is insufficient to maintain a tumorigenic state in the absence of ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 expression and indicate that the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 isoform and indicate that the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 isoform is a major oncogenic driver.</p><p id="P9">To determine whether the differential transforming activity of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant involved altered receptor recycling, we performed immunofluorescence staining on cells expressing the different ErbB2 receptors with antibodies directed towards ErbB2 and the early endosome marker EAA1 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Cells were treated with cycloheximide in serum-free medium for one hour, followed by one hour in complete medium at 4&#x000b0;C. To permit receptor internalization, cells were warmed to 37&#x000b0;C with fresh complete medium for 15 minutes. Examination of NeuNT expressing cells revealed that ErbB2 and EAA1 were co-localized in the early endosome, indicating rapid down-regulation of ErbB2 from the cell surface (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). In contrast to these observations, the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant could not be detected in the endosomal compartment.</p><p id="P10">To confirm that lack of detectable ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 receptor in the endosomal compartment was due to defect in down-regulation from the cell surface, we performed a biotin labeling of cell surface proteins and measured the percentage of internalized ErbB2 that was protected from proteolytic degradation (see Material and Methods). Consistent with the rapid internalization of NeuNT in the endosomal compartment, a significant percentage of ErbB2 was protected 60 minutes after shifting the cells to the permissive temperature for sorting. By contrast only a small proportion of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant was internalized (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B and 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Another indication of altered trafficking for ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived variant stem from the observation that mammary tumor cell lines derived from either transgenic mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) or NMuMG cells expressing the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 isoform are resistant to the anti-ErbB2 therapeutic T-DM1 antibody&#x02013;drug conjugate whereas control cells expressing the wild-type ErbB2 were highly sensitive to T-DM1 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D and 3E</xref>). Given that T-DM1 drug delivery requires internalization, the inability of T-DM1 to kill these the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 expressing likely reflects it inability to be internalized <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Collectively these observations demonstrate that the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 is primarily a cell surface receptor that is not efficiently internalized and also indicate that expression of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 isoform may confer resistance to T-DM1.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Mammary specific expression of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 isoform results in the rapid induction of metastatic breast cancers</title><p id="P12">To directly evaluate the oncogenic potential of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 isoform in the mammary epithelium, we placed the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 under the transcriptional control of the tetracycline response element and crossed these strains of FVB mice to a separate FVB strain expressing the Reverse Tetracycline Trans activator (rtTA) under the transcriptional control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (MMTV) <sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. To facilitate detection of transgene expressers, we placed an IRES EGFP expression cassette downstream of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 cDNA (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In this manner, we can induce expression of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 in the mammary epithelium by the addition of doxycycline to the drinking water. Of the initial 7 independent founder lines, 2 independent the founder strains could be induced to express elevated levels of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 isoform upon doxycycline administration (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3A and S3B</xref>). Using RT-PCR analyses, we show that ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 expression is primarily restricted to the mammary and salivary glands (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig S4</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To further characterize the kinetics of tumor onset in the inducible ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16, we generated cohorts of female mice from two of these independent strains and monitored tumor induction following addition of doxycycline to drinking water. Groups were unblinded throughout the study, and a target sample size of 20 per group was chosen to ensure sufficient statistical power. The results revealed that in contrast to MMTV/ErbB2 strain that developed focal mammary tumors after long latency period (T50=280 days) <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, both inducible ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 strains rapidly induced multifocal mammary tumors with an extremely short latency period (T50=10 and 28 days) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Additionally, ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 tumors frequently gave rise to metastatic lesions in the lung in a majority of tumor bearing animals (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C&#x02013;D</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Histological analyses of these tumors revealed that that the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 possessed tumor pathology that is distinct from those expressing the <italic>erbB2</italic> proto-oncogene (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A and 5C</xref>). Using trichrome staining, which stains for collagen deposition, we confirmed that ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors possess much higher levels of matrix deposition than the comparable ErbB2 tumors (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B and 5D</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To further evaluate whether the observed pathological differences between the two ErbB2 tumor models was due to different cellular origin, we next stained both full length and the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors with either luminal (cytokeratin 8) or basal keratin (cytokeratin 14, 6 and 5) markers. In contrast to tumors expressing full length ErbB2 that were uniformly positive for Keratin 8 marker and negative for any of the basal keratin markers, the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors stained positive for both luminal and basal keratins (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5A</xref>). Indeed, co-staining with different keratin markers revealed a diversity of cells that co-expressed both basal and luminal keratin markers. (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5B</xref>). Collectively these observations argue that in contrast to ErbB2 derived tumors, mammary epithelial expression of ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 results in rapid induction metastatic mammary tumors that possess a high degree of intra-tumoral heterogeneity.</p><p id="P16">To further establish the critical importance of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 as major oncogenic driver in mammary tumorigenesis, we next determined whether withdrawal of doxycycline from the drinking water in ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 tumor bearing mice would result in tumor regression. The results showed that removal of doxycycline from tumor-bearing animals resulted in rapid regression of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors. However after a variable tumor-free period, focal mammary tumors reappeared (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6A</xref>). Molecular and pathological analyses of these recurrent tumors revealed that exhibited EMT phenotype (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6C</xref>) that was further correlated with reduced expression of the epithelial marker E-Cadherin and complete loss of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 transgene expression (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6B</xref>). Thus like our previous cell culture data (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), these observations indicate that sustained expression of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 is required to maintain the transformed state.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors exhibit unique signaling and transcriptional profiles due to activation of transcription factor network</title><p id="P17">To further elucidate the molecular basis for the potent transforming ability of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 isoform we performed both RPPA and immunoblot analyses on a number of downstream signaling pathways. Despite the constitutive dimerization of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 receptor <sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, the levels of tyrosine phosphorylated ErbB2, EGFR and ErbB3 were impaired by comparison ErbB2 tumors (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Conversely, the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors exhibited a profound activation of p38 and c-Src family kinases compared to the tumors expressing the ErbB2 receptor (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Another important set of phosphorylated proteins that were clearly activated by RPPA as measured by the phosphorylation status in the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors were a number of transcription factors, including Stat-3, YB-1, Smad-2 and HIF1&#x003b1; (<xref rid="SD7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7</xref>). To confirm that activation status of this transcription factor network in the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 class of mammary tumors, we performed immunoblot analyses with phospho-specific antibodies directed against each of these transcription factors. Consistent with RPPA analyses, the results showed that although there was no absolute increase in the levels in these transcription factors, the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors exhibited a dramatic elevation in activation status of these key transcription factors (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The observations outlined above indicate that the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors have pathological and molecular features that are distinct from tumors induced by the ErbB2 receptor. To further explore the molecular basis for the striking differences between these closely related ErbB2 receptors, we performed gene expression profiling on 8 independent tumors from either the wild-type ErbB2 or the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 strains using the Agilent platform. Consistent with the molecular and pathological analyses, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles revealed that the ErbB2&#x00394;16 tumors co-clustered and could be readily distinguished from their ErbB2 counterparts (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Given that our RPPA data indicated that ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 selectively activated Stat3, Smad2 and HIF-1&#x003b1; transcription factors, we next evaluated whether differential gene expression profiles between two ErbB2 tumor subtypes could be due to selective activation of this transcriptional factor network. To accomplish this, we determined whether known target genes of these transcription factors were selectively up-regulated in the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors. The results of these analyses confirmed that differential gene expression profile exhibited by the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors can in part, be accounted for by activation of this transcriptional network (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Target genes downstream of Smad-2 (p=0.0019), HIF1&#x003b1; (p=0.014) and Stat3 (p=0.008) were significantly enriched in ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 samples (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B, 7C, and 7D</xref>). Notably, expression of Stat3 target genes such interferon &#x003b3; and Cxcl10 that have implicated in regulation of tumor immune microenvironment were dramatically up-regulated in the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors. Similarly, selective up-regulation of Smad-2 targets such TGF &#x003b2; superfamily was also observed in the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumor setting (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). In addition, transcription factors Snail1 and Twist1 that are also targets of Smad-2 and HIF1&#x003b1; in ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 tumors. Interestingly, these latter transcription factors are thought to play a critical role in EMT process <sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.

Additionally, we show that the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 expression is both sufficient and necessary for the maintenance of the transformed phenotype (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6</xref>). Specifically, we demonstrate that in contrast to another oncogenic ErbB2 mutant (NeuNT), the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 isoform is constitutively localized to the plasma membrane compartment (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Consistent with the unique properties of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16, mammary specific expression of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 resulted in rapid induction of multifocal metastatic mammary tumors that possessed molecular and pathological features that were distinct from the conventional MMTV ErbB2 models. These features include high levels of intra-tumoral heterogeneity that is characterized by co-expression of both luminal and basal keratins and is reflected at the molecular level by a distinct gene expression profile (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Although a number of studies have detected the presence of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant in both established breast cancer cell lines and primary breast cancers (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, the precise role of this variant in ErbB2-induced tumor progression was unclear. Using NMuMG immortalized mammary epithelial cell model, we demonstrate that elevated expression of wild-type ErbB2 is not sufficient to drive morphological transformation of this immortalized mammary epithelial cell line (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2</xref>). By contrast, expression of the activated ErbB2 (NT mutation) or the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 form was sufficient to drive the tumorigenic conversion of NMuMG cells (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2</xref>). Furthermore, expression of wild-type ErbB2 in the context of an ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16-driven tumor is incapable of maintaining transformation following loss of ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 expression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). These observations indicate that at least in this immortalized cell system, the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 is the major oncogenic driver.</p><p id="P21">The potent transforming property of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 isoform were further correlated with constitutive localization to the plasma membrane. By contrast, other activated versions of ErbB2 (NeuNT) are rapidly down-regulated from the cell surface (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and 3B</xref>). The difference in receptor trafficking in ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 tumors may account for the distinct signaling output from the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 receptor. In this regard, it has been reported that the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant is specifically associated within a membrane compartment harboring c-Src <sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Another important consequence of the differential trafficking properties of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant, is that tumor cells expressing this variant are highly resistant to T-DM1 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C and 3D</xref>). Because the biological activity of Trastuzumab-drug conjugate is dependent on its ability to be internalized to release the drug toxin <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, the inability T-DM1 to kill the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant expressing tumor cells reflects its inability to be efficient internalized.

In agreement with these observations, a transgenic line expressing the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant with constitutive MMTV promoter rapidly developed mammary tumors <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</sup> However, detailed molecular and pathological analyses of mammary tumors were not reported.</p><p id="P23">Another distinct feature of these the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 expressing tumors is that they have several unique pathological features, including major deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) and co-expression of both luminal and basal keratin markers (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5</xref>). The dense ECM depositions observed in the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors was further correlated with the metastatic dissemination to the lung (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C&#x02013;5D</xref>). In many respects, this ECM deposition phenotype resembles high breast density that is a known risk factor for development of breast cancer <sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.

These findings indicate that the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived mammary tumors exhibit a high degree of intra-tumoral heterogeneity comprising of mixed cell lineages, whereas MMTV wild-type ErbB2 tumors are comprised of a uniform luminal cell type.</p><p id="P25">The ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors also exhibited a profound difference in signaling pathways activated compared to their full-length counterparts. Using RPPA and immunoblot analyses (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref rid="SD7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7</xref>), we demonstrate that the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors exhibit reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 and its heterodimer partners EGFR and ErbB3 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) and elevated activation c-Src family of tyrosine kinases and activation of p38 kinase (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>) compared to ErbB2 derived tumors. These analyses also revealed that ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 dependent signaling was responsible for activation of number of key transcription factors including Stat3, Smad2, YB-1 and HIF1&#x003b1; (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Activation of these transcription factor networks has been implicated in regulating EMT process that is involved in breast cancer stem cell renewal <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. Consistent with these biochemical analyses, analyses of the gene expression profiles of ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors revealed that many of the known target genes of this transcriptional network are selectively up-regulated in ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Critically, comparison of the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 transcriptional signature to the human data sets revealed that they align with basal category of human breast cancers that have particularly bad outcome (<xref rid="SD9" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S9</xref>).</p><p id="P26">One important set of Stat3 target genes that are up-regulated in the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 tumors, such as interferon &#x003b3; and Cxcl10, are important modulators of immune micro-environment (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Given that activation of Stat3 is primarily in the tumor epithelium, these Stat3 dependent cytokines are acting in a paracrine fashion to promote immune infiltration (<xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8</xref>). In this regard, it is noteworthy that mammary tumor specific disruption of Stat3 in an ErbB2 model results in a decrease in infiltrating macrophages due to down-regulation of a number of Stat3 dependent inflammatory cytokines <sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the loss of an inflammatory tumor microenvironment is associated with a dramatic decrease in ErbB2 dependent metastasis <sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Indeed, the increase in spontaneous metastasis observed in ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 derived tumors (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) may be due to enhanced inflammatory tumor immune microenvironment. In addition to modulating macrophage infiltration, our recent studies have indicated that epithelial activation Stat3 plays a critical role in maintaining an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. For example, mammary epithelial deletion of Stat3 in PyV mT model results in rapid immune-mediated clearance of emerging PyV mT tumors <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Collectively, these observations argue that the potent transforming properties of ErbB2&#x00394;16 variant is due to its impact on the tumor immune microenvironment.</p><p id="P27">Recent studies have suggested that the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant may play an important role in biological effects of ErBB2 targeted therapies, such as the anti-ErbB2 antibody Trastuzumab. In one report, mammary cell lines expressing ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 were resistant to Trastuzumab treatment <sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> whereas several recent publications assert that Trastuzumab treatment can eliminate ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16-expressing tumors.

In light of our observations that the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant confers resistance to Trastuzumab based T-DM1 raise the possibility that its expression may be important determinant of resistance to these agents. Another interesting finding from our studies is that the ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 variant is also expressed to some level in a number of normal tissue sites (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>) indicating a potential role in normal tissue homeostasis.

(B) In cells expressing stable ErbB2 with inducible ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 (NMuMG-WTiSP), quantitative PCR confirms robust expression of ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 mRNA in the presence, but not the absence of doxycycline. By contrast, ErbB2 expression remains constant. (C) When NMuMG-WTiSP cells were injected orthotopically into athymic nude mice, tumors were detected 3 weeks after injection when treated with doxycycline. (D) Withdrawal of doxycycline results in rapid and complete regression of the WTiSP tumors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms768347f2"/></fig><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 displays altered internalization, which affects response to therapy. (A) Serum-induced internalization of NeuNT results in co-localization with EEA1, which is absent in ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 cells. (B) Quantification of a biotin internalization assay (C) reveals that while NeuNT is effectively internalized, ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 remains at the cell surface. (D) Treatment of NMuMG-ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 cells with the anti-ErbB2 therapy T-DM1 reveals an innate resistance to treatment compared to SkBR3 cells, which express very high levels of full length ErbB2. Additionally, (E) NMuMG cells expressing full length ErbB2 are intrinsically more sensitive to T-DM1 treatment than NMuMGErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms768347f3"/></fig><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>A transgenic mouse model of ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16-driven tumorigenesis. (A) A reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator (rtTA) is expressed in the mammary epithelium of transgenic mice via the MMTV promoter. In the presence of doxycycline, ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 is expressed in mammary epithelial cells through rtTA binding to the tetracycline-dependent promoter (TetO). (B) Expression of ErbB2&#x00394;Ex16 drives rapid tumor onset with a latency of 28 and 10 days for two independent founder lines, compared to 280 days for full length ErbB2.
