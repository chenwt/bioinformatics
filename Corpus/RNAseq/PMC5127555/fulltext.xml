Here, we evaluated how different microbial species commonly associated with laboratory-reared <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> impact host biology at the level of gene expression in the dissected adult gut and in the entire adult organism. We observed that guts from animals associated from the embryonic stage with either zero, one or three bacterial species demonstrated indistinguishable transcriptional profiles. Additionally, we found that the gut transcriptional profiles of animals reared in the presence of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> alone or in combination with bacteria could recapitulate those of conventionally-reared animals. In contrast, we found whole body transcriptional profiles of conventionally-reared animals were distinct from all of the treatments tested. Our data suggest that adult flies are insensitive to the ingestion of the bacteria found in their gut, but that prior to adulthood, different microbes impact the host in ways that lead to global transcriptional differences observable across the whole adult body.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eisen</surname><given-names>Michael B.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9634-0303</contrib-id><name><surname>Elya</surname><given-names>Carolyn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ludington</surname><given-names>William B.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by MBE&#x02019;s Investigator Award from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the National Institutes of Health Director&#x02019;s Early Independence Award DP5OD017851-01 to WBL, the Bowes Research Fellowship from the MCB Department at UC Berkeley to WBL, and CE&#x02019;s Graduate Research Fellowship from the National Science Foundation.

This suggests that variability in microbial load does not play as much of a role in defining transcriptional response as we had anticipated.

In this study, we wanted to study young adult flies that had been stably associated with a microbe or set of microbes of interest throughout their entire life history. To do this, we inoculated an initially sterile medium with a total five million microbial cells, deposited embryos on this medium and maintained animals on this same medium until the point of sampling (five days post-eclosion). We felt that inoculating the medium once at the beginning of the experiment would most closely recapitulate the experience of flies in the wild. That is, embryos (internally sterile until hatching) and pupae (who lose their association with microbes upon remodeling of the gut and are repopulated upon eclosion [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]) would acquire microbes present in their environment and coexist with these microbes throughout their life history.</p><p>Other studies have used higher inocula for preparing gnotobiotic animals [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], or inoculating axenic flies upon eclosion rather than associating from the embryo [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We wanted to understand how closely our experimentally-manipulated animals reflected their wild counterparts in terms of gut microbial density. We therefore sampled wild flies from Berkeley, CA and compared their microbial load to that of animals mono-associated in the laboratory. In doing so we had to address several potential complications. It has been well established that microbial load in laboratory <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> positively correlates with age [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and thus we wanted to sample animals that would be comparable in age to those used in our sequencing experiments. However, we did not want to capture newly-eclosed flies and rear them to the appropriate age in non-natural conditions, as this would deprive them of the substrate needed to replenish their natural gut microbiome and influence their microbial load [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Our devised solution was to first establish a stable food source (organic watermelon in a clean dish pan, referred to henceforth as the &#x0201c;fendel&#x0201d;) to continuously attract wild flies. We then began to leave various oviposition substrates (pieces of organic fruit) near the bait for 24 hours to allow wild females to deposit embryos. After 24 hours, oviposition substrates were transferred to clean vials and wild embryos were reared to adulthood for collection and sampling. Since our rearing method necessarily involved using a finite number of baits, and we did not know how these baits could impact the final microbial load, we also collected wild flies of unknown age that came to feed at the fendel.

As with the gnotobiotic, lab-reared flies, wild fly microbial loads were highly variable even within flies of relatively controlled age.

Raising flies in the presence of three bacterial species associated with laboratory stocks of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> (two of which are the highly abundant in lab-reared flies), either individually or in combination, has minimal effects on adult gut gene expression compared to flies raised axenically. There are, correspondingly, few differences in gut gene expression between flies raised on monocultures of different bacteria. In contrast, the presence of the yeast <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, either alone or in combination with bacteria, has a large effect on adult gut gene expression, suggesting that yeast plays a more important role than bacteria in shaping physiology of the adult gut.</p><sec id="sec009"><title>Insensitivity of adult female gut to bacterial species</title><p>Contrary to our expectations, we did not find significant differences in gene expression between the guts of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> individuals mono-associated with three different bacterial species (<italic>A</italic>. <italic>pasteurianus</italic>, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>brevis</italic> or <italic>L</italic>. <italic>plantarum</italic>) commonly found in lab-reared <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>. This was surprising not only because of previous reports that these mono-associations had phenotypic consequences, but also because we expected, and confirmed, high variability in bacterial load between individuals within the same treatment group. We believe the most parsimonious explanation for our data is that the adult <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> gut is largely indifferent to the identity of bacteria species that occupy it under laboratory colonization levels that reflect those found in wild flies. But several important caveats warrant discussion.</p><p>First, that there is no difference in gut gene expression in response to these three strains does not mean that the adult gut is insensitive to bacterial identity. Indeed, while the species found in association with laboratory <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> are also found in wild flies, it is possible that the bacterial species that thrive amongst lab-reared flies are not representative of natural populations, and that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gut would respond in different ways to different bacterial species. We also remind the reader that while the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pasteurianus</italic> strains used in these experiments was collected from flies, the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> strains came from non-fly sources (we used the sequenced strains of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>plantarum</italic> from the ATCC and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>brevis</italic> from the NBRC), and there may be important inter-strain differences that this choice obscured. For example, work with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>plantarum</italic> has shown that some strains but not others are competent to promote larval growth under nutrition-limiting conditions [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Second, although the guts of five day old adult females show no differences between different bacterial mono-associations, it does not indicate that their guts did not respond differently at earlier points in development; we may simply have missed a critical period for these interactions. In fact, compelling work from several groups has demonstrated that certain fly-associated bacterial strains make significant contributions to larval development [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and gut physiology [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Third, it is possible that the adult female <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> gut is capable of a differential response to these bacteria, but does so only under different conditions (e.g. different diet, different genetic background). Finally, it is possible that the guts in the flies we sampled were responding differently to these bacteria, but that these responses were not reflected at the level of gene expression. For example it could be that the common metabolic demands of the gut dominate its gene expression, and that the gut transduces bacteria-specific signals to other tissues.</p><p>Nonetheless, we think it is interesting that gene expression in the adult female <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> gut is so consistently insensitive to varying composition and levels of these bacteria under these conditions. There is a certain logic in insulating the gut from the effects of the constantly varying mix of diverse microbes that wild <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> are exposed to on their preferred substrate of rotting fruits, and our gene expression data may reflect precisely such an insulation. This is not to argue in any way that bacteria in the gut have no effect on the fly, just simply that the epithelial cells of the adult gut do not appear to be the locus for these effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Effect of yeast on gut gene expression</title><p>The results from this study reflect a dramatic effect of living <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> in the environment on gene expression in the adult gut. The strong effect of yeast on <italic>Drosophila</italic> physiology is unsurprising, given the important role that fungi play in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> life cycle, especially as food for larvae. However, the fact that yeast have a large impact on gut gene expression despite the near complete absence of living yeast cells in the gut suggests an indirect effect, such as differences in how the host responds to living versus dead yeast (either at adulthood or earlier in development), or differences in nutritional value or other properties of the media due to yeast growth. One obvious possible factor is ethanol. We did not perform a chemical analysis of the media, but it is all but certain that the presence of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> led to significant ethanol production. <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> preferentially oviposit in substrates emitting volatile fermentation products, and they have evolved a tolerance for relatively high ethanol levels as both larvae and adults.

At first glance, these two findings seem to present a paradox. That is, one might think that if the difference between animals is what microbes are contained in their gut and if the gut is not responding to this change then one should also not observe changes outside of the gut tissue.</p><p>We can imagine several ways in which to reconcile these seemingly contradictory results. First, given the repeated observation that different microbial taxa have profound influences on host biology at the larval stages [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we believe that differences in host gut gene expression would likely be observed at earlier time points. If this were the case, differences in response to the conventional samples (either due to species, fungal or bacterial, that were not introduced in our simplified community and/or strain-specific effects that could not be recapitulated by our chosen isolates) could lead to differences that accumulate over developmental time and result in animals with markedly different global transcriptional programs. In turn, these accumulated differences could manifest in several ways. The simplest case is that developmental differences accumulated to result in transcriptional differences in an otherwise physically indistinguishable animal. More likely, it could be that certain tissues are over- or underrepresented in conventional animals versus other treatments (which would appear in our data as either higher or lower contributions of those tissues to the overall transcriptional program). Alternatively, the metabolic state of the adult conventional animal could be distinct from those of other treatments (feeding back on transcription to cause big changes).</p><p>Lastly, we observed excessive microbial growth on the food in the conventional vials and the conventional animals were much more likely to die between eclosion and collection than any other treatment. It is possible that this sort of stressful environment selected for animals that were acutely adapted to deal with excessive microbial growth, which manifested at the level of global transcription.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Our data in the context of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> microbiome literature</title><p>While this study is, to the best of the authors&#x02019; knowledge, the first to look at the effects of individual microbial taxa on gene expression of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> adults, two other studies have proceeded ours in investigating the difference in gene expression between axenic and conventional adult flies [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

Given the differences in fly rearing practices (e.g. diet), microbial content and gene expression measurement methods between our study and theirs, this strikes us as a reasonable level of similarity between the two sets and perhaps identifies a smaller &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; set that is consistent across conditions.</p><p>In another study, 5-day old whole adult flies, reared axenically until adulthood and either left axenic or introduced to a mixture of fly-associated microbes upon eclosion, were pooled in groups of 20, and evaluated for differences in gene expression by microarray hybridization [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

This finding is consistent with that reported in an earlier study looking at conventional versus germ-free flies [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] as well as with studies showing immunomodulatory mechanisms to maintain commensal populations in the gut by silencing downstream immune responses despite immune activation [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], suggesting that the fly detects these bacteria as commensals and dampens its response to them. We note, however, that this study and these analyses were designed to detect consistent differences in gene expression between treatment groups; our data do not speak to associations between the expression of AMPs or any other gene and overall bacterial load or the presence of specific bacteria in individual samples.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Challenges in utilizing <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model system to study gut microbe-host biology</title><p>Lab-reared flies and their associated bacteria offer a convenient and powerful model for studying microbe-host interactions. However, the diversity and composition of the microbiomes of laboratory flies is limited compared to wild flies [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], likely because we have selected for microbes that thrive on the substrates that we use to culture flies in the lab. A consequence of this selection is that the effects of microbes associated with <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> in the lab may not reflect those of microbes they associate with in the wild.</p><p>It is also unclear exactly what it means for microbes to be associated with a fly. Though we generally refer to the microbes found within the fly gut as having colonized the gut, it has yet to be firmly established whether stable colonization of the gut occurs and under what conditions. Analogous to the mucus layer in the mammalian gut, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gut possesses a barrier, the peritrophic matrix (PM), that impedes the direct contact between objects greater than ~250 KDa (including food particles and microbial cells) and host cells [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Similar to the mammalian mucosal barrier, recent evidence suggests that the PM is a dynamic structure capable of responding to pathogenic microbes [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, while it has been established that some microbes in the vertebrate gut dine on mucus protecting the gut epithelium [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], it has not yet been firmly established whether <italic>Drosophila</italic>-associated microbes actually adhere to or subsist on the molecules comprising or associated with the PM. Additionally, flies appear to lack the crypt structures, present in vertebrate guts, that can provide hideout for microbes allowing them to persist during hard times [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. At present, we know that lab-reared flies can lose their microbiota by continually transferring onto sterile food [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The turnover of fly microbiota under these conditions suggests that stable colonization of the gut tissue is not occurring under these circumstances, although it is possible that there are different conditions under which stable colonization could be observed.</p><p>A recent study of wild flies illustrates the importance of microbes to fly biology and highlights the distinct manner in which flies associate with microbial partners. Yamada et al. (2015) discovered that a yeast species, <italic>Issatchenki orientalis</italic>, increases amino acid availability and extends lifespan in flies reared on a protein-deficient diet [<xref rid="pone.0167357.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. They found that lifespan could be extended not just by providing flies with live <italic>I</italic>. <italic>orientalis</italic>, but also by providing heat-killed <italic>I</italic>. <italic>orientalis</italic>. Of note, the authors observed that daily transfer of flies onto sterile medium resulted in the loss of association with <italic>I</italic>. <italic>orientalis</italic>. Thus, there is evidence for flies benefiting from a non-stable association with a microbial species, and the benefit is conferred even when the microbes are dead. This might not be how we typically conceptualize important microbial interactions in animals, but it&#x02019;s possible that these are the most critical microbial interactions for flies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec014"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec015"><title>Fly and microbial stocks</title><p><italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free CantonS fly stocks were reared on medium from UC Berkeley&#x02019;s Koshland fly kitchen (Koshland diet; 0.68% agar, 6.68% cornmeal, 2.7% yeast, 1.6% sucrose, 0.75% sodium tartrate tetrahydrate, 5.6 mM CaCl2, 8.2% molasses, 0.09% tegosept, 0.77% ethanol, 0.46% propionic acid) supplemented with activated dry yeast pellets at 25C on a 12:12 light:dark photoperiod. <italic>Acetobacter pasteurianus</italic> (CNE7) was isolated from lab-reared WT <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and grown on de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) agar (Research Products International Corp) at 30C. <italic>Lactobacillus brevis</italic> (NBRC 107147) and <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> (ATCC 8014) were acquired from NBRC and ATCC culture collections, respectively, and grown on MRS agar at 30C. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (ASQ HI) was isolated from wild Hawaiian <italic>Drosophila</italic> by Alli Quan and grown on YPD agar at 30C (A.
