RNA sequencing technology enables non-biased, high throughput, probe-independent inspection of expression data and high coverage and both quantification of global transcript levels as well as the detection of expressed exons and junctions given a sufficient sequencing depth (coverage). However, the analysis of sequencing data frequently presents a bottleneck. Tools for quantification of alternative splicing from sequenced libraries hardly exist at the present time, and methods that support multiple sequencing platforms are especially lacking. Here, we describe in details a whole RNA-Seq transcriptome dataset produced from PD patient's blood leukocytes. The samples were taken prior to, and following deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment while being on stimulation and following 1&#x000a0;h of complete electrical stimulation cessation and from healthy control volunteers. We describe in detail the methodology applied for analyzing the RNA-Seq data including differential expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). We also provide details of the corresponding analysis of in-depth splice isoform data from junction and exon reads, with the use of the software AltAnalyze.

All the participants signed informed consent forms prior to inclusion. The samples were collected from the PD patients' pre- and post-bilateral sub-thalamic (STN)-DBS neurosurgery while being on stimulation and following a short 1-hour of stimulation cessation. All of the study volunteers that passed the study exclusion criteria signed informed consent forms prior to inclusion in the study (clinical parameters of the recruited volunteers are given under <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>). To control for potential variability in the leukocyte expression profiles that might stem from other factors (such as infections, or other diseases), volunteers were assessed for their clinical overall background and state up to 1 year earlier (e.g past hospitalizations, high fever) and subsequently fulfilled detailed medical history questionnaires. Exclusion criteria for participant patients included depression and past and current DSM Axis I and II psychological disorders (SM), chronic inflammatory disease, coagulation irregularities, previous malignancies or cardiac events, or any surgical procedure up to one year pre-DBS. Potential volunteers that did not fulfill these inclusion criteria were excluded from the study. All patients went through bilateral STN-DBS electrode implantation (Medtronics, USA) and were under dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) both pre- and post-DBS (on significantly reduced dosage post-DBS, with <italic>t</italic>-test p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01), the last medication administered at least five hour pre-sampling.

System software analysis was used for all the primary data analyses including image analysis, bead finding, quality metrics and color calls. The software applications used to set and control data analysis included SOLiD software suite under license agreement. The suit included: Instrument Control Software (ICS), SOLiD Experimental Tracking System (SETS), and SOLiD Analysis Tools (SAT) V3.0. Job management by the Job Manager used the Corona-Lite v4.0 platform. Sequencing was run on the Applied Biosystems SOLiD 3 System. Images of each cycle were analyzed, data clustered and normalized. For each tag, a sequential (sequence-ordered) set of color space calls was produced. Quality metrics were produced through normalization. Two probe sets were used to maximize the fraction of &#x0201c;mappable&#x0201d; amplified beads, read length and sequencing throughput for sequencing of the 50-bp reads. Five rounds of primers (A, B, C, D and E) were used to sequence template by ligation of di-base labeled probes. As the libraries were size fragmented, the set of primers used was specific to the P1 Adaptor. For each library three types of raw data files were created: .csfasta (the sequenced reads in color space), .qual and .stats. The quality values given in the .qual files (estimate of confidence given for each color call), q for a particular call, is mathematically related to its probability of error (p), and its SOLiD q values are similar for those generated by Phred and the KB basecaller for capillary electrophoresis (described in detail under <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>). The algorithm relies on training (calibration) to a large set of control data and color calls for which the correct call is known. In the SOLiD-3 system, the correct call is determined by mapping the read to a known reference sequence. Further details regarding additional RNASeq analysis pipelines are detailed under <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0060"><title>Secondary RNA-Seq analysis: mapping of RNA-Seq reads to exons and junctions</title><p>The analysis stage included aligning the reads to the human genome &#x02014; UCSC human genome version 19 February 2009 GRCh37 (the reference genome in this case, using the database file homo_sapiens.GRCh37.56.dna.toplevel.fa) and generation of base space sequences. Each library was mapped using the Mapreads function of SOLiD&#x02122; BioScope&#x02122; (v1.3) cloud computing software (life technologies, applied biosystems, Carlsbad, California). All the alignment and mapping were done on ordered genomes.</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><title>Tertiary RNA-Seq analysis: exon and junction expression quantification</title><p>Junction mapping was conducted using the Bioscope splice junction extractor tool through cloud computing and exon level mapping conducted using the count tag tool. 2 mappings were run for each sample: 1) exon level &#x02014; to receive exon quantification and 2) junction level quantification. The output of this step included .gff and .sam files. For both cases, merging of count reads that employed discontinuous word pattern search algorithms was performed. The scripts used for mapping are also included in the public Synapse depository.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>De-novo splicing prediction, poly-A predictions and UCSC exon annotation</title><p>Following the identification of all the transcript structural event types by parsing of both the Ensembl and UCSC databases, the cases of intron retention were identified first by searching for regions that span two adjacent exons in at least one additional transcript for each gene. The remaining exons were clustered based on overlapping genomic coordinates (e.g. alternate 5&#x02032; ends or 5&#x02032; start-sites). Each exon was annotated as corresponding to exon block and region number within the corresponding transcript. All possible pair-wise transcript comparisons for each gene were then performed to identify exon pairs that show evidence of alternative exon-cassettes, alternative 3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032; splice-sites or alternative-N or -C terminal exons. All transcript exon pairs were considered (except for those adjacent to a retained intron) by comparing the exon block-ID and region-IDs of an exon and its neighboring exons to the exon blocks and regions in the compared transcripts, and a custom heuristic assigned the appropriate annotation based on these transcript comparisons. This process is repeated when importing RNA-Seq reads to identify novel splicing events. In addition to all de-novo splicing annotations, additional splicing annotations (e.g., alternative cassette-exon, alternative promoter) are imported from the UCSC genome database and linked to existing exon blocks and regions based on genomic coordinate overlap. We have further incorporated alternative Poly-A predictions using the polyA database <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

These ASPIRE dI can be calculated from the comparison of inclusion and exclusion junctions or an inclusion exon and an exclusion junction. The linear regression algorithm (based on previously described approach <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>) also uses the same reciprocal exon/junction features as ASPIRE. To derive the slope for each of the two biological conditions (control and experimental), the constitutive corrected expression of all samples for both reciprocal junctions is plotted against each other to calculate a slope for each of the two biological groups using the least squares method. In each case, the slope is forced through the origin of the graph (model&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;y&#x000a0;~&#x000a0;x&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;1 as opposed to y&#x000a0;~&#x000a0;x). The final linear regression score is the log<sub>2</sub> ratio of the slope of the baseline group divided by the experimental group. This ratio is analogous to a log<sub>2</sub> fold change, where 1 is equivalent to a 2-fold change.</p></sec><sec id="s0080"><title>Analysis of protein binding domain composition</title><p>Identification of protein domains that were predictably disrupted by alternative splicing changes in each clinical state was conducted through AltAnalyze.
