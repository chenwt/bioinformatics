The present study is the first to analyze the mitochondrial proteome in cardiac tissue of patients with DCM to identify potential molecular targets for its therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results</title><p>16 left ventricular (LV) samples obtained from explanted human hearts with DCM (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8) and control donors (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8) were extracted to perform a proteomic approach to investigate the variations in mitochondrial protein expression. The proteome of the samples was analyzed by quantitative differential electrophoresis and Mass Spectrometry. These changes were validated by classical techniques and by novel and precise selected reaction monitoring analysis and RNA sequencing approach increasing the total heart samples up to 25. We found significant alterations in energy metabolism, especially in molecules involved in substrate utilization (ODPA, ETFD, DLDH), energy production (ATPA), other metabolic pathways (AL4A1) and protein synthesis (EFTU), obtaining considerable and specific relationships between the alterations detected in these processes. Importantly, we observed that the antioxidant PRDX3 overexpression is associated with impaired ventricular function. PRDX3 is significantly related to LV end systolic and diastolic diameter (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.73, <italic>p</italic> value&#x0003c;0.01; r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.71, <italic>p</italic> value&#x0003c;0.01), fractional shortening, and ejection fraction (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.61, <italic>p</italic> value&#x0003c;0.05; and r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.62, <italic>p</italic> value&#x0003c;0.05, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This work could be a pivotal study to gain more knowledge on the cellular mechanisms related to the pathophysiology of this disease and may lead to the development of etiology-specific heart failure therapies.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), one of the most frequent causes of HF, is a severe pathology of unknown etiology characterized by impaired systolic function with increased ventricular mass, volume, and wall thickness <xref rid="pone.0112971-Jefferies1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112971-Olson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The mechanisms underlying the development of this cardiomyopathy are multiple, complex, and not well understood.</p><p>Mitochondria are the major energy production sites within cells <xref rid="pone.0112971-Bindoff1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Cardiac energy deficits have been reported in the failing heart, with convincing evidence of the important effect of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development and progression of HF in human and animal models resulting from its central role in energy production, metabolism, calcium homeostasis, oxidative stress, and cell death <xref rid="pone.0112971-Maloyan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112971-Sanbe1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Some studies identify mitochondria as both the target and origin of major pathogenic pathways that cause myocardial dysfunction <xref rid="pone.0112971-Bayeva1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Nevertheless, the mitochondria-specific role and the proteins contributing to HF are unclear. In earlier studies, this organelle has been studied using experimental models and classic biochemical methods <xref rid="pone.0112971-Horstkotte1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112971-Liesa1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These studies usually focused on only one particular protein rather than the whole cardiac mitochondrial proteome, despite the fact that methods designed to enrich and purify the mitochondria represent one of the most long-standing examples of proteome subfractionation <xref rid="pone.0112971-Agnetti1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112971-Imahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Thus, characterization of the mitochondrial proteome could provide new insight into cardiac dysfunction and suggest new molecular targets for the therapeutic intervention of DCM. However, the mitochondrial proteome has not been analyzed in pathological human hearts.</p><p>Here, we isolate mitochondria from left ventricular (LV) samples of explanted human hearts with DCM and use a proteomic approach to investigate the variations in mitochondrial protein expression. Our results identify the overexpression of several proteins involved mainly in energy metabolism but also in stress response and protein synthesis in dilated human hearts. We focus on seven representative mitochondrial proteins with different expressions in control (CNT) and diseased hearts validated by different classical techniques as well as novel and precise selected reaction monitoring (SRM) analysis and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) approach. We find that some proteins involved in the different components of cardiac energy metabolism and protein biosynthesis could have an important role in this cardiomyopathy. LV dysfunction is directly related with the antioxidant PRDX3 expression in DCM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The project was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital La Fe, Valencia, and all participants gave their written, informed consent.

Clinical history, hemodynamic study, electrocardiography, and Doppler echocardiography data were available from all of these patients. Non-ischemic DCM was diagnosed when patients had LV systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction, &#x0003c;40%) with a dilated non-hypertrophic LV (LV diastolic diameter, &#x0003e;55 mm) on echocardiography. Moreover, none of the patients had existing primary valvular disease or a familial history of DCM.

The hearts were initially considered for transplantation but were subsequently deemed unsuitable either because of blood type or size incompatibility. The cause of death was cerebrovascular or motor vehicle accident. All donors had normal LV function and no history of myocardial disease or active infection at the time of the transplantation.</p><p>Transmural samples were taken from the region around the apex of the left ventricle and stored at 4&#x000b0;C for a maximum of 6 h from the time of coronary circulation loss. The samples were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until the mitochondrial isolation was performed. Of the 25 heart samples, 16 were used in the proteomic analysis (DCM, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8; CNT, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8). The 25 heart samples were used in the validation to improve the numerical base with a higher number of patients (DCM, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;17; CNT, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Mitochondrial isolation and proteomic analysis</title><p>Mitochondrial isolation was performed using standard homogenization, protease digestion, and differential centrifugation methods as previously described by Imahashi <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0112971-Imahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

Samples were labeled using CyDye DIGE Fluor Minimal Dyes (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. The samples were resuspended in 20 &#x000b5;L of labeling buffer containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, and 30 mM Tris. The pH was then checked in every sample to ensure an optimal labeling reaction (pH 8.0&#x02013;9.0). Aliquots (50 &#x000b5;g protein in 10 &#x000b5;L) were separated into individual tubes and a pooled internal standard was generated by mixing of equal amounts of all samples included in the experiment. A total of 400 pmol of the appropriate CyDye was added to each sample according to the experimental protocol. This experimental design included 2 experimental groups and 8 samples per group, and thus 16 samples were labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5. The labeling reactions were developed for 30 min on ice in the dark and then quenched by incubation with 1 &#x000b5;L of 10 mM lysine for 10 min in the dark. The labeled samples were combined according to the experimental design and loaded onto the same immobilized pH-gradient (IPG) strip. We randomized the CyDye assignments and sample combinations in each gel, which also included one aliquot of the pooled internal standard labeled with Cy2.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Two-dimensional electrophoresis</title><p>The combined samples were diluted with a rehydration solution containing 8 M urea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mM DTT, and 1% IPG buffer (pH 3&#x02013;11 NL; GE Healthcare) to a final volume of 450 &#x000b5;L. The IPG strips (24 cm; pH 3&#x02013;11 NL) were allowed to rehydrate overnight in a re-swelling tray (GE Healthcare). After the strips were passively rehydrated, they were placed in an Ettan IPGphor Manifold ceramic tray (GE Healthcare) and isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed in an Ettan IPGphor 3 unit (GE Healthcare) at 20&#x000b0;C according to the following program: 1-h gradient to 1000 V, 1.5-h gradient to 1500 V, 2-h gradient to 3500 V, 4-h constant at 3500 V, 2-h gradient to 6000 V, and, finally, constant at 6000 V to constitute a total of 60 kV/h. After IEF, the strips were equilibrated for 20 min in 1.5 M Tris (pH 8.8) buffer containing 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and bromophenol blue to which 1% DTT had been added, followed by equilibration for 20 min more in the same buffer to which 2.5% iodoacetamide had been added. SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed overnight as described by Laemmli <xref rid="pone.0112971-Laemmli1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> by using the Ettan DALT<italic>six</italic> Electrophoresis System (GE Healthcare) at 1 W/gel.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Image acquisition and analysis</title><p>After SDS-PAGE, the gels were scanned with a Typhoon 9400 fluorescence gel scanner (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) using appropriate individual excitation and emission wavelengths, filters and photomultiplier (PTM) values that are sensitive for each of the Cy3, Cy5 and Cy2 dyes (PTM values: 480 nm, 490 nm, 500 nm, respectively). Relative protein quantification was performed on AS and healthy valves with DeCyder software v6.5 (GE Healthcare) and the multivariate statistical module EDA (Extended data analysis). The Differential in-gel analysis (DIA) module co-detected the 3 images of a gel (the internal standard and the two samples), measured the spot abundance in each image, and expressed these values as Cy3/Cy2 and Cy5/Cy2 ratios. These DIA datasets were then analysed using the Biological Variation Analysis module (BVA), which enabled the spot maps to be matched and the Cy3/Cy2 and Cy5/Cy2 ratios to be compared. Only protein spots with &#x0003e;1.5-fold differences in abundance were considered for the analysis. A statistical analysis was then carried out to determine the changes in protein species, with P-values below 0.05 accepted as significant when the Students t-test was applied. The gels were then re-stained with a silver staining kit (GE-Healthcare).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>In-gel protein digestion</title><p>Protein spots were excised manually and then automatically digested using the Ettan Digester (GE Healthcare).

The gel pieces were then rinsed with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 50% methanol (gradient, high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC] grade; Scharlau) and acetonitrile (gradient, HPLC grade; Scharlau) and dried in a Speedvac. Modified porcine trypsin (sequencing grade; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at a final concentration of 20 ng/&#x000b5;L in 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added to the dry gel pieces, and the digestion was allowed to proceed at 37&#x000b0;C overnight. Finally, 60% aqueous acetonitrile and 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (99.5% purity; Sigma-Aldrich) were added to extract peptides.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>MALDI-MS(/MS) and database searching</title><p>A total of 0.5 &#x000b5;L of each digestion solution was deposited using the thin-layer method onto a 384 Opti-TOF 123&#x000d7;81 mm MALDI plate (Applied Biosystems) and allowed to dry at RT. The same volume of matrix (3 mg/mL &#x003b1;-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) in 60% acetonitrile/0.5% trifluoroacetic acid) was applied on every sample in the MALDI plate. MALDI-MS(/MS) data were obtained in an automated analysis loop by using a 4800 Plus MALDI TOF/TOF Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Spectra were acquired in the reflector positive-ion mode by using an Nd:YAG 355-nm wavelength laser at 200 Hz laser frequency, and 1,000&#x02013;2,000 individual spectra were averaged. The spectra were acquired uniformly by using fixed laser intensity. For the MS/MS 1-kV analysis mode, precursors were accelerated to 8 kV in Source 1 and selected using a relative resolution of 200 (FWHM) and metastable suppression. Fragment ions generated by collision with air in a CID chamber were further accelerated by 15 kV in Source 2. The mass data were automatically analyzed using the 4000 Series Explorer Software, Version 3.5.3 (Applied Biosystems). The MALDI-TOF mass spectra were internally calibrated using 2 trypsin autolysis ions with m/z&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;842.510 and 2211.105. In the case of MALDI-MS/MS, calibrations were performed using the fragment-ion spectra obtained for Glub-fibrinopeptide (4700 Cal Mix; Applied Biosystems). MALDI-MS and MS/MS data were combined in the GPS Explorer Software Version 3.6 to search a non-redundant protein database (Swiss-Prot 2012_08) by using the Mascot software, version 2.2 (Matrix Science) <xref rid="pone.0112971-Perkins1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, featuring 50 ppm precursor tolerance, 0.6-Da MS/MS fragment tolerance, carbamidomethyl cysteine as the fixed modification, and oxidized methionine as the variable modification, and allowing for 1 missed cleavage. The MALDI-MS (/MS) spectra and database search results were manually inspected in detail using the aforementioned software. In the case of the combined MS and MS/MS data, identifications were accepted when the confidence interval (CI%) calculated using the GPS software was &#x02265;95%. Because Protein Scores and Ion Scores obtained from distinct searches cannot be directly compared, the GPS software calculates the CI% to combine the results of MS and MS/MS database searches. This coefficient value refers to a &#x0003c;5% probability of the observed match being a random event. In the case of the PMF spectra, identifications were accepted when the CI% was &#x02265;99%.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis</title><p>Protein samples for the detection of pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit &#x003b1;, somatic form (ODPA), electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETFD), dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (DLDH), delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (AL4A1), ATP synthase subunit &#x003b1; (ATPA), elongation factor Tu (EFTU) and thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase (PRDX3) were separated using Bis-Tris electrophoresis on 4&#x02013;12% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions.

After reduction, alkylation with 55 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma Aldrich) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate was conducted for 20 min at RT. Next, we added 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 15% acetonitrile (LCMS grade, Scharlau), and, finally, sequencing-grade modified porcine trypsin (Promega) at a final ratio of 1 &#x000b5;g trypsin: 50 &#x000b5;g protein. After digestion at 37&#x000b0;C overnight, 2% formic acid (99.5% purity; Sigma Aldrich) was added and samples were cleaned using Pep-Clean spin columns (Pierce) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.

Three replicate injections (4 &#x000b5;L containing 8 &#x000b5;g of protein) were made for each sample (except 2 samples with only 1 injection per sample) by using mobile phase A (2% ACN/98% water, 0.1% FA) at a flow rate of 10 &#x000b5;L/min for 5 min. Peptides were loaded onto a &#x000b5;-Precolumn Cartridge (Acclaim Pep Map 100 C18; 5 &#x000b5;m, 100&#x000c5;; 300 &#x000b5;m i.d. &#x000d7;5 mm, LC Packings) to preconcentrate and desalt samples. Reversed-phase LC was performed on a C18 column (Onyx Monolithic C18; 150&#x000d7;0.1 mm i.d., Phenomenex) in a gradient of phase A and phase B (98% ACN/2% water, 0.1% FA). Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 900 nL/min by following these steps: 2&#x02013;15% B for 2 min, 15&#x02013;30% B for 18 min, 30&#x02013;50% B for 5 min, 50&#x02013;90% B for 2 min, and, finally, 90% B for 3 min. The column was then regenerated with 2% B for another 15 min. Both TEMPO nano LC and 4000 QTRAP system were controlled using the Analyst Software, v.1.4.5. Theoretical SRM transitions were designed using MRMpilot software v1.1 (ABSciex), with the following settings: Enzyme&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;trypsin, missed cleavages&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0; modifications in peptide &#x02264;3; charge states&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;+1 from 300 to 600 Da, +2 from 500 to 2000 Da, +3 from 900 to 3000 Da, +4 from 1600 to 4000 Da, +5 from 2400 to 10,000 Da; studied modification&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;none; fixed modifications&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;carboxyamidomethylation; variable modifications&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;none; min. number of amino acids &#x02265;5; max. number of amino acids &#x02264;30; ignore multiple modification sites; 3 transitions per peptide (Table_S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112971.s001">File S1</xref>). A pool containing a mixture of all the samples was digested as described previously and analyzed in the 4000QTrap using a MIDAS acquisition method that included the theoretical transitions. Transitions were selected when the three co-eluting peaks (corresponding to the three transitions of the same peptide) had a signal-to-noise ratio over 5 and the MS/MS data matched the theoretical spectrum for that peptide.</p><p>The mass spectrometer was set to operate in the positive-ion mode with an ion-spray voltage of 2800 V and a nanoflow interface heater temperature of 150&#x000b0;C. Source gas 1 and curtain gas were set to 20 and 20 psi, respectively, and nitrogen was applied as both curtain and collision gases. Collision energy was optimized to obtain maximal transmission efficiency and sensitivity for each SRM transition. A total of 42 MRM transitions (3 per peptide) were monitored during the analysis of each sample and were acquired at unit resolution in both Q1 and Q3, with dwell times of 20 and 50 ms that resulted in a cycle time of 1.2303 s. The IntelliQuan algorithm included in the Analyst 1.4.5 software was used to calculate abundances based on the peak areas after integration.</p><p>To carry out this analysis we pooled the samples (four samples per pool). Correlations between proteins were evaluated by calculating Pearson product&#x02013;moment correlation coefficient of every transition from every peptide analyzed for each protein with respect to every transition of the peptides of the other proteins. If the results of 1 out of the 3 assayed transitions were divergent from the other two, this transition was not considered. While evaluating correlations, when 2 or more peptides were measured, the most significant peptide was selected, while the second one was used as a qualifier for the correlation, which was rejected if this second peptide had divergent results. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was calculated as a mean of all coefficients from all transitions from the most significant peptide-to-peptide correlation. When any of the transition-to-transition correlations was not significant, but close to signification, the greater transition-to-transition p value of the most significant peptide-to-peptide correlation was considered.</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>RNA extraction</title><p>Heart samples were homogenized in TRIzol reagent in a TissueLysser LT (Qiagen, UK).

Matsusshima <italic>et al.</italic> reported that PRDX3 overexpression protects the heart against post-myocardial infarct remodeling and failure in mice, reducing LV cavity dilation, dysfunction, fibrosis, and apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0112971-Matsushima1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. These results are consistent with our findings, since we found a significant increase in the protein levels of PRDX3 in the cardiac tissue of DCM patients probably due to its specific role in the attenuation mechanisms of these failing hearts. Although, we did not observe the same tendency between protein levels and gene expression, likely because of a different removal mechanism of this protein in failing hearts; however, the most remarkable finding was the good correlation between this protein level and LV function, indicating that an increased PRDX3 level is associated with impaired ventricular function. Thus, our findings demonstrated once again that mitochondrial oxidative stress is key player in the pathogenesis of cardiac failure and showed for the first time a direct relationship between the level of this antioxidant and LV dysfunction in human cardiac tissue, suggesting that it could be a primary line of defense against this disease process. With the objective to evaluate the causality of this significant relationship, further studies need to be done.</p><p>It is noteworthy that our results are consistent and have been validated by different established techniques and by novel and precise SRM analysis and RNAseq approach. Despite these significant data, more work is needed to fully understand the causal role and which of the alterations observed are adaptive or maladaptive. A promising way to obtain new therapeutic options is to explore strategies based on gene therapy to clarify the mechanism leading to energetic derangement and, moreover, to restore ventricular function in DCM patients. For example, silencing or inducing overexpression of <italic>PRDX3</italic> through gene therapy with the creation of a murine DCM model would allow us to investigate whether LV is aggravated or improved and to develop etiology-specific therapies in HF. In this way, we suggest new molecular targets and all these experiments could be providing a new therapeutic approach.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Study limitations</title><p>A common limitation of studies that use cardiac tissues from end-stage failing human hearts is the fact that there is high variability in disease etiology and treatment. To make our study population etiologically homogeneous, we chose DCM patients who did not report any family history of the disease.</p><p>Moreover, our tissue samples were taken from the transmural left ventricle apex, so our findings could not be generalized to all layers and regions of the left ventricle. However, we want to emphasize the importance of having carried out this study in a significant number of samples from explanted human hearts from DCM patients undergoing cardiac transplantation. This has allowed us to extract the region of tissue that we wanted to analyze, which could not have been possible if the study had been made using biopsied tissues.</p><p>In summary, the present study is the first to analyze the mitochondrial proteome in cardiac tissue of DCM patients. We found significant and reproducible alterations in cardiac energy metabolism, especially in molecules involved in substrate utilization and energy production, obtaining a considerable relationship between the alterations detected in both processes. LV dysfunction is directly related with the antioxidant PRDX3 expression. This work provides new insight into the cellular mechanisms associated with the pathophysiology of DCM and could serve as a pivotal study to develop etiology-specific therapies in HF.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0112971.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p><bold>Supporting figure and tables.</bold> Figure_S1: Representative two-dimensional DIGE gel.
