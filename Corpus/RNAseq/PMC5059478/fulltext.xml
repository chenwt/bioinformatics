We describe the genome-wide landscape of distant-acting enhancers active in the developing and adult human heart, an organ whose impairment is a predominant cause of mortality and morbidity. Using integrative analysis of &#x0003e;35 epigenomic data sets from mouse and human pre- and postnatal hearts we created a comprehensive reference of &#x0003e;80,000 putative human heart enhancers. To illustrate the importance of enhancers in the regulation of genes involved in heart disease, we deleted the mouse orthologs of two human enhancers near cardiac myosin genes. In both cases, we observe <italic>in vivo</italic> expression changes and cardiac phenotypes consistent with human heart disease. Our study provides a comprehensive catalogue of human heart enhancers for use in clinical whole-genome sequencing studies and highlights the importance of enhancers for cardiac function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

Diseases of the heart include a spectrum of adult-onset conditions, as well as congenital phenotypes that collectively represent the most common category of severe birth defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Causes of heart disease include environmental risk factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, common variants with moderate effect sizes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, and rare and <italic>de novo</italic> mutations that cause familial cases with Mendelian inheritance patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In particular for the latter category, candidate gene sequencing has proven powerful for obtaining molecular diagnoses. For example, for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, candidate gene sequencing identifies a clear genetic cause in &#x0223c;60&#x00025; of patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Nevertheless, this approach is by design limited to the coding sequence of candidate genes and fails to identify non-coding mutations. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can in principle detect non-coding mutations and is becoming increasingly adopted for patients with unexplained heart disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. However, early WGS studies illustrate major challenges in the interpretation of non-coding variants, and particularly of rare non-coding variants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In the absence of accurate annotations linking non-coding loci to <italic>in vivo</italic> functions, non-coding WGS findings are largely uninterpretable and, thereby, most cases with non-coding mutations remain unresolved.</p><p>To address the pressing need for a high-quality, genome-wide annotation of functional non-coding sequences active in the developing and adult heart, in the present study we describe a comprehensive catalogue of more than 80,000 candidate distant-acting cardiac enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Enhancers are a major category of non-coding regulatory elements that activate gene expression from a distance in a cell type-specific<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and temporally restricted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> manner. They are hypothesized to play a major role in development and disease, and sequence variants that alter enhancer function are associated with a variety of human phenotypes (for example, refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). We derived the heart enhancer compendium from more than three dozen epigenomic data sets mapping enhancer-associated chromatin marks in developing and adult heart tissue from mice and humans. This catalogue of human heart enhancers can be easily and immediately implemented in human disease studies, and to further facilitate its utilization in clinical studies, we provide confidence scores for each predicted enhancer that correlate strongly with <italic>in vivo</italic> validation rates. We find that more than 2,000 human variants implicated in heart-related phenotypes through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), either directly as lead variants or indirectly by linkage disequilibrium (LD), fall into putative heart enhancers. Anticipating downstream validation of WGS studies, which will likely focus first on regulatory sequences near genes already implicated in disease, we experimentally validated putative enhancers and provide <italic>in vivo</italic> characterization of more than 20 novel cardiovascular enhancers near known heart disease genes. Finally, as there remains a limited understanding of the general phenotypic impact of lost or impaired enhancer function, we deleted two enhancers near heart disease genes in mice. In both cases, we observed loss of target gene expression, as well as cardiac phenotypes consistent with heart disease in humans. Our results highlight the functional importance of enhancers for normal heart function, as well as the potential contribution of enhancer mutations to heart disease.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genome-wide mapping of heart enhancers</title><p>Genome-wide profiling of enhancer-associated proteins and histone modifications such as p300/CBP or H3K27ac via chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq directly applied to primary tissue is a powerful approach for the identification of <italic>in vivo</italic> enhancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Initial application of this technique to cardiac tissue samples established the general utility of the method for the identification of heart enhancers, but detected only modestly sized sets of candidate enhancers due to limited sampling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. To generate a comprehensive genome-wide catalogue of cardiac enhancers in the human genome that can easily be incorporated into human disease studies, we integrated epigenomic data from multiple developmental stages and all major anatomical subregions of the heart. In total, we examined &#x0003e;35 genome-wide p300/CBP and/or H3K27ac profiles from different <italic>ex vivo</italic> cardiac tissue samples, nearly all of which are known to be or presumed to be normal (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for tissue information and data sources)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The sampled conditions include prenatal human heart, major anatomical subregions of childhood and adult human hearts, and a closely spaced developmental time series of prenatal and postnatal mouse heart (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Although the inclusion of mouse samples could create bias towards the prediction of more highly conserved enhancers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>), it allows for better discovery of enhancers active exclusively during prenatal development, a timespan for which there is only a single human data set considered for analysis. To enable integrative analysis across samples and antibodies, all raw data was analysed using a uniform processing pipeline (see the &#x02018;Methods' section, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Because H3K27ac and p300 are associated with both enhancer and promoter sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, we excluded peaks overlapping promoters, defined as those centred within 1.5&#x02009;kb of a gene transcription start site (TSS; promoters and their scores are included separately in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref> but were not further evaluated). Peaks identified in mouse samples were mapped to the human genome (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Merging the peaks from all data sets resulted in a single list of 82,119 unique candidate heart enhancers in the human genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). Nearly all (&#x0003e;95&#x00025;) of the putative enhancers were &#x0003c;10&#x02009;kb in size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>), and most (85&#x00025;) were smaller than 5&#x02009;kb. A total of 3,677 candidate enhancer regions &#x0003e;10&#x02009;kb were identified, consistent with previous observations of subsets of very long enhancers that may form central nodes of tissue-specific regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 2</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><p>Two initial lines of evidence support that this catalogue is comprised of cardiac-specific enhancers. First, gene ontology analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> showed that the identified regions are highly enriched near genes with relevant functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). For example, 11 out of the 12 most enriched human phenotypes represent cardiovascular conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). In addition, 152 out of 170 (89&#x00025;) heart enhancers reported in the VISTA Enhancer Browser, a large collection of <italic>in vivo</italic> enhancers validated in transgenic mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, are identified as candidate heart enhancers in the present catalogue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). This high rediscovery rate highlights the sensitivity of the approach and suggests that most known heart enhancers are recovered by the integrative analysis in the present study.</p><p>Although p300 and H3K27ac are strong predictors of enhancer activity, there have been recent reports of improved enhancer prediction using various additional criteria (for example, transcription factor (TF) binding and DNase hypersensitivity (DHS))<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and/or supervised analysis methods trained on experimentally validated enhancer sets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. To assess whether additional types of data sets or methods would substantially improve enhancer prediction, we first performed a similar integrative analysis using available human and mouse heart DHS and TF data sets (data sets and their references are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Overall, DHS and TF ChIP-seq identify sets of loci that substantially overlap those captured by H3K27ac and p300 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Those sites displaying DHS or TF binding in the absence of H3K27ac or p300 are not associated with cardiac-specific function, suggesting they do not identify cardiac enhancers missed by our integrative H3K27ac and p300 analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c,d</xref>). We additionally found that our unsupervised approach performs with an accuracy similar to EMERGE (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) and EnhancerFinder (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), supervised methods for enhancer prediction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis, using a large number of data sets and relatively permissive criteria for the identification of candidate heart enhancers, identifies a considerable proportion of the human genome (264&#x02009;Mb or &#x0223c;8&#x00025; of the total genome) as potential enhancers under at least one of the conditions studied. However, individual predicted enhancer sequences vary substantially in the strength of the supporting evidence, which includes the intensity of ChIP-seq signal in individual data sets (peak scores), as well as recurrent observation of the same peak across multiple cardiac source tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, top). We hypothesized that these differences provide a means to distinguish higher- from lower-confidence predictions, allowing for rational experimental prioritization of candidate sequences. Such evidence-based ranking is critical because WGS studies identify far more rare and <italic>de novo</italic> non-coding variants than can be reasonably followed up experimentally<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, even with emerging high-throughput methods. We developed confidence scores to assess the support for a putative enhancer based on two criteria: (1) the statistical significance of the ChIP-seq enrichment observed at a locus and (2) the number of conditions under which a putative enhancer is observed (Methods section, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c and</xref>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 3</xref>). For each predicted enhancer sequence we provide a combined score, on a scale from 0 (weakest evidence) to 1 (strongest evidence), reflecting the strength of evidence from all data sets combined. Enhancer usage has previously been shown to be temporally dynamic, with the majority of enhancers not active throughout the entirety of development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Therefore, we have also provided scores from prenatal data alone and postnatal data alone. These stage-specific scores may be more applicable for studies, respectively, of congenital heart diseases, which typically present around birth, and phenotypes, such as coronary artery disease, that have adult onset.</p><p>We assessed the validity and utility of the confidence scores by comparing the genome-wide compendium against the collection of &#x0003e;2,000 experimentally tested enhancers available in the VISTA Enhancer Browser<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Many of the previously validated heart enhancers were retrospectively confirmed to be among the highest-ranking scored loci in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>), and validation rates correlated positively with confidence scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>, Methods section). In total, this retrospective analysis shows that the scoring scheme is a good indicator of the likelihood that a putative enhancer is active <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>As an example of how this cardiac compendium can be integrated into human disease studies, we intersected it with variants associated with a variety of heart-related phenotypes reported in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Including all variants in strong LD with the reported lead variants (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02265;0.8), more than 18,000 sequence variants are associated with human heart phenotypes. Approximately 2,300 of these fall within a predicted heart enhancer, with &#x0223c;900 in predicted enhancers that have a score of at least 0.2 (ranked list and corresponding heart enhancer scores provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>). This includes a variety of loci where protein-altering variants have not been identified to explain the association signal, such as (1) the 6q22 region near <italic>GJA1</italic> that has been strongly implicated in heart rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, (2) the 1p32 region overlapping <italic>PLPP3</italic> implicated in coronary artery disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> and (3) the 15q24 locus containing <italic>HCN4</italic> implicated in atrial fibrillation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). In the case of the <italic>GJA1</italic> locus, more than 200 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) fall within multiple phenotype-associated LD blocks. Intersecting those SNPs with the heart enhancer compendium identified 11 variants that fall within predicted enhancers, including one in a very high-scoring element (score=0.719). This is a number that is tractable to downstream experimental validation. In the case of the <italic>HCN4</italic> locus, the strongest scoring putative enhancer in the region (score=0.313) includes a SNP (rs7172038) in perfect LD (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>=1) with the reported lead variant (rs7164883), and we included this enhancer in the functional validation performed below. Overall, the heart enhancer compendium can be easily intersected with human disease data to identify strong candidates for further experimental validation and should help prioritize enhancer sequence variants found in human resequencing studies.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> validation of heart enhancers near disease genes</title><p>Given the large number of rare and <italic>de novo</italic> non-coding sequence variants that are identified in WGS studies, initial analyses will likely focus on characterizing variants in putative enhancers near genes previously implicated in heart disease. To explore the utility of the heart enhancer compendium for identifying <italic>in vivo</italic> enhancers near genes of interest, we examined 58 candidate sequences in transgenic mouse enhancer assays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. The selected regions spanned the full range of combined cardiac integrative analysis scores and were all located within 100&#x02009;kb of a heart disease-associated gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>). In addition to the close proximity, there is evidence from the chromatin&#x02013;chromatin spatial interaction database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> that most of the tested sites physically interact with the putative target gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>). In total, 22 of the tested sequences drove reproducible reporter gene expression in the developing heart or blood vessels at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>), including the enhancer upstream of <italic>HCN4</italic> that overlaps with a variant associated with atrial fibrilation. This enhancer had strong activity in the ventricles and weaker but reproducible activity in the atria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Examples of additional newly identified <italic>in vivo-</italic>validated cardiac enhancers include elements near <italic>TGFB3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) and <italic>PRKAG2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), two genes previously implicated in heart disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> but without known associated distant-acting heart enhancers. Furthermore, we characterized new enhancers near genes such as <italic>GATA4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>), where several <italic>in vivo</italic> enhancers had been previously identified<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The overall transgenic validation rate (38&#x00025; with cardiovascular activity) is somewhat lower than that reported by previous heart enhancer validation efforts.

To assess the biological necessity of heart enhancers for proper cardiac development and function, we created knockout mouse models for two different heart enhancers, mm77 and mm771, upstream of <italic>Myl2</italic> and <italic>Myh7</italic>, respectively.

For the affected myosin genes, gene expression changes are dose dependent, with heterozygotes having a reduction in myosin gene expression by &#x0223c;35&#x00025; compared with wild-type (mm77: <italic>P</italic>=2.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, mm771: <italic>P</italic>=9.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>, one-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>). We next examined whether these mRNA expression changes result in decreased myosin protein abundance.

In heart tissue from both <italic>&#x00394;mm77</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;mm771</italic> mice, we observed cases of myocardiocyte disarray and karyomegaly (cell nucleus enlargement; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a&#x02013;d</xref>).

In contrast, no reproducible histological or pathological abnormalities were observed in any other major organ system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 6</xref>). These results support that the deleted enhancers are important for establishing appropriate levels of myosin gene products and for maintaining healthy cellular morphology in the heart.</p><p>To further assess the effect of heart enhancer loss on cardiac physiological function, we used echocardiography. Homozygous <italic>&#x00394;mm77</italic> (<italic>P</italic>=0.046, paired one-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test) and <italic>&#x00394;mm771</italic> (<italic>P</italic>=0.026) mice had modest but significant decreases in fractional shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g,h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13a,b</xref>), as well as decreases in ejection fraction for <italic>&#x00394;mm771</italic> (<italic>P</italic>=0.025, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13c&#x02013;f</xref>).

This conclusion is further supported by adult <italic>&#x00394;mm77</italic> mice showing upregulation of <italic>Nppa</italic> (RNA-seq: <italic>P</italic>=8.29 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup>, see the &#x02018;Methods' section) and <italic>Nppb</italic> (RNA-seq: <italic>P</italic>=2.59 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;07</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 9b and 15</xref>), genes whose upregulation is a common biomarker of heart failure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Overall, the loss of either of the cardiac enhancers results in a large decrease of the mRNA and protein products of a neighbouring cardiac myosin gene, which leads to cardiac cellular abnormalities and reduced heart function.

While the strong contribution of non-coding sequences in many human disease traits is now widely recognized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, the skew towards coding sequence in the analysis of WGS data persists because of a lack of annotations and analytical tools to assess whether rare non-coding mutations are associated with phenotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In the present study, we begin to fill this void by generating a comprehensive compendium of more than 80,000 enhancers predicted to be active in the developing and adult human heart. Since these sequences represent functional units with defined boundaries, this allows for the binning of rare non-coding variants for association testing, analogous to aggregating coding variants by gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. To facilitate the prioritization of non-coding regions for experimental follow-up studies, each predicted enhancer is provided along with a confidence score summarizing the strength of the supporting epigenomic evidence. While the present study focuses on a single organ system of major epidemiological importance, the approach described here is applicable to nearly all human organ systems. Thus, we expect that similar resources for other phenotype-relevant tissues will serve as a critical foundation for the analysis of genetic data from many additional classes of human disease.</p><p>Non-coding sequence annotation is a critical first step for interpreting whole-genome sequence data but is generally insufficient to conclusively implicate specific mutations as causal in disease. One powerful complementary approach is through the use of genome engineering in animal models to formally test the importance of a sequence change <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this study, we illustrate how enhancers identified using genome-wide approaches can be prioritized and assessed for normal organismal function. Focusing on two heart enhancers located near disease-associated genes, we show in mouse models how their loss of function results in cardiac phenotypes. While a few enhancers previously knocked-out in mice have the potential to result in cardiac phenotypes (for example, refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), to our knowledge, the <italic>Myl2</italic> and <italic>Myh7</italic> enhancers are the first examples whose loss has been shown to result in a phenotype consistent with heart disease. With the recent advances in genome editing technology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, it appears likely that <italic>in vivo</italic> engineering approaches will be increasingly used for large-scale modelling of both coding and non-coding human mutations. Overall, this study highlights the important role enhancers play in cardiac health and provides a valuable compendium of human heart enhancers that can be easily integrated into cardiovascular disease studies.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Chip-seq data analyses for heart enhancer prediction</title><p>Short read data of published data sets were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> or Human Roadmap Epigenome website (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/roadmap/epigenomics/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/roadmap/epigenomics/</ext-link>).

Resulting mice were crossed into the C57BL/6J strain. All mice and mouse embryos described in the enhancer knockout section of this paper resulted from heterozygous x heterozygous crosses to allow for the comparison of matched littermates of different genotypes. With the exception of qPCR experiments (where entire litters were analysed) and the RNA-seq performed on adult mm77 mice (where sufficient matched littermates were not available), all experiments employed a matched littermate selection strategy. For every homozygous null animal selected, a homozygous wild-type animal from the same litter was selected for comparison. For all postnatal mice, littermate pairs were selected to have matching genders. Embryonic samples used for qPCR, RNA-seq and western blotting were dissected blind to genotype.</p><p>The underlying hypothesis of the enhancer knockout section was that loss of either cardiac enhancer would decrease neighbouring myosin gene and protein levels. Based on the <italic>Myl2</italic> gene-null phenotype previously observed in humans and mice (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 4</xref>), we expected this decrease in gene expression to result in reduced cardiac function and possibly mild cardiac hypertrophy in homozygous null mice relative to matched wild-type littermates. Therefore, statistical significance of results was assessed by one-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for metrics such as gene/protein expression, heart weight/body weight ratios, left ventricular mass and cardiac function (ejection fraction and fractional shortening) comparisons. Remaining metrics were assessed using two-tailed tests.
