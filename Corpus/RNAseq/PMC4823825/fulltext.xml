To address spatial heterogeneity, here we analyse 134 specimens from various neuroanatomical structures of whole autopsy brains from nine DIPG patients. Evolutionary reconstruction indicates histone 3 (H3) K27M&#x02014;including H3.2K27M&#x02014;mutations potentially arise first and are invariably associated with specific, high-fidelity obligate partners throughout the tumour and its spread, from diagnosis to end-stage disease, suggesting mutual need for tumorigenesis. These H3K27M ubiquitously-associated mutations involve alterations in TP53 cell-cycle (<italic>TP53/PPM1D</italic>) or specific growth factor pathways (<italic>ACVR1/PIK3R1</italic>). Later oncogenic alterations arise in sub-clones and often affect the PI3K pathway. Our findings are consistent with early tumour spread outside the brainstem including the cerebrum. The spatial and temporal homogeneity of main driver mutations in DIPG implies they will be captured by limited biopsies and emphasizes the need to develop therapies specifically targeting obligate oncohistone partnerships.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms11185-i1.jpg"/>Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas are diagnosed by sampling a small portion of the tumour.

They seemingly arise as <italic>de novo</italic> tumours in the pons where surgical options are limited<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Recently, we and others have identified recurrent somatic gain-of-function mutations leading to lysine 27 to methionine (p.Lys27Met, K27M) substitution in histone H3 in &#x0223c;80&#x00025; of DIPGs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Despite a low mutational rate relative to other cancers, these H3K27M mutants appear to be often associated with other mutations in cell cycle regulatory genes (<italic>TP53, PPM1D</italic>), chromatin remodeler (<italic>ATRX</italic>) or growth factors (<italic>ACVR1</italic>) (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>Spatial and temporal tumour heterogeneity is viewed as a major obstacle to accurate diagnosis and successful targeted therapy in cancer. Many adult cancers including high-grade gliomas (HGG) show intra-tumour heterogeneity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, which confounds determining the complete genetic landscape when only a fraction of a tumour is sampled. In DIPG, published studies have solely used biopsied or limited autopsied specimens without assessing the full spatial and temporal tumour heterogeneity. Despite the fact that H3K27M mutations are identified in most DIPG tumour samples<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, the homogeneity of histone and its partner mutation(s) across tumour mass is yet to be determined. It is not currently clear to what extent the tumour may be composed of a mixture of clonal populations carrying distinct mutations. In addition, while DIPGs invariably exhibit tumour spread outside of the pons and brainstem<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, there are to date no comprehensive molecular studies of these invading cells. Such infiltrating tumour cells may originate from specific clones present in the primary site, as described for other cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> including other paediatric tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Alternately, malignant cells may seed early during tumour evolution, as recently shown for low-grade gliomas in adults<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and/or may genetically diverge from the primary tumour as seen in metastatic cancer including medulloblastoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, in order to define DIPG heterogeneity, we sought to: (i) determine whether the currently recommended needle biopsies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> robustly define DIPG tumour biology; (ii) infer the temporal order of specific driver mutations in DIPG; and (iii) fully characterize the molecular signature of the primary, regional and distant subclones, and define their evolutionary relationships. Our results suggest that histone H3K27M mutations arise first and are associated with specific, obligate partners involving alterations in TP53 cell-cycle (<italic>TP53/PPM1D</italic>) or specific growth factor pathways (<italic>ACVR1/PIK3R1</italic>), which are present throughout the tumour as well as its spread outside the brainstem.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genomic landscape of primary and extended tumours</title><p>We analysed 134 punch cores from nine DIPG whole brain specimens obtained at autopsy as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Selected punch cores represented multiple spatial regions of the primary tumour and adjacent areas within the brainstem (average of six per autopsy encompassing the pons, midbrain and medulla), cerebellum and various cerebral neuroanatomical regions (average of 10 per autopsy) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1&#x02013;3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).

Surprisingly, samples with oncogenic mutations also included distal supratentorial areas (3/20), a few of which were deemed radiologically and histologically normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1&#x02013;3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 2A&#x02013;E and 4</xref>). In eight DIPGs, we observed K27M mutations in canonical H3.1 (2/8) or non-canonical H3.3 (6/8). In one patient, we identified K27M in <italic>HIST2H3C</italic>, which encodes the canonical histone 3.2 (H3.2K27M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) a novel mutation recently described in one paediatric DIPG sample<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. H3K27M mutations were ubiquitous in all 41 samples with oncogenic content, and were always associated with at least one additional partner driver mutation: <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>PPM1D</italic>, <italic>ACVR1</italic> or <italic>PIK3R1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Clonal evolution of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma</title><p>To decipher clonal evolution of DIPG, we employed a strategy resembling previously successful multi-region tumour sequencing studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.

We used our WES data (70 &#x000d7; mean coverage) to select mutations&#x02014;based on their presence in our and other available DIPG datasets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02014;for further screening using deep amplicon sequencing (&#x0223c;4,000 &#x000d7; mean coverage) in the initial sample set and in other geographically proximal and distal samples (<italic>N</italic>=134). Mutation allele frequencies were corrected for aneuploidy and presence within copy number variant (CNV) regions whenever possible, and subsequently used to reconstruct evolutionary trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 5, 6 and 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Remarkably, evolutionary analysis showed obligate association of specific combinations of at least four primary partner driver genes in our sample set: H3K27M/TP53 and/or PPM1D, H3K27M/ACVR1 and H3K27M/PIK3R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). The association between the histone mutation and obligate partner(s) was invariably maintained throughout all samples from an autopsy brain. This is in striking contrast to adult cancers, including HGG, which have large numbers of mutations and potentially long evolutionary histories resulting in complex clonal structures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. This also contrasts isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mediated tumorigenesis, where IDH mutations are associated with genetic alterations that change over the course of the disease either through partnership with a different mutated gene or through acquisition of additional/different mutations in the same gene during tumour evolution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Temporal tumour homogeneity of main driver mutations</title><p>The tight association of principal driver mutation pairs implies early and nearly concurrent appearance during tumour evolution. Accordingly, in several cases the order of the partner mutations could not be resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). However, variations in the relative allele frequencies across spatial samples in DIPG1, DIPG5, DIPG7 and DIPG9 enabled estimation of the most likely mutation order, suggesting H3K27M as the earliest tumorigenic event in DIPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). A clear example of such clonal evolution is illustrated by DIPG5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>) harboring three principal driver mutations (H3.3K27M/<italic>TP53</italic>/<italic>PPM1D</italic>). PPM1D regulates TP53 cell-cycle checkpoint and mutations in both genes have been described as mutually exclusive in gliomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. DIPG5 is the sole reported exception to this rule, providing valuable evolutionary insights. We identified two major clones carrying distinct combinations of driver mutations, H3.3K27M-<italic>TP53</italic> and H3.3K27M-<italic>PPM1D</italic>, indicating the H3.3K27M mutation as the initial event, followed by <italic>TP53</italic> mutation in one subclone, and <italic>PPM1D</italic> mutation in another. This suggests that the early presence of oncohistone mutations promotes subsequent alterations of the TP53 pathway, and that this partner association&#x02014;which is required for full transforming potential in DIPG&#x02014;is subsequently maintained throughout the tumour.</p><p>Further analysis of combined data from our cohort and published genomic DIPG datasets (<italic>N</italic>=130) showed the presence of H3K27M in 116/130 (89&#x00025;) of patients (29 H3.1K27M, 1 H3.2K27M, 86 H3.3K27M, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). H3K27M mutants were in vast majority of cases (111/116) associated with partner mutations, which included the <italic>TP53</italic> pathway exclusively (71), growth factor pathways exclusively (28), or a combination of both (11). Mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> (64), <italic>PPM1D</italic> (9), <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>PPM1D</italic> (1, DIPG5), or other genes controlling this cell-cycle checkpoint (1) were preferentially associated with H3.3K27M. Recurrent activating <italic>ACVR1</italic> somatic mutations were identified in 32 H3K27M samples, including eight with <italic>TP53</italic> pathway mutations. These mutations, as previously shown, tend to favor association with the canonical H3K27M (25/32). In rare cases including one from our dataset (DIPG1), we identified H3K27M/<italic>PIK3R1</italic> association as the main combination of driver mutations (3/111) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). A novel <italic>CTNNA2</italic> alteration was also identified as clonal in DIPG1 similar to PIK3R1. Even if we cannot fully rule out its contribution to tumorigenesis, it was not viewed as main driver as no clear phenotypic advantage could be inferred.

Remarkably, tumour spread was detected in proximal (for example, the cerebellum, 4/8 patients with sampled material) and distal (thalamus 4/4, hippocampus/ventricle/frontal or occipital lobes 3/7) brain locations, and in rare cases in areas with no clinical, radiological or histopathological evidence of tumour (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 2, 3, 4</xref>). Interestingly, re-analysis of the published datasets showed two cases where the matched &#x02018;normal' frontal lobe samples had H3K27M/partner mutation frequencies similar to the primary tumour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Furthermore, clustering analysis of our DNA methylation data showed distant tumour spread to be more similar to H3K27M mutant tumours than to normal brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Thus, molecular designation of histologically &#x02018;normal' brain DIPG specimen warrants more in-depth molecular scrutiny. Evolutionary studies of tumour dissemination were consistent with a mixture of early and late tumour spread. Some sites harbored most of the secondary mutations observed in the primary tumours suggestive of late spread, while others lacked the secondary mutations found in the primary tumour site suggestive of early spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the main driver mutations discussed above, several patients carry recurrent mutations that are clearly subclonal (present in some but not all tumour areas in a patient) and occur at later stages of tumour evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). These include mutations in the chromatin remodeler ATRX (DIPG5 and DIPG9), as well as the activating PIK3CA H1047R mutation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, which affects the catalytic domain of PIK3CA (DIPG2, DIPG3 and DIPG6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). In DIPG3 gross visual inspection of the pons indicated two morphologically distinct areas (Pons 1 and 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Histological examination identified area Pons 1 as low-grade infiltrative astrocytoma (WHO II) and Pons 2 as high-grade astrocytoma (WHO IV, glioblastoma, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Both areas carried <italic>HIST2H3C</italic>/<italic>ACVR1</italic> mutations inferred to occur early in tumour evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). However, only Pons 2 (WHO IV) carried PIK3CA H1047R. RNAseq analyses showed enrichment of overexpressed genes involved in vasculature development and angiogenesis pathways in Pons 2, in keeping with prior studies linking PI3K activation to angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 10</xref>). Alterations affecting the PI3K pathway are prevalent both in our sample set (4/9) and in published DIPG datasets (31/116, 26&#x00025;). Our data suggests that PIK3CA mutations are not essential to tumour initiation in DIPG but may confer localized survival, growth and angiogenic advantage in the areas they are subsequently acquired.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Genomic analysis of autopsy DIPG brains provides a fascinating opportunity to reconstruct the evolution of this deadly tumour, and has important implications on potential therapeutic interventions. Despite the sample number limitation based on disease incidence, this study provides insight into the spatial and temporal evolution of the tumour genome in DIPG helping derive a general model for this disease.</p><p>Our analysis suggests that H3K27M mutations are the initial oncogenic event in DIPGs. However, these mutations are not solely sufficient for tumour formation, as they require, nearly universally, obligate partners for effective tumorigenesis. There is some disagreement in the cancer field as to the definition of &#x02018;driver' versus &#x02018;passenger' mutations. The designation passenger has been used for any variant that is not absolutely essential to the tumorigenesis. However, for the purpose of this study&#x02014;and more generally&#x02014;we postulate three categories of mutations: (1) main driver mutations are essential to initiate and continue tumorigenesis; (2) accessory driver mutations can further promote and accelerate tumour growth but are not absolutely essential; (3) passenger mutations are neutral and do not affect the tumour. H3K27M and their obligate partners appear thus to be the main driver mutations, since they always co-occur together throughout each tumour.</p><p>These K27MH3.3 partner mutations are mostly genetic alterations affecting the TP53 pathway, mainly <italic>TP53</italic> and less frequently <italic>PPM1D</italic> genes. H3K27M mutants also favor association with <italic>ACVR1</italic> gain of function mutations and in rare cases (1 in our dataset and 2 in other reported cases) <italic>PIK3R1</italic> mutations. Interestingly, even if more frequent, PIK3CA mutations, including PIK3CA H1047R, clearly fall into the accessory driver category, since they were invariably sub-clonal in our dataset and in some other reported cases. Similarly, a PTEN mutation was also found in some but not all tumour areas in DIPG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). We can only speculate at this time as to why mutations that ultimately activate the PI3K/AKT pathway appear clonal for some of the component genes and subclonal for others. This may be related to the dosage effect of pathway activation, as the loss of the regulatory unit (<italic>PIK3R1</italic>) leads to increased baseline activity of the wild-type kinase whereas the PIK3CA H1047R mutation has been associated with higher kinase activity and oncogenic potential through cellular reprograming and induction of stemness properties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Further studies are needed to help ascertain the specific role of these accessory driver mutations in oncohistone tumorigenesis.</p><p>Once acquired, the main driver partnership is maintained throughout the course of the disease (diagnosis to autopsy), in all cells across the primary tumour site, and in tumour spread throughout the brain. The obligate partner is not chosen randomly. One speculation about the phenotypic advantage of the gain of additional mutations may be that the partners are selected as those best suited to increase levels of mutant H3 in cells. Indeed, H3K27M mutants show a dose-dependent effect in inducing cellular proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Canonical H3 variants are the most abundant histones in cells and need cell-cycle division (S-phase) for synthesis, whereas non-canonical H3.3 variants represent &#x0223c;5&#x00025; of all H3 in cells and are present throughout the cell cycle. Accordingly, H3K27M mutations in cell cycle-dependent canonical histones may co-occur with alterations affecting ACVR1, a growth factor that induces cell division, resulting in the synthesis of wildtype and mutant H3.1 proteins. H3K27M mutations in the non-canonical H3.3 histone are mainly associated with mutations affecting the TP53 pathway, as these possibly offer evasion from cell death and senescence and provide the needed opportunity for the mutant H3.3K27M to exert its effect over a longer period, effectively reshaping the epigenome and drive tumour formation.</p><p>The previously unsuspected homogeneity for main driver mutations across the course of the disease uncovered in this study indicate that efforts to cure DIPG should be directed at the oncohistone partnership, as other genetic alterations are generally sub-clonal. Our findings further indicate that needle biopsies recommended to orient care are representative of the main drivers in DIPG even if the regional heterogeneity of other secondary targetable alterations, such as PIK3CA mutations, may not be fully captured. Based on early tumour spread, efforts to cure DIPG should aim for early systemic tumour control as opposed to regimens focused on the pons.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Patient samples</title><p>All patient samples were collected with informed consent in accordance with the respective Ethics Review Boards of the Children's National Health System, Washington, DC, USA and the University of Queensland Child Health Research Center, Brisbane, Australia.

For clarity, only mutations selected to be likely oncogenic are shown. (<bold>a</bold>) DIPG5: a rare case harboring both TP53 and PPM1D mutations, which are generally found to be mutually exclusive. PPM1D and TP53 mutations occur in distinct clones and are both secondary to H3K27M. ATRX is also secondary and subclonal. (<bold>b</bold>) DIPG6: while it is impossible to resolve the order of H3/TP53/ATRX mutations' appearance, PIK3CA is clearly sub-clonal and appears in the later stages of evolution within this tumour. (<bold>c</bold>) DIPG2: the H3.1 K27M and ACVR1 main driver mutations are ubiquitous, occur at similar frequencies across all samples, and their mutation order cannot be resolved. Conversely, other accessory driver mutations are clearly secondary in order of appearance, and are present only in distinct subclones.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ncomms11185-f2"/></fig><fig id="f3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Tumour spread in DIPG.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Tumour spread in DIPG2 in the thalamus, cerebellum and brainstem. Tumour extension in the thalamus harbors secondary mutation PIK3CA, MAX and PTEN, which indicates late spread from both Pons 1 and Pons 2. Extension towards the cerebellum is relatively early in the tumour evolution as it lacks secondary mutations found in the primary tumour and other brainstem spread. (<bold>b</bold>) Evolution of tumour in patient DIPG3. Autopsy revealed two morphologically and histologically distinct regions of the tumour, indicated as DIPG3 Pons 1 (low-grade) and DIPG3 Pons 2 (high-grade). Exome sequencing identified 11 SNVs and several large scale CNAs common to both regions. Shared alterations included H3.2 K27M and ACVR1 G328V mutations that are likely the main driver mutations in this patient. The analysis also indicated a clear clonal substructure of the two regions, with 18 SNVs and 1 CNA found only in DIPG3 Pons 1, and 11 SNVs and 3 CNAs unique to DIPG3 Pons 2. Intriguingly, DIPG3 Pons 2 carries the activating PIK3CA H1047R mutation, which occurs early in the evolution of this sub-clone judging by its high allelic frequency. PIK3CA H1047R is associated with multi-potency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and PI3K activation with angiogenesis and growth and this mutation likely contributes to tumour aggressiveness and high-grade features of Pons 2 compared with Pons 1 in DIPG3.
