Here we show that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), via the oncoprotein LMP-1, induces the expression of &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1;, a strong antagonist of p53. This phenomenon is mediated by the LMP-1 dependent activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK-1) which in turn favours the recruitment of p73 to &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; promoter. A specific chemical inhibitor of JNK-1 or silencing JNK-1 expression strongly down-regulated &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; mRNA levels in LMP-1-containing cells. Accordingly, LMP-1 mutants deficient to activate JNK-1 did not induce &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; accumulation. The recruitment of p73 to the &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; promoter correlated with the displacement of the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH2 which is part of the transcriptional repressive polycomb 2 complex. Inhibition of &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; expression in lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) led to the stimulation of apoptosis and up-regulation of a large number of cellular genes as determined by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq). In particular, the expression of genes encoding products known to play anti-proliferative/pro-apoptotic functions, as well as genes known to be deregulated in different B cells malignancy, was altered by &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; down-regulation. Together, these findings reveal a novel EBV mechanism that appears to play an important role in the transformation of primary B cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Approximately 20% of worldwide human cancers have been associated with viral infections. Many oncogenic viruses exert their transforming properties by inactivating the products of tumour suppressor genes. One of the best characterized events induced by ongocenic viruses is the inactivation of the transcriptional factors p53. The mucosal high-risk HPV types, EBV, HTLV-1 and KSHV, via their viral proteins, are able to target p53 by distinct mechanisms. We have recently described a novel p53 inactivation mechanism of some cutaneous beta HPV types which have been suggested to be associated with skin carcinogenesis. Beta HPV38 induces accumulation of the p53 antagonist, &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; which in turn silences the expression of the p53-regulated genes. Here we report that also EBV, via the oncoprotein LMP-1, induces the expression of &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; which is dependent on the recruitment of p73 on &#x00394;Np73 promoter and the activation of JNK-1. The recruitment of p73 to the &#x00394;Np73 promoter correlated with the displacement of the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH2 which is part of a transcriptional repressive polycomb 2 complex. We also show that &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; plays an important role in transformation of primary human B cells and regulates the expression of a large number of cellular genes that encode proteins linked to cancer development, including lymphomagenesis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was partially supported by grants from La Ligue Contre le Cancer (Comit&#x000e9;s du Rh&#x000f4;ne, Dr&#x000f4;me and Savoie) and the Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer.

EBV infects B cells and, in most cases, does not lead to any clinical manifestations. However, when EBV infection occurs during adolescence or young adulthood, it may cause infectious mononucleosis, a benign lymphoproliferative disease. A minority of EBV infections result in the development of several types of human B cell malignancies, including Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Kieff1">[1]</xref>. In addition, EBV has been clearly associated with epithelial cancers, i.e. nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and a sub-set of gastric carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Kieff1">[1]</xref>. The risk of developing EBV-induced malignancies is significantly increased in immuno-compromised individuals, such as AIDS patients and organ-transplant recipients. <italic>In vitro</italic> EBV efficiently infects human resting B cells and transforms them into proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Young1">[2]</xref>. Similar to other herpesviruses, the EBV life cycle includes a latent and non-productive phase, as well as a lytic phase leading to the production of the virus progeny. After primary infection, EBV persists lifelong in a latent state in a sub-population of resting memory B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Babcock1">[3]</xref>. Recent studies led to a model of EBV persistence whereby different viral transcription programs were used within the context of the normal biology of B lymphocytes in order to carry out its life cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-ThorleyLawson1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Hochberg1">[5]</xref>. Eleven genes can be expressed in the latency phases, namely the EBV nuclear antigens (EBNA) 1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, LP, the latent membrane proteins (LMP) 1, 2A, 2B, the untranslated EBER-1 and EBER-2 RNAs, as well as multiple microRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Young1">[2]</xref>. Based on the expression pattern of the different latency genes, four latency phases have been identified so far. Type I latency is normally present in Burkitt's lymphoma and is associated with the expression of EBNA-1 as well as EBERs and miRNAs. Type II latency is frequently detected in Hodgkin's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and is linked to the expression of EBNA-1, LMP-1, LMP-2A, LMP-2B, EBERs and miRNAs. Type III latency is characterized by the expression of all 11 latency genes and is mainly found in lymphoproliferative diseases in immunocompromised individuals and in <italic>in vitro</italic> EBV-transformed LCLs. Finally, type IV latency is associated with the infectious mononucleosis and is less well defined, since the expression pattern of the latency genes may differ in different patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Hochberg2">[6]</xref>.</p><p>LMP-1 is the major EBV oncoprotein and displays transforming activities in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Young1">[2]</xref>. It is an integral membrane protein composed of a short cytoplasmic amino-terminal domain, six hydrophobic transmembrane domains, and a cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Young1">[2]</xref>. LMP-1 exerts its transforming properties by functioning as a member of the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily leading to the a constitutive activation of several cellular signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Dawson1">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Soni1">[9]</xref>. In particular, LMP-1 activates the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) signaling pathway, thus promoting cell growth and inhibition of apoptosis. In addition to LMP-1, other EBV latent proteins, i.e. EBNA-2, EBNA-3A and EBNA-3C, are involved in the immortalization of primary B cells. The role of EBNA-2 is mainly mediated by its ability to modulate the transcription of host and viral genes, while EBNA-3C plays a direct role in cellular transformation by inactivating the products of tumor suppressor genes, such as retinoblastoma (pRb) and p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Cai1">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Yi1">[14]</xref>. Interestingly, as for other oncogenic viruses, e.g. human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Ghittoni1">[15]</xref>, EBV developed multiple and redundant mechanisms to inactivate p53-regulated pathways. Indeed, EBNA-3C is able to alter the p53 transcription activity via direct binding as well as by inducing stabilization of p53 inhibitors, such as mdm2 and Gemin3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Cai1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Saha1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Yi1">[14]</xref>.</p><p>p73 is a closely p53-related transcription factor that shows functional similarity to p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Courtois1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Moll1">[17]</xref>. The impact of EBV on p73 has been poorly investigated so far, although initial findings indicate that, similarly to p53, p73 is targeted by EBV. Indeed, p73 expression was found down-regulated in EBV-positive gastric carcinoma by heavy methylation of CpG islands within its promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Ushiku1">[18]</xref>. In addition, it has been recently shown that EBNA-3C attenuates p73 expression in LCLs by targeting the transcription factor E2F-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Saha3">[19]</xref>. However, it is likely that, in line with the previous findings on p53, EBV has developed multiple mechanisms to alter p73 function. In addition, due to the variability in the expression pattern of the latent genes in EBV-positive cancer cells, it is possible that more than one viral protein has the ability to target the p53/p73 pathway.</p><p>We have previously shown that cutaneous HPV38 which belongs to an HPV subgroup potentially associated with the development of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), is able to induce the accumulation of &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; which in turn alters the transcriptional functions of p53 and p73 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Accardi1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Accardi2">[21]</xref>. &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; is a p73 isoform that lacks transactivation (TA) domain and is accumulated in several tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Buhlmann1">[22]</xref>.

We therefore evaluated whether the levels of this specific &#x00394;Np73 transcript were induced by EBV. &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; mRNA levels were determined in EBV-positive and EBV-negative B-cell lines by RT-PCR using specific primers. Six LCLs expressed high levels of &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; transcript, while no signal was detected in the EBV-negative B lymphoma cell line BJAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003186-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). To assess that the over-expression of &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; was indeed linked to EBV infection, we infected primary B cells with recombinant EBV and analyzed &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; mRNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR. As previously shown, &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; is not expressed in primary B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003186-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Brigati1">[28]</xref>. In contrast, an increase in &#x00394;Np73 mRNA levels was observed between 12&#x02013;36 hours post-EBV infection which correlated with LMP1 transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003186-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). &#x00394;Np73 mRNA accumulation was also observed in cancer B-cell lines, RPMI, upon EBV infection cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003186-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Several C-terminus &#x00394;Np73 isoforms have been characterized, that are generated by alternative splicing (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;, &#x003b5;). The isoform alpha plays a key role in altering the p53/p73 functions and is over-expressed in several human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Ueda1">[29]</xref>.

Accordingly, we observed that the decrease in &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; levels by AS in LCL also led to the deregulation of several genes encoding products that are involved in development, e.g. in neurogenesis and in the regulation of apoptosis in neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003186.s002">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003186.s003">S3</xref>, supplementary material), indicating the specificity of our approach and validating our RNA seq analysis. Most importantly, AS &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; up-regulated genes encoding proteins, which play crucial roles in cellular transformation processes, such as apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA-repair and signaling pathways, i.e. NF-&#x003ba;B, Notch, RAS, and toll-like receptors (TLRs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003186.s002">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003186.s003">S3</xref>, supplementary material). In agreement with the functions of &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; as an antagonist of p53, several p53-regulated pro-apoptotic genes were found up-regulated in LCLs transfected by AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003186-g007">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003186.s002">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003186.s003">S3</xref>, supplementary material). Interestingly, the inhibition of &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; by AS in LCLs resulted in a strong increase of <italic>PLK2</italic> mRNA levels. <italic>PLK2</italic> is a p53-regulated gene and encodes a serine threonine kinase which is involved in cell cycle regulation and cellular response to stresses. Its expression has been often found silenced by promoter methylation in Burkitt's Lymphomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Syed1">[47]</xref>. ChIP experiments in SaOS-2 cells expressing HA-tagged-&#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; demonstrated its binding to the promoter of <italic>PLK2</italic> to the p53 binding site 1, which was further increased in the presence of LMP-1, while p73 recruitment to the same promoter was not influenced by the viral oncoprotein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003186-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). To corroborate the RNA-seq data, we have down-regulated &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; and determined PLK2 mRNA levels by quantitative PCR. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003186-g007">Figure 7E</xref> shows that <italic>PLK2</italic> and <italic>Pig3</italic> are down-regulated in LCL in comparison to primary B cells. In addition down-regulation of &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; resulted in a rescue of their expression confirming the RNA seq data. Another gene that was found up-regulated in &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; AS-transfected LCLs is <italic>KLHDC8B</italic> which also appears to be associated with lymphomagenesis and is often found mutated in familiar and sporadic Hodgkin lymphomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Salipante1">[48]</xref>.

Taken together, these data show that in LCL, &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; plays a key role in regulating cellular genes, the products of which exert important functions in cellular transformation, including two genes, <italic>PLK2</italic> and <italic>KLHDC8B</italic>, that have been previously reported to be associated with lymphomagenesis.</p><fig id="ppat-1003186-g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1003186.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>&#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; inhibit expression of pro-apoptotic genes in EBV-infected cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LCLs were transfected with 2 &#x000b5;g S (S-high) and 2 increasing concentration of AS (0.5 &#x000b5;g, AS-low and 2 &#x000b5;g, AS-high), against &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1;.

One of the best characterized mechanisms of oncogenic viruses is the ability to inhibit the function of the tumor suppressor p53, a transcription factor that can trigger cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to stress or DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Vousden1">[49]</xref>.

We have recently described a novel mechanism of deregulation of p53 transcriptional functions by the beta cutaneous HPV38 which appears, together with other beta HPV types, to be linked to skin carcinogenesis. HPV38 E7 oncoprotein promotes accumulation of &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; increasing its transcription and protein half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Accardi1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Accardi2">[21]</xref> and our unpublished data). In turn, &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; competes with p53 for binding to p53 RE elements, preventing the activation of p53-regulated genes. Although the involvement of HPV38 in NMSC is still under debate, the demonstration that also other well-established oncogenic viruses promote &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; accumulation will further highlight the importance of the event and corroborate the potential role of HPV38 in human carcinogenesis. In this study, we show that the oncoprotein LMP-1 from EBV activates the transcription of &#x00394;Np73, favoring the recruitment of p73 to <italic>cis</italic> p53 element of &#x00394;Np73 p2 promoter. We also demonstrated that LMP-1-mediated up-regulation of &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; transcription is dependent on JNK-1, a kinase strongly activated by LMP-1. JNK-1 inhibition by different means strongly decreased &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; expression in EBV-infected cells. In addition, expression of ectopic levels of JNK-1 in the EBV-negative B-lymphoma cell line, BJAB, resulted in the activation of &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; transcription. Accordingly, LMP-1 mutants lacking the JNK-1 activating domain (CTAR2) did not influence the &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; expression levels. It is well established that several amino acid residues of p73 are phosphorylated by JNK-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Eliopoulos1">[34]</xref>. Therefore, it is likely that p73 recruitment to the &#x00394;Np73 promoter is mediated by its JNK-1-dependent phosphorylation. Additional experiments are required to confirm this hypothesis and establish whether the p73 affinity for &#x00394;Np73 promoter is determined by phosphorylation of one or more specific amino acids. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of JNK-1 in LMP-1 expressing cells led to decrease of cdc2 levels and cell cycle arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Kutz1">[55]</xref>. In our experimental model the inhibition of cdc2 in LCLs by the chemical inhibitor roscovitine slightly affected &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; levels (data not shown).</p><p>JNK-1 could also induce &#x00394;Np73 transcription by an alternative mechanism via activation of the proto-oncogene c-Jun. It has been shown that p73 acts in synergistic manner with c-Jun in promoting cellular survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Vikhanskaya1">[56]</xref>. This event is well explained by their cooperative ability to activate the transcription of specific subsets of cellular genes. ChIP-seq experiments have revealed the presence of AP1-binding motifs in close proximity to the p73 <italic>cis</italic> elements in promoters of genes encoding proteins with anti-apoptotic functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Koeppel1">[57]</xref>. Brigati <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that TPA treatment of Germinal Center B cells, able to induce &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; expression, also leads to binding of c-Jun to an AP1 site which was located on the promoter of &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1;, just upstream the p53/p73 RE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Brigati1">[28]</xref>. According to these findings, we observed that in LCLs c-Jun is recruited to an AP1 <italic>cis</italic> element closely located to the p53/p73RE of &#x00394;Np73 promoter (our unpublished data).</p><p>ChIP experiments in primary and EBV-immortalized B cells showed that activation of &#x00394;Np73 promoter by the recruitment of p73 correlated with the displacement of the polycomb 2 complex component EZH2 and epigenetic changes. The apparently paradoxical finding that EBV infected B cells, despite the increased intracellular levels of EZH2, show reduced amount of EZH2 and lower levels in H3K27 methylation on the promoter of &#x00394;Np73, recalls the scenario observed in HPV16 E6/E7 expressing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Hyland1">[58]</xref>. Hyland <italic>et al</italic>. observed increased levels of EZH2 in the presence of HPV16 E6 and E7 proteins, which correlated with a decrease of H3K27 methylation. The authors explained that this phenomenon was due to an increase in KDM6A and KDM6B levels, two demethylase enzymes, and a decrease in BMI1, a Polycomb1 protein which stabilizes Polycomb 2-mediated methylation. According to this model, EBV is able to trigger accumulation of KDM6B via LMP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Anderton1">[59]</xref> and our unpublished data) as well as a reduction of BMI1 levels (our unpublished data). Accumulation of EZH2 in cells expressing LMP-1 could be a consequence of post-translational modifications that negatively regulate its enzymatic activity. Accordingly, it has been previously shown that phosphorylation of EZH2 by AKT on serine 21 suppresses methylation of lysine 27 in Histone 3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Cha1">[60]</xref>. It has been reported that EBV LMP-1 triggers the AKT pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Shair1">[61]</xref> which is often found activated in NPC and Hodgkin's lymphomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Dutton1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Morrison1">[63]</xref>. Based on these findings, we could speculate that the loss of EZH2 recruitment to &#x00394;Np73 promoter is due to serine 21 phosphorylation. We are currently assessing this hypothesis.</p><p>High levels of p73 and &#x00394;Np73 have been observed in B cell chronic lymphocytic Leukemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Leupin1">[64]</xref>. Although resting B cells do not express &#x00394;Np73, epigenetic changes leading to &#x00394;Np73 up-regulation were observed in the activated B cells compartment of the germinative center of the tonsil. Thus, it is likely that the mechanisms characterized in EBV-infected cells in this study may also occur in different scenarios independently of the presence of the viral oncoprotein.</p><p>To evaluate the biological significance of EBV-mediated &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; over-expression in the transformation of B cell, we down-regulated &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; expression by AS in LCL, and compared the cellular expression profiling with one of the S transfected LCL. Decrease in &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; levels led to the alteration of the expression of cellular genes linked to neurogenesis as well as to the regulation of apoptosis in neurons. These results are consistent with the known <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of &#x00394;Np73 in brain development and in the prevention of nerve growth factor induced p53-mediated apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Tissir1">[46]</xref>. An additional cluster of genes that appeared down-regulated by &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; in LCL is a group of Homeobox genes.

Since both HOX genes and &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; are aberrantly expressed in cancer cells, these findings, if confirmed, could further contribute to the understanding of the events associated with carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Buhlmann1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Shah1">[65]</xref>.</p><p>Loss of <italic>PLK2</italic> expression by promoter CpG island methylation is one of the most common epigenetic events in B-cell lymphomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Syed1">[47]</xref>. It is worth noting that we found <italic>PLK2</italic> gene strongly up-regulated upon inhibition of &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; in LCL. It is well known that <italic>PLK2</italic> promoter is positively regulated by p53. Thus, it is highly likely that &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; induces <italic>PLK2</italic> down-regulation by altering the p53 transcriptional function. For the first time, our data provide evidence for a link between <italic>PLK2</italic> expression silencing and &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; in EBV-infected cells. Our findings also suggest that LMP-1 increases the affinity of &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; for PLK2 promoter without altering its protein levels (HA-&#x00394;Np73&#x003b1;: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003186-g007">Figure 7D</xref> and our unpublished data). It is possible that the viral oncoprotein, independently of its ability to positively regulate the &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; transcription, may increase &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; affinity for PLK2 promoter by promoting post-translational modifications.</p><p>Similarly to <italic>PLK2</italic>, <italic>KLHDC8B</italic> has been linked to lymphomagenesis. Multiple cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma with translocations or polymorphisms affecting <italic>KLHDC8B</italic> have been reported in the same family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Timms1">[66]</xref>, indicating that inhibition of its expression plays a role in B cell transformation. Our data show that the expression of <italic>KLHDC8B</italic> was restored upon &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; down-regulation. According to the well characterized &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; ability to act as an inhibitor of p53, the expression levels of different p53 responsive genes (<italic>MDM2, APAF1, GADD45, BAX, CCND1,</italic> etc.) increased significantly after &#x00394;Np73 down-regulation, leading to apoptosis. Other subgroups of genes that resulted to be regulated by &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; are the ones involved in lymphocyte migration and proliferation, cytokine production and innate immune response. As a whole, the RNA seq data indicate that in EBV infected cells &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; may contribute to the development of EBV-associated disease in several ways, e.g. by inhibiting apoptosis, promoting B cell growth, as well as by modulating host defence machinery allowing EBV persistence.</p><p>In summary, our data underline the important function of &#x00394;Np73&#x003b1; in EBV-induced cellular transformation, unveiling novel links between its accumulation and deregulation of the expression of many cellular genes.

Poly dI-dC (40 &#x000b5;g) was added to the reaction to avoid unspecific binding. DNA bound proteins were recovered by incubating with 60 &#x000b5;l of streptavidine-agarose beads for 1 hour at 4&#x000b0;C and washed several times with HKMG buffer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003186-Gong1">[71]</xref>.

The absence of 28s/18s rRNA was checked on the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer instrument. Five hundred ng of each sample were enzymatically fragmented using 1 unit of RNase III provided in the SOLiD Total RNA-seq Kit, incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes and cleaned up using the Invitrogen RiboMinus Concentration Module according to manufacturer's standard protocol. RNA yield and size distribution were assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument and the Agilent RNA 6000 Pico kit. The amplified whole transcriptome library for each sample was constructed according to Lifetechnologies's SOLiD Total RNA-seq Kit protocol (PN 4452437 Rev.B). To summarize, adaptors were hybridised and ligated to 100 ng of fragmented rRNA-depleted total RNAs followed by the construction and subsequent purifications of cDNAs using successively the SOLiD Total RNA-seq Kit and the Agencourt AMPure beads. cDNAs were then barcoded, amplified with 15 cycles of PCR and purified using the Invitrogen PureLink PCR Micro Kit. Yield and size distribution of the amplified DNA libraries were assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument and the Agilent DNA 1000 kit. After minimizing the DNA in the 25&#x02013;200 bp range, 0.4 pM of each barcoded libraries were pooled at equimolar concentrations prior to template bead preparation, in which the pooled library is clonally amplified by emulsion PCR following the Lifetechnologies's SOLiD EZ bead E80 protocols (PN 4441486 Rev. D, 4443494 Rev. D, 4443496 Rev. D). Two hundred and forty &#x000b5;l of emPCR beads were 3&#x02032; modified and deposited on 4 lanes FlowChip before being incubated for 60 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C.
