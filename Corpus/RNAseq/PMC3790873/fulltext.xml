Our goal is to develop a new biotherapeutic agent in which a lysosomal protein (saposin C, SapC) and a phospholipid (dioleoylphosphatidylserine, DOPS) are assembled into nanovesicles (SapC-DOPS) for treating pancreatic cancer. A distinguishing feature of SapC-DOPS nanovesicles is their high affinity for phosphatidylserine (PS) rich microdomains, which are abnormally exposed on the membrane surface of human pancreatic tumor cells. To evaluate the role of external cell PS, <italic>in vitro</italic> assays were used to correlate PS exposure and the cytotoxic effect of SapC-DOPS in human tumor and nontumorigenic pancreatic cells. Next, pancreatic tumor xenografts (orthotopic and subcutaneous models) were used for tumor targeting and therapeutic efficacy studies with systemic SapC-DOPS treatment. We observed that the nanovesicles selectively killed human pancreatic cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic> by inducing apoptotic death, whereas untransformed cells remained unaffected. This <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxic effect correlated to the surface exposure level of PS on the tumor cells. Using xenografts, animals treated with SapC-DOPS showed clear survival benefits and their tumors shrank or disappeared. Furthermore, using a double-tracking method in live mice, we showed that the nanovesicles were specifically targeted to orthotopically-implanted, bioluminescent pancreatic tumors. These data suggest that the acidic phospholipid PS is a biomarker for pancreatic cancer that can be effectively targeted for therapy utilizing cancer-selective SapC-DOPS nanovesicles. This study provides convincing evidence in support of developing a new therapeutic approach to pancreatic cancer.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by NIH/NCI Grants Number 1R01CA158372-01 (to Qi), 1R43CA117283-01(to Qi and Xu), and New Drug State Key Project Grant Number 009ZX09102-205 (to Qi).

It is usually asymptomatic in the early stages, while frequently invading regional lymph nodes and liver, and less often the lungs and visceral organs. Current multi-modal strategies, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, have failed to improve long-term survival. The current standard of treatment, the nucleoside analog gemcitabine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Burris1">[4]</xref>, prolongs survival by only several months. Despite exhaustive efforts to map the genetic alterations associated with pancreatic cancer growth, few promising drug targets have been reported, and new, effective treatments are urgently needed. Experimental therapeutic strategies include small and large molecule inhibitors of oncogenic pathways, anti-angiogenic agents, vaccination/immunotherapy, gene therapies, and many others, but no clearly superior therapies have emerged.</p><p>In the last two decades, cellular membranes have become targets for anti-cancer drugs.

Little is known, however, of the underlying signaling pathways impacted by membrane-targeted anti-neoplastic agents.</p><p>We have been working to develop a novel biotherapeutic drug that can selectively target the cell membrane of pancreatic tumors and effectively destroy malignant pancreatic cells without harming normal tissues and cells. This agent is composed of two purified natural cellular components &#x02013; a small natural protein (saposin C, SapC) and a natural lipid (dioleoylphosphatidylserine, DOPS) &#x02013; which we assemble into cancer-selective nanovesicles (SapC-DOPS). SapC is a small nonenzymatic glycoprotein present in all normal tissues that acts as a biological activator of lysosomal enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Sandhoff1">[13]</xref>. The functional organization of SapC includes a membrane fusogenic domain and a region for activation of lysosomal enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Qi1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Qi2">[15]</xref>.

SapC enhances degradation of glucosylceramide, sphingomyelin, and galactosylceramide to ceramide via acid &#x003b2;-glucosidase, acid sphingomyelinase, and acid &#x003b2;-galacotsylceramidase, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Sandhoff1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Harzer1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Linke1">[19]</xref>. In patients with lysosomal storage diseases, SapC accumulates along with glycosphingolipids in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Morimoto1">[20]</xref> and it appears that excessive SapC and lipids may be toxic for these cells.</p><p>A general property of saposins is their lipid membrane binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Qi4">[21]</xref> since they play important roles in lipid transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Hiraiwa2">[22]</xref>, lipid microdomain assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-You1">[23]</xref>, and reorganization of biological membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Vaccaro1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-You2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Wang1">[26]</xref>.

This interaction is required for SapC activation of lysosomal enzymes.</p><p>We hypothesized that because phosphatidylserine (PS) is relatively abundant on the surface of cancer cells and tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Ran1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Utsugi1">[28]</xref>, it would provide a tumor-specific target for SapC. In comparison to untransformed cells, neoplastic cells are hypermetabolic and thus produce significant amounts of acid and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) as by-products of anaerobic glycolysis and aerobic respiration, respectively. Hydrogen ions accumulate in tumor tissues and as a result, the mean extracellular pH in solid tumors is lower (pH &#x0223c; 6) than that in normal tissues (pH &#x0223c; 7) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Vaupel1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-WikeHooley1">[30]</xref>.

Expressed proteins were purified on a nickel column and completely desalted with C4 reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). After lyophilization, saposin powder was used and its concentration was determined by its weight. All phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Bath sonication was used to form SapC-DOPS nanovesicles as previously described with minor modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Chu1">[40]</xref>. After solvent removal under nitrogen gas, phospholipids were mixed with pure saposin proteins in 20 &#x000b5;l of acid buffer (pH 5) and quickly diluted in 50X volume of physiological aqueous solution. The protein-lipid mixture was then gently sonicated and the two components readily assembled into nanovesicles. The sonicated nanovesicles can be used after storing at 4&#x000b0;C for at least a week. For long-term storage, stable lyophilized SapC-DOPS samples were prepared with a water-organic cosolvent system. After removing the solvent, dried DOPS was dissolved in 80% tert-butyl alcohol. SapC and sucrose (10 mg/ml) solution were made in water. DOPS and SapC/sucrose (vol:vol&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1&#x02236;0.6) mixture was lyophilized to a powder cake in a freeze dryer (VirTis Unitop, The VIRTIS Co., Gardiner, NY).

To address this need, we are reporting a promising novel biotherapeutic agent composed of two natural cellular components that spontaneously assemble into stable nanovesicles (SapC-DOPS). Based on our current results, SapC-DOPS nanovesicles selectively attack pancreatic cancer by binding to tumor cells and inducing cell death. Though the molecular mechanism of tumor entry is not entirely clear, SapC-DOPS nanovesicles are thought to enter the tumor mass and bind to aberrantly exposed PS rich membrane domains that have been widely reported in cancer cells and cells of the tumor neovasculature. The SapC-DOPS nanovesicles may trigger acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)-derived ceramide signaling cascades to induce apoptosis of cancer cells, as we show in our hypothetical diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075507-g011">Figure 11</xref>.

While our current <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence strongly indicates that SapC-DOPS induces caspase-mediated apoptotic cell death of human pancreatic cancer cells in culture, the molecular mechanism of tumor cell entry and caspase activation remain unknown. We showed that SapC-DOPS related cytotoxicity was much greater in pancreatic tumor cell lines that have greater PS expression on the cell surface. However, different cells lines with the same amount of external PS may vary in their response, as PS levels are likely not the sole determinant of effectiveness for SapC-DOPS treatment.

However, the targeting of the nanovesicles (fluorescence signal) to the tumors was blocked after pretreatment with PS-specific binding proteins, indicating that SapC-DOPS binds with cell surface PS lipids. The SapC-DOPS nanovesicles also targeted pancreatic cell tumor metastases, as documented by fluorescence signal. Although fluorescently labeled SapC-DOPS was detected in the mouse liver and spleen, it disappeared by 24 hours, whereas it was able to be detected in subcutaneous pancreatic cell tumors for over 4 days.</p><p>We demonstrated significant inhibition of pancreatic tumor xenograft growth by SapC-DOPS nanovesicles as compared to control, and significantly increased survival of mice with orthotopically-implanted pancreatic tumors when treated with SapC-DOPS as compared to control. Both of these reflect the significant tumor-killing effect of SapC-DOPS.</p><p>Through these studies, we demonstrate that SapC-DOPS nanovesicles are a promising technology that selectively target pancreatic cancer cells, but not normal pancreatic cells. The reason for this targeting is likely threefold. First, SapC-DOPS nanovesicles directly interact and fuse with the exposed PS rich microdomains on cancer cell surface. Secondly, the acidic microenvironment that favors the activity of SapC is available only around the cancer cells. Thirdly, normal cells do not have as much sphingomyelinase, which results from pancreatic cancer cell membrane &#x0201c;leakiness.&#x0201d; The absence of toxicity and adverse side effects with use of SapC-DOPS nanovesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Qi5">[36]</xref>, as well as their rapid clearance from normal tissues and accumulation only in pancreatic tumor tissues, provides significant evidence of their safety. Continued evidence of efficient tumor targeting and killing should prompt testing against other deadly cancers.</p><p>In our future studies, we plan to investigate the molecular mechanism of SapC-DOPS targeting using several approaches, including RNAseq to investigate relevant genes, western blots to determine protein expression level, and cell lysates using mass spectroscopy to confirm dose-dependent killing pathways. The safety of SapC-DOPS will need be tested on other animal models as we prepare to proceed with further clinical testing of this new treatment. Although no significant side effects were evidenced in our previous acute and chronic toxicology studies of SapC-DOPS nanovesicles in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075507-Qi5">[36]</xref>, we have not excluded the possibility of long-term adverse effects, such as a prothrombogenic reaction.</p><p>In summary, we report a therapeutic nanovesicle approach that uses a unique combination of the recombinant SapC and the phospholipid DOPS. Our data suggest that this combination selectively binds and fuses with aberrantly externalized acidic phospholipid PS patches on cancer cells and induces cell death. Further experiments will unveil more details about this proposed mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0075507.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Orthotopic pancreatic tumor cell injection techniques.</bold> (A) A small left abdominal flank incision was made and the spleen exteriorized.
