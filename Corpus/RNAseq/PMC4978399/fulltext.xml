[<xref rid="pone.0159197.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The parasite is transmitted by a triatomine insect vector, where it is introduced into the host by the feces of the insect as it takes a blood meal. There is no preventive vaccine, and the current drug regimens are highly toxic. The drugs are fairly effective if taken during the early (acute) stage of the disease, with limited utility in the chronic stages of the disease. Approximately 30% of infected individuals will develop chronic Chagas Disease, which can manifest as inflammatory heart disease, and/or gastrointestinal disease leading to megacolon or megaesophagus. [<xref rid="pone.0159197.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p><italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> reproduces clonally, but there appears to be at least one historical hybridization event leading to strains with different haplotypes. The population structure is described by assigning the various strains of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> into six discrete typing units (DTUs) based on molecular markers. [<xref rid="pone.0159197.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] While there is some debate as to the number of hybridization events that have occurred to produce the heterozygous strains in DTUs V and VI, there is broad agreement that DTUs I and II are pure ancient lineages. [<xref rid="pone.0159197.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>DTU I is the dominant strain of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> in Northern South America and Central America. It is believed that DTU I parasites differ from DTU II in many aspects. Those include clinical symptoms (such as the relative increase in gastrointestinal symptoms associated with DTU II parasites [<xref rid="pone.0159197.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and altered ECG [<xref rid="pone.0159197.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]) in humans, differential congenital transmission in a mouse model [<xref rid="pone.0159197.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], differing immune and heart inflammation response in dogs [<xref rid="pone.0159197.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Robust epidemiological studies tying disease symptoms to parasite strain are lacking, although a recent study suggested that the rate of Chagas cardiomyopathy may be lower in countries with DTU I as the dominant strain compared to DTU II dominant countries [<xref rid="pone.0159197.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

The expected progression of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection is shown. Briefly, the parasite invades the cell within 15 minutes of attachment, and is enclosed by a portion of the host cell membrane (parasitophorous vacuole). By 4 hours post-infection (hpi), the parasite begins to transform from infective trypomastigote to the intracellular amastigote; it exits from the parasitophorous vacuole at around 8 hpi. The parasite completes its transformation by 24 hrs and starts dividing. By around 96 hpi, the parasite begins the transformation back to the trypomastigote form. The trypomastigotes then escape the cell and the infection process begins anew. Two independent infections were carried and total RNA was collected at three time points (4, 24 and 72 hpi), from both infected cells and tissue culture typomastigotes. Libraries were prepared and sequenced for each of the two biological replicates at each timepoint. Pie charts show the average proportion of RNAseq reads mapping to the human (gray) and parasite (purple) reference genomes for each of the intracellular timepoints.

While we did not identify significantly differentially expressed genes in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> Sylvio-infected cell at 4 hpi (in contrast with 441 DE genes at the same time point in Y strain-infected cells), we observed a strong similarity between the host response to Sylvio and Y strains of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> at 24 hpi and later when genes that are significantly DE in both infections (and had a fold change greater than 2) are compared. While this observation may suggest that a Sylvio infection is more silent in the early hours of a mammalian infection, more biological replicates would be needed to make such an assertion.

The three genes which move into the top 10 at 72 hpi have pro-apoptosis and/or tumor suppressor activity. The gene with the largest increase between 24 and 72 hpi is tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 10, also known as TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL, ENSG00000121858).

The relatively small changes between parasites may be explained by constraints levied by the <italic>in vitro</italic> infection system, which removes all influences of the immune system, and that may provoke a marked difference in either host or parasite response to an <italic>in vivo</italic> infection. Another plausible explanation is that differences may lie within multigene families which were omitted in this analysis due to the poor current state of assembly of these largely repetitive sequences. It is likely that many of the virulence factors (such as trans-sialidases and MASPs) lie within these multigene families. Using technologies that produce longer sequence reads will lead to a better assembly and annotation, which will resolve differences in multigene families and improve similar analyses in the future. Finally, differences at the proteome level may provide better insights into possible translational regulatory mechanisms not interrogated in this work.</p><p>A unique benefit of using RNA-Seq in the context of this work is the ability to characterize the early behavior of both host and parasite simultaneously, even when parasite RNA levels are proportionally very small during the early timepoints of an infection.
