Direct regulation of 149 DEGs was suggested by strong proximal TCF7L2 binding (peak proximity score &#x0003e; 10) and early mRNA expression changes (&#x02264;18 h).

The major downstream transcriptional effectors of Wnt signaling are the lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF1) and the T-cell factor (TCF) family of high-mobility group box (HMG-box)-containing proteins. These transcription factors bind DNA directly and recruit multiple transcription factors which, depending on the cellular context, activate or repress gene expression (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Thus, the expression of Wnt target genes is highly coordinated and is controlled in a temporal and cell-specific manner, which is likely dependent on the expression, DNA binding and transcriptional activity of TCFs.</p><p>A good example of carefully coordinated Wnt signaling is during liver hepatocyte development. The liver is unique in that amongst all tissues in the human body, it regulates a large spectrum of metabolic pathways and plays a central role in the coordination of whole-body homeostasis. It is critical for protein, carbohydrate, lipid and drug metabolism, as well as hormone and bile production and detoxification (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). To accommodate this array of metabolic functions, the liver displays a remarkable degree of heterogeneity and functional plasticity, known as metabolic zonation (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The zonation of the liver is transcriptionally controlled by Wnt signaling (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and several studies have suggested that the transcriptional co-activator &#x003b2;-catenin is the master-regulator of liver zonation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, what role individual TCFs play in determining the metabolic phenotype of hepatocytes is still largely unknown.</p><p>As a key member of the TCF family of transcription factors, TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2) is unique in that its gene is the most significant type 2 diabetes (T2DM) candidate gene identified to date (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and recently attention has focused on the molecular and physiological role of TCF7L2 in the tissues relevant to T2DM pathogenesis&#x02014;most notably the liver (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), brain (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), fat (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and the pancreas (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In the liver, several groups have examined the role of TCF7L2 in glucose metabolism and hepatic glucose production (HGP). In cultured rat, human and mouse hepatocytes, it has been shown that wild-type TCF7L2 negatively regulates gluconeogenesis (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Silencing of TCF7L2 protein levels in these cells leads to an increase in glucose output associated with elevated expression of multiple gluconeogenic genes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In rodents, Oh <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) first demonstrated that mice with reduced hepatic TCF7L2 levels similarly have elevated rates of HGP and higher fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although a recent study demonstrated that tamoxifen-induced liver TCF7L2 knock-out lowered fasting glucose levels (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), it is clear from the literature that TCF7L2 has an important role in glucose metabolism in the liver.</p><p>However, important questions remain about the wider impact of TCF7L2-mediated transcription on liver physiology. Given the role of Wnt signaling in regulating diverse pathways in multiple cells and tissues, and it's known role in metabolic zonation of the liver, is TCF7L2 important in determining the overall phenotype of hepatocytes beyond the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism? In an effort to address this question a few studies have examined static TCF7L2 DNA binding across the genome and have shown that TCF7L2 binds to thousands of targets spanning a number of physiological pathways in multiple cell types (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). However, global DNA binding alone cannot infer function, and it is currently not known which of these TCF7L2 DNA binding sites are functionally significant and regulate target gene expression and, therefore, definitively affect the cellular pathways that impact the hepatocyte phenotype. It also is not clear what mechanisms exist in hepatocytes to regulate TCF7L2 target gene expression. This is particularly relevant in the liver, where cooperation between TCF7L2 and other hepatic transcriptional regulators could significantly enhance the diversity of the pathways regulated by TCF7L2, and allow for fine control of the hepatic phenotype.</p><p>In the current study, we employed an integrative genomics study to examine the mechanisms of TCF7L2-target gene regulation in hepatoma cells. Using a combination of temporal RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq tools in wild-type and TCF7L2-silenced hepatoma cells, we first focused on identifying genes that were directly regulated by TCF7L2 DNA binding. Proximal binding of TCF7L2 was found to preferentially stimulate gene expression in the liver, and only a small fraction of TCF7L2-bound genes were differentially expressed following experimental reductions in TCF7L2 expression. However, these genes included important regulators of multiple pathways critical for liver cell growth, differentiation and cancer, as well as lipid, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. We also describe the transcriptional partners of TCF7L2 and, in particular, identify the master-regulator hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4&#x003b1;), as a key transcriptional partner of TCF7L2 in the hepatoma cells, particularly in the regulation of metabolic genes. Taken together our data show that direct and indirect regulation of gene expression by TCF7L2 points to a significant role for TCF7L2 in the determination of the hepatic phenotype.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cell culture, adenovirus infection and siRNA electroporation</title><p>Low passage rat H4IIE and human Hep3B cells were purchased from ATCC and used up to passage 30 and 10, respectively. The H4IIE cells were selected for several important reasons. First, it has been shown by many groups that these cells produce glucose in a physiologically relevant manner, a process that is sensitive to insulin and metformin in the physiological range (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Second, H4IIE cells have been shown to exhibit highly similar lipid metabolism when compared to primary hepatocytes (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The human Hep3B cells express wild-type beta-catenin and demonstrate Wnt activity (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Cells were routinely cultured in low glucose (5 mM) Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; H4IIE cells) or Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM; Hep3B cells) media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the absence of antibiotics. Silencing of <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> and/or <italic>Hnf4a</italic> mRNA in H4IIE cells, thereby knocking down TCF7L2 and/or HNF4&#x003b1; protein, was achieved using 100 nM Dharmacon SmartPool siRNA, introduced via Neon electroporation, as described previously (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed using TaqMan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gene Expression Assays (see Supplementary Methods for catalog numbers), and data were normalized to a panel of three reference targets (<italic>Actb</italic>, <italic>Hmbs</italic> and <italic>B2m</italic>) using qbase+ software (Biogazelle, Zwijnaarde, Belgium). Human wild-type TCF7L2 (Vector Biolabs, cat. #1280) and eGFP control (Vector Biolabs, cat. #1060) were over-expressed in Hep3B cells using adenovirus infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50, and harvested 72 h later for western blot and qRT-PCR analysis.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-2"><title>Time-course RNA-sequencing</title><p>Cells were electroporated with TCF7L2 or scramble siRNA in 24-well plates in culture medium for the analysis of RNA-Seq at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 48 and 96 h following <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing. The time-course RNA-Seq experiment was performed in duplicate or triplicate with separate electroporations being performed on a different passage of cells on a different date (see data analysis below for more details).

Prior to further analysis, the fold changes were recalculated by adding a pseudo count of 0.1 FPKM to the Cuffdiff-reported expression values to eliminate unrealistically high fold changes for genes with very low expression in one of the samples. Per time point, a significant differentially expressed gene (DEG) was required to have a <italic>q</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.05 when comparing the <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> siRNA treatment against scramble siRNA. Depending on the question, the set of DEGs was further defined separately for each time point, additively over the early (3&#x02013;18 h) or late (48 and 96 h) time points, or additively over all time points.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-5"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation and ChIP-Seq</title><p>Analysis of TCF7L2 and HNF4&#x003b1; genome-wide occupancy was carried out using specific and internally-validated antibodies. For TCF7L2, we used an antibody (clone C48H11, cat. #2569, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), that has been previously validated by us for use in western blotting, immunoprecipitations and ChIP-Seq (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and, more recently, by the Encode Consortium (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). This antibody recognizes a region surrounding Leu330 of the TCF7L2 protein, which is at the 3&#x02032; end of exon 9 and is common to all known and theoretical <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> mRNA transcripts. It should be noted, however, that only two major protein isoforms are observed in the H4IIE cells, both of which are detected approximately equally by #2569 on western blots. For HNF4&#x003b1;, a mouse monoclonal antibody (clone H1415, cat. #PP-H1415&#x02013;00, R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was selected for ChIP-Seq analysis and was validated using the rat apolipoprotein-C-III (Apoc3) gene promoter. A Myc-tag antibody (clone 71D10, cat. #2278, Cell Signaling Technology) was used as a negative control (Supplementary Figure S1). ChIP-Seq was performed on scramble and siRNA-<italic>Tcf7l2</italic> treated cells in duplicate (for TCF7L2) and each sequenced sample (for HNF4&#x003b1; and TCF7L2) represented a pool of two independent immunoprecipitations, each consisting of between 10 and 20 &#x003bc;g of chromatin. Further details on the preparation of ChIP-Seq samples are provided in Supplementary Methods.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-6"><title>ChIP-Seq analysis</title><p>The 50 bp single end ChIP-seq reads for TCF7L2 and HNF4&#x003b1; samples 15 h after <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> or scramble siRNA treatment were mapped against the rn4 reference genome (including the small <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> exon gap fix as described in Supplementary Methods) using Bowtie version 0.12.8 with essential command attributes -n 1 -m 1 -k 1 &#x02013;trim5 5 -l 36 &#x02013;best (see Supplementary Table S3 for detailed read statistics). We assessed TCF7L2 binding in the silenced cells primarily to confirm that the reduction in protein levels for TCF7L2 were effectively translated to a global reduction in genome-wide chromatin occupancy during the early time-course period. Each duplicate ChIP-Seq experiment represents an independent siRNA electroporation, performed on separate H4IIE culture passages. The two replicates for each treatment met the ENCODE criteria that 75% of the identified peaks be shared (scramble replicates = 87.1%, siRNA <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> replicates = 94.3% shared, Supplementary Figure S2A) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), even when we required, stringently, that any two individual peaks overlap only if 50% of the shorter peak was contained within the longer. Peaks were detected using MACS2 callpeak version 2.0.10.20130306 against a common input sample (merged from <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> or scramble siRNA treated cells) with essential command attributes -bw 100 -m 5,50 &#x02013;keep-dup 1 &#x02013;qvalue = 0.01 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The primary output parameter of statistically significant peaks is the fold enrichment where the enrichment of signal is measured over the &#x02018;noise&#x02019; of the input sample. Replicate read sets were subsequently merged, and all downstream analyses were performed on TCF7L2 peaks called from these merged reads.</p><p>In order to provide a measure of TCF7L2 or HNF4&#x003b1; binding in <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> and scramble siRNA treated cells for all locations where at least one of the conditions had a peak, the consensus summit set for each transcription factor (TF) was identified as described by us previously (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) (see Supplementary Methods for further details and Supplementary Table S3 for essential peak identification statistics). Final overlap of consensus TCF7L2 and HNF4&#x003b1; peaks was defined using the &#x02018;50% of shorter&#x02019; rule described above.

To gain further insight into the direct regulation of gene expression by TCF7L2, we investigated genome-wide chromatin occupancy of TCF7L2 in the control and <italic>Tcf7l2</italic>-silenced cells 15 h after TCF7L2 knock-down. There was an approximate 80% reduction in the number of observed peaks in siTcf7l2 cells 15 h after siRNA electroporation (8446 versus 1573 total peaks with 97% overlap; Supplementary Figure S2A, and Supplementary Table S7). On average, TCF7L2 ChIP-Seq peak enrichment also was reduced by 60.4% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>) across the genome, as shown globally in Supplementary Figure S2B and at selected target genes, including <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> itself, in Supplementary Figures S2C, S3 and S4 (full GEO datasets: GSE53862). The reduced enrichment was not due to lower number of sequenced or mapped reads (Supplementary Table S3), and was confirmed using ChIP qRT-PCR at the <italic>Axin2</italic> gene (Supplementary Figure S2D).</p><p>Superimposing TCF7L2 ChIP-Seq and siTcf7l2 RNA-Seq data revealed that 149 (54.0%) of the early DEGs contained strong proximal TCF7L2 binding sites (TCF7L2 peak proximity score &#x0003e; 10), compared to only 51 (39.2%) of the unique late DEGs, indicating that a greater proportion of the early DEGs are likely directly regulated by TCF7L2 (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). This is supported by the temporal nature of the early gene expression changes; <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> mRNA was significantly reduced at 3 h and global TCF7L2 DNA binding also was reduced at 15 h by &#x0223c;60%, yet up to 15 h post-<italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing only three other genes were found to be differentially expressed. The number of DEGs increased markedly at 18 h, however, and this latency period between the reduced <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> expression and downstream gene target effects suggests a mechanistic link between <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing and downstream gene regulation. The relationship between the TCF7L2 binding and temporal changes in nearby gene expression genome-wide is summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.</p><p>Of note, the TCF7L2 peaks were much more frequent around genes that were down-regulated by <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing compared to those that were up-regulated (lower versus upper half of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), which was confirmed when the running means of peak proximity scores were plotted against the sorted DEG fold-changes (FCs) at each time point (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>); down-regulated DEGs clearly had significantly higher peak proximity scores for TCF7L2 compared to up-regulated DEGs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> also highlights the temporal relationship between proximal TCF7L2 binding and the down-regulation of target genes, as the running mean peak proximity score increases through the early phase of the time-course and saturates by 12 h. This temporal relationship also was evident when average peak proximity scores for directly targeted down- and up-regulated DEGs were compared within the early and late-only DEG sets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

Further examples of potential direct TCF7L2 metabolic genes are highlighted in Supplementary Figure S3 and full datasets are available online (GEO: GSE53862).

Binding peaks for TCF7L2 were observed in intron 3 and &#x0223c;13 kb downstream of the <italic>Hnf4a</italic> gene, and HNF4&#x003b1; also bound multiple sites around its own gene, suggesting the existence of a positive feedback loop on <italic>Hnf4&#x003b1;</italic> gene expression (Supplementary Figure S7A).</p><p>Chromatin occupancy of HNF4&#x003b1; increased following <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing by &#x0223c;50% (2373 versus 3563 peaks in scramble and siTcf7l2 cells, respectively) (Supplementary Table S8). In contrast to TCF7L2, however, HNF4&#x003b1; DNA binding associated strongly with genes that were up-regulated after siTcf7l2 treatment (Supplementary Figure S8A). The difference in HNF4&#x003b1; peak proximity scores between down- and up-regulated genes applied to both early- and late-appearing DEGs (early: 11.9 &#x000b1; 6.3 versus 15.8 &#x000b1; 10.1, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02; late-only DEGs: 9.1 &#x000b1; 5.1 versus 13.2 &#x000b1; 8.7, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.03) (see also Supplementary Figure S8B). The specificity of the HNF4&#x003b1; chromatin binding was confirmed by motif analysis demonstrating enrichment of the HNF4&#x003b1; consensus site (TGRACTTTGVMCYYTG, Supplementary Figure S7B) in both control and silenced cells. As mentioned above, it is noteworthy that the core sequence in the HNF4&#x003b1; motif (ACTTTG) is highly similar to that in the conserved TCF7L2 motif (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>), although outside that core sequence, there are a number of important differences like the position immediately 3&#x02032; of the core where TCF7L2 has a near absolute requirement for A whereas HNF4&#x003b1; accepts any nucleotide.</p><p>Of the total combined 11 793 binding sites for TCF7L2 and HNF4&#x003b1;, 1050 were shared between TCF7L2 and HNF4&#x003b1; (&#x0223c;9%). This is most likely a conservative estimate of TCF7L2 and HNF4&#x003b1; binding overlap since we reserved classifying a binding site as shared to TCF7L2 peaks that contained at least 50% of an HNF4&#x003b1; peak (or vice versa), and peaks were narrow (&#x0223c;&#x000b1;100 bp). The ChIP-seq read accumulations around the combined 11 793 peaks are visualized in Supplementary Figure S9. Integrating TCF7L2 and HNF4&#x003b1; peak proximity scores for the 406 DEGs confirmed that genes targeted exclusively by TCF7L2 (peak proximity score for TCF7L2 &#x0003e; 10 and for HNF4&#x003b1; &#x02264; 5) were preferentially down-regulated upon siTcf7l2 treatment (63 DEGs down, 21 up), whereas HNF4&#x003b1;-exclusive targets (peak proximity score for TCF7L2 &#x02264; 10 and for HNF4&#x003b1; &#x0003e; 5) were primarily up-regulated (9 DEGs down, 65 up) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Interestingly, &#x0223c;29% (116) of all DEGs were targeted by both TCF7L2 and HNF4&#x003b1; (peak proximity score for TCF7L2 &#x0003e; 10 and for HNF4&#x003b1; &#x0003e; 5), irrespective of whether the individual binding locations were shared by the two TFs.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Differential association of TCF7L2 and HNF4&#x003b1; binding near genes down- or up-regulated by siTcf7l2.

Using a novel temporal RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq experimental design, we demonstrate that TCF7L2 regulates over 400 genes in hepatoma cells, and that early gene expression changes (&#x02264;18 h post-<italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing) and a strong proximal presence of TCF7L2 (peak proximity score &#x0003e; 10), indicate that TCF7L2 directly regulates 149 of these genes in hepatoma cells. TCF7L2 is an integral member of Wnt signaling, and a number of the pathways regulated by <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing in our study have been linked to Wnt activity in numerous tissues and cells, including those related to cell growth, differentiation and cancer (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). However, previous studies have focused on the role of the transcriptional co-activator &#x003b2;-catenin in these pathways, but our study demonstrates that TCF7L2 <italic>per se</italic> may be the key mediator of Wnt signaling in the liver. Surprisingly, our data also provide evidence that TCF7L2 plays a major role in the regulation of metabolism in liver cells, especially lipid, protein/amino-acid and carbohydrate metabolism. While recent studies have explored the role of TCF7L2 in HGP, we show that the metabolic role of TCF7L2 in the liver extends far beyond this single pathway, and that the diverse metabolic role played by TCF7L2 is accomplished via interactions with numerous key transcription factors in the liver, including HNF4&#x003b1;, FOXO1, MYC, CITED2 and LEF1. For the first time, we demonstrate that the balance between TCF7L2 and HNF4&#x003b1; levels determines the expression of numerous metabolic genes in hepatoma cells. Taken together our study significantly broadens our understanding of TCF7L2 biology, and suggests that TCF7L2 is a critical determinant of the hepatic phenotype and, as such, may play an essential role in regulating whole body homeostasis.</p><p>A number of studies have examined DNA binding patterns of TCF7L2 in various cell types (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) in an effort to extrapolate chromatin occupancy to transcriptional activity and, thus, physiological function. While these studies have provided important insights into the potential mechanistic role of TCF7L2 in various cell-types, no study has systematically examined the functional significance of genome-wide TCF7L2 DNA binding on global transcription. To address this, we used a novel temporal RNA- and ChIP-Seq approach to track gene expression changes following transient silencing of <italic>Tcf7l2</italic>. A reduction in <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> mRNA and protein expression, as well as a global reduction in TCF7L2 chromatin occupancy, led to a time-dependent change in the expression of over 400 genes, and we first set out to determine which of these may represent direct TCF7L2 targets. A total of 149 genes that were found to be differentially expressed up to and including 18 h after silencing also had a strong proximal presence of TCF7L2 (defined as a peak proximity score &#x0003e; 10), suggesting direct regulation by TCF7L2.</p><p>An important observation from our analysis is that wild-type TCF7L2 appears to primarily act to induce gene expression in hepatoma cells. This was apparent after overlaying genome-wide TCF7L2 binding peaks with siRNA-<italic>Tcf7l2</italic> mediated changes in gene expression. We observed a clear increase in the presence of proximal TCF7L2 ChIP-Seq peaks near genes that were down-regulated by <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing, whereas up-regulated genes were less enriched for proximal TCF7L2 binding. While this is a simplistic view of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin mediated transcription, because TCF7L2 cooperates with &#x003b2;-catenin and other transcription factors to regulate target gene expression, recent evidence indicates that TCF7L2 is a predominant mediator of Wnt-mediated transcription and that &#x003b2;-catenin is bound exclusively by TCFs (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Of note, TCF7L2 binding is not restricted to proximal promoter regions. However, what role relatively distal binding plays in the regulation of gene expression by TCF7L2 is currently unknown. A very recent study suggests that for some transcription factors, proximal and distal binding events may regulate completely different biological processes (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Our temporal RNA-Seq IPA pathway analyses indicated that early and more directly regulated DEGs tended to be related to cell growth, differentiation and cancer pathways in the hepatoma cells, which is consistent with the role of Wnt signaling in these developmental pathways. As an example of this direct gene regulation by TCF7L2, the classic Wnt target genes <italic>Lef1</italic> and <italic>Axin2</italic> demonstrated early changes in gene expression following <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing, and were bound proximally by TCF7L2. Further, maximal reductions in the expression of <italic>Lef1</italic> and <italic>Axin2</italic> mirrored precisely the maximal reduction in <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> expression and began to recover as <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> expression approached levels observed in scramble-treated cells. We also highlight similar effects at the ornithine aminotransferase (<italic>Oat</italic>) and liver-specific glycogen synthase (<italic>Gys2</italic>) genes, indicating that these metabolic genes also are direct TCF7L2-regulated genes in hepatoma cells.</p><p>It is apparent from our study that TCF7L2 has an important and diverse molecular role in hepatoma cells, and that it regulates an array of pathways essential for hepatocyte physiology. Performing IPA analysis on all 406 DEGs identified lipid metabolism and cell growth, differentiation and cancer pathways as most enriched. After analyzing the time-course RNA-Seq data, we identified nine broad pathway categories that were regulated by <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing, and these fit broadly into two major themes&#x02014;cell growth, differentiation and cancer, and liver metabolism, which included lipid, carbohydrate and amino acid and urea metabolic pathways. As detailed above, the cell growth related pathways appeared earlier in the RNA-Seq time course and may be under more direct control by TCF7L2, whereas metabolic pathways appeared later, suggesting more indirect regulation by TCF7L2, involving several other transcription factors. In general <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing was associated with a gene expression program consistent with reduced cell invasiveness, diminished capacity for liver injury repair and a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) in hepatoma cells. The tumor suppressor gene and epithelial cell marker E-cadherin (<italic>Cdh1</italic>) was markedly up-regulated and the oncogenic transcription factor <italic>Myc</italic> was down-regulated by <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing. The hepatocyte growth factor/c-met (<italic>Met</italic>) and the amphiregulin (<italic>Areg</italic>) genes also were both significantly down-regulated by <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing, and these genes are known to be important regulators of liver injury repair (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). These functions are consistent with the general role of Wnt signaling in these pathways (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), but we show for the first time that TCF7L2 is a global regulator of genes regulating these cellular processes in a liver-related cell line.</p><p>In addition to these pathways, our data also demonstrate that TCF7L2 is a major regulator of metabolic genes in hepatoma cells. In mature hepatocytes, precise coordination of carbohydrate, lipid, protein/amino-acid and xenobiotic metabolism is paramount, and TCF7L2 mediates many of these pathways, which we show can occur directly or indirectly through cooperation with hepatic transcription factors. A central and novel finding in our study was that <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> has a significant role in hepatic lipid metabolism and transport which, to our knowledge, has not previously been described. In our RNA-Seq experiments, <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> knock-down surprisingly led to significant gene expression changes of many essential lipid-related genes. This included an approximate doubling of <italic>Apob</italic> gene expression after 48 h and an approximate 4-fold increase at 96 h, which was accompanied by a doubling in the expression of the <italic>Mttp</italic> and <italic>Abcg8</italic> genes at 48 h. Given the known roles of these genes in hepatic lipid metabolism (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), it is highly likely that reduced <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> expression promotes an increase in cholesterol synthesis, trafficking and secretion from hepatoma cells. While this role of TCF7L2 has not previously been described, one study has demonstrated that the Wnt co-receptor LRP5 regulates plasma cholesterol levels (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Mice lacking LRP5 expression display increased plasma cholesterol after being fed a high-fat diet, which was caused by reduced hepatic cholesterol clearance, and was likely exacerbated by defects in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from &#x003b2;-cells (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In humans, mutations in the gene encoding LRP6 are associated with hyperlipidemia in humans (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Carriers of the LRP6 mutation had drastically elevated triglycerides and low-density lipoproteins (LDL), were hyperglycemic, and had a higher incidence of T2DM, despite a normal BMI (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Expression of mutant LRP6 in NIH3T3 cells markedly reduced <italic>Lef1</italic> transcriptional activity, which is consistent with an overall reduction in Wnt signaling, and also the data in our current study, where a significant reduction in <italic>Lef1</italic> expression also was observed. Furthermore, in mice lacking &#x003b2;-catenin, an increase in liver cholesterol was observed (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), but other studies have demonstrated that over-expression of &#x003b2;-catenin increased hepatic triglyceride content (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p><p>Similar to lipid-metabolism genes, TCF7L2 was also a significant regulator of amino acid metabolism, especially arginine, cysteine, tryptophan, methionine and citrulline metabolism, and also controlled the expression of many enzymes involved in the urea cycle. These pathways are not mutually exclusive, and are connected through common or linked enzymes. For example, arginine is produced from citrulline via the action of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), the genes of which were both up-regulated following <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing. Further, citrulline is produced from ornithine, which is regulated by the action of ornithine aminotransferase (OAT, encoded by <italic>Oat</italic>), a clear direct TCF7L2 target gene in our study.</p><p>In terms of glucose metabolism, a number of studies have demonstrated that native TCF7L2 is a negative regulator of genes controlling gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes in culture and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), but we show that the role of TCF7L2 in hepatic glucose metabolism extends beyond gluconeogenesis. Genes regulating glycogen metabolism (<italic>Gys2</italic>), glycolysis (<italic>Aldob</italic> and <italic>Eno2</italic>) and glucose transport (<italic>Slc2a2</italic>) were all affected by <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing in the hepatoma cells, suggesting that TCF7L2 activity is an important determinant of carbohydrate metabolism overall in the liver. Taken together these data describe new metabolic roles for TCF7L2 in the liver that have not previously been described and it will be important to examine whether these metabolic gene expression changes induced by <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> knock-down translate to physiological and metabolic alterations in mature hepatocytes <italic>in vivo.</italic></p><p>A second important and novel finding in our study is that TCF7L2 indirectly regulates gene expression through cooperation with a number of important hepatic transcriptional partners, and this cooperation may explain the diverse metabolic pathways affected by <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing. We found that several master regulators of hepatic gene transcription were differentially regulated by TCF7L2 in the RNA-Seq time-course. These genes included those encoding HNF4&#x003b1;, MYC, LEF1, CITED2, MIXL1 and FOXO1. Because of its clear role in regulating hepatic metabolic gene transcription, we focused our analysis on the relationship between TCF7L2 and HNF4&#x003b1;. We previously documented an increase in <italic>Hnf4a</italic> mRNA following <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and a molecular and physical relationship between these two important transcription factors has been documented by others (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). A recent report showed that TCF7L2 isoforms co-precipitate with HNF4&#x003b1; and modify its nuclear expression (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In our study, silencing <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> not only increased <italic>Hnf4a</italic> mRNA and protein levels, but also led to an increase in HNF4&#x003b1; chromatin occupancy genome-wide. HNF4&#x003b1; binding was focused around genes that were up-regulated by <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing, indicating a potential cooperative relationship between these two factors.</p><p>Many metabolic genes that were differentially expressed in our dataset and were bound by HNF4&#x003b1; included those important for gluconeogenesis (i.e. <italic>Fbp1</italic>, <italic>G6pc</italic>) and cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism (i.e. <italic>Dgat2</italic> and <italic>Apob</italic>), which is consistent with a role for HNF4&#x003b1; in regulating these pathways in the liver. To examine this more closely, we performed co-silencing experiments of TCF7L2 and HNF4&#x003b1;, and examined the expression of several metabolic genes in the hepatoma cells. The data from these experiments highlight that HNF4&#x003b1; is indeed required for the effect of TCF7L2 silencing on the <italic>Mttp</italic> and <italic>Apob</italic> genes, and the independent regulation of liver fat genes by HNF4&#x003b1; also has been demonstrated in HNF4&#x003b1; liver-specific null mice (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Knock-out of HNF4&#x003b1; in mouse liver leads to massive liver triglyceride accumulation, which is the result of an almost complete absence of <italic>Mttp</italic> and <italic>Apob</italic> expression and leads to reduced VLDL-mediated secretion of triglycerides (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Similarly, we also show that HNF4&#x003b1; is required for the effect of TCF7L2 on amino acid and urea cycle genes, particularly <italic>Asl</italic> and <italic>Otc</italic>, and that it can regulate the expression of these genes independently of TCF7L2. The independent role of HNF4&#x003b1; in this pathway is consistent with a previous report demonstrating that liver-specific disruption of HNF4&#x003b1; drastically reduces <italic>Otc</italic> expression and disrupts ureagenesis (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). For glucose metabolism, silencing HNF4&#x003b1; also blunted the effect of TCF7L2 silencing on the expression of <italic>Aldob and Fbp1</italic>, but did not appear to be required for the effect of TCF7L2 on <italic>G6pc</italic> and <italic>Slc2a2</italic> expression. These data indicate that (i) the balance between HNF4&#x003b1; and TCF7L2 expression plays a defining role in the regulation of a subset of metabolic genes in liver cells that will require further exploration genome-wide, and (ii) TCF7L2 likely interacts with several additional transcription factors to regulate gene expression in these cells. Of particular interest in this regard is FOXO1, as this factor has been shown to interact with TCF7L2 to regulate metabolic gene expression in mouse liver <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>The changes in the expression of many of the cooperating transcription factors in our study persisted at the 96 h end-point of our RNA-Seq study, which may explain the persistent changes in some metabolic genes; the expression of <italic>Hnf4&#x003b1;</italic>, <italic>Foxo1</italic>, <italic>Cited2</italic> and <italic>Mixl1</italic> remained differentially expressed when <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> had returned to near basal levels. These findings may have arisen directly from the residual depletion of TCF7L2 mRNA and protein at 96 h, or indirectly as a result of the cascading nature of gene expression changes, such that a factor that was altered early in our time-course affected the downstream expression of a gene later on that persisted beyond the period of maximal <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> silencing. The expression of the important developmental transcription factor <italic>Mixl1</italic> exponentially decreased during the entire 96 h time-course and did not recover which also may indicate that some gene expression changes induced by siTcf7l2 may be relatively permanent and/or extremely slow to recover, which may further contribute to persistent secondary gene expression changes.</p><p>In summary, the results of our study provide novel and important insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation by TCF7L2 in hepatoma cells and further advance our understanding of how TCF7L2 may impact the cellular and metabolic pathways that are important to liver cell development, cancer and hepatic metabolic disorders. We highlight that TCF7L2 has a diverse role in hepatoma cells and, through direct and indirect gene regulation, regulates multiple pathways. Future studies conducted <italic>in vivo</italic> will be needed to validate these findings, and similar experiments in other tissues and cells that are important for metabolic diseases will be required.</p></sec><sec id="SEC5"><title>ACCESSION NUMBERS</title><p>Raw and processed RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data, including the H4IIE-specific transcriptome file in gtf-format, have been deposited to the NCBI under accession number GSE53862.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SEC6"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gku1225/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p>
