Gene expression profiling of intact human tumors fails to reveal the molecular nature of functionally distinct epithelial cell subpopulations, in particular the tumor cells that fuel tumor growth, metastasis, and disease relapse. We generated primary serum-free cultures of NSCLC and then exposed them to conditions known to promote differentiation: the air-liquid interface (ALI) and serum. The transcriptional network of the primary cultures was associated with stem cells, indicating a poorly differentiated state, and worse overall survival of NSCLC patients. Strikingly, the overexpression of RNA splicing and processing factors was a prominent feature of the poorly differentiated cells and was also observed in clinical datasets. A genome-wide analysis of splice isoform expression revealed many alternative splicing events that were specific to the differentiation state of the cells, including an unexpectedly high frequency of events on chromosome 19. The poorly differentiated cells exhibited alternative splicing in many genes associated with tumor progression, as exemplified by the preferential expression of the short isoform of telomeric repeat-binding factor 1 (TERF1), also known as Pin2. Our findings demonstrate the utility of the ALI method for probing the molecular mechanisms that underlie NSCLC pathogenesis and provide novel insight into posttranscriptional mechanisms in poorly differentiated lung cancer cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><title>Introduction</title><p>Non&#x02013;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths despite the successful development of many therapies.

As a complementary approach that circumvents both of these conditions, we characterized lung cancer cells with distinct differentiation states by establishing primary serum-free NSCLC cultures and then inducing differentiation by various methods.</p><p>Faithful preservation of the undifferentiated state in culture without the acquisition of genetic or epigenetic alterations requires sophisticated techniques such as defined serum-free media and three-dimensional (3D) matrices <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A relevant culture method to study the developmental hierarchy of normal and cancerous lung cells is the air-liquid interface (ALI), in which cells are induced to differentiate in 3D growth by exposure to the air.

However, the direct comparison of ALI to conventional methods such as serum has not been conducted in NSCLC but would inform the relevant approaches to characterize the gene expression and mRNA splicing profiles of the poorly differentiated state.</p><p>The dysregulation of mRNA splicing has been implicated in tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, but genome-wide analysis of mRNA splicing has not been broadly applied to the study of poorly differentiated cancer cells. The differential expression of mRNA splice isoforms of various genes regulates differentiation and pluripotency in normal tissue stem cells <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, but its prevalence and functions in poorly differentiated cancer cells are not well characterized.</p><p>We demonstrate that poorly differentiated NSCLC cells overexpress RNA processing factors and exhibit a distinct profile of alternatively spliced mRNAs. As a striking example, the short isoform of the telomere factor <italic>TERF1</italic> is enriched in the poorly differentiated state. The clinical relevance of the ALI method for studying NSCLC was revealed by comparison to patient datasets and generation of gene signatures that predict survival outcomes.

Matrigel was diluted in PBS to 0.4&#x000a0;mg/ml, transferred to culture flasks, and allowed to solidify overnight at room temperature before adding cells. TUM449 cell line was generated from patient tumor sample 87449A1, an NSCLC adenocarcinoma, and TUM110 cell line was generated from patient sample 60110A1, an NSCLC squamous cell carcinoma.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><title>Air-Liquid Interface Cultures</title><p>Millicell 1-&#x003bc;m PET hanging cell culture inserts (Millipore) lacking Matrigel were seeded with 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells in BEGM.

Correlation analysis of gene level expression change between differentiated and undifferentiated condition (log2ratio) was performed using Pearson method. Event level change for each alternatively spliced event was calculated as the ratio of geometric means between probes that target the variant transcript to the reference transcript (B, C, D, and E).

The TUM110 culture was established from a female patient diagnosed with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (Union for International Cancer Control stage T2N0MX), and the TUM449 culture was from a female patient diagnosed with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung (Union for International Cancer Control stage T2N0MX). In one differentiation condition, &#x0201c;BEGM-ALI,&#x0201d; the cells were exposed to the ALI in standard BEGM medium, which is similar to the medium used for ALI cultures of HBECs <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In another condition, &#x0201c;CnT23-ALI,&#x0201d; which was used in the original study <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, cells were exposed to the ALI in protein-free CnT23 medium, which contains 50 nM retinoic acid and 1&#x000a0;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. In the third condition, &#x0201c;Serum,&#x0201d; cells were cultured in standard tissue-culture plates submerged in medium that contains 10% FBS; this condition has long been known to induce differentiation in HBECs <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Upon exposure to the ALI, the tumor cells formed a 3D multilayered epithelium (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>B</italic>), consistent with previous reports <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. ALI samples were harvested on day 16 for gene expression profiling based on our previous studies and similarity to published HBEC studies that support a lack of significant changes in gene expression after 8 to 10 days <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Cells that were exposed to serum remained in monolayer but exhibited significant morphological changes, such as a spindly morphology (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>B</italic>). Serum samples were harvested on day 4 because they still appear to look healthy on that day and time courses had shown that the cells do not survive 16&#x000a0;days in serum. Gene expression profiles of three biological replicates per condition were generated with the Affymetrix U133Plus microarray platform. Principal component analysis revealed prominent patterns (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>C</italic>). In both cultures, the BEGM-ALI profile was located closest to that of the poorly differentiated profile, followed by CnT23-ALI and then serum. The arrangement of the samples indicated that differentiation induced similar overall changes in transcription in TUM110 and TUM449. Similar patterns were observed by hierarchical clustering (Supplemental Figure S1<italic>A</italic>). The analysis suggested distinct molecular outcomes of the three conditions, especially serum; these differences were subsequently explored by various bioinformatic analyses.</p><p>A gene signature termed GeneSig2 was defined for each condition as the group of probe sets with at least two-fold lower expression (FDR&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0.01) in the differentiated state in both cultures (<xref rid="ec0010" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). Interestingly, each GeneSig2 contained several genes that encode RNA processing factors; subsequent analysis demonstrated the highly significant enrichment of these factors in the poorly differentiated state (see below). We compared each GeneSig2 with clinical patient-matched gene expression and survival data. Patient samples from the NSCLC Directors&#x02019; Challenge <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> were ordered according to their expression of each GeneSig2, and the survival data of the patients in the top and bottom quartiles were subjected to Kaplan-Meier analysis. High expression of the genes in GeneSig2 from each differentiation condition was associated with worse overall survival (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref><italic>A</italic>). This result indicated that our approach could provide relevant molecular insights into the histological observation that less differentiated NSCLC tumors are associated with increased risk of death <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>The BEGM-ALI GeneSig2 had the strongest hazard ratio (HRatio), whereas the serum signature yielded the weakest values (BEGM: 3.27; Cnt23: 2.92; Serum: 2.5; <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref><italic>A</italic>) despite the fact that the serum signature contained more than twice as many probe sets as the other signatures. Six probes defined the intersection of the three GeneSig2 sets (Supplemental Figure S1<italic>B</italic>), and strikingly, this small gene set was correlated with worse overall survival (Hazard Ratio [HRatio]&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.02, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.0023). Similarly, significant differences in patient survival based on Genesig2 were also observed when the entire patient cohort was bisected into top and bottom halves (BEGM: <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.84E-05, HRatio&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.96; Cnt23: <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.000237, HRatio&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.8; Serum: <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.000486, HRatio&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.75).</p><p>However, there were also significant differences among the GeneSig2 from the three conditions. The changes in gene expression were generally consistent across tumor cultures and conditions; most genes exhibited changes that trended in the same direction even if the changes did not achieve the thresholds used to generate GeneSig2 (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref><italic>B</italic>). Interestingly, in TUM449, approximately 25% of the probe sets in the serum signature changed in opposite directions in serum versus both ALI conditions. Overall, the GeneSig2 analysis demonstrated the clinical relevance of the experimental approach to characterize the undifferentiated state of NSCLC at the molecular level. Although clinical relevance was demonstrated for all three differentiation conditions, the results indicated certain molecular consequences of both ALI and serum, which were followed up in additional experiments below.</p><p>The converse set of gene signatures&#x02014;genes with higher expression in the differentiated state&#x02014;did not exhibit any correlation with patient survival data and thus was not pursued. This observation could be due to the heterogeneity of differentiation as opposed to the relatively few deviations within the poorly differentiated serum-free culture. Additional gene signatures were generated that were comprised of genes that increased <italic>or</italic> decreased during differentiation; patient cohorts that were clustered by these compound gene signatures exhibited a significant survival difference (e.g. log rank <italic>P</italic> value .013 for BEGM-ALI), but the results were not as robust as those from GeneSig2. Together, these results demonstrate that the signatures defined by genes overexpressed in the poorly differentiated state (GeneSig2) exhibited the most clinical relevance and overall robustness.</p></sec><sec id="s0055"><title>Overexpression of mRNA Processing Factors in Poorly Differentiated Cells</title><p>Additional bioinformatic analyses were performed with the full gene expression profiles and thus were independent of GeneSig2. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA; Broad Institute) demonstrated that the expression profiles of the poorly differentiated state were significantly enriched for gene sets of poor clinical prognosis (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref><italic>A</italic>), most notably one from the Directors&#x02019; Challenge <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> which is the same dataset used above in the independent GeneSig2 analysis. In addition, the identification of stem cell factors demonstrates that the poorly differentiated state of the culture was associated with metastasis factors (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref><italic>A</italic>, Supplemental Figure S2<italic>A</italic>), which is consistent with a large body of data that supports the links between metastatic stem cells and poor survival <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Notably, the gene expression profiles in the poorly differentiated state were enriched for at least five gene sets containing targets of the Myc oncogene (Supplemental Figure S2<italic>A</italic>).</p><p>Strikingly, GSEA identified many RNA processing signatures that were enriched in the poorly differentiated state (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref><italic>A</italic>). Specifically, the signatures converged on posttranscriptional modification, especially mRNA splicing. Notably, there were not many significant differences in the expression of ribosomal protein genes and transcription factors in the poorly differentiated versus differentiated states (Supplemental Figure S3). Thus, these results likely reflected the overexpression of these factors independent of any differences in total RNA synthesis or metabolism.</p><p>Conversely, GSEA of the profiles from the differentiated state identified gene sets associated with better patient survival and downregulation in stem cells and metastasis (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref><italic>B</italic>, Supplemental Figure S2<italic>B</italic>). Differentiation in serum but not ALI was enriched for apoptosis and cell death pathways (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref><italic>B</italic>), which represented a striking contrast between the serum and ALI. The serum condition also yielded weaker statistics or lack of significance for several gene sets that were enriched in the ALI conditions.</p><p>The enrichment of mRNA processing factors in the poorly differentiated cells was independently revealed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The two pathways that were uniquely enriched in the undifferentiated state were RNA posttranscriptional modification and RNA trafficking (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref><italic>A</italic>). Notably, these pathways were enriched only in the ALI condition, not in serum. The pathways uniquely enriched in the differentiated state were protein degradation, free radical scavenging, and antigen presentation (Supplemental Figure S4).</p><p>An examination of individual genes in these pathways demonstrated higher expression of RNA processing factors in the poorly differentiated state on the microarrays (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref><italic>B</italic>, <xref rid="ec0015" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table S2</xref>). In many cases, the change in expression was more pronounced in ALI than in serum, which likely explains why the IPA pathways were enriched only in ALI.</p></sec><sec id="s0060"><title>Splicing Factor Gene Alterations and Overexpression in NSCLC</title><p>Given these results, we hypothesized that mRNA processing factors could be dysregulated across NSCLC. The expression of the genes in IPA&#x02019;s RNA posttranscriptional modification pathway was queried in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Indeed, almost all of the factors in the panel were found to be overexpressed in NSCLC compared with normal tissue; the results were observed in both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>).</p><p>To assess genetic alterations in these factors, TCGA was queried with cBioPortal <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> for the same panel of genes. Genomic alterations were observed in 71% (351/493) of squamous cell carcinoma cases and 37% (206/563) of adenocarcinoma cases (Supplemental Figure S5, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). Most of these alterations were copy number gain, defined as at least 2.8 copies, and some were mutations; very few of the alterations were copy number loss. The high frequency (58%) of <italic>TRA2B</italic> copy number gain in squamous cell carcinoma accounted for most of the difference in alteration frequencies between the subtypes. The <italic>TRA2B</italic> amplification was not focal. Notably, the mRNA expression level of <italic>TRA2B</italic> was highly correlated with copy number (Pearson <italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.75; Supplemental Figure S5<italic>C</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><title>Alternative Splicing in Poorly Differentiated NSCLC Cells</title><p>Based on the above observations, we hypothesized that poorly differentiated NSCLC cells might exhibit a distinct alternative splicing profile from their differentiated counterparts. The SpliceArray&#x02122; platform enables the measurement of 281,209 splicing events, both documented and theoretical, and has identified novel alternative splice isoforms in several studies <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The coordinated measurement of many probes at each event provides an internal control and allows for normalization. To generate a global alternative splicing profile, mRNA samples from TUM110 and TUM449 in the poorly differentiated and BEGM-ALI states (three biological replicates per condition) were evaluated on the SpliceArray&#x02122;; the BEGM-ALI condition was chosen because it produced the most robust results in the above analyses. Importantly, gene expression changes (measured independently of alternative splicing events) were highly correlated on the SpliceArray&#x02122; and Affymetrix platforms, with Pearson <italic>r</italic> values of 0.798 and 0.772 in TUM110 and TUM449, respectively (Supplemental Figure S6).</p><p>We identified 264 alternative splice events within 137 unique genes that changed significantly between poorly differentiated and differentiated cells in both TUM110 and TUM449 (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>; <xref rid="ec0020" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table S3</xref>). Most of the events with significant changes (67%) were classified as exon skipping.

The remainder mapped to the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; untranslated region (Supplemental Table S4).</p><p>Global analysis of the alternative splicing events that changed between poorly differentiated and differentiated cells revealed an unexpectedly high proportion on chromosome 19, as normalized to the SpliceArray events per chromosome and thus independent of gene density (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref><italic>A</italic>; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.0001, chi-square goodness-of-fit test). The chromosome 19 genes with splicing event changes were highly enriched within ontology categories of extracellular factors (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.7E-11), many of which have been implicated in tumorigenesis, such as <italic>CEACAM1, GDF15, ICAM1, C3</italic>, and <italic>MUC16</italic> and the kallikrein-related peptidases <italic>KLK6</italic>, <italic>KLK7</italic>, <italic>KLK8</italic>, and <italic>KLK10</italic>.</p><p>In addition, among the 137 genes were factors that have been associated with NSCLC (e.g., <italic>ANLN, C3, CLDN4, CRYAB, EIF4A2, ELF3, S100P, SAA, SOD2</italic>), factors with documented function in undifferentiated cells (e.g., <italic>ALDH3A1, CEACAM3, CEACAM5, DNMT1, GTF2I, ICAM1, L1CAM, TERF1, TOP2A</italic>), and factors that mediate interactions with the tumor microenvironment (e.g., <italic>CCL2, IL8, IL32, GDF15</italic>). The type of alternative splicing event identified for each of these genes is provided in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>.</p><p>As a notable example of affected genes, the analysis revealed the alternative splicing of <italic>TERF1</italic>, a gene that encodes a telomeric protein and has two characterized splice isoforms <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Higher expression of the short form was observed in the poorly differentiated state in both cultures; expression relative to the differentiated state was 4.26-fold (FDR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.024) in TUM110 and 3.92-fold (FDR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.067) in TUM449 (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>). <italic>TERF1</italic> was selected for confirmation of the SpliceArray data by RT-PCR because of prior characterization of its two isoforms, the documented function of <italic>TERF1</italic> in stem cells <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and the association between telomeres and tumorigenesis <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We performed RT-PCR with two probe sets: one that specifically amplifies the short form and the other that specifically amplifies the long form. The results were consistent with the SpliceArray data (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>, <italic>C</italic>&#x02013;<italic>E</italic>). In fact, a subtle distinction was observed in both array and RT-PCR: the short form was upregulated in the poorly differentiated cells in both cultures; the long form was upregulated in the differentiated cells in TUM110 but unchanged during differentiation in TUM449. These results demonstrate that the alternative splicing of <italic>TERF1</italic> depends on the differentiation state of NSCLC cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Discussion</title><p>The novel strategy employed in this study to characterize the differentiation hierarchy in NSCLC revealed the upregulation of RNA processing factors and a distinct mRNA splicing profile in poorly differentiated cells, including the preferential expression of the short form of <italic>TERF1</italic>. Our strategy circumvents specific liabilities of other methods such as cell sorting and intact tissue analysis and thus is complementary to such approaches. Our analysis of samples that represent the two major subtypes of NSCLC suggests that the results may apply broadly to NSCLC. Indeed, the overexpression of RNA processing factors that we identified in this study was also observed in the larger datasets that represent hundreds of human NSCLC samples.</p><sec id="s0070"><title>ALI Method to Study NSCLC</title><p>Inducing differentiation of stem cells by exposure to serum is a common method <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, but our results indicate that the ALI method constitutes a cleaner, more precise technique in NSCLC. As appreciated previously, the 3D structures formed by cells at the ALI resemble solid tissues more than the spindly low-density cultures of cells exposed to serum.</p><p>Consistent with the morphological observations, three independent lines of analysis demonstrated the greater precision and relevance of the ALI method, in particular BEGM-ALI. First, the BEGM-ALI gene signature showed the strongest HRatios when compared with clinical datasets, whereas the serum signature had the weakest values despite being comprised of a larger number of genes. Second, GSEA revealed that BEGM-ALI exhibited the strongest enrichment of clinical and stem cell gene signatures, whereas, in contrast, serum was the only condition to enrich for cell death. Third, the enrichment of RNA trafficking and RNA posttranscriptional modification in poorly differentiated cells was observed to a significant degree for BEGM-ALI and CnT23-ALI but not serum.</p><p>Although the ALI technique requires more time and expense and has lower throughput relative to serum, our analysis demonstrates its greater precision and clinical relevance. In serum differentiation, the more extreme changes in gene expression coupled with less statistical enrichments suggest that the method is prone to generate a substantial amount of false positives, as well as the induction of cell death. Our results also provide an explanation for the emergence in conventional serum-cultured cancer cell lines of grossly altered states that do not reflect the primary tumors <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Distinct mRNA Splicing Profile in Poorly Differentiated NSCLC</title><p>Analysis of the primary NSCLC cells cultured at the ALI revealed the overexpression of mRNA processing and splicing factors in the poorly differentiated state. The finding was based on the gene expression changes common to TUM110 and TUM449 and was identified by two independent analyses: GSEA and IPA. Because there were no differences in the overall expression levels of transcription factors or ribosomal protein genes, the finding suggested that mRNA was being processed differently and/or more efficiently in the less differentiated cells. Consistent with our findings, analysis of mouse embryonic stem cell&#x02013;like gene expression modules compared with those from differentiated cells revealed the upregulation of RNA processing factors <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Notably, the upregulation of mRNA processing and splicing factors was not observed in the poorly differentiated state of normal HBECs <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, which indicates that the dysregulation of these factors may distinguish cancerous from normal lung cells. Interestingly, we also identified the enrichment of Myc signatures in the poorly differentiated cells, and one mechanism of Myc action is to stimulate mRNA capping which in turn promotes downstream RNA processing and translation <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>Based on the specific enrichment of RNA processing factors in the poorly differentiated cells, we hypothesized that a distinct mRNA splicing profile would be evident and might promote certain phenotypes. Indeed, we identified 264 splice events within 137 genes that differed significantly in the poorly differentiated cells of both TUM110 and TUM449. Although alternative splice isoforms and mutations in splicing factors have been observed widely in cancer, our results provide evidence that alternative splicing might be exploited differently by cancer cells within the same tumor, for example, depending on their differentiation state. We speculate that the disproportionately high frequency of alternative splicing events on chromosome 19 may be connected to the high gene density on the chromosome which could result in especially open or poised chromatin structure and accessibility to splicing factors in the poorly differentiated cells. These results are consistent with many other associations between chromosome 19 and NSCLC <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>Poorly differentiated tumor cells likely employ some of the mechanisms that maintain normal stem cells, and the alternative splicing of <italic>TERF1</italic> may affect lifespan or unique DNA maintenance functions; some cell cycle checkpoints are distinct in stem cells versus nonstem cells <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In this respect, it is intriguing that the short isoform does not contain the serine residue that is phosphorylated by Aurora-A kinase and known to promote mitotic defects <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In addition, it is possible that the alternative splicing of TERF1 affects its gene product&#x02019;s interaction with DNA, proteins in the shelterin complex, or proteins that modify TERF1 such as tankyrase and F-box protein FBX4. Future studies will be needed to explore the functional consequences of differentiation state-dependent splicing of <italic>TERF1</italic> to validate their potential roles in telomere biology and tumorigenesis. Alternative splicing events in <italic>TERF1</italic> and other genes that are specific to tumors and/or undifferentiated tumor cells may offer novel targets for therapeutic intervention with less toxicity than general splicing inhibitors.</p><p>Additional downstream effects of the overexpression of RNA processing factors may help maintain poorly differentiated cells. For instance, mRNA transcripts might be processed more efficiently, which may also be coupled to more efficient packaging and export to the cytoplasm <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The faster production of translation-ready mRNAs could enable the cell to respond more rapidly to microenvironmental cues that regulate cell growth and differentiation. Separately but not exclusively, the overexpression of RNA splicing factors could provide a buffer against stochastic splicing events <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> that could have unpredictable but profound consequences in stem and progenitor cells. In the ALI model and in general, differentiated cells proliferate more slowly than the poorly differentiated cells, and it will be important to distinguish alternative splicing as a function of proliferation versus other aspects of differentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has introduced a novel strategy for the characterization of poorly differentiated NSCLC cells and has provided insights into their transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation as they relate to lung cancer pathology and clinical outcomes.</p><p>The following are the supplementary data related to this article.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ec0005"><caption><title>Supplemental figures</title><p><bold>Supplemental Figure S1</bold>.
