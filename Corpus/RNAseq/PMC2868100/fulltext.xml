id="P1">RNA-Seq provides an unbiased way to study a transcriptome, including both coding and non-coding genes. To date, most RNA-Seq studies have critically depended on existing annotations, and thus focused on expression levels and variation in known transcripts. Here, we present Scripture, a method to reconstruct the transcriptome of a mammalian cell using only RNA-Seq reads and the genome sequence. We apply it to mouse embryonic stem cells, neuronal precursor cells, and lung fibroblasts to accurately reconstruct the full-length gene structures for the vast majority of known expressed genes. We identify substantial variation in protein-coding genes, including thousands of novel 5&#x02032;-start sites, 3&#x02032;-ends, and internal coding exons. We then determine the gene structures of over a thousand lincRNA and antisense loci. Our results open the way to direct experimental manipulation of thousands of non-coding RNAs, and demonstrate the power of <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction to render a comprehensive picture of mammalian transcriptomes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">A critical task in understanding mammalian biology is defining a precise map of all the transcripts encoded in a genome. While much is known about protein-coding genes in mammals, recent studies have suggested that the mammalian genome also encodes many thousands of large ncRNA genes<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Recently, we used a chromatin signature, combining Histone 3 Lysine 4 tri-methylation modifications (H3K4me3) that mark the promoter region and Histone 3 Lysine 36 tri-methylation modifications (H3K36me3) that mark the entire transcribed region (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), to discover the genomic regions encoding ~1600 large intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) in four mouse cell types<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, and ~3300 lincRNAs across 6 human cell types<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.</p><p id="P3">Defining the complete gene structure of these lincRNAs is a pre-requisite for experimental and computational studies of their function. We previously gained initial insights by hybridizing total RNA to tiling microarrays defined across the K4-K36 region<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. This provided a coarse list of putative exonic locations, but could not define the precise gene structures and exon connectivity.</p><p id="P4">Advances in massively-parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) have opened the way to unbiased and efficient assays of the transcriptome of any mammalian cell<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.

They were thus of limited utility for discovering the complete gene structure of lincRNAs or other non-coding transcripts.</p><p id="P5">An alternative strategy is to use an <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction approach<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> to learn the complete transcriptome of an individual sample from only the <italic>unannotated</italic> genome sequence and millions of relatively short sequence reads. A complete <italic>ab initio</italic> transcriptome reconstruction of a sample will (<bold>1</bold>) identify all expressed exons; (<bold>2</bold>) enumerate all the splicing events that connect them; (<bold>3</bold>) combine them into transcriptional units; (<bold>4</bold>) determine all isoforms, including alternative ends, and (<bold>5</bold>) discover novel transcripts. A successful <italic>ab initio</italic> method should be applicable to large and complex mammalian genomes, and should be able to reconstruct transcripts of variable sizes, expression levels and protein-coding capacity.</p><p id="P6">Despite early successes in yeast<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction of a mammalian transcriptome has remained an elusive and substantial computational challenge. There has been important recent progress, including (<bold>1</bold>) efficient gapped aligners (<italic>e.g.</italic>, TopHat<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) that can map short reads that span splice junctions (&#x02018;spliced reads&#x02019;); (<bold>2</bold>) use of such gapped alignments to identify novel splicing events<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>; (<bold>3</bold>) exon identification methods<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>; and (<bold>4</bold>) genome-independent assembly of unmapped reads to sequence contigs (<italic>e.g.</italic>, Abyss<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Each of these methods provides an important component towards reconstruction, but none can reconstruct the complete transcriptome of a mammalian cell, due to scaling issues<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, limitations in handling splicing<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, or inability to identify transcripts with moderate coverage<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>.</p><p id="P7">Here, we present Scripture, a comprehensive method for <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction of the transcriptome of a mammalian cell that uses gapped alignments of reads across splice junctions (exploiting recent increases in read length) and reconstructs reads into statistically significant transcript structures. We apply Scripture to RNA-Seq data from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC), neural progenitor cells (NPC), and mouse lung fibroblasts (MLF) and correctly identify the complete annotated full-length gene structures for the vast majority of expressed known protein coding genes. The reconstruction of the three transcriptomes reveals substantial variation in protein coding genes between cell types, including thousands of novel 5&#x02032;-start sites, 3&#x02032; ends, or additional coding exons. Many of these variant structures are supported by independent data. We also discover the gene structure and expression level of over 2000 non-coding transcripts, including hundreds of transcripts from previously identified lincRNA loci, over a thousand additional lincRNAs with similar properties, and hundreds of multi-exonic antisense ncRNAs. We show that lincRNAs have no significant coding potential, and that they are evolutionary conserved. Our results open the way to direct experimental manipulation of this new class of genes and highlight the power of RNA-seq along with an <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction to provide a comprehensive picture of cell specific transcriptomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>RNA-seq libraries</title><p id="P8">We used massively parallel (Illumina) sequencing to sequence cDNA libraries from polyA(+) mRNA from ESC, NPC and MLF cells, with 76 base paired-end reads. For the ESC library, we generated a total of 152 million paired-end reads. Using a gapped aligner<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 93 million of these were alignable (497Mb aligned bases, 262X average coverage of known protein coding genes expressed in ESC). We obtained similar numbers for the NPC and MLF libraries (<bold>Methods</bold>). In ESC, 76% of these reads map within the exonic regions of known protein-coding genes, 9% are in introns of known protein coding genes, and 15% map in intergenic regions. We found a strong correlation between expression levels of protein-coding genes as measured by RNA-Seq and Affymetrix expression arrays (<italic>r</italic>=0.88 for all genes, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="methods"><title>Scripture: a statistical method for <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction of a mammalian transcriptome</title><p id="P9">We next developed Scripture, a genome-guided method to reconstruct the transcriptome using only an RNA-Seq dataset and an (unannotated) reference genome sequence. Scripture consists of five steps (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 1, Methods</xref>). <bold>First</bold>, we use reads aligned to the genome, including those with gapped alignments<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> spanning exon-exon junctions (&#x02018;aligned spliced reads&#x02019;, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). &#x02018;Spliced&#x02019; reads provide direct information on the location of splice junctions within the transcript, and ~30% of 76 base reads are expected on average to span an exon-exon junction. From the aligned spliced reads, we construct a <italic>connectivity graph</italic> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), where two bases in the genome are connected if they are immediate neighbours either in the genomic sequence itself or within a spliced read. We use agreement with splicing motifs at each putative junction to orient the connection (edge) in the connectivity graph<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). <bold>Second</bold>, to infer transcripts, we use a statistical segmentation approach<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and both spliced and non-spliced reads to identify paths in the connectivity graph with mapped read enrichment compared to the genomic background (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). This is done by scoring a sliding window using a test statistic for each region, computing a threshold for genome-wide significance, and using the significant windows to define intervals. <bold>Third</bold>, from the paths, we construct a <italic>transcript graph</italic> connecting each exon in the transcript (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Each path through the graph is directed and represents one oriented (strand-specific) isoform of the gene (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Alternative spliced isoforms are identified by considering all possible paths in the transcript graph. <bold>Fourth,</bold> we augment the transcript graph with connections based on paired-end reads and their distance constraints, allowing us to join transcripts or remove unlikely isoforms (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>, below). <bold>Finally,</bold> we generate a catalogue of transcripts defined by the paths through the transcript graph.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Paired-end reads in transcriptome reconstruction and resolution of alternative spliced isoforms</title><p id="P10">Paired-end information, consisting of reads that came from the two ends of the sequenced RNA fragment, provides valuable additional information in the reconstruction.</p><p id="P11"><bold>First</bold>, the presence of paired-ends linking two regions shows that they appear in the same transcript; such a connection might not otherwise be apparent because low expression levels or non-alignable sequence might prevent a continuous chain of overlapping sequence reads (spliced or unspliced) across the transcript. We thus augment the transcript graphs with paired-end information, where available, to (indirectly) link nodes in the graph. We use these indirect links (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>) to add edges between disconnected graphs, add internal nodes (exons) that might have been missed within a path (transcript), and add extra support for existing edges. This refines the structure of our transcripts and increases our confidence in them, especially in lowly-expressed transcripts that are more likely to have coverage gaps.</p><p id="P12"><bold>Second</bold>, the distribution of library insert sizes constrains the distance between the paired end reads; these distance constraints can be used to infer the relative likelihood of some potential transcripts (for example, those in which the paired ends would be much closer or much further than expected). We infer the distribution of insert sizes for a given library from the position of read pairs on transcripts from those genes for which there is only a single transcript model (<italic>i.e.</italic>, no detectable alternative splicing, <bold>Methods</bold>). For example, in the ESC library, this distribution matches well with the experimentally determined sizes. Using this distribution we assign likelihoods to each connection, filtering unlikely ones (<bold>Methods</bold>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Reconstruction of full-length gene structures</title><p id="P13">We applied Scripture to our mouse ES RNA-Seq dataset, and compared our reconstructions to protein-coding gene annotations<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Scripture identified 16,389 nonoverlapping, multi-exonic transcript graphs which correspond to 15,352 known multi-exonic genes (<bold>Methods</bold>). 88.4% of reconstructed genes are covered by a single graph (no fragmentation of the reconstructed transcript) and 8.0% are covered by two transcript graphs (fragmentation of the transcript to two separate pieces in the reconstruction). Focusing on the 13,362 genes with a significant expression level (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, <bold>Methods</bold>), Scripture reconstructed the full-length structure of the longest known splice isoform (from 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; end, including all exons and splice junctions, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) for 10,355 of them (~78%). All of our reconstructed transcripts for known multi-exonic transcripts also had the correct orientation (strand), allowing us to reconstruct genes that overlap one another on opposite strands (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Complete transcript structures are recovered across a very broad range of expression levels (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b,c</xref>) for both single and multi-exonic genes. For example, Scripture accurately reconstructs the full-length transcript of ~73% of the known protein-coding genes at the second quintile of expression, and ~94% of the genes from the top quintile. Furthermore, the average proportion of bases constructed for each transcript was high (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Even for the bottom 5% of expressed genes, we recover on average 62% of each of these transcripts&#x02019; bases (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). For single-exon genes, we recover on average 80% of the transcribed bases. We obtained similar results in the other two cell types (19,835 and 20,407 transcript graphs for 14,212 and 13,351 known genes in NPC and MLF, respectively). Most of the genes that are not fully reconstructed are those with low expression levels; it should be possible to reconstruct most of these by generating additional RNA-Seq data. The few highly expressed genes that are not fully reconstructed are either the result of alignment artifacts caused by recent processed pseudogenes or stem from novel transcriptome variations, missing from the current annotation (explored in detail below).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Novel transcriptome variations in annotated protein-coding genes</title><p id="P15">Given that the vast majority of the Scripture reconstructions of protein-coding genes are extremely accurate, we next investigated the differences between the reconstructed transcriptome and the known gene annotations (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

A recent study proposed to overcome this limitation experimentally by using very long reads (<italic>e.g.</italic>. 454 sequencing), as a scaffold for short read reconstruction<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. This is applicable, albeit at a substantial cost, for highly expressed genes, but would require extraordinary depth to cover more lowly expressed ones.</p><p id="P41">Here, we present Scripture, a novel computational method to reconstruct a mammalian transcriptome with no prior knowledge of gene annotations. Scripture relies on longer reads that span splice junctions to connect discontiguous (spliced) segments, resolve multiple splice isoforms, and leverages paired-end information to refine these transcripts. Scripture can identify short but strongly expressed transcripts as well as much lower expressed transcripts for which there is aggregate evidence along the entire transcript length. While Scripture does rely on a reference genome sequence, many of its components can also be used in the development of methods for assembly of transcripts from read data only.</p><p id="P42">We applied Scripture to RNA-Seq data from pluripotent ES cells and differentiated lineages and showed that we can accurately reconstruct the majority of expressed annotated protein coding genes, at a broad range of expression levels, as well as uncover a large number of novel isoforms in the protein-coding transcriptome. This variation may play key regulatory roles, defining new cell-type specific promoters, UTRs and protein-coding exons.

We then use a statistical segmentation strategy to traverse the graph topology directly and determine <italic>paths</italic> through the connectivity graph that represent a contiguous path of significant enrichment over the background distribution (below). In this segmentation process, we scan variable sized windows across the graph and assign significance to each window. We then merge significant paths into a <italic>transcript graph</italic>. Specifically, for a window of fixed size, we slide the window across each base in the connectivity graph (after augmenting it with the non-spliced reads). If a window contains only contiguous non-spliced reads, then it represents a non-spliced part of the transcript. However, if the window hits an edge in the connectivity graph connecting two separate parts of the genome (based on two or more spliced reads), then the path follows this edge to a non-contiguous part of the genome, denoting a splicing event. Similarly, when alternative splice isoforms are present, if a base connects to multiple possible places, then all windows across these alternative paths are computed.

Specifically, if we are interested in computing the probability of observing alignment <italic>a</italic> (of length <italic>r</italic>) at position <italic>i</italic> (out of a total genome size of <italic>L</italic>) we can permute the alignments and ask how often read <italic>a</italic> overlaps position <italic>i</italic>.

Extending this reasoning, we can compute the probability of observing <italic>k</italic> reads (of average length <italic>r</italic>) at position <italic>i</italic> as the binomial probability.

We use this method to compute a corrected significance cutoff for any given region.</p><p id="P57">Finally, to identify significant intervals, we scan the genome using variable sized windows, computing significance values for each and filtering by a 5% significance threshold. For each window size, we merge the significant regions that passed this cutoff into consecutive intervals.

Trimming is performed by computing a normalized read count for each base in the interval compared to the average number of reads in the genome.

expressed 4-exon gene (1500032D16Rik, top, exons: grey boxes) with coverage from different type of reads. Unspliced reads (black bars) fall within a single exon, whereas splice reads (dumbbells) span exon-exon junctions (thin horizontal lines connect the alignment of a read to the exons it spans). The coverage track (bottom) shows the aggregate coverage of both spliced and unspliced reads. <bold>(b&#x02013;g) A schematic description of Scripture.</bold> (<bold>b</bold>) <bold>A cartoon example.</bold> Reads (black bars) originate from sequencing a contiguous RNA molecule. Shown are transcripts from two different genes (blue and red boxes), one with seven exons (blue boxes) and one with three exons (red boxes), which are adjacent in the genome (black line). The grayscale vertical shading in subsequent panels is shown for visual tracking. (<bold>c</bold>) <bold>Spliced reads.</bold> Scripture is initiated with a genome sequence and spliced aligned reads (dumbbells) with gaps in their alignment (thin horizontal lines). Scripture uses splice site information to orient splice reads (arrow heads). (<bold>d</bold>) <bold>Connectivity graph construction</bold>. Scripture builds a connectivity graph by drawing an edge (curved arrow) between any two bases that are connected by a spliced read gap. (Edges are color coded to relate to the original RNA and eventual transcript). (<bold>e</bold>) <bold>Path scoring.</bold> Scripture scans the graph with fixed-sized windows and uses coverage from all reads (spliced and non-spliced, bottom track) to score each path for significance (p-values shown as edge labels). (<bold>f</bold>) <bold>Transcript graph construction.</bold> Scripture merges all significant windows and uses the connectivity graph to give significant segments a graph structure (three graphs in this example). (<bold>g</bold>) <bold>Refinement with paired-end data</bold>. Scripture uses paired-end (dashed curved lines) to join previously disconnected graphs (Gene 1, bold dashed line), find break point regions within contiguous segments (<italic>e.g.</italic> no dashed lines between Gene 1 and 2), and eliminate isoforms that result in paired-end reads mapping at a distance with low likelihood.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms194494f1"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Scripture correctly reconstructs full length transcripts for the majority of annotated protein coding genes</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) <bold>A typical Scripture reconstruction on mouse chr9</bold>.

The height of each bar is the fraction of genes in that quantile that were fully reconstructed. For example, ~20% of the transcripts at the bottom 5% of expression levels are fully reconstructed; ~94% of the genes at the top 95% of expression are fully reconstructed.
