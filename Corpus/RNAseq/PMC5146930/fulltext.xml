Genetic alterations that are common to all HNSCC types are likely to be important for squamous carcinogenesis. In this study, we have investigated the role of the homeodomain-only homeobox gene, HOPX, in the pathogenesis of HNSCC. We show that HOPX mRNA levels are reduced in OSCC and NPC cell lines and tissues and there is a general reduction of HOPX protein expression in these tumours and OPSCCs. HOPX promoter methylation was observed in a subset of HNSCCs and was associated with a worse overall survival in HPV negative tumours. RNAseq analysis of OSCC cells transfected with HOPX revealed a widespread deregulation of the transcription of genes related to epithelial homeostasis and ectopic over-expression of HOPX in OSCC and NPC cells inhibited cell proliferation, plating efficiency and migration, and enhanced sensitivity to UVA-induced apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that HOPX functions as a tumour suppressor in HNSCC and suggest a central role for HOPX in suppressing epithelial carcinogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) that develop in the head and neck region (HNSCC) include cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx and nasopharynx, which are tumours with different and distinct etiologies. Both oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPSCC) are caused primarily by tobacco and alcohol, but there is now strong evidence implicating human papillomavirus with a sub-set of OPSCCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Whilst there is some overlap in the profile of molecular alterations detected in the three tumour types, significant differences have been reported. For example, p53 mutations are common in OSCCs, but are less frequent in HPV-positive OPSCCs (compared with HPV-negative cases) and NPCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Genes that are commonly mutated and/or de-regulated in OSCC, OPSCC and NPC, therefore, are likely to be of fundamental importance to the development and progression of SCCs in general.</p><p>The homeodomain only protein, HOPX (also known as HOP, NECC1, LAGY or OB1), was initially identified as a gene essential for cardiac development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. HOPX is unusual because although it forms a classical homeodomain fold, it lacks several key DNA-binding residues that are conserved among other homeodomain proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Rather than binding to DNA, two distinct regions on the surface of the HOPX protein are required for its ability to interact with other proteins such as serum response factor (SRF) and HDACs to modulate transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. There are three reported splice variants of the HOPX gene (HOPX-&#x003b1;, HOPX-&#x003b2; and HOPX-&#x003b3;) that code for the same protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. However, recent analysis of NCBI reference sequences indicates that there are five transcripts that encode three different proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, although the expression of these transcripts in different tissues has not yet been examined. The HOPX-&#x003b2; promoter contains CpG islands that are methylated in various cancers leading to down-regulation of HOPX expression, strongly suggesting that HOPX functions as a tumour suppressor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>Our previously published microarray data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> showed that HOPX mRNA levels were reduced in both OSCC and NPC compared to their respective non-malignant controls. In the present study, we have extended these observations and show for the first time that the expression of HOPX is markedly down-regulated in three different subtypes of HNSCC, namely OSCC, NPC and OPSCC. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HNSCC dataset showed that hypermethylation of the HOPX-&#x003b2; promoter occurs in a sub-set of HNSCCs and this was associated with worse overall survival in HPV negative HNSCCs. Ectopic expression of HOPX in OSCC cells revealed that HOPX loss was associated with the deregulated transcription of genes involved in epithelial homeostasis. Additionally, ectopic expression of HOPX in both OSCC and NPC-derived cell lines inhibited cell proliferation, plating efficiency and migration, and enhanced sensitivity to UVA-induced apoptosis. Our results point to a central role for HOPX in suppressing epithelial carcinogenesis.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Down-regulation of HOPX mRNA expression in OSCC and NPC</title><p>A re-examination of our previous microarray data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> demonstrated down-regulation of HOPX in both OSCC and NPC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). To validate these data, RT-qPCR analyses were performed to determine the mRNA levels of HOPX in a series of OSCC and NPC cell lines and tissues. In OSCC, compared to three cultures of normal oral keratinocytes, HOPX expression was markedly reduced in immortalized oral keratinocytes (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), immortal cell lines derived from oral dysplasia tissues (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) and SCCs (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>).

By contrast, HOPX expression was reduced in oral premalignant lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The majority of OSCCs (13 of 20) showed focal HOPX staining that co-localised with areas of keratinisation within the tumour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>), the remaining seven cases did not show any HOPX expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>). The majority (19 of 27) OPSCCs showed focal weak HOPX staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2F</xref>), whilst the remaining eight cases did not show any HOPX expression. There was no correlation between HOPX expression and HPV status in this small series of OPSCCs (15 HPV positive, 12 HPV negative). Twenty NPCs were tested and all were HOPX negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2G</xref>). HOPX immunohistochemistry was carried out on a tissue microarray constructed from cores from normal oral mucosa (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;31), oral premalignant lesions (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) and from the invasive front of OSCCs (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;42).

Three OSCC cell lines showed high methylation values, namely H413 (880), H357 (120) and H400 (7), while the two normal oral keratinocytes had methylation values less than 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Among the immortalised nasopharyngeal cell lines, NP69 showed the highest methylation value (35) while the other two normal nasopharyngeal cell lines studied (NP460 and NP550) showed values less than 0. Four NPC cell lines showed methylation values higher than 35, i.e. C666 (63), CNE2 (57), CNE1 (46) and TWO1 (46) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). In support of these data, the expression of HOPX mRNA was re-activated in H413 cells (which showed the highest methylation value) following the treatment with the demethylating drug, Zebularine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>HOPX-&#x003b2; expression and promoter methylation in primary HNSCC</title><p>There are 26 CpG sites on the Illumina<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (&#x0201c;450&#x02009;k platform&#x0201d;) which are within the HOPX gene. Comparison of the DNA sequence information for the relevant probes with sequence information for the promoter region of the HOPX-&#x003b2; transcript, revealed that three of the 26 CpG sites (cg21899596, cg24852548 and cg01330221) were within the promoter region.</p><p>To obtain a measure of the total methylation of the promoter region, total methylation (beta) value across the three relevant CpG sites was calculated. For each site the beta value is a number between 0 (totally unmethylated) and 1 (100% methylated), so the sum of the three is a number between 0 (all sites totally unmethylated) and 3 (all sites 100% methylated). We chose an arbitrary cut off value of 1 to represent hyper-methylation across the three probes. Using these criteria, 53 out of 503 HNSCC tumours within the TCGA dataset showed hyper-methylation of the HOPX-&#x003b2; promoter. Of the 20 cases for which methylation and expression were available for both the tumour and matched normal tissues, HOPX was lower in 17 (85%) of cases; 3 of the 17 tumours showed evidence of HOPX-&#x003b2; promoter hyper-methylation and this was associated with a significant reduction of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Interestingly, HOPX expression was more than 100% higher in each of the remaining three tumours compared to matched normal controls.</p><p>Based on a univariate analysis of all the tumour samples, there was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between cases with and without HOPX-&#x003b2; promoter hyper-methylation. However, when HPV-ve cases were considered in isolation, 42 out of 407 tumours showed HOPX-&#x003b2; promoter hyper-methylation and there was a statistically significant association with worse overall survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>HOPX regulates the transcription of genes associated with tissue homeostasis</title><p>To investigate the consequences of HOPX down-regulation in HNSCC, we analysed gene expression by performing RNAseq in H376 OSCC cells stably transfected with HOPX isoform b (H376/HOPX). Over-expression of HOPX in transfected H376 cells relative to vector only controls (H376/pIRES) was confirmed by both RT-qPCR, Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1</xref>). Following ectopic re-expression of HOPX in H376, 1525 genes were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>) and 995 up-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S2</xref>) with an absolute fold change &#x0003e;1.5 and p value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01. Gene ontology analysis revealed an enrichment of genes associated with cell proliferation, adhesion, cell death and response to DNA damage, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref> and B). To examine the potential functional significance of HOPX loss in HNSCCs, we performed gene ontology analysis of genes regulated by HOPX in H376 that were also altered in primary tumours. To do this, we identified genes that were down-regulated by HOPX in H376 but up-regulated in micro-dissected OSCCs and vice versa (GSE35261 dataset<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Gene ontology analyses on these genes identified pathways associated with cell proliferation, adhesion and migration, as well as pathways that regulate epithelial development and differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref> and D). Collectively, these data indicate that HOPX functions to regulate squamous epithelial homeostasis and these mechanisms are altered in primary OSCCs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>HOPX inhibits proliferation and migration and enhances the sensitivity of OSCC and NPC cells to DNA damage</title><p>Having shown that HOPX influences key pathways associated with homeostasis and carcinogenesis, we next tested these observations <italic>in vitro</italic>. Cell proliferation, migration and the response to DNA damage were examined in H376/HOPX cells and also in the NPC-derived cell line, HONE-1, stably transfected with HOPX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>Over-expression of HOPX resulted in a significantly slower growth rate (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>) and a reduced plating efficiency (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>) in both cell lines compared to their respective controls. LPA can induce SRF whose activity is inhibited by HOPX<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and we have previously shown that LPA is a motility factor for both OSCC and NPC cells (unpublished data;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Therefore, we next investigated whether HOPX is involved in LPA-mediated migration and found that the migration of both HOPX-expressing H376 and HONE1 cells was significantly reduced compared to the vector controls (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined whether over-expression of HOPX influences the cellular response to UV-induced DNA damage.

Identification of genetic abnormalities that are common to all three cancer types might reveal genes/pathways fundamental to squamous carcinogenesis and lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. In the present study, we demonstrate that the expression of HOPX protein is consistently down-regulated in different sub-types of HNSCC when compared to their respective non-malignant epithelium <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data extend an early report showing loss of HOPX mRNA in another subtype of HNSCC, hypopharyngeal carcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, and implicate HOPX as a universal tumour suppressor gene relevant to head and neck carcinogenesis. The decrease in HOPX expression in immortal dysplasia cells and tissue samples of oral premalignant lesions observed here suggests HOPX down-regulation occurs early during disease progression.</p><p>The loss of HOPX expression in other malignancies, such as gastric, pancreatic, esophageal, colorectal and lung cancers, is attributed to the hypermethylation of HOPX-&#x003b2; promoter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In the present study, we show that the HOPX-&#x003b2; promoter is hypermethylated in approximately 50% of OSCC and NPC cell lines and that treatment of an OSCC cell line with a demethylating drug restored HOPX expression, suggesting that promoter methylation is in part responsible for the loss of HOPX expression in HNSCCs. Interrogation of the level 2 methylation data from the TCGA HNSCC dataset indicates that approximately 10% of tumours show evidence of HOPX-&#x003b2; promoter hypermethylation. Interestingly, this methylation correlated with a worse overall survival in HPV negative HNSCCs, which supports previous studies showing an association between HOPX-&#x003b2; promoter hypermethylation and patient prognosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. It is noteworthy that we identified the five recently reported HOPX isoforms (that code for protein isoforms a, b and c)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> plus two apparently non-coding transcripts in the TCGA HNSCC RNASeq data. Clearly, the biological functions of HOPX in human tissues are more complex than previously thought and studies to elucidate the function of the HOPX isoforms, together with the identification of isoform- and tissue-specific binding partners are warranted.</p><p>To investigate the function of HOPX in the pathogenesis of HNSCC, we performed RNAseq on OSCC cells transfected with HOPX (isoform b). GO analyses of the transcriptionally altered genes indicated an enrichment of genes associated with cell proliferation, adhesion, cell death and response to DNA damage. Rather than validate a limited number of the transcriptional changes <italic>in vitro</italic>, we adopted an approach to identify pathways that were functionally relevant in tumours. To do this we performed GO analyses on those genes that were altered following HOPX expression in OSCC cells <italic>in vitro</italic> that were also transcriptionally deregulated in micro-dissected primary OSCCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Similarly, pathways related to cell proliferation, adhesion and migration were identified plus pathways associated with epithelial development and differentiation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HOPX regulates the transcription of genes associated with epithelial homeostasis. Whilst it will be important to confirm these findings in normal keratinocytes following knockdown of endogenous HOPX, our data are entirely consistent with observations that HOPX regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation in a number of cell types and controls late terminal differentiation in keratinocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><p>To examine whether the pathways identified by GO analyses in the present study translated to a functional effect of HOPX expression on cell behaviour, we determined the effect of ectopic over-expression of HOPX in OSCC and NPC cells. Expression of HOPX in both OSCC and NPC cells inhibited cell proliferation and plating efficiency, similar to previous reports in different cancer types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. HOPX expression in OSCC and NPC cells also inhibited cell migration towards LPA. These observations can be explained by the fact that HOPX inhibits SRF activity, LPA has been shown to activate SRF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and that SRF promotes migration and proliferation of gastric epithelial cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Consistent with this, HOPX has been shown to suppress c-fos transcription in a SRF dependent manner in endometrial and breast cancer cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. These results are particularly noteworthy because we have recently observed that LPA signalling is aberrantly activated in NPC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In addition, we found that re-expression of HOPX sensitised OSCC and NPC cells to UVA-induced apoptosis, confirming a functional role for HOPX in mediating the response to DNA damage. In contrast to a recent study in lung cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, we did not observe any induction of senescence following HOPX expression (data not shown). In the present study, we did not observe any alteration in the expression of differentiation markers (CK1, CK4, CK13 and involucrin) in HOPX-expressing OSCC cells (data not shown), which probably reflects a block in terminal differentiation in SCCs. However, HOPX was expressed in the surface keratinising layers of normal oral epithelium and HOPX expression co-localised with areas of keratinisation in OSCCs, data that are entirely consistent with HOPX being a regulator of late keratinocyte differentiation and that HOPX expression correlates with tumour keratinisation in epidermal SCCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Taken together, our data show that transcriptional regulation by HOPX directly affects tumour cell behaviour and that HOPX functions as a tumour suppressor in HNSCC.</p><p>In summary, we show that HOPX is consistently lost in OSCC, OPSCC and NPC, three distinct subtypes of HNSCC, which results in a more aggressive phenotype. Our results highlight a central role for HOPX as regulator of epithelial homeostasis and a suppressor of squamous carcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell lines and tissue samples</title><p>Details and culture conditions for the normal, dysplastic and malignant oral keratinocytes have been described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.
