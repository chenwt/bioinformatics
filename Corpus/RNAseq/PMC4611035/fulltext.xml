However, the barrier properties of CVM differ from woman to woman, and the causes of these variations are not yet well understood. Using high-resolution particle tracking of fluorescent HIV-1 pseudoviruses, we found that neither pH nor Nugent scores nor total lactic acid levels correlated significantly with virus trapping in unmodified CVM from diverse donors. Surprisingly, HIV-1 was generally trapped in CVM with relatively high concentrations of <sc>d</sc>-lactic acid and a <italic>Lactobacillus crispatus</italic>-dominant microbiota. In contrast, a substantial fraction of HIV-1 virions diffused rapidly through CVM with low concentrations of <sc>d</sc>-lactic acid that had a <italic>Lactobacillus iners</italic>-dominant microbiota or significant amounts of <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, a bacterium associated with bacterial vaginosis. Our results demonstrate that the vaginal microbiota, including specific species of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, can alter the diffusional barrier properties of CVM against HIV and likely other sexually transmitted viruses and that these microbiota-associated changes may account in part for the elevated risks of HIV acquisition linked to bacterial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal microbiota.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>IMPORTANCE</title><p>Variations in the vaginal microbiota, especially shifts away from <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-dominant microbiota, are associated with differential risks of acquiring HIV or other sexually transmitted infections.

Cervical mucus flows by gravitational and/or abdominal pressure through the cervical os into the vaginal canal (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), where it is modified by fluid and ion exchange (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), shed epithelial cells, and the vaginal microbiota (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Thus, mucus secretions coating the vaginal epithelium are frequently referred to as cervicovaginal mucus (CVM) to emphasize both its origin and the unique physicochemical properties that differentiate CVM from cervical mucus. CVM is critical to reproductive health not only as a lubricant that minimizes physical trauma to the underlying epithelium during coitus but also by serving as the first line of defense against transmission of infectious virions.</p><p>Vaginal microbes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) can modify CVM biochemically to an extent not yet fully understood (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Until recently, the primary method for characterizing the vaginal microbiota was Nugent scoring, a morphology-based evaluation of the abundance of rod-shaped, Gram-positive <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. (the most prevalent bacteria in the vagina) and Gram-variable polymicrobial communities (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Advances in high-throughput-sequencing technology based on analysis of the 16S rRNA gene now afford high-resolution culture-independent molecular methods that reveal the full diversity of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. and other commensal or pathogenic microbes present in the vaginal microbiota, as well as the dynamic nature of shifts between different microbial communities over short temporal scales (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Among the four most common <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species (<italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic>, <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic>, <italic>L.&#x000a0;jensenii</italic>, and <italic>L.&#x000a0;gasseri</italic>), an <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic>-dominant microbiota is found in about 14% of African-American women and over 45% of Caucasian women, while an <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic>-dominant microbiota and a microbiota comprising <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> and other bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) are found in 36% and 40%, respectively, of African-American women and in 27% and 10%, respectively, of Caucasian women (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>For vaginal transmission to occur, HIV must penetrate CVM to reach target cells in the vaginal epithelium (or penile epithelium, in the case of female-to-male transmission). CVM that either retards or immobilizes HIV virions can directly reduce the effective viral load that arrives at target cells and can potentially prevent initial infections altogether. In prior work, we measured the mobility of HIV in fresh human CVM and found that native CVM from a limited number of college students, the majority with vaginal microbiota likely dominated by <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic>, effectively trapped HIV-1 virions (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). A follow-up study on a different population of women by a coauthor of that initial work reported that CVM generally failed to trap HIV-1 virions (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Since there are substantial variations in the vaginal microbiota between women and within the same woman over time (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), differences in the vaginal microbiota between the subject populations may well account for the reported differences between the two studies. Thus, we sought to explore whether the vaginal microbiota, including different strains of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp., can alter the diffusional barrier properties of CVM against HIV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="h1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s1.1"><title>CVM with high <sc>d</sc>-lactic acid (D-LA) concentrations consistently traps HIV-1.</title><p>To reconcile the contrasting observations of HIV mobility in CVM reported in the two previous publications, we screened a larger subject pool than was included in our original study and observed significant variation in the mobility of HIV-1 virus-like particles (pseudotyped with a YU2 envelope) in fresh, minimally modified CVM that could be broadly divided into 2 categories (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="movS1">Movies&#x000a0;S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="movS2">S2</xref> in the supplemental material): CVM that traps the vast majority of HIV-1 virions (<italic>n</italic> = 17 of 31 women) and CVM with a substantial population of rapidly diffusing HIV-1 virions (<italic>n</italic> = 14 of 31). On average, the mobile fraction of HIV-1 was only 1.3% &#x000b1; 0.6% in CVM samples that trapped HIV-1 compared to 45% &#x000b1; 8% in CVM samples with a substantial fast-moving population (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>), and the average effective diffusion coefficient (<italic>D</italic><sub>eff</sub>) of HIV-1 in CVM with substantial fast-moving viral populations was ~20-fold greater than in CVM that effectively trapped HIV-1. In CVM samples that trapped HIV-1, virions were trapped immediately after addition into mucus and remained trapped for over more than 1 h of incubation; similarly, in samples that failed to trap HIV-1, virions remained diffusive even after extended incubation.</p><p>To begin to understand what might contribute to these variations in the diffusional barrier properties of CVM samples against HIV, we first attempted to correlate the observed HIV-1 mobility with three traditionally measured properties of CVM: pH, Nugent score, and lactic acid (LA) content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). Although CVM generally did not trap HIV-1 at high vaginal pH, lower vaginal pH (pH &#x02264; 4.2) was not predictive of HIV-1 trapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">E</xref>; note that a pH level of 4.2 is the upper limit of CVM pH measured under physiologically hypoxic conditions for women with what is thought to be a clinically &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; microbiota [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while the clinical criterion of a pH level of &#x0003e;4.5 for BV is based on measurements in ambient air). Over 25% of the CVM specimens with a pH level of &#x02264;4.2 failed to trap HIV-1, and the average pH of CVM samples that trapped HIV-1 (pH&#x000a0;3.99 &#x000b1; 0.04) was not statistically different from that of samples that failed to trap HIV-1 (pH&#x000a0;4.03 &#x000b1; 0.03) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref> in the supplemental material). HIV-1 mobility also tended to be greater with higher Nugent scores (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1B</xref>), which is not surprising given the correlation between BV and greater risk for HIV transmission (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, nearly a third of the CVM samples that exhibited low Nugent scores in the &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; range (0 to 3 [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]) failed to trap HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">F</xref>), and the difference between low-Nugent-score samples that trapped HIV-1 and those that did not trap HIV-1 was not significant (average Nugent score of 1.07 &#x000b1; 0.30 versus 1.67 &#x000b1; 0.49; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1B</xref>). Likewise, high levels of total LA were not predictive of HIV-1 trapping in CVM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">G</xref>), with average LA levels of 0.96 &#x000b1; 0.09% (wt/vol) versus 0.85 &#x000b1; 0.07% (wt/vol) for samples that trapped or did not trap HIV-1 among those with &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; LA levels (at least 0.7% [wt/vol] LA [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1C</xref>).

Therefore, we tested whether D-LA or L-LA content might help reveal differences in the barrier properties of CVM. We found that CVM samples that trapped HIV-1 at native pH levels generally possessed substantial quantities of D-LA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">D</xref>); in contrast, CVM that failed to trap HIV-1 generally possessed significantly lower levels of D-LA. Among samples with relatively high levels of D-LA (&#x0003e;0.3% [wt/vol]), 10 of 11 samples trapped HIV-1, with an average D-LA level of 0.52% &#x000b1; 0.07% (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1D</xref> in the supplemental material). While the lone sample that did not trap HIV-1 had a D-LA level of 0.39%, this sample also had a Nugent score of 6 (in the &#x0201c;intermediate&#x0201d; range bordering on bacterial vaginosis [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). HIV-1 trapping in CVM did not correlate with either the L-LA level or the D:L ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">E</xref> or C and F, respectively), and average differences in the L-LA or D:L ratio between samples that trapped versus those that did not trap HIV-1 were not statistically significant (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>HIV-1 mobility measured by average effective diffusivity (D<sub>eff</sub>) (A to C) values or fraction of mobile virions (D to F) versus D-LA (A and D), L-LA (B and E), or D:L ratio (C and F) for <italic>n</italic> = 31 CVM samples with a pH level of &#x0003e;4.2 (<italic>n</italic> = 12) or &#x02264;4.2 (<italic>n</italic> = 19).

Thus, we speculated that differences in D-LA levels between CVM specimens likely reflect the presence of different species of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis has shown that <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic> generally expresses high levels of both <sc>d</sc>- and <sc>l</sc>-lactate dehydrogenase leading to high levels of both D-LA and L-LA, whereas many strains of <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic> exhibit reduced expression of <sc>d</sc>-lactate dehydrogenase relative to <sc>l</sc>-lactate dehydrogenase, resulting in low levels of D-LA but not of L-LA (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). We thus hypothesized that the correlation between HIV mobility and the level of D-LA in CVM likely reflects distinct microbial communities present in CVM. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we characterized the microbial composition and structure of a subset of CVM specimens from our studies described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3A</xref>), and we indeed found that CVM samples with high D-LA levels that trapped HIV generally possessed an <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic>-dominant microbiota (group 1), whereas the majority of CVM that failed to trap HIV possessed either an <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic>-dominant microbiota (group 2) or significant quantities of <italic>G.&#x000a0;vaginalis</italic> (group 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref>).

This suggests that the majority of HIV-1 virions (diameter, ~100&#x000a0;nm) should not be slowed appreciably by steric obstruction, although it was unclear whether the pore size of CVM could be substantially reduced by specific vaginal microbes. To test this, we prepared polymeric nanoparticles (diameter, ~200&#x000a0;nm) coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to produce a mucoinert surface that prevents adhesive interactions with mucins, whereby the diffusion of the beads is limited only by physical obstruction from the mucus mesh.

To do so, we prepared &#x00394;Env mCherry-Gag-tagged pseudoviruses (i.e., without the HIV-specific envelope glycoprotein) and compared their mobility in the same CVM specimens to that of virions with intact envelope glycoprotein. We found that the &#x00394;Env pseudoviruses exhibited comparable trapping in CVM with high D-LA content as well as similar mobile fractions in CVM with low D-LA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.&#x000a0;S2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">F</xref> in the supplemental material). This indicates that the adhesive interactions responsible for trapping HIV-1 viruses in CVM do not involve HIV-specific viral proteins and may instead be based on interactions between mucins and components of the lipid membrane of the viruses.</p><p>Mucins, due to their dense glycosylation, contain many carboxyl groups that are negatively charged at neutral pH (i.e., COO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) but that become increasingly neutral as pH decreases and COO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> groups are protonated (i.e., COOH). Similarly, the surfaces of HIV and other enveloped viruses also contain a high density of carboxyl groups derived from either glycans on viral proteins or, more generally, human glycoproteins and glycolipids naturally incorporated into the viral membrane. Protonation of carboxyl groups both on the virus surface and on mucins may supply the protons necessary to form hydrogen bonds, and the extent of such hydrogen bonding increases as mucus pH decreases to approach the pK<sub>a</sub> of the carboxyl groups (~3 [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). Thus, we speculated that virions in native, acidic CVM samples that trap HIV-1 may be immobilized via multiple hydrogen bonds between surface carboxyl groups and mucins and that protonation of even a small fraction of carboxyl groups may be adequate to create sufficient hydrogen bonds to stop the diffusion of viruses through mucus. To test this hypothesis, we measured the mobility of carboxyl-modified latex beads (polystyrene [PS]-COOH) in a subset of CVM specimens. As we expected, PS-COOH was mostly trapped in CVM specimens in which the HIV-1 virions were largely trapped and displayed substantial mobility in CVM specimens that failed to trap HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4C</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.&#x000a0;S2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">G</xref> in the supplemental material). We further found that neutralizing CVM, which eliminates essentially all protonated carboxyl groups, reduced the adhesive interactions between HIV-1 and mucus constituents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.&#x000a0;S2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">H</xref>). Since &#x00394;Env pseudoviruses that lack viral glycoproteins on the viral surface also exhibited diffusion kinetics similar to those of pseudoviruses with Env, it is likely that the bulk of the interactions between the viral surface and mucins are via carboxyls on host-derived envelope glycolipids or glycoproteins rather than via carboxyls on viral glycoproteins.</p><fig id="fig5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>Comparison of average effective diffusivity values for HIV-1 in native versus neutralized (pH&#x000a0;7) CVM.

The primary association between mucus and HIV transmission is typically in the elevated risks for women with episodes of BV of acquiring HIV and various other sexually transmitted infections (STI). BV is commonly diagnosed in research settings by Nugent scoring or in clinical settings by Amsel&#x02019;s criteria (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), which include an elevated pH (&#x0003e;4.5) and increased watery vaginal discharge. It is thought that watery vaginal fluid allows HIV to more easily reach target cells in the vaginal epithelium (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), resulting in a greater risk of transmission. Consistent with this notion, we found that CVM with substantial (i.e., &#x0003e;5%) quantities of <italic>G.&#x000a0;vaginalis</italic>, a bacterium frequently associated with BV, failed to trap HIV-1. Surprisingly, we discovered that even differences in specific <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. can directly impact the barrier properties of CVM: CVM from women with an <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic>-dominant microbiota consistently trapped HIV-1, whereas CVM from women with an <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic>-dominant microbiota mostly failed to do so. Importantly, CVM that trapped HIV-1 virions also trapped &#x00394;Env pseudoviruses and carboxyl-modified latex beads, suggesting that CVM with <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic>-dominant microbiota may broadly preclude the penetration of HIV across different clades/strains as well as that of other enveloped viruses transmitted sexually.</p><p>Previously, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. were thought to be associated with only a moderate reduction in the risks of acquiring HIV and other STIs. Indeed, epidemiological studies suggest that the risk for women with intermediate microbiota or BV of acquiring HIV or other STIs is only ~2-fold to 4-fold higher than the risk for women with <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-dominant microbiota. Unfortunately, the common method of categorizing the vaginal microbiota in these studies, Nugent scoring (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), does not differentiate between different species of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> or account for the potentially rapidly fluctuating nature of the vaginal microbiota (Nugent scoring is typically performed only at the onset of a clinical trial rather than throughout the trial, while episodes of BV may last only a few days at a time [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). Recent evidence has shown that <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic> is commonly found in women who have had episodes of BV or intermediate microbiota (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). It is thus very likely that a significant population of women with an <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic>-dominant microbiota that frequently shifts to an intermediate microbiota or BV may have been included in the &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; protective vaginal microbiota group in prior epidemiological studies. This, in turn, suggests that the risks of acquiring STIs when a woman possesses an <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic>-dominant microbiota (and, potentially, other <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. besides <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic>) are likely markedly lower than previously estimated. If true, this implies that methods ensuring an <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic>-dominant microbiota may be among the most effective means of reducing vaginal HIV transmission.</p><p>We posit that <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic> may mediate vaginal protection against HIV by at least three mechanisms: (i) enhanced trapping of viruses via hydrogen bonding to mucins at low pH, (ii) direct inactivation of cell-free or cell-associated HIV through secreted lactic acid (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and (iii) inhibition of other bacteria that could compromise CVM barrier properties and thereby elevate risks for HIV acquisition. First, lactic acid continuously secreted by <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. creates an acidic environment in the range of pH&#x000a0;3.5 to 4 under anaerobic conditions (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Numerous studies have shown that <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic> produces not only more D-LA but also more total LA than <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic>, with correspondingly lower pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3C</xref>) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Lower pH, in turn, promotes hydrogen bonding among carboxylic acid groups, which our studies suggest likely play a role in interactions between the virus surface and mucins. Greater LA secretion may also lead to more-rapid restoration of the native acidic environment upon exposure to semen. Second, in addition to serving as a marker of the diffusional barrier properties of CVM, there is emerging evidence that LA may facilitate protection by other mechanisms. For example, LA acidification can rapidly inactivate sperm as well as prevent vaginal colonization by nonindigenous organisms (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that LA possesses increased antimicrobial activity beyond acidity alone (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and Aldunate et al. showed that vaginal concentrations of LA can potently inactivate HIV (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Furthermore, low (&#x0003c;5.8) pH quickly immobilizes and kills human leukocytes (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), which, combined with the CVM diffusional barrier surrounding the cells, is likely to effectively inhibit any cell-associated transmission of HIV via immune cells present in the mucus layer. Finally, cultivation-based studies have shown that women with vaginal microbiota colonized by <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic> have a lower risk of BV acquisition than women colonized by other species of lactobacilli (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Lactic acid at low (&#x0003c;4.5) pH is a potent bactericide against BV-associated bacteria (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic> may also produce bacteriocins that ward off other bacteria, including <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic> and <italic>G.&#x000a0;vaginalis</italic> (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). <italic>G.&#x000a0;vaginalis</italic> can secrete high levels of sialidases and other mucin-degrading enzymes (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and it is possible that some strains of <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic> may also secrete enzymes that reduce HIV trapping in CVM, either by destroying the mucin network that holds adhered viruses in place or by cleaving binding groups on mucins that HIV virions bind to in <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic>-dominant CVM. The various extents to which HIV and carboxyl-modified latex beads were trapped in native CVM may thus reflect various concentrations of bacterial enzymes in CVM, which in turn would impact the extent to which mucins are altered biochemically. Once mucins are degraded, their ability to trap HIV is likely irreversibly compromised. Thus, addition of exogenous D-LA did not enhance trapping, and we speculate that addition of <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic> to <italic>ex vivo</italic> CVM also would not facilitate trapping. In contrast to <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic>, <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic> does not appear to produce bacteriocins (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), which may contribute to a higher frequency of shifts to intermediate or BV microbiota. In general, the presence of <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic> has been found to correlate with vaginal metabolic profiles that are intermediate with respect to those correlated with BV-associated bacteria and <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic> (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), although such studies have yet to reveal additional metabolite differences specifically attributable to <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic> versus <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic>. (Note that while <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic> is thought to be a hydrogen peroxide producer and <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic> a nonproducer [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], this difference is unlikely to be relevant <italic>in vivo</italic>, since hydrogen peroxide production requires aerobic conditions and the vagina is typically hypoxic [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].) The combination of the factors discussed above may explain why no single CVM characteristic measured in this study&#x02014;pH, Nugent scores, total lactic acid, or even D-LA&#x02014;correlated as strongly with HIV mobility as did the vaginal microbiota.</p><p>CVM can exhibit markedly different macroscopic characteristics (e.g., color and consistency) over time as well as between women. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the physical properties of the local environment (i.e., at the length scale of HIV virions) that enable or block HIV diffusional mobility in CVM are distinct from the macroscopic physical properties of the mucus gel (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). For example, in our previous study (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), as well as the current work, the bulk viscoelasticities of CVM did not appear to differ between the CVM specimens that trapped HIV and those that failed to trap HIV, including those with substantial quantities of <italic>G.&#x000a0;vaginalis</italic>. Likewise, variations in the macroscopic properties of CVM do not necessarily compromise its ability to serve as an effective and consistent diffusional barrier against HIV and other STIs. Consequently, the key to harnessing CVM as a protective barrier is to better understand the complex molecular and biophysical interactions that occur within CVM, and our current effort to link vaginal microbial communities to HIV mobility in CVM provides important first clues as to how the innate diffusional barrier properties of CVM may be reinforced against STIs.</p><p>Trapping or even slowing viruses in mucus is likely an effective mechanism of mucosal protection that operates not only by reducing the viral load arriving at target cells and purging trapped viruses by natural mucus clearance mechanisms but also by increasing the likelihood of inactivation via other innate protective mechanisms (e.g., defensins, thermal inactivation, etc. [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]) while virus penetration of mucus is delayed. The potential effectiveness of trapping in mucus is perhaps best exemplified by studies in reproductive biology: sperm trapped in mucus by antisperm antibodies are excluded from contacting target cells (i.e., eggs), and the inability of sperm to penetrate mucus correlates strongly with infertility (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Recently, we showed that mucosal IgG against herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) can trap HSV-1 in CVM at subneutralizing concentrations and that even a nonneutralizing IgG can block vaginal Herpes transmission in mice by trapping viruses in mucus (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). (Note that while it is also possible for HIV to be trapped by HIV-binding IgG, this mechanism is unlikely to have played a role in the current study, since samples were obtained from individuals who self-reported as HIV negative.) Our current finding that <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic> can enhance the diffusional barrier properties of native CVM adds to emerging insights into the mechanisms of both innate and adaptive vaginal mucosal immune protection based on trapping viruses in mucus.</p><p>It is important to note that our discoveries have been made possible only by investigation of pathogen mobility in fresh, minimally modified CVM collected from a relatively large number of women. Few prior studies of mucosal protection have been performed with human mucus secretions <italic>ex vivo</italic>, since fresh mucus gel is more difficult to obtain and handle than diluted fluids from lavages or swabs or from mucins isolated from cell cultures. We anticipate that investigating the effect of exposure to semen will also be critical to fully understanding CVM barrier functions <italic>in vivo</italic>. Semen contains degradative enzymes that may alter mucins and/or the HIV surface (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In addition, HIV transmitted from ejaculate to CVM may be coated with proteins or other semen components that affect HIV diffusion in CVM. Perhaps most importantly, semen transiently dilutes and neutralizes CVM (the entire vagina becomes acidic again within minutes to hours, depending on the rate of postcoital discharge of semen [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]), which can interfere with its ability to block HIV. Nevertheless, semen is unlikely to fully mix with mucus, and there is likely to be a pH gradient within the mucus layer that is more acidic closer to the epithelium, where lactobacilli are most abundant. Further studies using fresh <italic>ex vivo</italic> semen and mucus gels from women with diverse microbiota, and in greater numbers of samples, will afford a better understanding of the barrier properties of physiological mucus secretions and will likely lead to the development of novel approaches to reinforce the mucosal barrier against pathogens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="h3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3.1"><title>Preparation of fluorescent HIV-1 and &#x00394;Env pseudoviruses.</title><p>Replication-defective HIV-1, internally labeled with an mCherry-Gag construct to avoid alteration of the viral surface, was prepared by transfection of 293T cells with plasmids encoding NL4-3Luc<sup>+</sup>Vpr<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Env<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, Gag-mCherry, and YU2 Env in a 4:1:1 ratio.

The translational motions of the particles were recorded using an electron multiplying charge-coupled-device (EMCCD) camera (Evolve 512; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) mounted on an inverted epifluorescence microscope (AxioObserver D1; Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with an Alpha Plan-Apo 100&#x000d7;/1.46 numerical-aperture (NA) objective, an environmental (temperature and CO<sub>2</sub>)-control chamber, and a light-emitting-diode (LED) light source (Lumencor Light Engine DAPI/GFP/543/623/690).

Particle trajectories (<italic>xy</italic> locations) were obtained using MatLab software, following methods originally developed in IDL by Crocker and Hoffman (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Subpixel tracking resolution was achieved by determining the precise location of particle centroids by light-intensity-weighed averaging of neighboring pixels. Trajectories were analyzed using a frame-by-frame approach (Y.-Y. Wang, K. L. Nunn, D. Harit, S. A. McKinley, and S. K.

This approach minimizes bias toward faster-moving particle subpopulations due to the particles potentially moving into and out of the focal plane multiple times throughout the course of a movie (this results in multiple traces, whereas only a single trace is typically recorded for a trapped particle). Trajectories of &#x02265;40 particles per frame on average were analyzed for each experiment, which typically corresponds to &#x0003e;100 individual particle traces throughout the video and is consistent with the extent of sampling in our previous work (Wang et al., submitted).

We next grouped the remaining CVM specimens based on whether they were <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic>-dominant (group 1) or <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic>-dominant (group 2) to determine whether <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic> and <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic> have differential effects on CVM barrier properties.</p></sec><sec id="s3.6"><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>Statistical comparisons were limited to two groups (CVM samples that trapped HIV-1 versus those that did not trap HIV-1 and CVM samples with microbiota dominated by <italic>L.&#x000a0;crispatus</italic> versus those dominated by <italic>L.&#x000a0;iners</italic> or containing substantial <italic>G.&#x000a0;vaginalis</italic>). A one-tailed Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>&#x000a0;test, assuming unequal variances, was used for all comparisons. Differences were deemed significant at an alpha level of 0.05.
