GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, which inhibit the physiological inactivation of endogenous GLP-1, are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Using the Metabochip, we identified three novel genetic loci with large effects (30&#x02013;40%) on GLP-1&#x02013;stimulated insulin secretion during hyperglycemic clamps in nondiabetic Caucasian individuals (<italic>TMEM114</italic>;<italic> CHST3</italic> and <italic>CTRB1/2</italic>; <italic>n</italic> = 232; all <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 8.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>). rs7202877 near <italic>CTRB1/2</italic>, a known diabetes risk locus, also associated with an absolute 0.51 &#x000b1; 0.16% (5.6 &#x000b1; 1.7 mmol/mol) lower A1C response to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment in G-allele carriers, but there was no effect on GLP-1 RA treatment in type 2 diabetic patients (<italic>n</italic> = 527). Furthermore, in pancreatic tissue, we show that rs7202877 acts as expression quantitative trait locus for <italic>CTRB1</italic> and <italic>CTRB2,</italic> encoding chymotrypsinogen, and increases fecal chymotrypsin activity in healthy carriers. Chymotrypsin is one of the most abundant digestive enzymes in the gut where it cleaves food proteins into smaller peptide fragments.

Furthermore, it reduces glucagon secretion and exerts beneficial effects on gut motility, satiety, and food intake (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Based on these functions and the impaired incretin effect in type 2 diabetic patients, two novel incretin-based classes of glucose-lowering drugs have been developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). These include injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), which provide pharmacological levels of GLP-1, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, which inhibit the physiological inactivation of endogenous GLP-1. The enzyme DPP-4 rapidly inactivates endogenous GLP-1 by cleavage of the two NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In addition to their direct insulinotropic effects on the pancreas, injectable GLP-1 RAs, like endogenous GLP-1, lower blood glucose by inhibiting glucagon secretion and slow down gastric emptying in a glucose-dependent manner. Also, GLP-1 RAs promote satiety and weight loss. All these actions contribute to their therapeutic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Similarly, oral DPP-4 inhibitors lower blood glucose by stimulating insulin and inhibiting glucagon secretion but are considered weight neutral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Importantly, the treatment response to compounds of either drug class varies widely, and it is conceivable that both environmental and genetic factors may underlie these differences.</p><p>Previously, we showed that during hyperglycemic clamps, the insulin response to intravenous GLP-1 stimulation was affected by genetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) with an estimated heritability of 0.53 (0.33&#x02013;0.70) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). These findings indicate that genetic factors exert substantial effects on GLP-1&#x02013;induced insulin response and, as a consequence, may affect an individual&#x02019;s response to the GLP-1&#x02013;based therapies.</p><p>In the current study, the Metabochip (200k single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) was used to identify genetic variants affecting GLP-1&#x02013;induced insulin secretion during hyperglycemic clamps in 232 nondiabetic participants from two independent populations, the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) and the German T&#x000fc;bingen cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Subsequently, the influence of associated SNPs was tested on response to GLP-1 RA and DPP-4 inhibitor treatment in type 2 diabetic patients (<italic>n</italic> = 527) from the Netherlands (Diabetes Care System [DCS] West-Friesland) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and the U.K. (GoDARTS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Finally, gene expression in the pancreas and pancreatic islets and functional tests in healthy volunteers were performed to further elucidate potential underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Our studies identify rs7202877 near <italic>CTRB1</italic> and <italic>CTRB2</italic>, which both encode the digestive enzyme chymotrypsin, in the regulation of the incretin pathway, development of diabetes, and response to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study subjects and experimental procedures</title><sec id="s3"><title>Hyperglycemic clamp cohort.</title><p>We included 232 Caucasian subjects from two independent studies in the Netherlands and Germany. There were 126 subjects from the NTR, including 69 monozygotic (MZ) and 29 dizygotic twins as well as 28 of their nontwin siblings recruited from 54 families (120 normal glucose tolerant [NGT] and 6 impaired glucose tolerant [IGT]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The German cohort consisted of 73 participants with NGT and 33 participants with IGT who were all unrelated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).

All studies were approved by the local medical ethics review board, all subjects gave written informed consent, and the studies were performed according to the principles of the declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>All subjects underwent a modified hyperglycemic clamp with glucose and GLP-1 as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In brief, subjects received a priming infusion of glucose to acutely raise blood glucose levels to 10 mmol/L. Variable glucose infusions were used to keep glucose levels constant throughout the whole procedure. After the 2nd hour, insulin secretion was further stimulated using intravenous GLP-1 infusion (4.5 pmol/kg bolus for 1 min at <italic>t</italic> = 120 followed by a continuous infusion of 1.5 pmol &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 1 h). In the Dutch NTR twin cohort, slightly lower GLP-1 concentrations were used (1.5 pmol/kg and 0.5 pmol &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively). The near maximal insulin response was tested by injecting a bolus of 5 g arginine hydrochloride at <italic>t</italic> = 180 min. First and second phase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), insulin sensitivity index (ISI), and disposition index (DI) were calculated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). GLP-1&#x02013;stimulated insulin secretion was measured as the incremental area under the curve during the last 20 min of the glucose + GLP-1 stimulation (<italic>t</italic> = 160&#x02013;180). In order to increase the power and robustness of the analysis of GSIS in carriers of SNPs associated with GLP-1&#x02013;stimulated insulin secretion, we included another 216 subjects from two Dutch cohorts (Hoorn and Utrecht study cohorts) who underwent an identical hyperglycemic clamp but without the additional GLP-1 stimulation.

However, in publically available gene expression data from the MuTHER consortium, rs4148941 acts as eQTL for <italic>CHST3</italic> in lymphoblast cell lines (<italic>P</italic> = 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;51</sup>) and <italic>SPOCK2</italic> in both adipose tissue (<italic>P</italic> = 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;21</sup>) and lymphoblast cell line (<italic>P</italic> = 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Given the additional trend toward association with GLP-1 RA treatment response in diabetic patients, further research is warranted to establish its role in diabetes development and treatment.</p><p>Previously, the G allele of rs7202877 near <italic>CTRB1/</italic>2 on chromosome 16q23.1 has been identified as a risk factor in a genome-wide association study for type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and as a protective factor for development of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). We now report positive effects of the G allele of rs7202877 on GLP-1&#x02013;stimulated insulin secretion, which likely explains the protective effect of this allele on type 2 diabetes susceptibility. Furthermore, we observed decreased glucose reduction in patients treated with DPP-4 inhibitors. Our observations are further supported by the fact that the SNP increases gene expression of <italic>CTRB1/2</italic> in islets and pancreata and enzyme activity in stool, placing <italic>CTRB1/2</italic> in a key role of the enteroendocrine system.</p><p>rs7202877 is located in an intergenic region between <italic>CTRB1</italic> and <italic>CTRB2</italic>, encoding chymotrypsinogen B1 and B2, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db13-0227/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 3</ext-link>). In an in silico functional analysis using the regulome database, there is no known functional effect of rs7202877, indicated by a regulomeDB score of 5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.regulomedb.org">www.regulomedb.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). At least 50 SNPs are in high LD (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003e;0.8) with rs7202877, some of which might affect gene expression but require further detailed study. The linkage disequilibrium block also encompasses the breast cancer antiestrogen resistance protein 1 gene (<italic>BCAR1</italic>); for which it has been shown that rs7202877 acts as an eQTL in blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), although this was not confirmed in the MuTHER consortium data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). <italic>BCAR1</italic> is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues, including the pancreas. However, given that the SNP acts as eQTL for <italic>CTRB1/2</italic> but not <italic>BCAR1</italic> in the pancreas and alters chymotrypsin activity in the gut, <italic>CTRB1</italic> and <italic>CTRB2</italic> are the most likely candidate genes in this region, although a role of <italic>BCAR1</italic> cannot be excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The chymotrypsinogens (EC 3.4.21.1) belong to a family of serine proteases that are secreted by the pancreas into the gastrointestinal tract as inactive precursors, which are then activated by proteolytic cleavage with trypsin. Chymotrypsin cleaves food proteins into smaller peptides suitable for further digestion. Chymotrypsinogens are highly expressed in the exocrine pancreas, but expression in &#x003b2;-cells has also been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), which is confirmed in this study and in INS1E cells. Interestingly, in a study in mice, chymotrypsin has been identified as a target for DPP-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). A peptide fragment (VPAIQPVLTG) containing the DPP-4 H<sub>2</sub><italic>N</italic>-Xaa-Pro consensus motif was found at a 10-fold higher level in gut tissue from DPP-4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> versus DPP-4<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Our in vitro findings, showing reduced chymotrypsin activity after preincubation with DPP-4, confirm this observation in humans and may add to the observed differences in chymotrypsin activity.</p><p>As previously shown, altered exposure of intestinal L cells to nutrients, resulting from changes in food composition, point of entry (after gastric bypass), rate of gastric emptying, and gut motility, may affect GLP-1 secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). It could be hypothesized that the observed increase in fecal chymotrypsin activity may be associated with alterations in L-cell stimulation and/or gastric emptying as a result of increased nutrient digestion. However, incretin secretion during oral glucose tolerance test in nondiabetic subjects was not significantly different (<italic>n</italic> = 457) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db13-0227/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 8</ext-link>). It has been shown that oral treatment with chymotrypsin inhibitors slows gastric emptying and acutely reduces glucose and insulin levels after a meal in type 2 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Prolonged use of these inhibitors in a phase IIa cancer chemoprevention trial significantly reduced glucose levels in nondiabetic cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Interestingly, various vegetables, including potatoes and soybeans, contain high levels of trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors, and high intake of soy has been associated with reduced risk of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). These results support the observation that rs7202877 genotype, enhancing pancreatic chymotrypsin expression and enzyme activity in the gut, alters diabetes risk.</p><p>The divergent effect of rs7202877 on treatment response to DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 RA is intriguing. At present, our study design and sample size, especially regarding GLP-1 RA&#x02013;treated subjects (&#x0223c;50% power to detect an effect with similar size to the DPP-4 inhibitor group), does not allow us to establish the robustness of the difference in treatment response between GLP-1 RA and DPP-4 inhibitors and/or whether these findings have clinical consequences. To this end, a well-powered genotype-selected prospective clinical trial would be required. It is, however, of note that the G allele at rs7208277 has opposing effects on type 1 and type 2 diabetes risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), which may hint at divergent effects at the level of the pancreas and other tissues, most likely the gut, differently affecting type 1 and type 2 diabetes susceptibility and GLP-1&#x02013;based treatment responses, but this requires further exploration.</p><p>Type 2 diabetes, of which pancreatic endocrine dysfunction is a hallmark, has also been associated with pancreatic exocrine dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Furthermore, GLP-1&#x02013;based therapies exert insulinotropic effects, but their use has also been linked to pancreatic exocrine disturbances, including pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In this respect, the present finding is of interest as it identifies a genetic factor encoding a pancreatic digestive enzyme at the crossroad of pancreatic endocrine function and the response to GLP-1&#x02013;based therapies. It is of further note that there is suggestive evidence from the PanScan consortium that SNPs, including rs7202877, near the <italic>CTRB1</italic>/<italic>CTRB2</italic> region are linked to pancreatic neoplasms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Studies into the interrelationship of these genetic factors and phenotypic defects are mandatory to help increase our insight into the complex pathophysiology of diabetes and its comorbidities as well as our understanding of the regulation and physiological function of the incretin pathway.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the following. Due to the unique and comprehensive deep phenotypes, the sample sizes are relatively small, although results are replicated and size and directionally consistent in all independent cohorts. A further limitation is that most studies presented here only involve nondiabetic individuals, and thus our results do not necessarily represent the situation in diabetic states. The power in our pharmacogenetic studies is limited, and larger, better-powered studies are needed to check the robustness and clinical utility of our associations. Finally, the Metabochip focuses on loci previously implicated in metabolic and cardiovascular phenotypes, and although this increases power, it is likely that other loci exist that are not captured with this chip.</p><p>In conclusion, several loci are associated with GLP-1&#x02013;stimulated insulin secretion in healthy nondiabetic volunteers. One of the loci, <italic>CTRB1/2</italic> on chromosome 16q23.1, was further associated with a reduced response to treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors in type 2 diabetic patients. Carriers of the G allele at rs7202877 additionally showed increased chymotrypsin mRNA expression and activity in the pancreas and feces, respectively. These results highlight the importance of chymotrypsin in the incretin response and regulation of glucose homeostasis and may provide novel targets for preventive and therapeutic strategies in the combat of diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db13-0227/-/DC1">http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db13-0227/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="fn2"><p>See accompanying commentary, p. <related-article related-article-type="companion" id="d35e1415" vol="62" page="3019" ext-link-type="pmc">3019</related-article>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This research was supported by grants from the Dutch hub of the Biobanking and Biomolecular Research Infrastructure (BBMRI-NL, NWO 184.021.007, Grant CP1), the Dutch Diabetes Research Foundation (Grant 2006.00.060), an unrestricted investigator-initiated grant of Merck Sharp &#x00026; Dohme, and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF 01GI0925 and 0315381B).
