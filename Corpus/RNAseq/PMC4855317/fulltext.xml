Iron uptake appears to be copper-independent, but is regulated by zinc. Conversely, iron deprivation resulted in the transcriptional activation of numerous genes encoding zinc-containing regulation factors. Iron uptake is likely mediated by a ZIP-family protein (Ot-Irt1) and by a new Fea1-related protein (Ot-Fea1) containing duplicated Fea1 domains. The adaptation of cells to iron limitation involved an iron-sparing response tightly coordinated with diurnal cycles to optimize cell functions and synchronize these functions with the day/night redistribution of iron orchestrated by ferritin, and a stress response based on the induction of thioredoxin-like proteins, of peroxiredoxin and of tesmin-like methallothionein rather than ascorbate.

The unicellular alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> is an excellent model for investigations of the crucial mechanisms involved in the uptake of iron and other important metals, and in the physiological response to iron deficiency in unicellular photosynthetic organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The main iron uptake system of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> is a reductive system, very similar to that described in yeast: a plasma membrane reductase (Fre) mediates the reductive dissociation of extracellular ferric complexes, and iron is taken up by channeling through a permease (Ftr) associated with a multicopper oxidase (Fox) that re-oxidizes iron during its uptake (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]). The best-studied model land plant is <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, which also uses a reductive system (&#x0201c;strategy 1&#x0201d;, which also involves the excretion of phenolics and protons to solubilize iron), but takes up iron as ferrous ions without concomitant copper-dependent re-oxidation, via ZIP family proteins (Irt) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]). Finally, graminaceous plants can take up iron non-reductively (strategy 2), through the excretion of phytosiderophores (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Reductive iron uptake probably also occurs in marine microalgae (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]), but other high-affinity mechanisms for iron uptake likely also occur in these marine organisms, several species of which have no ferrireductase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Evidence is emerging for the existence of siderophore-independent, nonreductive iron uptake systems able to take up hydrated ferric species without prior reduction. A protein widely expressed by marine phytoplankton (Isip2a) was recently shown to participate in such a system, by concentrating ferric iron at the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in iron uptake by marine microalgae and, more generally, the precise mechanisms of cell adaptation to iron scarcity in the marine environment remain very poorly understood, particularly for the green algal lineage.</p><p>The cosmopolitan marine microalga <italic>Ostreococcus tauri</italic> is an ancient member of the green algal lineage (Prasinophyceae). Several of its features make it a very good model for studying physiological and genetic aspects of the adaptation of the green algal lineage to the marine environment. This microalga is the smallest eukaryotic organism described to date, it has a very compact genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], is easy to culture in laboratory conditions, and can be genetically manipulated by efficient homologous recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. We have shown that this species has no inducible ferrireductase activity at the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], and that it uses ferritin to recycle intracellular iron as a function of the day/night cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Ferritin (FTN) also seems to be involved in iron uptake in this species, because a &#x02206;<italic>Ftn</italic> mutant was found to have impaired iron uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Surprisingly, an analysis of the genomes of <italic>O. tauri</italic> and <italic>O. lucimarinus</italic> provided no clues to the iron-uptake mechanisms used by these species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p>We investigated iron homeostasis in <italic>O. tauri</italic> by evaluating the short-term and long-term adaptive responses of this species to iron deprivation by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in combination with physiological assays. We paid particular attention to the transcriptional response of cells to iron deprivation according to the day/night cycles, as previous studies had reported an orchestration of the transcription of biological processes around these cycles in <italic>O. tauri</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Our aim in this work was to identify clusters of genes displaying tightly orchestrated temporal expression patterns following the exposure of cells to iron deprivation and day/night cycles. We also aimed to compare the cellular response to iron deprivation in two green algae, <italic>O. tauri</italic> and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, based on the extensive work of Urzica <italic>et al.</italic> on <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. We found that the genes involved in iron uptake and metabolism were mostly regulated according to the day/night cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We further found key differences in iron metabolism between <italic>O. tauri</italic> and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, leading us to conclude that these two species do not use the same iron uptake system and do not respond in the same manner to changes in iron nutritional status. The transcriptional response of <italic>O. tauri</italic> to iron deprivation was unique within the green alga lineage. We therefore propose the use of this species as a new model for studies of iron metabolism in eukaryotic phytoplankton.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Global transcriptomic analysis reveals that iron homeostasis is tightly coordinated by day/night cycles</title><p>We used RNAseq to obtain a genome-wide view of the cellular response of <italic>O. tauri</italic> to iron deprivation. As we aimed to investigate the fundamental aspects of iron metabolism in <italic>O. tauri</italic>, we defined two different sets of experiments (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1; in both sets of experiments, the cells were grown under a 12&#x000a0;h:12&#x000a0;h light/dark regime). In one set of experiments (&#x0201c;condition 1&#x0201d;), we analyzed the transcriptome of the cells shortly (3&#x000a0;h and 6&#x000a0;h) after shifting the cells to iron-rich and iron-deficient conditions during the day and during the night (see <xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). These experiments were designed to characterize the short-term response of cells subjected to sudden and massive changes in iron availability. In a second set of experiments (&#x0201c;condition 2&#x0201d;), we carried out a series of transcriptome analyses over a 24-h period (3&#x000a0;h, 9&#x000a0;h, 15&#x000a0;h and 22&#x000a0;h after dawn) after the cells had been allowed to adapt to iron-poor or iron-rich conditions for one week (see <xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). These experiments were designed to characterize the long-term adaptive response of cells to changes in iron concentration. All experiments were conducted in triplicate and we applied a dedicated bioinformatics framework for analysis of the RNAseq results (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). In total, we sequenced, analyzed and combined the results from 48 mRNA samples from algae grown in 16 different sets of growth conditions (S<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>16</sub>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1 and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This is, to our knowledge, the largest time-course transcript profiling study ever performed in <italic>O. tauri</italic>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Global analysis of changes in mRNA abundance. Gene expression data for all genes and all samples were analyzed by PCA. PCA is a well-established technique in multivariate statistics. The general principle is to determine new coordinate systems such that the first coordinate explains the maximal amount of variance in the data and successive coordinates explain maximal remaining variance whilst being orthogonal to the first [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. <bold>a</bold> Barplot showing the variability accounted for by each PCA component.

We first quantified the influence of these factors on the global variability observed in our RNAseq results. We carried out principal component analysis (PCA) on the complete gene expression dataset (all genes and all samples analyzed simultaneously). We found that the percentage of the variance decreased rapidly with increasing principal component (PC) number, with more than 95&#x000a0;% of the total variance accounted for by only five PCs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). This analysis identified the key factors affecting gene expression. In particular, PC1 and PC2, which accounted for 55&#x000a0;% of the variance, define a coordinate system in which samples are clearly grouped according to light/dark, whereas PC2 and PC3 (35&#x000a0;% of the variability) define a coordinate system in which samples are grouped according to experimental conditions (1 or 2) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The iron nutritional status also had an impact on gene expression (PC4 and PC5, accounting for 12&#x000a0;% of the variability) but of a lesser magnitude than that of the other factors. The expression of genes regulated by iron nutrition is thus strongly affected by day/night cycles, particularly in condition 2, in which cells were allowed to adapt to low/high levels of iron over several day/night cycles. It has been shown that the transcription of genes involved in biological processes in <italic>O. tauri</italic> is organized principally around day/night cycles under standard growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. We show here that the light/dark factor retains its predominant position under conditions of iron stress, suggesting that iron homeostasis is regulated according to the day/night conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Transcriptional regulation in response to iron deprivation is a robust cellular process that can be maintained for extended periods</title><p>Among the genes for which expression data were available, we identified those displaying significantly different levels of expression in conditions of iron deprivation (&#x02212;Fe) and iron excess (+Fe).

We found that 224 and 259 genes were downregulated in condition 1 and condition 2, respectively, and that this downregulation was mostly specific to the experimental conditions used, consistent with the PCA results (see above). However, a different situation was observed for upregulated genes. We found that 1,201 genes were upregulated after a prolonged period of cell adaptation to iron deficiency (condition 2), whereas only 128 genes were upregulated after short-term iron stress (condition 1), with most of the genes (75&#x000a0;%) upregulated in condition 1 also being upregulated in condition 2. Thus, genes induced less than 6&#x000a0;h after the shift to iron-deficient conditions were generally still induced after one week of adaptation to iron shortage (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3A), highlighting the robustness of the cellular response to iron stress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Iron metabolism in O. tauri involves many new proteins and pathways that remain to be discovered</title><p>We defined a set of genes including <italic>i</italic>) genes differentially expressed in a least two conditions, and <italic>ii</italic>) genes differentially expressed in only one condition but for which interesting functions were retrieved (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3B). For that, we developed a dedicated process for inferring gene function, combining information from multiple web resources (ORCAE, HHPRED and PFAM databases) and systematic manual inspection of the retrieve predictions (see <xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). We then defined 19 general functional categories (and associated subfunctions) and used them to classify 1,048 genes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3B). This list of genes, together with detailed information including function, subfunction and database search results, is presented in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1. The data corresponding to all <italic>O. tauri</italic> genes are presented in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Data Sets 2. Functions associated with the up- and downregulated genes are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. In condition 1, about two thirds of the upregulated genes belonged to the &#x0201c;Regulatory&#x0201d; (31&#x000a0;%), &#x0201c;Unknown&#x0201d; (23&#x000a0;%) or &#x0201c;Stress and redox response&#x0201d; (8&#x000a0;%) functional groups. The <italic>p</italic>-values associated with the functional enrichment of genes were calculated (see <xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) and the result was highly significant for the &#x0201c;Regulatory&#x0201d; function (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) and particularly for the &#x0201c;Zinc-containing proteins&#x0201d; subfunction (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1). The genes rapidly downregulated by iron deprivation were particularly remarkable in terms of their highly significant enrichment in the function &#x0201c;Development and growth&#x0201d; (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>), including the &#x0201c;Ribosome-related&#x0201d; subfunction (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1). These data suggest that the early response of cells to iron deprivation involves the recruitment of a large number of regulatory proteins (many of which are zinc-containing proteins) and a decrease in protein synthesis through repression of the translational machinery. This decrease in translation is consistent with the observation that iron limitation decreases the total amount of protein per cell as well as cell size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The massive recruitment of zinc-containing proteins (56 genes upregulated by iron deprivation encode zinc-containing proteins, mostly zinc finger proteins; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1) raises questions about the link between zinc and iron in <italic>O. tauri</italic> (see below). Condition 2 led to the differential expression of many more genes and the range of functional categories for upregulated genes was broader than for condition 1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In addition to the functional enrichments already observed in the early response (see above), functional enrichments (<italic>p</italic>-values&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.15) were observed for the functions &#x0201c;Metabolism&#x0201d; (3&#x000a0;%), &#x0201c;Photosynthesis&#x0201d; (4&#x000a0;%), &#x0201c;Surface&#x0201d; (2&#x000a0;%) and &#x0201c;Heme/Chlorophyll&#x0201d; (2&#x000a0;%). Most of the genes downregulated by iron deprivation were associated with the functions &#x0201c;Development and Growth&#x0201d; (10&#x000a0;%), &#x0201c;Carbon Metabolism&#x0201d; (7&#x000a0;%), and &#x0201c;Surface&#x0201d; (4&#x000a0;%). These data are consistent with the metabolic remodeling expected during the adaptation of cells to iron limitation. Surprisingly, 25&#x000a0;% of the downregulated genes were assigned to the functional category &#x0201c;Unknown&#x0201d;, a percentage much higher than would be expected by chance alone (enrichment <italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>). As proposed by Urzica <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], these proteins can be considered &#x0201c;pioneer proteins&#x0201d;, because they contain no domains suggestive of a particular function.

Unlike ferrireductase activity, iron uptake (from both ferric and ferrous iron) by <italic>O. tauri</italic> was induced shortly after the cells were shifted to iron-deficient conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), and ferrous, but not ferric iron uptake was further induced subsequently, after more than one week of iron deprivation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

Zinc-deprived cells displayed a deregulation of iron uptake, with higher rates of iron uptake than in control cells when the cells were grown in iron-rich medium (which suggests that zinc is required to repress iron uptake by the cells when iron concentration is high), and lower iron uptake rates than control cells when the cells were grown in iron-depleted medium (which suggests that zinc is required for the full induction of iron uptake by the cells at low iron concentration) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Figure S7). Consistent with our transcriptomic data (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1), this result suggests that zinc plays a more important role in the regulation of iron uptake in <italic>O. tauri</italic> than in other green lineage organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] or yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Iron uptake may be mediated by a ZIP-family protein (Ot-Irt1) and a new Fea1-related protein (Ot-Fea1) containing duplicated Fea1 domains</title><p>Other important proteins involved in iron uptake and intracellular iron trafficking in plants and in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> are the ZIP family transporters IRT and NRAMPs, which are widely conserved from bacteria to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

Ot-Fea1 contains three such motifs, which are absent in CrFea1 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>: Figure S10A).</p><p>The role of Fea1 in iron uptake by <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> remains a matter of debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], but we recently described a new protein with a C-terminal Fea1 domain (Isip2a, which also contains two of the motifs mentioned above) that plays an important role in ferric iron uptake by diatoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. A phylogeny of homologous Fea1 and Isip2a domains from algal proteins is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The Ot-Fea1 N- and C-terminal domains are monophyletic with the Fea1 domains of other green algae. Multiplication of the Fea1 domain has clearly occurred on several independent occasions, with the detection of an even number of domains ranging from 2 to 10 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Mass spectrometry analysis of iron-containing proteins in <italic>O. tauri</italic> led to the identification of Ot-Fea1 with a very good score as one of the proteins that are loaded with iron in <italic>O. tauri</italic> cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>: Figure S11). Based on this finding and those of our previous study on Isip2a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], we suggest that Ot-Fea1 plays a major role in iron uptake (probably in the ferric form) by <italic>O. tauri</italic>. The levels of this protein were also correlated with the effects of different growth conditions on iron uptake: protein abundance was maximal in cells grown in iron-deficient conditions, and zinc deficiency (more than copper) also increased Ot-Fea1 levels (and the level of iron associated with the Ot-Fea1 band on native gel), consistent with an effect of zinc on iron uptake (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Phylogeny of Ot-Fea1.

The fundamental difference between the roles of the ferritin proteins in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>O. tauri</italic> is highlighted by the different conditions promoting ferritin iron loading in the two organisms: in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> the major ferritin, Fer1, displayed maximal loading with <sup>55</sup>Fe in iron-deficient cells, whereas the <italic>O. tauri</italic> ferritin (ostta02g03400) was more strongly loaded with <sup>55</sup>Fe in cells maintained in iron-rich medium. Moreover, the total iron content of <italic>O. tauri</italic> ferritin was much lower than that of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> ferritin (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">14</xref>: Figure S12). This major difference probably accounts for the fact the major ferritins of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and green plants behave like most ferritins, as iron storage proteins protecting the cell against oxidative stress and storing iron for later use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], whereas the <italic>O. tauri</italic> ferritin behaves like a protein involved in intracellular iron recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], as does the ferritin of the diatom <italic>Pseudonitzschia multiserie</italic>s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], the ferritin gene displayed circadian regulation, with expression levels being highest at the end of the night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This strongly expressed gene (1167 RNK) was also upregulated (during the night only) by prolonged growth at low iron concentrations (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1), consistent with its role in recycling iron from iron-containing proteins expressed during the day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This result contrasts with observations for <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, in which both the ferritin genes, <italic>FER1</italic> and <italic>FER2,</italic> are strongly induced by iron starvation during the day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The authors suggested that ferritins, together with the manganese superoxide dismutase, could protect the cells against ROS, which may become more abundant when PSI function is compromised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. In <italic>O. tauri,</italic> the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (ostta01g04820) was repressed by long-term iron starvation, particularly during the day (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1; and see below: Stress and redox response).</p><p>As the main role of <italic>O. tauri</italic> ferritin relates more to iron redistribution than to iron storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], it remains unclear how iron is stored in this organism. The vacuole is the main iron-storage compartment in several organisms (particularly yeasts lacking ferritin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and a protein homologous to the yeast vacuolar iron importer Ccc1 is found in plants (VIT1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, the corresponding gene was unexpectedly shown to be upregulated by iron deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. We found a homolog in <italic>O. tauri</italic> (Ot-<italic>VIT1:</italic> ostta07g00660) that was repressed by iron starvation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Data Sets 2), consistent with a role of the vacuole in iron storage. However, it is not clear whether <italic>O. tauri</italic> actually has a vacuole, due to the small size of this eukaryote. Numerous small vesicles have been described in <italic>O. tauri</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and the storage compartment could thus be a specialized small vacuolar structure related to the polyphosphate bodies (acidocalcisomes) containing polyphosphate and metals described in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This hypothesis seems probable, because a gene encoding a typical vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-pyrophosphatase found in acidocalcisomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] is present in the <italic>O. tauri</italic> genome (ostta01g00980), and this gene was induced by iron deprivation, particularly during the night (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Conversely, the inorganic phosphate transporter (ostta02g02460) was strongly downregulated by iron limitation at almost all time points (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1), which suggests the existence of a strong relationship between iron and phosphorus metabolism in <italic>O. tauri,</italic> as demonstrated in land plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Iron could thus be stored in acidocalcisome-like vesicles, possibly as polyphosphates, rather than ferritin, as suggested by an analysis of the intracellular distribution of iron. When whole extracts of <sup>55</sup>Fe-loaded <italic>O. tauri</italic> cells were subjected to fractionation by gel filtration (FPLC), the major iron peak was associated with low-molecular weight compounds (&#x0003c;17&#x000a0;kDa; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM15" ref-type="media">15</xref>: Figure S13).

This was observed to some extent: one of the major sinks for iron concerns the use of nitrate as the nitrogen source. A repression of genes encoding a nitrate transport protein (ostta10g00950), nitrate reductase (ostta10g00920) and ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (ostta10g00930) was observed in both the early and later adaptive responses to iron limitation (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1). In parallel, a RWP-RK transcription factor (ostta14g01760) likely involved in the transcriptional response to nitrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] was strongly induced in all conditions, and a zinc GATA factor possibly involved in nitrogen metabolism (ostta07g03410) was also strongly induced (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Conversely, the ammonium transporter (ostta12g00300) was induced during the day in cells adapted to iron limitation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1), possibly to compensate for the lower levels of nitrate transport. Repression was also observed in all conditions for the gene encoding the [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster protein adrenodoxin, ferredoxin-like protein (ostta11g0770), and for key enzymes involved in the synthesis of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (several di-iron prolyl-4-hydroxylases) and in lipid metabolism (di-iron-containing fatty acid desaturases, sterol desaturase, fatty aldehyde decarbonylase/acyl-ACP reductase etc.) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1). Four 2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase (prolyl-4-hydroxylase)-encoding genes (ostta04g02880, ostta04g00640, ostta16g00350 and ostta11g00880) were globally repressed in iron-deficient growth conditions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1), with probable consequences for cell surface properties, because hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins are the major proteinaceous components of the cell walls in green algae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The downregulation of fatty acid desaturases would also be expected to change the lipid composition of membranes (see below). Other iron-containing proteins vital for cell division (ribonucleotide reductase ostta08g00560, JmjC domain cupin-like protein ostta15g00920) were not downregulated by iron deprivation, and a global upregulation of these proteins was even observed (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1), reflecting the optimization of iron use/redistribution to high-priority iron-proteins during iron limitation.</p><p>As stated above, the long-term adaptation of cells to iron limitation was largely determined (in terms of genome-wide patterns of expression) by day/night cycles. Thus, most genes were neither fully induced nor fully repressed, instead being up- or downregulated at different points in the day/night cycle. The genes encoding proteins involved in tetrapyrrole synthesis provide a typical example. Unsurprisingly, iron deprivation leads to some chlorosis in <italic>O. tauri</italic> (although much less pronounced than that observed in acetate-grown <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cells), and both the chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> content and the heme <italic>b</italic> content of the cells were significantly decreased by iron starvation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The decrease in chlorophyll content could result from both a decrease in synthesis (because magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester cyclase is a di-iron enzyme) and an increase in degradation: chlorophyllide <italic>a</italic> oxygenase (ostta07g02450), another iron-containing enzyme involved in chlorophyll <italic>b</italic> synthesis, was slightly repressed, whereas the pheophorbidase gene ostta01g02150 (which is involved in chlorophyll degradation) was strongly upregulated under iron starvation, as was the gene encoding pheophorbide <italic>a</italic> oxygenase (ostta12g01390), a key regulator of chlorophyll catabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1). The decrease in heme content probably resulted from the induction of heme oxygenase (ostta10g01650) under conditions of iron deprivation (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which probably made a significant contribution to the iron-sparing response by allowing the cells to recycle iron from heme. The <italic>GUN4</italic> gene, encoding a major regulator of tetrapyrrole synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], was also strongly affected by iron nutrition conditions, as a function of the day/night cycle, and the transcription pattern of this gene was consistent with the general transcription pattern for all genes involved in heme and chlorophyll biosynthesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>): in conditions of rapid iron depletion (condition 1) these genes were slightly repressed during both the day and night (rapid iron-sparing response, accompanied by a slight corepression of heme oxygenase), but when the cells were allowed to adapt to low iron conditions for several days (condition 2), the transcription profile of these genes responded to the day/night cycle, with a peak of transcription at the start of the night (accompanied by the induction of heme oxygenase), consistent with the actual concentrations of heme <italic>b</italic> in the cells over a 24-h period (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Thus, although the global level of transcription (over a 24&#x000a0;h period) of genes involved in tetrapyrrole synthesis was decreased by iron deprivation, and the total amount of heme was decreased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), the cells maintained the day/night regulation pattern of these genes as in iron-replete cells, probably to optimize cell functions and synchronize these functions with the day/night redistribution of iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and the redistribution of iron resulting from long-term iron limitation.

The early response to iron deficiency in <italic>O. tauri</italic> (condition 1) involves the recruitment of Hsp20-like and other molecular chaperones (ostta18g01945, ostta08g01350), and the induction of a peroxiredoxin (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase; ostta18g00200), but not of the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1).

Genes encoding components of PSI and PSII were also globally repressed after prolonged growth under iron limitation, reflecting compromised photosystem reaction centers and low rates of photosynthetic electron transport, even though the transcriptional profiles of these genes remained largely determined by the day/night cycles under iron-deficient conditions (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1).

There is one bHLH protein homologous to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> FIT1 (Fe-deficiency-induced transcription factor 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] in <italic>O. tauri</italic> (ostta14g01990), but the expression of the corresponding gene was not significantly affected by iron limitation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Data Sets 2), and the network of bHLH transcriptional regulators in the green algal lineage does not seem to be conserved in <italic>O. tauri</italic>. However, several Myb-like transcription factors were downregulated by iron limitation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1), and the transcription of many other transcription factors was induced/repressed in response to iron limitation (see the &#x0201c;Regulatory&#x0201d; functional category in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Data Sets 1). In <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, genes directly involved in reductive iron uptake are coordinately coregulated (together with <italic>FEA1</italic>), and it has been suggested that regulation involves the activation of genes under conditions of low iron availability rather than repression at high iron concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. We were unable to identify the equivalent of an &#x0201c;iron regulon&#x0201d; in <italic>O. tauri</italic>, <italic>i.e</italic>., an ensemble of genes directly involved in iron metabolism and primarily regulated by iron at the transcription level. It is however possible that the apparent lack of a clear iron regulon simply results from our lack of knowledge: as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>, there were very few genes that were upregulated by iron deprivation regardless of the day/night cycles and of the experimental conditions (like Ot-Fea1), but most of these genes encode unknown proteins. The same applied for genes downregulated by iron deprivation: very few genes were downregulated regardless of the day/night cycles and of the experimental conditions, and most of these genes have unknown function (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). In the overwhelming number of cases, iron controlled transcription differentially, according to the day/night cycles and to the experimental conditions (short-term/long-term response). The mechanisms of transcriptional regulation involved in the whole-cell response to iron limitation are, therefore, probably multifactorial and complex.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Clusters of genes globally induced (<bold>a</bold>) or repressed (<bold>b</bold>) by iron starvation and cluster of genes encoding zinc regulatory proteins. We performed a clustering analysis (using the k-means method) on the complete dataset; very few genes were upregulated in all conditions (experimental conditions 1 and 2, dark/light): these genes are grouped in cluster A.

As shown above, zinc had strong effects on iron uptake that depended on the growth conditions. Conversely, we show here that iron deprivation results in the transcriptional activation of numerous genes encoding zinc-containing regulation factors. Transcriptional effects thus probably underlie at least part of the connection between zinc and iron in <italic>O. tauri</italic>, through the recruitment of zinc proteins under conditions of low iron concentration. Such zinc regulation factors may be required for full activation of the Ot-Fea1-dependent iron uptake system under iron deprivation, potentially accounting for the incomplete induction of iron uptake in zinc-deprived cells.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our work reveals tight coordination of iron metabolism with diurnal cycles in <italic>O. tauri</italic>. This observation generalizes our previous findings that intracellular iron is cycled from the main iron proteins (during the day) to ferritin (during the night) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and that cell iron uptake capacity also varies over day/night cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

The earlier induction of the iron uptake systems in <italic>O. tauri</italic> compared to <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> in response to iron starvation may reflect differences in the role of ferritin in the two organisms: ferritin does not behave like an iron-storage protein in <italic>O. tauri</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and its weaker iron storage capacity may result in more rapid iron starvation than in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cells, which can use ferritin as an iron store. However, the rapid induction of iron uptake activities in <italic>O. tauri</italic> is not fully reflected by transcriptomic data: whereas <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, coordinately induces genes encoding ferrireductase, ferrooxidase and iron permease proteins (components of the reductive iron uptake system and ZIP family transporters) in response to iron deprivation, we could only identify one gene (Ot-<italic>FEA1</italic>) directly involved in iron uptake that was primarily induced by iron deprivation in all conditions (day/night, short term/long term response) in <italic>O. tauri</italic>. However, it is always possible that some genes unaffected by iron at the transcriptional level could be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. The difference in the transcriptional response to iron limitation in <italic>O. tauri</italic> and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> could result from several factors.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To our knowledge, the response of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> to changes in iron nutrition was never investigated according to the day/night cycles.

Homologues of the <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> Fea1/Fea2 proteins have been previously considered in the green algal lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], but Ot-Fea1 is structurally very different than Cr-Fea1 (it cannot be found by simple BLAST search) and presents unique features that make it a good candidate for nonreductive ferric iron uptake in <italic>O. tauri</italic>, as we recently showed for ISIP2a in diatoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Despite of several attempts, we were not able to generate a &#x02206;<italic>Ot-Fea1</italic> knockout in <italic>O. tauri</italic>, suggesting that the gene is vital for growth. We are currently trying to determine the conditions of Ot-Fea1 iron loading <italic>in vitro</italic> by overproducing this protein in <italic>E. coli</italic> and then purifying it and incubating it with extracts of <italic>O. tauri</italic> cells grown in different conditions.</p><p>Ot-Irt1 is another protein that is most probably involved in iron uptake in <italic>O. tauri</italic>, and it differs from other Irt-like proteins of the green lineage by the abundance of His-rich motifs (GHGHGHGHGHG). Grossoehm <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] showed that such His-rich sequences (which is further enriched by 2 additional H residues in Ot-Irt1) has a high entropy-driven affinity for Fe<sup>3+</sup> and might be involved in retaining ferric iron on the cytoplasmic side of the protein, thereby inhibiting further ferrous iron uptake by the extracellular side of the protein. This might be of particular relevance for <italic>O. tauri</italic>, since this organism is probably able to take up iron without prior reduction.</p><p>Other components involved in iron uptake by <italic>O. tauri</italic> probably remain to be identified. A better understanding of the mechanisms of iron uptake should account for the much higher efficiency of <italic>O. tauri</italic> cells to concentrate extracellular iron as compared to <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>: our work shows that <italic>O. tauri</italic> needs much less iron in the medium than <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> to reach maximal growth rate, although the iron requirement of both organisms is similar. This is the main reason why we propose <italic>O. tauri</italic> as an alternative model to study iron metabolism in the green algal lineage. To date, the transcriptional response to iron limitation in marine micro-algae was mainly investigated in diatoms. Some centric diatoms like <italic>Thalassiosira pseudonana</italic> have genes encoding all the components of a classical reductive iron uptake system similar to that of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In <italic>T. pseudonana</italic>, Kustka <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] showed that the genes encoding plasma membrane ferrireductases (<italic>TpFRE1</italic> and <italic>TpFRE2</italic>) and two very similar iron permeases (<italic>TpFTR1</italic> and <italic>TpFTR2</italic>) were upregulated in response to iron deprivation, while the gene encoding a putative multicopper ferroxidase (<italic>TpFET3</italic>) was not responsive to iron. In contrast, <italic>FET3</italic> and <italic>FTR1</italic> homologues are lacking in the genome of the pennate diatom <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic>, which suggests that iron uptake does not involve a ferroxidase-permease complex in this species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The transcriptional response of <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> to iron starvation involves the strong upregulation of <italic>ISIP</italic> genes (Iron Starvation Induced Proteins), among which <italic>ISIP2A</italic>, encoding a protein that concentrates iron at the cell surface and facilitates its uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. There is thus some similarity between <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> and <italic>O. tauri</italic>, since both species lack the classical components of a reductive iron uptake system (although <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>, but not <italic>O. tauri</italic> has an inducible ferrireductase activity) and both species respond to iron deprivation by inducing proteins that are phylogenetically related (through the Fea1 domain): Isip2a (for <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>) and Ot-Fea1 (for <italic>O. tauri</italic>).</p><p>Besides iron uptake, the transcriptional response of <italic>O. tauri</italic> to iron limitation differs from that of other chlorophytes (<italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, <italic>A. thaliana</italic>) by several important features, especially related to the stress response. An increase in antioxidant mechanisms in response to iron limitation has been demonstrated in various plants and algae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], and a key defense response has been shown to be mediated by ascorbate in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, in which iron limitation results in a 10-fold increase in cell ascorbate content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. At the same time, the response of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> to iron deprivation involves induction of the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and of both ferritins Fer1 and Fer2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. We show here that the response of <italic>O. tauri</italic> to iron deprivation is completely different: transcription of key genes involved in ascorbate synthesis and of the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase is unaffected by the iron status in <italic>O. tauri</italic>. As shown in other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], peroxiredoxin (induced by iron deprivation in <italic>O. tauri</italic>) may therefore be the main scavenger of endogenous hydrogen peroxide in <italic>O. tauri</italic>. Ferritins also behave very differently in <italic>O. tauri</italic> and <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, with respect to iron-dependent transcription of the corresponding genes, but also regarding the conditions promoting iron loading of the proteins (see <xref rid="Sec18" ref-type="sec">Conclusions</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There is increasing evidence to suggest that several marine microalgae have iron uptake systems different from those in terrestrial organisms, involving for example, the nonreductive uptake of inorganic ferric species, as an adaptation to the extreme scarcity of iron prevailing over vast ocean regions. <italic>O. tauri</italic> could therefore be used as an alternative model alga (to <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, the model freshwater alga) for studying iron metabolism in unicellular marine photosynthetic organisms. Our results show that iron metabolism differs considerably between these two species. <italic>O. tauri</italic> is much more efficient than <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> at taking up iron from media with low iron content and it can grow with as little as one hundredth the amount of iron required by <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>. This organism must, therefore, have powerful iron uptake systems. The novel protein Ot-Fea1 seems to be involved primarily in iron uptake by <italic>O. tauri</italic>.</p><p>One striking feature of <italic>O. tauri</italic> iron metabolism is its tight dependence on the day/night cycle. Among the genes displaying differential expression with a log ratio &#x0003e;1.5 for at least one time point after adaptation of the cells to iron limitation (condition 2), only 7&#x000a0;% were induced during both the day and the night (4 time points). The transcriptional response to iron limitation was therefore highly dependent on the diurnal cycle. This diurnal regulation probably reflects the intracellular recycling of iron between iron-containing proteins and ferritin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Regulation of the ferritin gene is multifactorial and ferritin itself has a regulatory function, possibly related to iron sensing. The ferritin gene is under circadian regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and is also regulated by iron in a complex manner: in short-term experiments we showed that high iron concentration in the medium resulted in larger amounts of the translation product, in experiments using a ferritin-Luc reporter gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, we also show here that the ferritin gene was upregulated only during the night in conditions of long-term iron limitation. Moreover, ferritin is itself involved in the regulation of its own gene, as we were able to show that circadian regulation was abolished for a ferritin-luc homologous recombinant (<italic>i.e.,</italic> when the ferritin gene was expressed with a tag that prevented the assembly of a functional ferritin multimer). Ferritin is also directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of iron uptake (because iron uptake rate was low in a ferritin knockout strain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These data suggest that iron homeostasis is orchestrated around ferritin in <italic>O. tauri</italic>. Such a mode of regulation of iron homeostasis has to our knowledge never been described previously, but could be widespread in marine microalgae: recent work in <italic>Pseudonitzschia multiserie</italic>s showed that the ferritin of this marine diatom was more involved in iron redistribution than in iron storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p>Another striking feature of <italic>O. tauri</italic> iron metabolism is its connection with zinc metabolism. Such a strong iron/zinc connection has not been described in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, and could be related to the particular mechanisms of regulation of iron metabolism in <italic>O. tauri</italic>, involving the recruitment of many zinc-containing proteins.</p><p>We currently know very little about the molecular mechanisms of iron uptake and homeostasis in eukaryotic phytoplankton, and this lack of knowledge is reflected here, because the genes displaying the highest levels of differential expression as a function of iron nutrition had unknown functions.

This last fraction accounted for most of the intracellular iron, probably stored in the form of polyphosphate complexes.
