Here we use intravital imaging of signalling reporter cell-lines combined with genome-wide transcriptional analysis to define signalling pathways and genes associated with melanoma metastasis. Intravital imaging revealed heterogeneous cell behaviour in vivo: less than 10% of cells were motile and both singly moving cells and streams of cells were observed. Motile melanoma cells had increased Notch- and SRF-dependent transcription. Subsequent genome-wide analysis identified an overlapping set of genes associated with high Notch and SRF activity. We identified EZH2, a histone methyltransferase in the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2, as a regulator of these genes. Heterogeneity of EZH2 levels is observed in melanoma models and co-ordinated up-regulation of genes positively regulated by EZH2 is associated with melanoma metastasis. EZH2 was also identified as regulating the amelanotic phenotype of motile cells in vivo by suppressing expression of the P-glycoprotein Oca2. Analysis of patient samples confirmed an inverse relationship between EZH2 levels and pigment. EZH2 targeting with siRNA and chemical inhibition reduced invasion in mouse and human melanoma cell lines. The EZH2 regulated SRF target genes KIF2C and KIF22 are required for melanoma cell invasion and important for lung colonisation. We propose that heterogeneity in EZH2 levels leads to heterogeneous expression of a cohort of genes associated with motile behaviour including KIF2C and KIF22. EZH2 dependent increased expression of these genes promotes melanoma cell motility and early steps in metastasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Intravital microscopy</kwd><kwd>melanoma</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>cancer cell motility</kwd><kwd>SRF</kwd><kwd>Notch</kwd><kwd>EZH2</kwd><kwd>Polycomb</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Melanoma is a skin cancer arising from the uncontrolled proliferation and invasion of melanocytes. Melanoma metastasis starts with the acquisition of motility in the primary tumour. Previous intravital imaging of B16 melanoma showed that motile cells had lower pigment levels and higher Brn2 promoter activity compared to non-motile cells,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> indicating that motile cells may represent a less differentiated subset of cells. This is consistent with studies suggesting that melanoma cells revert to a &#x0201c;neural crest-like&#x0201d; state during metastasis.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> It has also been proposed that melanoma cells switch between mutually exclusive invasive and proliferative states.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The proliferative state is characterised by high expression of the melanocyte transcription factor MITF and low Brn2 expression, whereas the invasive state is characterised as having Brn2 expression but low MITF expression.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> However, little is known about the signalling pathways that might drive the changes in differentiation and promote a motile state.</p><p id="P5">We chose to use intravital imaging of transcriptional reporters to monitor signalling of B16 melanoma cells during the early steps of the metastatic process. We focussed on two pathways thought to be important in melanoma metastasis, the Notch, and SRF pathways. Notch signalling is usually activated through membrane bound ligand-receptor interactions leading to Notch receptor activation, cleavage and the release of the active Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD binds to the DNA-binding factor RBPSUK (RBPj&#x003ba;) and leads to increased transcription of target genes.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Melanoma cells with constitutively active Notch signalling show increased motility in vitro and increased lung colonisation, through Notch mediated regulation of N-cadherin.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Furthermore, the Notch pathway has an important role in maintaining melanocyte stem cells<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and Notch activation in mature melanocytes is sufficient to induce re-programming and de-differentiation to neural crest stem cell&#x02013;like cells.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p id="P6">The SRF pathway links changes in the actin cytoskeleton to gene transcription. Actin polymerisation leads to a decrease in the myocardin related transcription factor MRTF-A binding to G-actin. MRTF-A (also called MKL) is a co-activator of SRF and subsequently accumulates in the nucleus leading to increased SRF dependent transcription.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Loss of MRTF-A in B16 melanoma cells leads to decreased experimental lung metastasis.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Depletion of the SRF targets MYL9 (myosin light chain) and MYH10 (myosin heavy chain IIb) also reduced invasion and metastasis. Another actomyosin regulator, RhoC, is up-regulated in metastatic melanoma cells<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and can increase SRF signalling.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Although both SRF and Notch are implicated in metastasis, it is not clear whether their activity is simply permissive for metastasis or whether they are dynamically regulated during different stages of the metastatic process.</p><p id="P7">In addition to transcription factor activity, the expression of many genes is influenced by post-translational modification of histones. EZH2 is part of the Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) and catalyses the tri-methylation of histoneH3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a mark usually associated with gene repression.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> During development EZH2 silences differentiation associated genes to maintain cells in a progenitor state.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> EZH2 is up-regulated in many tumour types including melanoma and increases in expression from benign nevi to metastatic melanoma.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Further EZH2 expression levels are coupled to BRAF, a common melanoma oncogene.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> EZH2 has also been implicated in cancer cell EMT and invasion.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p id="P8">In this study, we use intravital imaging to show heterogeneous transcriptional activation of the Notch, and SRF pathways in melanoma cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and activation of these pathways in motile cells. Genome-wide analysis reveals that MRTF/SRF targets and genes up-regulated in the Notch reporter high population show significant overlap. Further, these overlapping genes are regulated by EZH2. We demonstrate key roles for EZH2 in suppressing pigment production in invasive melanoma cells by repressing Oca2 levels. Further, we show that EZH2 enables invasion and metastasis by positively controlling the expression KIF2C and KIF22.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>B16 melanoma shows heterogeneous motile behaviour in vivo</title><p id="P9">Intravital studies of cancer motility have revealed heterogeneous cancer cell behaviour. <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> We examined the behaviour of metastatic melanoma cells using intravital imaging of B16 F2 tumours followed by cell tracking. The majority of B16 F2 melanoma cells were non-motile. On average 6.6% of cells were motile, with a range of 0-22% per field of view. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1Ai,ii</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supp. mov.1</xref>). Motile melanoma cells showed speeds between 0.4&#x003bc;m/min to 6.7&#x003bc;m/min. Further, the distribution of directions was significantly non-uniform, with melanoma cells predominantly moving towards the tumour margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1Aiii</xref>). Cell tracking also revealed that some melanoma cells moved as single cells whereas other cells followed the same path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">Supp. mov.2</xref>). Cells with tracks that overlapped in a 15 minute time window (see methods for a more detailed classification) moved significantly faster than cells moving in isolation, however there was no significant difference in persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>). We propose that cells following the same paths are using multicellular streaming<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> as a mode of motility, whereas cells in isolation are using single cell amoeboid motility. Quantification of motile cells showed that, on average, 44% of motile cells exhibited multicellular streaming and 56% display single cell motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Generation of Notch and SRF reporter B16 F2 lines</title><p id="P10">Heterogeneity in signalling within the tumour could account for the different behaviours of non-motile and motile cells. We hypothesized that two signalling pathways implicated in melanoma metastasis, SRF and Notch, might be differentially activated in migratory and non-migratory cells. To test this we generated B16 F2 reporter cell-lines to visualise the signalling status of Notch (using CBFRE::GFP reporter) and SRF signalling (using 3DA::2eGFP reporter -see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig.1</xref> for more details of reporter constructs). Stable monoclonal reporter cell-lines were made in B16 F2 cells containing a constitutive mRFP membrane label (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig.1</xref>) to aid visualisation and to ensure that any heterogeneity in signalling observed was not the result of heterogeneity within the starting B16 F2 cell line. Multiple SRF reporter clones were chosen, 1 3DA::2eGFP and 1 3DA::2eGFP Fos3&#x02019;UTR reporter clone (Fos 3&#x02019;UTR helps destabilise eGFP mRNA), but only 1 responsive Notch CBFRE::GFP reporter clone was generated. The veracity of the Notch reporter was confirmed by transfection of NICD together with mCherry to label transfected cells. NICD transfection increased the expression of eGFP, whereas empty vector alone had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2Ai</xref>). The 3DA::2eGFP SRF reporter cell-line did not show changes in eGFP expression following NICD transfection. In contrast, 5&#x003bc;M Cytochalasin D, which activates the SRF co-factor MRTF/MAL, increased eGFP expression in nearly all of the 3DA:2eGFP SRF reporter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2Aii</xref>).

To obtain more general information about the tissue structure, we imaged collagen second harmonic signal and used C57/BL6 mice with GFP-CAAX labelled endothelial cells.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Notch reporter tumours showed heterogeneity in Notch signalling with few GFP positive, Notch active cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2Bi,ii</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig.1C</xref>). However, we did note an exclusive relationship between CBFRE::GFP positive cells and the presence of melanin pigment within cells measured using near infrared stimulation of visible emission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2Biii</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p id="P12">The B16 F2 3DA::2eGFP SRF (and 3DA::2eGFP Fos3&#x02019;UTR) reporter tumours also showed that SRF transcriptional activity was heterogeneous <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2Ci,ii</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig.1C</xref>). 3DA::2eGFP positive cells were scattered throughout the tumour, both in small clusters and individual positive cells.

Cells with high SRF-dependent transcriptional activity had low pigment levels and vice-versa. This suggests an overlap between the motile low pigment cells reported in Pinner et al<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and cells with both active SRF signalling and Notch signalling.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Motile behaviour of B16 cells in vivo is associated with increased Notch and SRF transcriptional activity</title><p id="P13">Given the heterogeneity in Notch and SRF signalling and their links to melanoma metastasis we hypothesised that the cells with active Notch, and SRF signalling were more motile. Quantification of Notch reporter tumours showed that motile cells had increased Notch dependent transcription compared to non-motile cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2Di</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">Supp.Mov.3</xref>). Similarly, motile cells had increased SRF reporter activity compared to non-motile cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2Dii</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">Supp.Mov.4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig.2A</xref>). This indicates that active Notch and SRF signalling is associated with cell motility in melanoma. However, both Notch and SRF reporter activity was occasionally observed in non-motile cells, suggesting that each pathway alone was not sufficient for motility.</p><p id="P14">We next investigated subsequent steps in the metastatic process. Metastatic cells in the lymph node of Notch reporter tumours showed little GFP intensity, similar to non-motile cells in the primary tumour, indicating a lack of Notch signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2Di</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig.2B</xref>). In contrast, 3DA::2eGFP SRF reporter cells in the lymph node were GFP positive, similar to motile cells in the primary tumour, suggesting that SRF signalling remained active in cells that arrived at the metastatic site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2Dii</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Fig.2C</xref>). Together these data suggest a transient activation of Notch signalling during melanoma metastasis, but a more prolonged activation of SRF signalling.</p><p id="P15">The data above show that both Notch and SRF signalling are increased in invasive melanoma cells. This observation predicts that &#x02018;double positive&#x02019; cells with high levels of both signalling pathways should be observed. We tested this hypothesis by staining CBFRE::GFP Notch reporter tumours for the SRF co-factor MRTF/MKL. Activation of SRF signalling is associated with nuclear translocation of MRTF/MKL, therefore the activity of SRF can be inferred from the localisation of MRTF/MKL. Quantification revealed that cells with both active Notch and SRF signalling formed 5% of the tumour; this number corresponds well with the overall proportion of motile cells in the tumour (6.6% - shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1Aii</xref>). Further, Fisher&#x02019;s exact statistical test revealed a significantly greater fraction of double positive cells than would be expected if SRF and Notch signalling were independently regulated (p=0.0023).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Notch and SRF signalling is associated with a common transcriptional programme</title><p id="P16">Given that SRF and Notch signalling were increased in motile cell populations, we sought to identify any genes associated with both elevated Notch and SRF signalling, and if these genes might modulate cell migration and metastasis. CBFRE::GFP Notch reporter high and low populations were purified by fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) and subjected to microarray analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supp. File 3</xref>). Target genes of the SRF pathway in B16 F2 melanoma cells were obtained from Medjkane et al.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">Supp.File.3</xref>). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA, Broad Institute) showed significant overlap (p-value&#x0003c;0.001) between MRTF/MKL target genes and genes up-regulated in the Notch reporter high population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3A</xref>). Out of 145 MRTF target genes and 75 genes up-regulated in the Notch high population, 29 showed overlap between the two populations. These genes will be referred to as &#x02018;invasive cell population high&#x02019; genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, many of these 29 genes were not up-regulated when Notch signalling was ectopically activated using NICD over-expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supp.Fig.3Ai</xref>). This suggests that Notch signalling might be coincidently activated with the &#x02018;invasive cell population high&#x02019; genes, but not directly activating them. As a control we confirmed that CBFRE::GFP Notch high genes did show significant overlap with NICD Notch target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supp.Fig.3Aii</xref>). We therefore propose that the &#x02018;invasive cell population high&#x02019; genes are not necessarily Notch target genes, but that a critical regulator of invasive potential promotes both Notch and SRF pathway activity.</p><p id="P17">To gain further evidence that the &#x02018;invasive cell population high&#x02019; genes were associated with migratory cells in vivo we investigated their expression in melanoma cells with high Brn2 activity. The activity of a Brn2::GFP reporter is elevated in migratory melanoma cells in vivo<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and both MRTF target genes and CBFRE::GFP high genes are enriched in the Brn2 promoter high population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supp.Fig.3B</xref>). Further the &#x02018;invasive cell population high&#x02019; genes were enriched in the Brn2 promoter high cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supp.Fig.3C</xref>).

The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB, Broad Institute) was used to search for published gene sets with the most overlaps with the &#x02018;invasive cell population high&#x02019; genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supp. File 1</xref>). Interestingly, genes positively regulated by EZH2 in prostate cancer cells (identified by Nuytten et al.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>) showed significant overlap (FDR=1.22 &#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;14</sup>) with &#x02018;invasive cell population high&#x02019; genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supp. File 1</xref>).

EZH2 depletion did not affect cell viability nor induced senescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supp. Fig. 3D</xref>). GO analysis showed that genes positively regulated by EZH2 were enriched for cytoskeletal components (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supp. File 1</xref>). We confirmed that EZH2 positively regulates the expression of multiple kinesins and other genes identified in the microarray analysis using QRT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3Di</xref>). Analysis of TGCA data revealed strong positive correlations between EZH2 mRNA and KIF2C, KIF22, and TOP2A mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3Dii</xref>). Finally, GSEA confirmed a significant overlap of genes positively regulated by EZH2 in B16 cells with the &#x02018;invasive cell population high&#x02019; genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>).

Depletion of EZH2 resulted in a 2-4 fold increase in pigment as determined by cell pellets and two-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5A</xref>). Depletion of another PRC2 component, Suz12, also increased pigment levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supp. Fig.5A</xref>) suggesting that EZH2 may regulate pigment levels via PRC2-mediated gene repression. We tested the importance of EZH2 catalytic function by using DZNep, which inhibits EZH2 methyl transferase functions.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Treatment of both B16 and human 501mel cells with DZNep for 48 hours led to a marked increase in melanosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). We did not observe any consistent changes in mRNA of the pigmentation genes Slc45a2, Tyr, Tyrp1 or Dct following EZH2 depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig.6A</xref>). However, both siRNA depletion and pharmacological targeting of EZH2 caused an increase Oca2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5C</xref>). Further, Oca2 and EZH2 are expressed in a mutually exclusive manner across a large number of melanoma samples: tumours with high levels of EZH2 have low Oca2 mRNA and vice-versa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig.6B</xref>). Oca2 encodes the P-protein, a transmembrane protein localised to melanosomes<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and loss of function mutation leads to a form of albinism.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Depletion of Oca2 with two independent siRNA dramatically decreased pigment levels in B16 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5D</xref> &#x02013; cell viability was unaffected <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Fig.6C</xref>). The effect of EZH2 on pigment levels was ablated on combined knockdown of EZH2 and Oca2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5E</xref>), suggesting that EZH2 affects pigment levels through regulation of the Oca2 gene. Further, pigment production in B16 cells was highly sensitive to the levels of Oca2, because 50% depletion of Oca2 mRNA using a low concentration of siRNA was sufficient to prevent the increase in melanosomes following inhibition of EZH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>EZH2 regulates melanoma invasion and metastasis</title><p id="P23">Given that EZH2 can regulate the genes associated with motile behaviour in a mouse model of melanoma, we explored possible links between EZH2 and metastasis in human melanoma. Analysis of microarray data<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> comparing A375P (non-metastatic) and A375M2 (metastatic) melanoma cells showed that genes positively regulated by EZH2 are up-regulated in the A375M2 metastatic sub-line compared to the A375P parental population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6Ai</xref>). More strikingly, genes up-regulated in human melanoma patients who developed metastasis within 4 years compared to patients who did not, showed significant overlap with genes positively regulated by EZH2 in B16 melanoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6Aii</xref>). These data are consistent with a role for EZH2 in regulating melanoma metastasis.</p><p id="P24">We next investigated the functional role of EZH2 in melanoma motility and metastasis. Depletion of EZH2 led to changes in actin cytoskeleton regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6B</xref>). EZH2 depleted cells had an increase in cell area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6Bii</xref>) and a decrease in phosphorylation of the plasma membrane-cortex linker proteins, ERM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6Biii</xref>). We also observed a similar change in cell morphology on depletion of Suz12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supp.Fig.5C</xref>) suggesting a more general PRC2 regulation of the cytoskeleton. EZH2 depletion decreased invasive protrusions into collagen-matrigel matrices and subsequently decreased invasion in both B16 and 5555 mouse melanoma cell-lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6C</xref>). DZNep inhibition of EZH2 catalytic function also reduced invasion of B16 and 5555 cells. Importantly, we confirmed this finding in two human melanoma cell lines (501mel and CHL-1 &#x02013; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D&#x00026;E</xref>). Many regulators of cell migration and invasion are also required for extra-vasation and lung colonisation during metastasis. EZH2-depleted cells were significantly under-represented in the lungs 48hrs after co-injection intra-venously with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>). These data establish that EZH2 is required for efficient lung colonisation by metastatic melanoma.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>EZH2-regulated kinesins are required for invasion and metastasis</title><p id="P25">We next tested whether any of the &#x02018;invasive cell population high&#x02019; genes might be involved in EZH2-mediated melanoma invasion and metastasis. We focused on two cytoskeletal genes whose expression is regulated by EZH2 (additionally confirmed using DZNep&#x02013; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supp. Fig. 7A</xref>) and correlates with EZH2 mRNA levels across a large cohort of melanoma patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3Dii</xref>). Depletion of the kinesins KIF2C and KIF22 significantly reduced invasion into collagen-matrigel matrices in both B16 and 5555 mouse melanoma cell-lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7A</xref>). Neither kinesin was required for cell viability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp. Fig. 8B</xref>). In contrast, depletion of the KIF11, which is not EZH2 regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3Di</xref>), had no effect. Further, KIF22 depletion also led to an increase in the area of B16 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). Consistent with the identification of KIF2C and KIF22 as MRTF/SRF-regulated genes, siRNA-mediated depletion of SRF reduced the invasion of melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp Fig.8B</xref>). Depletion of both KIF2C and KIF22 significantly reduced lung colonisation in a short-term metastasis assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>). Therefore we propose that EZH2 regulation of KIF2C and KIF22 promotes the invasive phenotype of mouse melanoma cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S13"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">Relatively little is known about the initial steps of melanoma metastasis in vivo. We show that even in an aggressive mouse melanoma cell-line, 6-7% of cells are motile in vivo. This is similar to murine breast cancer models.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Most motile cells use an amoeboid-like single cell mode of motility, however roughly 40% exhibit a streaming mode of motility whereby motile cells share the same tracks. Both the splitting and merging of groups of cells moving along common tracks was observed. This suggests that multicellular streaming is not associated with stable cell-cell junctions that persist for long periods (&#x0003e;15 minutes). Streaming cells are also faster than singly motile cells and may be following pre-generated tracks in the ECM, potentially made by fibroblasts, as seen in vitro.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p><p id="P27">We show that Notch- and SRF-dependent transcriptional activation is heterogeneous in vivo and increased in motile cells. More detailed analysis reveals that SRF signalling is increased in both singly moving and streaming cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp.Fig.2B</xref>). Notch signalling is clearly elevated in singly moving cells, but the data is more ambiguous in streaming cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp.Fig.2B</xref>). This may reflect the lower range of Notch reporter cells or some mechanistic difference between singly moving and streaming cells. The cell-lines are clonal in origin, therefore heterogeneity in SRF and Notch activity is unlikely to result from genetic differences. SRF signalling is responsive to both soluble factors, such as LPA and SDF-1, and external physical tension.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Notch signalling can be activated through cell-cell interactions and hypoxia.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Thus many cell extrinsic factors can modulate SRF and Notch signalling potentially leading to signalling heterogeneity. We demonstrate that EZH2 function influences activity of SRF and Notch reporters. The increased levels of EZH2 observed at the tumour margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4</xref>) suggest that stromal cells enriched in this region may be responsible for the heterogeneous activation of SRF- and Notch-dependent transcription.</p><p id="P28">Increased Notch- and SRF- dependent transcriptional activation in motile melanoma cell population is consistent with previous work showing the importance of these pathways for melanoma metastasis.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, we noted that activation of SRF was not sufficient to drive cell invasion when EZH2 function was blocked (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp. Fig.8C</xref>) indicating that there are likely to be additional mechanisms by which EZH2 controls invasive potential. Although Notch activity is associated with melanoma metastasis it does not appear to be directly involved in regulation of cell migration. Depletion of RBPjK had no effect on invasion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supp.Fig.8B</xref>) and NICD over-expressing cells did not show elevated motility in vivo (data not shown). Notch signalling may promote metastasis by mechanisms unrelated to cell migration.</p><p id="P29">Combining the transcriptional reporters with genome-wide analysis enabled identification of genes associated with melanoma cell motility. Many of these &#x02018;invasive cell population high&#x02019; genes were associated with the cell cycle and the microtubule cytoskeleton. Our observations are similar to previous reports in breast cancer where more than half of differentially regulated genes in the motile cell population in vivo were associated with the cell-cycle and further the Polycomb proteins EZH1 and EED were also up-regulated.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Multiple kinesins were up-regulated in the motile population of both B16 melanoma and breast cancer<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> such as KIF2C and KIF23. Thus, the &#x02018;invasive cell population high&#x02019; genes are likely to be relevant in many tumour types. We show that EZH2 can positively regulate the expression of KIF2C and KIF22. How EZH2 positively regulates these genes is unknown as EZH2 and PRC2 are classically considered to silence gene expression.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> EZH2 may indirectly regulate these genes through silencing a transcriptional repressor, or it may directly methylate and activate proteins that positively regulate SRF and Notch signalling. EZH2 has a modest effect on the basal activity of SRF and Notch reporter constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3</xref>) and may make melanoma cells more responsive to cues that activate SRF and Notch signalling. The heterogeneity in EZH2 levels in both human and mouse melanoma is consistent with a role for EZH2 in regulating the switch to the relatively rare motile state. The epigenetic mechanism of action of EZH2 could imply that melanoma cells would remain in this more motile state for a pro-longed period.</p><p id="P30">Previous work has shown that the motile cells in B16 melanoma are less pigmented than non-motile cells.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> We show that EZH2 can control this phenotype change associated with motility, through regulation of Oca2/P-protein expression. We hypothesise that this is via direct PRC2 dependent regulation of the Oca2 locus as high H3K27me3 levels could be detected in multiple lymphoma cell-lines that do not express Oca2.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Depletion of EZH2 leads to changes in the actin cytoskeleton and a reduction in invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells. We identified two kinesins, KIF2C and KIF22, as playing a role in EZH2-dependent melanoma invasion. Previous reports show that KIF2C is associated with motility and metastasis in multiple cancer types.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p><p id="P31">Taken together, these data place EZH2 as a central regulator of both the amelanotic and migratory phenotype of a subset of melanoma cells associated with metastasis. In conclusion, we propose that heterogeneity in EZH2 levels leads to heterogeneous expression of a cohort of genes associated with motile behaviour in vivo. These genes include many kinesins, and a subset are regulated by SRF. Elevated expression of these genes is important for melanoma cells to respond to pro-migratory cues in the primary tumour micro-environment, and favours their extravasation into the lung parenchyma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S14"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S15"><title>Cells and tissue</title><p id="P32">B16, CHL-1, 5555 and 501mel were kind gifts from Richard Treisman, Michael Way, Richard Marais and Chris Marshall respectively.
