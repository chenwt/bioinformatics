Currently, Illumina Inc. (San Diego, CA) provides one of the most widely utilized sequencing platforms for gene expression analysis. While Illumina reagents and protocols perform adequately in RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), alternative reagents and protocols promise a higher throughput at a much lower cost. We have developed a low-cost and robust protocol to produce Illumina-compatible (GAIIx and HiSeq2000 platforms) RNA-seq libraries by combining several recent improvements. First, we designed balanced adapter sequences for multiplexing of samples; second, dUTP incorporation in 2<sup>nd</sup> strand synthesis was used to enforce strand-specificity; third, we simplified RNA purification, fragmentation and library size-selection steps thus drastically reducing the time and increasing throughput of library construction; fourth, we included an RNA spike-in control for validation and normalization purposes. To streamline informatics analysis for the community, we established a pipeline within the iPlant Collaborative. These scripts are easily customized to meet specific research needs and improve on existing informatics and statistical treatments of RNA-seq data. In particular, we apply significance tests for determining differential gene expression and intron retention events. To demonstrate the potential of both the library-construction protocol and data-analysis pipeline, we characterized the transcriptome of the rice leaf. Our data supports novel gene models and can be used to improve current rice genome annotation. Additionally, using the rice transcriptome data, we compared different methods of calculating gene expression and discuss the advantages of a strand-specific approach to detect bona-fide anti-sense transcripts and to detect intron retention events. Our results demonstrate the potential of this low cost and robust method for RNA-seq library construction and data analysis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The advent of ultra-high-throughput sequencing (UHTS) technology has invoked a paradigm shift in the field of genomics and transcriptomics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Metzker1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Wang1">[2]</xref>. It is now possible to obtain whole-genome scale information at a highly accelerated rate.

Together, these newly developed technologies provide new insight into biological systems. In particular, RNA-seq provides highly resolved gene expression data, enables the identification of alternatively spliced transcripts and facilitates gene discovery through annotation improvements. When compared to the standard platform of transcriptomics, microarray analysis, RNA-seq provides orders of magnitude increased throughput for a comparable cost, increased sensitivity and superior resolution and accuracy for expression profiling experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Wang1">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Much of the advantage and added functionality of RNA-seq over microarray analysis lies in the methodology of transcript detection. Microarray analysis uses an indirect hybridization-based detection method where a population of pre-synthesized and immobilized nucleotides serve as probes to monitor gene expression through fluorescence signals. Gene expression values are calculated from the fluorescence intensity or a ratio of the intensities. In contrast, RNA-seq uses direct sequence-based detection to quantify gene expression. Since no pre-determined probes are used, RNA-seq is considered an open platform, as no previous annotation of the target genome is needed. The dynamic range of gene expression derived from RNA-seq is much higher relative to microarray analysis, and is largely due to the fact gene quantification is performed by simply counting reads, while fluorescent intensity is usually constrained by a saturation ceiling as an innate property of the probes or the instruments used to detect the signal. For instance, in leaf sections photosynthesis-related genes are so highly expressed that they constitute over 30&#x00025; of the total transcriptome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Li2">[11]</xref> and can easily saturate detection limits in microarray analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Sawers1">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Despite the many advantages RNA-seq offers, it is still a relatively new methodology with developments continuing for both experimental procedures and subsequent data analyses. For instance, strand-specific RNA-seq protocols been developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Levin1">[13]</xref>, but they have not yet been widely adapted by the community. As one may expect from such a rapidly evolving field, no official strand-specific RNA-seq pipeline is yet publicly available from Illumina and only few are available from other companies (e.g. Epicenter). Additionally, no standard has been established for methods of processing RNA-seq data for gene expression estimation, normalization, comparison and experimental design. A few noteworthy computational pipelines are currently being developed, however, that are gaining community acceptance, these include the &#x0201c;Tuxedo package&#x0201d; - Bowtie, Tophat and Cufflinks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Trapnell1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Trapnell2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Langmead1">[16]</xref> that align RNA-seq reads to the genome, determine and align reads to splice junctions and calculate FPKM/RPKM (fragments/reads per kilobase of exon per million fragments/reads mapped) - a normalized value representing gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Mortazavi1">[17]</xref>. The Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) that was designed to quickly align reads to a genome, allowing gaps or deletions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Li3">[18]</xref>, is also widely utilized, but lacks the ability to align reads to splice junctions. Supersplat is another software program that aligns RNA-seq reads to the genome and splice junctions but does not support strand-specific protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Bryant1">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Although RNA-seq has a relatively short history, it has quickly become the method of choice for analyzing transcriptomes. However, one obstacle that hinders broad acceptance of RNA-seq is cost. While UHTS technologies have decreased the overall cost of sequencing on a base pair basis, the direct cost remains inhibitory for many laboratories to perform a large number of UHTS-based experiments. The current dominate RNA-seq platform provider Illumina (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.illumina.com">www.illumina.com</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Metzker1">[1]</xref> and its latest sequencing machine - Hiseq2000 (first commercialized during mid-2010) is capable of producing approximately 200 million clusters per lane that typically yield 180&#x02013;190 million sequencing reads post filtering (TruSeq Cluster Kit v3). When considering the cost of reagents for library construction, costs/sample can run close to $50 with additional costs for sequencing. Thus, cost remains a serious limitation to broader application of RNAseq technology in high-throughput applications.</p><p>In this report, we describe a low-cost and robust method of generating strand-specific Illumina-compatible libraries for RNA-seq and a data analysis pipeline to improve gene quantification and detection. By using the alternative reagents and protocols, we are able to reduce the cost to approximately $5 per library. We designed a series of expandable multiplex adaptors that permit pooling of multiple samples into one lane of an Illumina flowcell to reduce sequencing costs and improve experimental design. We also incorporate an aRNA spike-in control to validate library construction and sequencing and as an optional method for normalization. The experimental protocol was streamlined so that over 32 samples can be constructed in less than two days by a single researcher. Using this custom protocol and computational pipeline, we analyzed the rice leaf transcriptome. We detect previously un-annotated genes, improve existing gene models and map novel anti-sense transcripts. We also compare methods of normalization for calculating gene expression and describe a novel statistical approach to detect intron retention events. In summary, our method and data analysis pipeline substantially improve both library construction and data analysis, providing the RNA-seq community with an accessible, easily adaptable and robust tools for transcriptomics studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overview of the library construction protocol</title><p>The primary workflow of our improved RNA-seq library construction protocol does not diverge significantly from the standard Illumina library construction procedures illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026426-g001">Figure 1</xref>. However, we have implemented a number of key improvements at steps marked with red asterisks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026426-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Most importantly, we incorporated a step that preserves the strand-specific nature of mRNA molecules. In addition, we incorporated aRNA spike-in controls added to each RNA input before fragmentation. The aRNA spike-in controls are synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic> from four distinct human cDNA sources that have no homology to plant species (e.g. maize, rice, Arabidopsis, Setaria, Brachypodium, Barley, potato and tomato). The added aRNA spike-in control was used to validate sequencing results and provided an alternative parameter for normalization. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026426.s001">Figure S1</xref>, spike-in based normalization underperforms when compared to other methods of normalization. The principle of how strand-specific information is retained is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026426-g002">Figure 2</xref> and is an adaptation of a robust technique where the second-strand cDNA is marked with deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) in place of deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Levin1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Parkhomchuk1">[21]</xref>. We also simplified the fragmentation procedure for the RNA input: instead of using a specific fragmentation buffer, we opted to use reverse transcription (RT) first-strand buffer (Invitrogen, CA) directly, which eliminated the need to purify fragmented RNA. The average size of the RT-buffer fragmented RNA is approximately 200 bps with a 5 minute treatment at 94 degrees as measured by the Agilent Bioanalyzer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026426.s002">Figure S2</xref>), which is the suggested size distribution for RNA-seq library on Illumina platform.</p><fig id="pone-0026426-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0026426.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Overview of RNA-seq library construction.</title><p>mRNA is purified from total RNA and fragmented to the desired size range. Next, the sheared RNA is reverse-transcribed to cDNA to form a DNA/RNA hybrid. The double-stranded cDNA is then synthesized, end-repaired and adenylated. Illumina adaptors are ligated to the processed double-stranded DNA and size selected. Finally, the size-selected ligated DNA products are amplified using primers to produce a sequence-ready library.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0026426.g001"/></fig><fig id="pone-0026426-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0026426.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Enforcing strand specificity using dUTP.</title><p>dTTP is substituted with dUTP during second strand cDNA synthesis.

PCR amplification of this single strand confers strand specificity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0026426.g002"/></fig><p>The other important enhancement in our protocol is the simplification of purification steps during library construction. Purification is particularly important for the dUTP-based strand-specific protocol to ensure there is no carryover of dTTP after first strand synthesis that may compromise the strand-specificity of the final library. For all the purification steps, we used SPRI (Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization) paramagnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, Danvers, MA), which reduces the cost and time needed for purification, as it is no longer necessary to use nucleotide purification columns (e.g. Qiagen RNA/DNA purification columns). Furthermore, using the SPRI beads, we developed a novel method to obtain the desired size distribution of fragmented RNA by replacing the stock buffer of the SPRI bead suspension with varying concentrations of polyethylene glycerol m.w. 8000 (PEG-8000). Our approach replaces the time-consuming gel-based size-selection method, and improves yield of purified fragments. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026426.s003">Figure S3</xref> demonstrates the use of different PEG-8000 concentrations to size fractionate RNA and the corresponding library size distribution analyzed by ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). It is known that variation in library size affects how clusters are generated on the Illumina flowcell and base-calling quality. When the size distribution is large, fewer clusters are generated that are suitable for base-calling (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.illumina.com">www.illumina.com</ext-link>). When the library is of desired uniform size, more clusters can be generated on a flow cell to produce a greater number of high quality reads. Using our approach, the library size distribution can be controlled (e.g. the GAIIx and HiSeq2000 platforms have different optimal library size requirements).</p><p>An important consideration when designing RNA-seq experiments is cost. With the recent increases in Illumina per lane read counts (up to 190 million), it is now desirable to pool multiple samples on a single flow cell lane. Based on our previous findings, 30 million reads is sufficient to detect approximately 90&#x00025; of differentially expressed genes in maize cultivar B73 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Li2">[11]</xref>. For organisms with much smaller genomes such as bacteria and yeast, current read depth/lane is well beyond what is required for accurate gene detection and quantification. Pooling multiple samples into one lane using indices decreases cost and can reduce experimental variation (e.g. lane effects). Additionally, using the methods described in this report and purchasing reagents from alternative sources, it was possible to reduce library construction costs approximately 10-fold from the current manufacture's recommendations (Illumina TruSeq kit). The list of reagents are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026426.s010">Table S1</xref>. In summary, our improved protocol reduces both the time and cost of library preparation and increases the quantity and quality of reads over standard protocols.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Comparison to non strand-specific protocols</title><p>To compare the output from the strand-specific (SS) and standard non strand-specific (NSS) versions, we performed two RNA-seq experiments in parallel using two-week old rice seedling leaf tissue following nearly identical procedures, with the exception of the dUTP labeling step. For the SS protocol, dUTP was used in second strand synthesis, whereas dTTP was used for the NSS protocol. Libraries were sequenced on six lanes of the GAIIx platform (three lanes for each library). Approximately 100 million 35-nt processed reads were generated for each library and RPKM values calculated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026426-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, the correlation of log<sub>10</sub> RPKM values from the two datasets is high with a correlation coefficient, <italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.976. As illustrated by the shaded portion of the chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026426-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, there appears to be a subset of genes with higher estimated gene expression values when the NSS protocol was used relative to the SS protocol. We reason that this shift likely occurs when a large number of sense and antisense reads map to the same gene. In the SS protocol only sense alignments are counted, whereas both sense and antisense alignments contribute to the RPKM in the NSS protocol. To test this hypothesis, we re-analyzed the data generated from the SS protocol and added the reads from both sense and antisense strands together. Indeed the new comparison, as shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026426-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, has a higher correlation with the <italic>r</italic> value of 0.987, suggesting that the NSS method does overestimate RPKM for a subset of genes. To visualize this discrepancy, we examined four genes with high differential RPKM values between NSS and SS protocols. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026426.s004">Figure S4</xref> shows alignment profiles using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Robinson1">[21]</xref>). Interestingly, some of the discrepancies arise from incorrectly annotated gene models. In a few cases, convergent genes were incorporated into the one gene model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026426.s004">Figure S4a</xref>&#x02013;c). In other cases, numerous anti-sense and sense reads mapped to the same gene model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026426.s004">Figure S4d</xref>), thus confirming our hypothesis that the SS method is a more accurate method to calculate RPKM values and can be used to validate gene models.</p><fig id="pone-0026426-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0026426.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Correlation of RPKM calculated from NSS and SS protocols and coverage statistics.</title><p>(a) Scatter plot of log<sub>10</sub> correlation of SS- and NSS-derived RPKM values.

The percent GC content is also plotted.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0026426.g003"/></fig><p>It is important to note that the average gene coverage profile is slightly different for the NSS and SS methods. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026426-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, the NSS protocol provides better coverage at the 5&#x02032;-end compared to the SS-method. This is a consequence of the SS protocol; fragmented RNA molecules are always sequenced from the 3&#x02032; end, and depending on the sequence length, sequencing may not proceed to the 5&#x02032; end. This bias can be partially negated by generating longer reads (in this study, we used 35-bps reads) or completely overcome with paired-end sequencing, where sequencing starts from both ends. We also observed a higher coverage towards the 3&#x02032; end of the average gene body. This is possibly caused by RNA degradation, since we used an oligo-dT based purification method that captures mRNA at the 3&#x02032; end. The other possibility is a PCR bias resulting from high GC-content that increases near the 5&#x02032; end of rice genes. Indeed, when we plot the average GC content across the average rice gene body, it show a gradual drop from over 50&#x00025; GC to just over 40&#x00025; GC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026426-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Analyzing anti-sense alignments</title><p>As previously mentioned, we used a slightly modified version of the dUTP method to enforce the strand specificity in our final libraries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Parkhomchuk1">[20]</xref>. We increased the incubation time with UDG (Uracil-DNA Glycosylase) to 30 minutes to enforce the complete degradation of dUTPs. From the 82 million aligned reads that were generated using the SS protocol, we detected approximately 3.88&#x00025; anti-sense reads according to the most current rice version 6.1 genome annotation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Ouyang1">[22]</xref>. This is slightly higher than the percentage of antisense reads detected in yeast using multiple strand specific protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Levin1">[13]</xref>. This discrepancy may reflect a true biological difference or a technical limitation related to the maturity of the genome annotation. That is, annotation for the yeast genome is highly refined, enabling a very accurate mapping of antisense reads to the gene space. Given the fact that the rice genome annotation is still being improved, some of the anti-sense reads are due to incorrectly annotated gene models. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026426-g004">Figure 4A</xref> shows an example where an incorrectly annotated gene model contributes to the over-estimation of anti-sense coverage. Based on sense-strand alignments, the upper gene model is likely incorrect (Os07g36090.3). The other two gene models (Os07g36080.1, Os07g36090.1) running opposite directions are supported by the aligned reads. In this case, if Os07g36090.3 is used for calculating the anti-sense alignment, a substantial number of reads would align to the opposite strand. This example clearly demonstrates the advantage of utilizing a strand-specific protocol, as it is difficult to resolve the validity of gene models with only NSS reads alignment (compare top and middle panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026426-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0026426-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0026426.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Survey of anti-sense alignments.</title><p>(a) An example of read alignment showing NSS- and SS-derived data for rice gene Os07g36090.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026426-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, a large number of anti-sense reads map to transcript termini (likely the UTR regions). We considered the possibility that a lower thymine (T) content at the ends of genes may have resulted in this profile, as regions with few Ts would serve as poor substrates for the UDG. However, this is clearly not the case, as the average percentage of T is in fact higher at transcript ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026426-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Previous reports in animals and yeast also support our observation that antisense transcripts are more abundant in the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTR regions, and these anti-sense transcripts likely play regulatory roles in modulating gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Mignone1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Finocchiaro1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Yassour1">[25]</xref>. Although similar analyses have not been published for plant species, our results suggest that comparable mechanisms are employed in rice.</p><p>The validity of anti-sense transcripts captured by strand-specific RNA-seq protocols is of great interest to the research community. To examine this within our data, we first compared the average percentage of anti-sense transcripts captured relative to the total transcript pool as shown by Levin <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Levin1">[13]</xref>.

Yet, we cannot rule out the possibility that these detected anti-sense reads are a baseline of anti-sense &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d; generated from either the limitations of the technique or a low level of antisense transcription present throughout the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Pickrell1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Lindberg1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Sato1">[28]</xref>. Interestingly, we also detected 1.88&#x00025; of anti-sense alignments from the two most abundant aRNA spike-ins synthesized by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription, which technically should not generate anti-sense reads. While it is possible that this is an artifact of our experimental method (e.g. incomplete digestion), it is still likely that the synthesized aRNA would contain a finite amount of anti-sense transcript (e.g. through template switching).</p><p>It is important to note that our results are derived from oligo-dT enriched mRNA populations, and it has been reported that most natural antisense RNA are not polyadenylated in mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Kiyosawa1">[29]</xref> and possibly in other organisms, suggesting there may be more anti-sense transcripts that escape detection using our approach. Alternative non oligo-dT-based mRNA enrichment methods (e.g. rRNA depletion) would overcome this limitation and provide a more complete coverage of natural anti-sense RNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Multiplexing using indexed adapters</title><p>One of the challenges of multiplexing samples is ensuring an even distribution of read counts across indexed libraries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Craig1">[30]</xref>. In the method described here, a combination of five nucleotides serves as the index with a T as the common fifth base pair to minimize biases caused by differences in ligation efficiency. The index itself is incorporated into the adaptor as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026426.s005">Figure S5</xref>. When samples are multiplexed using this design, they can be processed using single-end or pair-end sequencing on the Illumina platform. The read output starts with the index and a T followed by the target sequence. We tested a set of adaptors by multiplexing eleven rice leaf samples in one lane and sequenced the libraries using a total of six lanes on a GAIIx Illumina machine. The average ratio of indexed reads are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026426-g005">Figure 5</xref>. The percentage of reads derived from each of the eleven indices is relatively uniform, which is a notable improvement to an initial study where index adaptors were used (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0026426-Craig2">[31]</xref>) and comparable to Illumina's official multiplexing scheme with a lower cost. It is worth noting that the edit distances, or number of changes to transform one index sequence into another, are at least two among the 11 indices. Thus, with one sequencing error in the first five bps, a read will be assigned to a unique index. This is important, as we have observed higher errors rates at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of reads. By including reads with one mismatch to the index, it was possible to reclaim an additional 5&#x00025; of the total mappable reads (4.8 million reads).</p><fig id="pone-0026426-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0026426.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Average multiplex read distribution.</title><p>Bar plot of the read distribution among the eleven indices used for this study.

Instead of using the first base for calibration as in the GAIIx platform, HiSeq2000 uses the first five bases. Since the fifth base of the multiplexing index is always T, the calibration software overcompensates for the bias and no longer accurately calls subsequent reads. We have explored two approaches to resolve the compatibility issues. The most straightforward is to adapt a longer index design. Using this method we have tested four balanced 7-bps indices that performed well on the HiSeq2000 machine. From a single lane of HiSeq2000 sequencing, we captured 72,903,160 reads, of which 71,960,164 could be unambiguously associated with a specific index (98.7&#x00025; of total reads) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026426.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Another way to overcome the calibration issue is to spike approximately 5&#x00025; PhiX control (a common control sample for Illumina platform) into each lane with the 5 bps indices. Although we have used a PhiX spike-in successfully (Pinghua Li, personal communication), it nevertheless leads to a loss of total reads. Thus, with slight modifications our indexing design can be applied to the HiSeq2000 platform.</p><p>Illumina's official multiplexing protocol and kit enable one to pool of up to twelve samples, and the output can be deconvoluted to individual samples. While Illumina's approach to multiplexing is adequate, the associated costs of using official Illumina library construction kit become inhibitory for many labs when a large number (e.g. hundreds) of libraries are constructed.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Detecting significantly expressed genes</title><p>An emerging need for RNA-seq data analysis is to determine confidence intervals for defining significance in gene expression values. As a part of our data analysis pipeline, we determined the significantly expressed genes by comparing the reads that aligned to the annotated gene space (i.e. exons and UTRs) to the &#x0201c;non-coding regions&#x0201d; (NCRs) that are defined as regions of at least 5 kb away from any annotated genes. Our method is built upon two assumptions: first, the NCRs, by definition, do not generate a large number of transcripts; second, that gene annotation is accurate. Based on these assumptions, the reads mapped to the NCRs are likely due to artifacts of the sequencing method or library construction. For instance, DNA contamination in the RNA samples could lead to read placements in NCRs and thus can be used to estimate the background or &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d; level. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026426-g006">Figure 6</xref>, we calculated the significance of gene expression using the normalized coverage in 99&#x00025; of the NCRs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">methods</xref> for more detail).

Reads that map to introns may indicate alternative splicing and pre-mRNA populations but may also indicate incorrectly annotated gene models. To assign a significance value to a given intron, we developed a novel statistical model and an empirical Bayes method, similar to the one used to detect significantly expressed genes, to detect significant intronic alignments. For this test, we considered a number of factors that would affect intron detection that include: 1) RPKM value of the corresponding gene 2) intron length and 3) and number of reads mapped to the intron.
