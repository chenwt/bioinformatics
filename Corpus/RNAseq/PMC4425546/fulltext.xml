Here we identify variable DNA mismatch repair (MMR) as the basis of this variation. Analysing ~17 million single nucleotide variants from the genomes of 652 tumours, we show that regional autosomal mutation rates at megabase resolution are largely stable across cancer types, with differences related to changes in replication timing and gene expression. However, mutations arising after the inactivation of MMR are no longer enriched in early replicating euchromatin relative to late replicating heterochromatin. Thus, differential DNA repair and not differential mutation supply is the primary cause of the large-scale regional mutation rate variation across the human genome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P4">We examined 1Mb mutation densities along 652 fully sequenced human cancer genomes with &#x0003e;3000 SNVs (single nucleotide variants) per genome, originating from 16 tissues. This threshold enables more robust estimates of regional SNV densities in the examined samples, but it excludes cancer types with a very low mutation burden (Methods). Despite vastly different mutational loads between tissues of origin and between individual tumours<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, the relative regional densities were, overall, consistent between samples. In a principal components (PC) analysis, the first PC corresponds closely to the average densities over all samples (R<sup>2</sup>=0.99) and captures 86.2% of the non-random variability between the 1Mb windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-c</xref>). This estimate of baseline variability per PC (Methods) encompasses the non-biological sources of randomness in the data (e.g. low mutation counts per bin in some cancer types) but it may also include genuine biological variability, if it is particular to individual tumour genomes. The second most prominent PCA trend (PC2, 5.9% variability; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a, d</xref>) precisely captures the known hypermutation of the X chromosome in a subset of tumours<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Across the 652 tumours, we estimate a further 7.9% of non-random variability exists that is not explained by the general pattern of regional rates or by the hypermutation of X (in PC3-8, with 4.4% in PC3 only; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>).</p><p id="P5">This signal can, in part, be ascribed to tissue-specific mutation rates: cancer samples from 7/16 tissues were significantly shifted in the distribution of their PC3 loadings (Mann-Whitney test, FDR&#x0003c;1%). Liver, colorectal and B-lymphocyte tumours were differentiated by lower PC3 loading scores, whereas melanoma, breast, ovarian and lung tumours had higher PC3 loadings (tissues highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). To examine if these significant regional rate changes are associated to DNA replication timing changes, we used RepliSeq data from ENCODE cell lines as a proxy for the changes occurring in the cancers of the corresponding tissues. In all cases, the correlation of the cell line-specific RepliSeq signal to the cancer type-specific 1Mb mutation rates was most prominent in the cancer type matching the cell line, with a significant difference from the non-matching cancer types (FDR&#x0003c;10%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Similarly, the changes in average gene expression levels in 1Mb windows in tumour samples paralleled the changes in mutation rates in the same samples with significantly stronger correlations for the matching cancer type (FDR&#x0003c;10%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1g</xref>; example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a, b</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Visualizing the cancer samples in a PC plot revealed a group of outliers in a low-density area of the plot with extreme PC3 and PC4 loadings (box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). These samples derive almost exclusively from colorectal, stomach or uterine cancers even though most samples from these three cancer types clustered elsewhere on the PC plot. One feature particular to tumours from these three tissues is that they frequently display inactivation of the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway through mutation of MMR genes or hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene promoter<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Inactivation of MMR results in a high incidence of small insertions and deletions (indels) at simple sequence repeats - referred to as microsatellite instability (MSI) and used to phenotypically identify MMR deficiency - but also an increased SNV load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The outlier colon, gastric and uterine cancer samples on the PC plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>) were almost always MSI samples (phenotypically scored as MSI-high, MSI-H), suggesting MMR deficiency as the cause of their unusual regional mutation rate variation. To understand how the regional mutation rate differs in these samples, we plotted their mutation densities along the genome. The regional rate variation was substantially decreased in these tumours compared to in other microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumours from the same tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-c</xref>). The change towards more homogeneous mutation rates in MSI cancers was significant across many chromosomal regions, with ~72% of the genome being affected (1977/2748 1Mb windows, Mann-Whitney test on pooled tissues, 10% FDR; examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1e, f</xref>). Consistently, the regional rates in MSI cancers from all three tissues correlate poorly to replication timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e-g</xref>), gene expression levels and heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a-f</xref>). Moreover, the slopes of the regression lines between binned replication timing and SNV rates revealed consistent changes in MSI cancer samples when calculated separately for intergenic and for genic (intronic) DNA in the whole genome sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h, i</xref>). Very similar trends were observed in a broader set of 950 exome sequences of colorectal, uterine and gastric cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2g-j</xref>).</p><p id="P8">High mutation rates in uterine and colorectal cancers can also be caused by inactivation of the proofreading domain of DNA polymerase epsilon<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> (PolE). Proofreading is a result of a 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; exonuclease activity that enhances the accuracy of PolE by excising incorrectly placed nucleotides during synthesis. MSS PolE tumours exhibited a significantly larger spread of the regional SNV density distribution than MSI tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>), even though their mutational load is typically higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). Similar conclusions are reached with stomach cancer<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> hypermutators of unknown aetiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Thus, increased mutation supply does not explain the loss of regional mutation rate variability in MSI cancers.</p><p id="P9">The relative frequencies of 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; contexts of different SNVs - the mutation spectrum - are informative of the mutational processes operative in a particular cancer type<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. We observed the previously-reported<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> signatures of MMR-deficiency in MSI cancers: C&#x0003e;T transitions in a NpCpG sequence context and C&#x0003e;A transversions at CpCpC (all mutations considered strand-symmetrically). In addition, we report a general increase in the relative frequency of transitions in MSI genomes, wherein A&#x0003e;G increases preferentially when preceded or followed by a C, and C&#x0003e;T clearly increases most in the GpCpN context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We examined how the different mutation spectra are distributed across the genome in MSI samples. The signatures most characteristic of MMR-deficiency had a considerably flatter distribution in MSI tumours than in MSS or PolE-mutated tumours whereas this was less the case for signatures not associated with MMR-deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 3b, c</xref>). Indeed, the more abundant a mutational context becomes specifically in MSI tumours, the more uniformly it is distributed with respect to replication timing in MSI samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, R<sup>2</sup>=0.45, P&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) but not in MSS samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>, R<sup>2</sup>=0.01).</p><p id="P11">Notably, however, many signatures not associated with MMR-deficiency do flatten to some extent in MSI tumours. This suggests that the residual correlation to replication timing in MSI cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e-g</xref>) might derive purely from the mutations originating prior to MMR inactivation. To test this idea, we used the proportion of mutations in MSI-associated contexts to sort the MSI samples by the proportion of their history spent in a MMR-deficient state (Methods). The proportion of mutations in MSI-associated contexts significantly correlates to how flat the overall regional rates are with respect to replication timing in each sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, R<sup>2</sup>=0.37, P=0.0017). Importantly, this is also true for mutations in contexts that increase little or decrease in relative frequency in MSI genomes: all transversions (excluding C&#x0003e;A in CCN) and the transitions A&#x0003e;G in AAN and C&#x0003e;T in TCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3e, f</xref>; R<sup>2</sup>=0.38-0.45, P&#x0003c;0.0015). Thus, the greater the proportion of its history a tumour has spent in a MMR-deficient state, the flatter its distribution of mutations across the genome and this flattening is observed for mutations in both MSI-associated and non MSI-associated contexts.</p><p id="P12">To more precisely quantify the contribution of MMR to the observed regional mutation variation across the genome, we next estimated the time spent in the MMR-proficient and MMR-deficient states in each individual tumour. We used a simple model that assumes that genome-wide mutation rates for each mutational context are equal across samples but allowing a distinct rate for each context in the MMR-proficient and MMR-deficient states (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). We employed a genetic algorithm-based optimization that minimizes the difference to observed mutational signatures (Methods). After fitting a global set of rate parameters, this simple model captures 68% of the variance in differential mutational context usage across the MSI and a set of MSS cancer samples from all three MSI-prone cancer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Importantly, the de-convolution recapitulated the known consequences of MMR deficiency on the mutational spectrum and the MSI status of each sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c, d</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The model shows that the earlier MMR fails in the history of a tumour, the flatter its regional rate landscape is with respect to replication timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, R<sup>2</sup>=0.54, P&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>; examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Indeed the inferred time of MMR failure predicts the loss of regional rate variability better than a simple proportion of mutations in MSI-prone contexts (R<sup>2</sup>=0.37, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). In addition, the 99% confidence interval of a linear fit to the points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref> crosses the horizontal zero line - corresponding to a fully flat regional landscape - prior to the point where all mutations are predicted to have arrived in the MMR-deficient state. This indicates that the mutations that arose after the inactivation of MMR in these tumours are not distributed with the characteristic regional variation across the genome. In the absence of MMR, mutation rates are not reduced in early replicating euchromatic regions compared to in late replicating heterochromatin.</p><p id="P14">In summary, through an analysis of human tumours we have shown that MMR is more effective in euchromatic early-replicating regions of the human genome and that this suppresses the accumulation of mutations in these regions. MMR is known to be coupled to DNA replication, with elevated repair efficiency during S-phase<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Differences in DNA accessibility to the repair machinery<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, the coupling of this machinery to the replication fork, or the time available for repair might contribute to the increased efficiency of repair in early replicating euchromatin. Across cell types, most active genes performing essential functions are euchromatic and replicated early<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. It is thus sensible to envisage that enhanced MMR in euchromatin is a beneficial trait and one that has been selected for during evolution.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S2"><title>TCGA genomes, calling somatic mutations</title><p id="P15">We downloaded aligned short reads (to hg19/GRCh37) for the available whole-genome sequences of tumours (<italic>n</italic>=630) and the matched normal tissue from the TCGA repository at CGHub.

We further increased the stringency of Strelka&#x02019;s post-call filtering to prevent spurious mutation calls. By default Strelka requires that the overall confidence score (<italic>QSS_NT</italic>) is &#x02265;15, that the fraction of filtered basecalls at the site (<italic>BCNoise</italic>) is &#x0003c;40%, and also that the fraction of reads crossing site with spanning deletions (<italic>SpanDel</italic>) is &#x0003c;75%.

Next, we masked out the regions in the UCSC Browser blacklists (Duke and DAC), chosen for often exhibiting anomalous signal in next-generation sequencing experiments (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeMapability">http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeMapability</ext-link>). Finally, we discarded the exons (plus flanking 2nt) of the UCSC gene set to avoid the signal stemming from selection on gene coding regions. Then we divided the genome into non-overlapping 1Mb windows and discarded those with &#x0003c;250 kb of DNA passing the above filters; we also exclude the remaining windows on chromosome Y (<italic>n</italic>=7) as RepliSeq data was not available for them (see below). This yielded 2748 1Mb windows with an average of 664 kb highly alignable, non-blacklisted, non-exonic DNA per window. When determining SNV densities, the SNV counts in each window were divided by its effective length (after masking) to obtain frequencies per MB. The choice of 1Mb resolution is a trade-off between inclusion of low mutation burden tumour samples/types (better with coarser resolution) and the level of detail in describing the regional variability (better with finer resolution). Furthermore, replication timing is known to be organized in megabase-scale domains<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conditions for inclusion in the final genome set</title><p id="P18">We merged the three sets of genomes (TCGA, Alexandrov <italic>et al.</italic> and ICGC) and discarded the genomes that had less than 3000 SNVs in the alignable regions of the genome in order to obtain more reliable regional mutation density estimates.

Next, we assigned MSI-H, MSI-L or MSS status of the exomes from the same data sources used for the whole genomes (see above) and discarded samples where the MSI status was not known. This left 950 samples, of which 195 MSI-H, and the rest MSS or MSI-L (pooled together). PolE status was not inferred for exomes. The genomic mask for the exome analysis was constructed differently than for whole genomes: we similarly used the &#x0201c;CRG Alignability 36&#x0201d; filter and the two UCSC blacklists. However, we excluded all DNA except the protein coding exons (but not exons of commonly mutated cancer genes, which were also excluded). Finally, we retained only the 1Mb windows with at least 5 kb of alignable, non-backlisted exonic DNA. This reduced the initial set of 2748 windows (for the whole genome analysis) to a 1709 windows for the exome analysis.

For the analysis where we considered each exome separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2j</xref>), we limited the analysis to exomes with &#x02265;50 SNVs in the selected genomic windows.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Gene expression data</title><p id="P23">The expression levels in tumours were downloaded from the TCGA RnaSeqV2 data sets<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> where they are expressed as TPM (transcript-per-million<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>) values for each gene. For 15 TCGA cancer types that had RnaSeqV2 data available, we downloaded TPM levels for those tumour samples where we had called whole-genome somatic SNVs, in total 8-92 RnaSeqV2 samples per cancer type (average=29). The TPM levels of genes overlapping (incl. partially) each 1Mb window were averaged for a tumour sample, and we then averaged over all samples of each cancer type to get the final expression level for that 1Mb window in that cancer type; if lower than 0.01 TPM, it was adjusted to 0.01 TPM.

To avoid biasing the sample, we excluded multiple lymphoblastoid cell lines and retained Gm12878 as a representative. We computed the average RepliSeq signal within 1Mb genome windows of the remaining 11 cell lines, except chromosome Y which was unavailable in the original data. The resulting values ranged from 0-100, where higher values indicate earlier replication.

For the TS analysis, we considered those cell lines that (i) could be matched to a cancer type, based on their tissue of origin and that (ii) corresponded to one of the 8 cancer types found to have a significant shift in PC3 of the regional mutation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). In particular, replication timing TS in MCF7 cells served as a proxy for BRCA (breast cancer), BJ cells for SKCM (melanoma), IMR-90 cells for LUSC/LUAD (lung cancers), HEP G2 cells for LIHC (liver cancer) and Gm12878 for DLBC (lymphoma). For consistency with the gene expression TS analyses, we considered the same set of 1Mb windows (see above) in the replication timing TS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Heterochromatin data</title><p id="P27">We downloaded RoadMap epigenomics H3K9me3 ChIP-seq signal for a diverse set of healthy tissues or cell lines from NCBI GEO, encompassing: GSM621651 (adult kidney), GSM537710 (adult liver), GSM670028 (mesenchymal stem cells), GSM772917 (CD4 na&#x000ef;ve), GSM669939 (fetal lung), GSM450266 (H1 cell line), GSM521914 (IMR90 cell line).

The slope of a regression line fitted through the average 1Mb relative mutation rates of each bin is measure of association of mutation rates to replication timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This measure has the desirable property of being robust to differences in the overall mutation load between smaller groups of tumour samples or individual genomes, or between mutational signatures.</p><p id="P29">For the analysis where intergenic and genic regions were examined separately in MSI and MSS cancers, we used the UCSC gene set to define these regions.

When calculating relative mutation rates, regardless if analyzing intergenic or intronic mutations, each sample was always normalised by dividing by the mean of the aggregate (intergenic plus intronic DNA) SNVs rates across all its windows. The five RepliSeq bins were the same as in the whole-genome analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Statistical analysis &#x02013; general</title><p id="P30">Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed in R 3.1.1 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria) and in XLStat 2014.2 (Addinsoft, Paris, France) on the relative 1Mb mutation rates of each tumour sample, where samples were features (columns in data table), and 1Mb windows were examples (rows). To find the relative rates, first the SNV densities per Mb of alignable, non-exonic, non-blacklisted DNA (see above) were determined for each 1Mb window in every tumour sample. Then, these densities in each sample were normalised by dividing by the mean SNV density of all windows in that sample. Thus, the relative mutation frequencies &#x0003e;1 correspond to above-average SNV densities in a tumour sample, and &#x0003c;1 to below-average densities. The approximate 95% confidence intervals of the median (across tumour samples: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1e, f</xref>) for the 1Mb windows were estimated using the formula &#x000b1;1.58*IQR/sqrt(n_samp), as defined in the R function <italic>boxplot.stats</italic> and references therein. In the PCA, the tumour samples were features (columns) and the 1Mb windows were examples (rows); therefore, the PCs will be linear combinations of tumour samples, and the loadings of the samples on PCs 3 and 4 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>.

The mutations are counted strand-symmetrically, thus six possible changes exist: C&#x0003e;G, C&#x0003e;A, C&#x0003e;T, A&#x0003e;T, A&#x0003e;C and A&#x0003e;G. These are equivalent, respectively, to: G&#x0003e;C, G&#x0003e;T, G&#x0003e;A, T&#x0003e;A, T&#x0003e;G and T&#x0003e;C. Each of the 6 changes has four possible 5&#x02032; and four 3&#x02032; neighbouring nucleotides, which amounts to 6&#x000d7;4&#x000d7;4=96 contexts. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref> shows their relative usage, as % of SNVs observed in each context. The MSI propensities of contexts (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>) were defined as the log<sub>2</sub> ratio of the absolute mutation frequency (per MB) of a context in the MSI samples to its mutation frequency in the MSS samples.</p><p id="P32">DNA word frequencies are not necessarily equally frequently occurring in genomes; for instance, the CpG dinucleotide is rare. Moreover, they may vary in frequency across the genome, as is most evident in the global G+C content variation. The outcome of analyses that compare how mutational context usage co-varies with replication timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">4</xref>) may be affected by this. Therefore, we normalised the mutation frequencies in different contexts by dividing each by the number of corresponding nucleotides-at-risk in each 1MB window (only nucleotides passing the alignability mask described above). On data normalised thusly, we determined the strength of association to replication timing via the slope of the line fitted to RepliSeq bins, as described above. (Of note, as with the full set of mutations, here also all 1Mb windows values were divided by the genome average prior to binning.) In case different contexts needed to be combined, the RepliSeq slopes were determined for each context separately and then the slopes were averaged for the combined context.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Determining time of MMR failure in samples</title><p id="P33">We aimed to determine the relative time spent in the MMR-proficient and MMR-deficient states for each of the 24 MSI samples: 10 CRAD, 4 STAD and 10 UCEC (see &#x0201c;PolE mutants&#x0201d; section above) by deconvoluting their mutational signatures into MSI and MSS components. To these 24 MSI samples, we added a further 24 MSS samples, matched by cancer type, while excluding the PolE ultramutators (in CRAD/UCEC) or otherwise hypermutated (in STAD) samples.</p><p id="P34">To reduce the number of parameters that need to be estimated, we pooled the contexts with different 3&#x02032; nucleotides together (this corresponds to how bars are drawn in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). An exception were the NCG&#x0003e;NTG changes (deamination of CpG dinucleotides) that were kept separate from other NCN&#x0003e;NTN changes, which are here denoted as NCH (H = A, C or T). This yields a total of 28 contexts, for each of which we estimated a pre-MMR failure relative mutation rate (<italic>a</italic>) and a post-MMR failure relative mutation rate (<italic>b</italic>). The rates were assumed to be constant across samples and in time. Each sample may, however, spend a different fraction of time in the pre-MMR-failure state (<italic>z</italic>). Thus the total number of parameters to estimate is 28 (<italic>a</italic> for contexts) + 28 (<italic>b</italic> for contexts) + 24 (<italic>z</italic> for MSI samples) + 24 (<italic>z</italic> for MSS samples) = 104.</p><p id="P35">For a set of 104 parameters, the expected relative frequency of a context <italic>ctx</italic> in a sample <italic>samp</italic> may be calculated as a<sub>ctx</sub>*Z<sub>samp</sub> + b<sub>ctx</sub>*(1-Z<sub>samp</sub>). A measure of goodness-of-fit for a candidate set of parameters was the negative root-mean-square difference between these expected relative frequencies, and the observed relative frequencies of use of 28 different contexts across the 48 samples.

Upon examining the coefficients of the solutions and schematic diagrams of the accumulation of mutations in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4e-j</xref>), it becomes evident that the two sets of solutions are equivalent, with symmetrical <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> mutation rates, and also the pre-MMR failure time (<italic>z</italic>) and the post-MMR failure time (1-<italic>z</italic>) across all samples.

In no other way was the algorithm aware of which signatures are specific to MSI tumours, or which of the 48 samples were MSI and which were MSS. The algorithm could, in principle, be used to deconvolute other mutational processes which have a distinct time of (de)activation during carcinogenesis. Its practical use would, however, likely be limited to those processes which, like MSI, have a very distinct mutational signature.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="extended-data" id="S16"><title>Extended Data</title><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><label>Extended Data Figure 1</label><caption><p id="P37">Overall mutational burden and megabase-scale regional rate variability in tumour samples of MSI-prone cancer types. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>, Correlations of tissue specificity (TS, see Methods) in regional mutation rates of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC) with TS of gene expression in DLBC (<bold>a</bold>), or with TS of replication timing in the Gm12878 lymphoblastoid cell line (<bold>b</bold>). <bold>c</bold>, Overall mutational load, as SNVs per Mb of alignable genomic DNA (Methods) for MSI-H, MSS (includes MSI-L), polymerase &#x003b5; (PolE) mutant tumours, or otherwise hypermutated tumour samples. <bold>d</bold>, Principal components plot with PCs 3 and 4, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>, but showing only tumour samples for colorectal (CRAD), uterine (UCEC) and stomach (STAD) cancers for visual emphasis. <bold>e</bold>, <bold>f</bold>, Relative SNV frequencies across 1Mb windows of chromosome 1p in UCEC and STAD.
