Analysis of genome/transcriptome sequence data from the sea urchin <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic> (Echinoidea), the sea cucumber <italic>Apostichopus japonicus</italic> (Holothuroidea), and the starfish <italic>Patiria miniata</italic> (Asteroidea) reveals that in each species there are two types of SALMFamide precursor: an L-type precursor comprising peptides with a C-terminal LxFamide-type motif and an F-type precursor solely or largely comprising peptides with a C-terminal FxFamide-type motif. Here, we have identified transcripts encoding SALMFamide precursors in the brittle star <italic>Ophionotus victoriae</italic> (Ophiuroidea) and the feather star <italic>Antedon mediterranea</italic> (Crinoidea). We have also identified SALMFamide precursors in other species belonging to each of the five echinoderm classes. As in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>, <italic>A. japonicus</italic>, and <italic>P. miniata</italic>, in <italic>O. victoriae</italic> there is one L-type precursor and one F-type precursor. However, in <italic>A. mediterranea</italic> only a single SALMFamide precursor was found, comprising two peptides with a LxFamide-type motif, one with a FxFamide-type motif, five with a FxLamide-type motif, and four with a LxLamide-type motif. As crinoids are basal to the Echinozoa (Holothuroidea&#x02009;+&#x02009;Echinoidea) and Asterozoa (Asteroidea&#x02009;+&#x02009;Ophiuroidea) in echinoderm phylogeny, one model of SALMFamide precursor evolution would be that ancestrally there was a single SALMFamide gene encoding a variety of SALMFamides (as in crinoids), which duplicated in a common ancestor of the Echinozoa and Asterozoa and then specialized to encode L-type SALMFamides or F-type SALMFamides. Alternatively, a second SALMFamide precursor may remain to be discovered or may have been lost in crinoids. Further insights will be obtained if SALMFamide receptors are identified, which would provide a molecular basis for experimental analysis of the functional significance of the &#x0201c;cocktails&#x0201d; of SALMFamides that exist in echinoderms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>neuropeptide</kwd><kwd>echinoderm</kwd><kwd>SALMFamide</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>ophiuroid</kwd><kwd>crinoid</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="22"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="7925"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The SALMFamides are a family of neuropeptides that occur in species belonging to the phylum Echinodermata (e.g., starfish, sea cucumbers, and sea urchins) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The prototypes for this neuropeptide family were discovered in the starfish species <italic>Asterias rubens</italic> and <italic>Asterias forbesi</italic> and are known as SALMFamide-1 (S1) and SALMFamide-2 (S2) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). S1 was identified as a C-terminally amidated octapeptide with the amino acid sequence Gly-Phe-Asn-Ser-Ala-Leu-Met-Phe-NH<sub>2</sub> (GFNSALMFamide) and S2 was identified as a C-terminally amidated dodecapeptide with the amino acid sequence Ser-Gly-Pro-Tyr-Ser-Phe-Asn-Ser-Gly-Leu-Thr-Phe-NH<sub>2</sub> (SGPYSFNSGLTFamide). Both peptides have the C-terminal motif FNSxLxFamide (where <italic>x</italic> is variable), which suggested that S1 and S2 may have evolved as a consequence of gene duplication or intragenic DNA duplication. Immunocytochemical investigation of the expression of S1 and S2 in <italic>A. rubens</italic> revealed widely distributed patterns of expression in the nervous system but in separate populations of neurons (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Furthermore, S1 and S2 are present in the innervation of neuromuscular organs and, consistent with this finding, both peptides cause relaxation of starfish cardiac stomach, tube foot, and apical muscle preparations <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Subsequent to the discovery of S1 and S2 in starfish, SALMFamide-type neuropeptides were identified in other echinoderms. Thus, SALMFamide-type peptides were isolated from two sea cucumber species &#x02013; <italic>Holothuria glaberrima</italic> and <italic>Apostichopus japonicus</italic> &#x02013; and, consistent with the actions of S1 and S2 in starfish, these peptides cause muscle relaxation in sea cucumbers (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). It appears, therefore, that the relaxing action of SALMFamides on echinoderm muscle may be a general property of this neuropeptide family (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Discovery of SALMFamides in sea cucumbers also revealed structural heterogeneity in SALMFamides. Two SALMFamides isolated from <italic>Holothuria glaberrima</italic> were identified as GFSKLYFamide and SGYSVLYFamide, which share with the starfish SALMFamides S1 and S2 the C-terminal motif SxLxFamide (i.e., L-type SALMFamides) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, two SALMFamides isolated from <italic>Apostichopus japonicus</italic> were identified as GYSPFMFamide and FKSPFMFamide, which have the C-terminal motif SxFxFamide (i.e., F-type SALMFamides) (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Sequencing of the genome and transcriptome of the sea urchin <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic> (class Echinoidea) provided the first insight into the genetic basis of SALMFamide-type neuropeptide diversity in an echinoderm species (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Thus, in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> there are two genes encoding SALMFamide precursor proteins: one gene encodes a precursor comprising one L-type SALMFamide and one L-type-like (SxIxFamide) SALMFamide (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and the second gene encodes a precursor comprising seven F-type SALMFamides (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, a more complicated picture has emerged as sequence data from other echinoderms has become available. The Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers) are a sister group to the class Echinoidea and, as in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>, analysis of transcriptome sequence data from <italic>A. japonicus</italic> revealed two SALMFamide precursor transcripts. One of the precursors comprises three L-type or L-type-like SALMFamides and is homologous to the L-type SALMFamide precursor in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> that contains two L-type or L-type-like SALMFamides (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The second SALMFamide precursor in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> is largely comprised of F-type or F-type-like SALMFamides (five in total) but interestingly, unlike the precursor that gives rise to F-type SALMFamides in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>, it also contains three L-type/L-type-like SALMFamides (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Thus, the &#x0201c;cocktail&#x0201d; of SALMFamides in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> is more complex than in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>. What is not clear from these data, however, is which condition is ancestral and which is derived and to address this issue sequence data from other echinoderms is required.</p><p>Recently, genome sequence data for the starfish <italic>Patiria miniata</italic> has been obtained and this has revealed a SALMFamide profile similar to the sea cucumber <italic>A. japonicus</italic>. Thus, in <italic>P. miniata</italic> one SALMFamide precursor is solely comprised of L-type SALMFamides, which include S1 and six other structurally related peptides (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The other SALMFamide precursor in <italic>P. miniata</italic> is largely comprised of F-type or F-type-like SALMFamides (eight in total) but it also contains an S2-like peptide with an L-type C-terminal motif (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These predicted <italic>P. miniata</italic> SALMFamide precursor sequences now require confirmation by transcript sequencing. Nevertheless, the data currently available suggest that the occurrence of a precursor comprising several F-type SALMFamides and one or more L-type SALMFamides may be the ancestral condition, with the absence of L-type SALMFamides in the sea urchin F-type SALMFamide precursor being a derived condition. However, there remains the possibility that the occurrence of L-type SALMFamides in the F-type SALMFamide precursor is a feature that has arisen independently in both the holothurian and asteroid lineages. To gain further insight on this issue it will be necessary to determine the sequences of SALMFamide precursors in species belonging to two other extant echinoderm classes: the Ophiuroidea (brittle stars) and the Crinoidea (feather stars and sea lilies). As a sister group to the Asteroidea (starfish), the Ophiuroidea could provide key insights on SALMFamide precursor evolution. Thus, if the F-type SALMFamide precursor in brittle stars also contains L-type or L-type like SALMFamides, as in starfish and sea cucumbers, this would add weight to the notion that this is a feature that dates back to the common ancestor of the Asterozoa (Asteroidea&#x02009;+&#x02009;Ophiuroidea) and the Echinozoa (Holothuroidea&#x02009;+&#x02009;Echinoidea). The Crinoidea are basal to the Asterozoa and the Echinozoa (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and determination of the sequences of SALMFamide precursors in species belonging to this class of echinoderms could provide insight into the ancestral condition in the common ancestor of all extant echinoderms.</p><p>Here, we have analysed transcriptome sequence data from the starfish <italic>P. miniata</italic>, which in combination with genome sequence data has enabled definitive determination of the sequences of SALMFamide precursors in this species. Importantly, these data have also enabled comparison of SALMFamide gene structure in an asterozoan species (<italic>P. miniata</italic>) and an echinozoan species (<italic>S. purpuratus</italic>). Furthermore, here we report the sequences of novel SALMFamide precursors that we have discovered by analysis of transcriptome sequence data from the ophiuroid <italic>Ophionotus victoriae</italic>, a brittle star species that has a circumpolar distribution around Antarctica, and the crinoid <italic>Antedon mediterranea</italic>, a feather star species that is (as its name implies) native to the Mediterranean Sea. Having identified SALMFamide precursors in single species from each of the five echinoderm classes, we investigated the generality of our findings by analysis of genome/transcriptome sequence data from other echinoderm species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Transcriptome sequencing of the starfish <italic>Patiria miniata</italic></title><p><italic>Patiria miniata</italic> transcriptome sequence was produced using RNA from several developmental stages from blastula to juveniles, including bipinnaria and brachiolaria larvae.

However, the predicted gene products reported by Elphick et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) have yet to be confirmed by transcript sequencing.

Residues 63&#x02013;212 of this protein were found to be identical to residues 25&#x02013;174 of the predicted 174-residue protein. However, the N-terminal region of the 212-residue protein (residues 1&#x02013;62) did not share sequence identity with the N-terminal region of the predicted 174-residue protein (residues 1&#x02013;24). Thus, the predicted 174-residue sequence of the L-type SALMFamide precursor in <italic>P. miniata</italic>, which was based on analysis of genomic sequence data, may be partially incorrect. Furthermore, BLAST analysis of <italic>P. miniata</italic> genome sequence data revealed that residues 1&#x02013;62 of the 212-residue protein are encoded by an exon located on scaffold JH775329.1 (34230&#x02009;bp), whereas residues 63&#x02013;212 are encoded by an exon located on scaffold JH770521.1 (or 1914; 55,595&#x02009;bp). Thus, the presence of the two exons on different genomic scaffolds provided an explanation for why the first exon was not identified when analysing genomic sequence data. The putative exon encoding residues 1&#x02013;24 of the predicted 174-residue L-type SALMFamide precursor was identified on the same scaffold (JH770521.1) as the exon encoding the C-terminal region of the protein and was a plausible candidate exon because it encodes a polypeptide that has the expected properties for the N-terminal signal peptide region of a neuropeptide precursor. Transcriptome sequencing indicates that this prediction may have been wrong. However, there remains the possibility that this gene is subject to alternative splicing and transcripts encoding the predicted 174-residue L-type SALMFamide precursor occur naturally but are less abundant than transcripts encoding the 212-residue protein.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Patiria miniata</italic> SALMFamide precursors</bold>. <bold>(A)</bold> L-type SALMFamide precursor. <bold>(B)</bold> F-type SALMFamide precursor.

This contrasts with L-type SALMFamide precursor genes (see above), where the exon encoding the N-terminal region of the precursor also encodes a 5&#x02032; non-coding region. In common with L-type SALMFamide precursor genes, the C-terminal region of the F-type SALMFamide precursor proteins (which includes multiple copies of SALMFamide peptides) is encoded by a large exon with a long 3&#x02032; non-coding region.</p><p>Thus, L-type SALMFamide precursor and F-type SALMFamide precursor genes are similar in that the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the proteins are encoded by two exons. However, the presence (L-type) or absence (F-type) of a 5&#x02032; non-coding region in the first protein-encoding exons is a distinguishing feature. This provides evidence that the L-type SALMFamide precursors in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> and <italic>P. miniata</italic> are orthologous and F-type SALMFamide precursors in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> and <italic>P. miniata</italic> are orthologous, which is an important finding because evidence for orthology based solely on comparison of protein sequences is not very strong, particularly for L-type SALMFamide precursors.

In conclusion, therefore, the evidence of orthology provided by similarities/differences in gene structure provides an important basis for classifying SALMFamide genes in echinoderms as either L-type SALMFamide precursor genes or F-type SALMFamide precursor genes.</p></sec><sec id="S3-8"><title>Identification of an L-type SALMFamide precursor in the ophiuroid <italic>O. victoriae</italic></title><p>BLAST analysis of <italic>O. victoriae</italic> transcriptome sequence data revealed a 2422&#x02009;bp contig (2059646) encoding a 169-residue protein comprising a predicted 20-residue N-terminal signal peptide and four putative SALMFamide neuropeptides bounded by monobasic or dibasic cleavage sites.

Analysis of the sequences of the four putative SALMFamide neuropeptides derived from this precursor revealed that the first (i.e., N-terminally located) is a dodecapeptide with a canonical L-type SALMFamide motif (SxLxFamide) and the fourth (i.e., C-terminally located) is a putative 14-residue neuropeptide with an L-type-like SALMFamide motif (SxMxFamide). The intervening second putative neuropeptide is an 11-residue peptide with the C-terminal pentapeptide sequence SGLMQamide, which is L-type-like based on the presence of the leucine residue but is otherwise very unusual in having a C-terminal glutamine residue. The third neuropeptide is also a putative 11-residue peptide but with the C-terminal pentapeptide sequence TGFMMamide, which is F-type-like based on the presence of the phenylalanine residue but it has C-terminal methionine residue. Thus, this is predominantly a precursor of L-type or L-type-like SALMFamide precursor, homologous with L-type SALMFamide precursors that have been identified in other echinoderms.

Thus, whilst the overall organization of the F-type SALMFamide precursors in the two species is similar and clearly indicative of orthology, lineage specific gain/loss of peptides has occurred as well as conversion of peptides from F-type to L-type or vice versa. Analysis of a wider range of species will therefore be necessary to identify the ancestral characteristics of F-type SALMFamide precursors in asteroids.</p><p>Recent molecular phylogenetic analysis of the class Ophiuroidea has identified three clades: clade A, clade B, and clade C (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).

Thus, the L-type SALMFamide precursors in <italic>O. victoriae</italic> and <italic>O. angulata</italic> comprise four homologous peptides. However, as reported above for other classes, there is variable conservation of the sequences of peptides that occupy equivalent positions in the precursor proteins.

This has revealed that in each species there are two SALMFamide precursor genes: firstly, a gene that encodes peptides with a C-terminal LxFamide-type motif (L-type) and secondly, a gene that either only encodes peptides with a C-terminal FxFamide-type motif (F-type) (<italic>S. purpuratus</italic>) or encodes F-type SALMFamides plus one or more L-type SALMFamides (<italic>A. japonicus</italic>, <italic>P. miniata</italic>) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, the <italic>P. miniata</italic> sequences were based on predictions made from genome sequence data, without supporting evidence from transcript sequences. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of SALMFamide precursor evolution in the phylum Echinodermata will require analysis of sequence data from at least one species from the two other extant echinoderm classes &#x02013; the Ophiuroidea and Crinoidea.</p><p>Here, we have determined the sequences of transcripts encoding the L-type SALMFamide precursor and F-type SALMFamide precursor in the starfish <italic>P. miniata</italic>, which has enabled comparison of the structure of genes encoding these precursors with SALMFamide precursor genes in the sea urchin <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>. This has revealed that F-type SALMFamide precursor genes have one or two introns in the 5&#x02032; non-coding region of the genes, whereas L-type SALMFamide genes do not have this feature. The overall level of sequence identity when comparing L-type SALMFamide precursors or F-type SALMFamide precursors protein sequences from different echinoderm classes is low [see Figures 5 and 6 in Ref. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)]. Consequently, the categorization of SALMFamide precursors into two types (L-type and F-type) has hitherto been based upon the relative abundance of constituent peptides that have either an LxFamide motif or FxFamide motif. Obtaining evidence of orthology based on gene structure now provides an important additional criterion for classification of SALMFamide precursors as either L-type or F-type.</p><p>The F-type SALMFamide precursors in <italic>A. japonicus</italic> (echinozoan clade) and <italic>P. miniata</italic> (asterozoan clade) are largely comprised of F-type SALMFamides but they also contain one or more L-type SALMFamides. This suggests that the occurrence of L-type SALMFamides in F-type precursors may be a characteristic of F-type precursors traceable to the common ancestor of the Asterozoa and Echinozoa, with the absence of L-type SALMFamides in the F-type precursors of sea urchins (Echinoidea, Echinozoa) presumably a derived feature. Here, we have obtained evidence in support of this hypothesis with the identification of a transcript encoding a F-type precursor in the brittle star <italic>O. victoriae</italic> (Ophiuroidea, Asterozoa). Thus, in <italic>O. victoriae</italic> there is an F-type precursor that largely comprises F-type SALMFamides (11) but which also contains an L-type SALMFamide. Similarly, the F-type precursor in the brittle star <italic>O. angulata</italic> comprises 10 F-type SALMFamides and 1 L-type SALMFamide. By way of comparison, the L-type SALMFamide precursors in <italic>O. victoriae</italic> and <italic>O. angulata</italic> comprise four putative peptides, including two L-type SALMFamides and an unusual peptide with a C-terminal LxQamide motif. This latter feature is atypical of L-type precursors that have been identified in other echinoderms and therefore it appears to be derived characteristic of ophiuroids.</p><p>Analysis of transcriptome sequence data from the crinoid <italic>A. mediterranea</italic> revealed only a single SALMFamide-type precursor. A homolog of this precursor was found in the feather star <italic>A. wilsoni</italic> and, as in <italic>A. mediterranea</italic>, this was the only SALMFamide precursor identified in this species. Analysis of the sequences of the putative neuropeptides derived from the <italic>A. mediterranea</italic> precursor reveals that it comprises five peptides with a FxLamide-type motif and four peptides with a LxLamide-type motif but only two peptides with a LxFamide-type motif and one peptide with a FxFamide-type motif. Based upon these characteristics, the <italic>A. mediterranea</italic> SALMFamide precursor does not appear to be an L-type-like precursor, which are largely comprised of peptides with a LxFamide motif, or an F-type-like precursor, which are largely comprised of peptides with a FxFamide motif. Thus, discovery of SALMFamide precursors in crinoid species has broadened our perspective on the structural characteristics of SALMFamides.</p><p>Hitherto SALMFamides have been characterized as either L-type (LxFamide) or F-type (FxFamide). Peptides that deviate from these motifs have been identified in echinozoans and asterozoans; for example, one of the peptides in the <italic>A. japonicus</italic> L-type SALMFamide precursor has the C-terminal motif IxLamide, which previously was categorized as L-type-like. Similarly, one of the peptides in the <italic>A. japonicus</italic> F-type SALMFamide precursor has the C-terminal motif FxLamide, which was categorized as F-type-like. Our discovery that the crinoid SALMFamide precursor largely comprises peptides with a LxLamide motif or LxLamide-like motif (e.g., LxMamide) and peptides with a FxLamide motif has provided a basis for categorization of SALMFamides into four types: 1. FxFamide, 2. FxLamide or FxMamide, 3. LxFamide, and 4. LxLamide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). However, we retain the use of the terms L-type (LxFamide) and F-type (FxFamide) because these are useful for categorization of SALMFamide peptides and SALMFamide precursors in echinozoans and asterozoans.

Then one of the duplicated genes specialized to encode L-type SALMFamides and the other specialized to exclusively or predominantly encode F-type SALMFamides (as in Echinozoa and Asterozoa). In the context of this evolutionary scenario, it is of interest to compare the structural features of SALMFamide precursors in the five echinoderm classes, using the precursors identified in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>, <italic>A. japonicus</italic>, <italic>P. miniata</italic>, <italic>O. victoriae</italic>, and <italic>A. mediterranea</italic> as examples (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). Starting with the single SALMFamide precursor identified in the crinoid <italic>A. mediterranea</italic> and with reference to the key, which shows the color coding for the different types of SALMFamides, the predominance of peptides with a FxLamide-type or FxMamide-type motif (orange) or a LxLamide-type motif (dark red) is apparent, whilst the prototypical L-type SALMFamides (LxFamide; red) and F-type SALMFamides (FxFamide; yellow) are minor components. What cannot be deduced from this single precursor in an extant crinoid is whether or not this precursor structure is representative of an ancestral-type SALMFamide precursor that would have existed in extinct crinoid species ~550 million years ago, before the emergence of echinozoan and asterozoan echinoderms (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In the lineage leading to extant feather stars (order Comatulidina; infraorder Comatulidia) such as <italic>A. mediterranea</italic>, intragenic duplication events may have resulted in expansion of segments of DNA encoding some SALMFamide neuropeptide types, whilst mutational changes or deletion events may have resulted in loss of other SALMFamide neuropeptide types. Further insight on this issue may be obtained if SALMFamide precursor transcript/gene sequences are obtained in the future with broader taxonomic sampling of extant crinoids. Nevertheless, we speculate that the occurrence of multiple types of SALMFamides (FxFamide-type, FxLamide-type or FxMamide-type, LxFamide-type, and LxLamide-type) in the <italic>A. mediterranea</italic> SALMFamide precursor is reflective of the ancestral condition in extinct crinoids that predated the emergence of asterozoans and echinozoans, although of course the precise number of copies of each type may be variable between extant crinoid species.</p><p>If the <italic>A. mediterranea</italic> precursor is representative of an ancestral-type SALMFamide precursor in being comprised of a variety of SALMFamides that have C-terminal FxFamide-type, FxLamide-type or FxMamide-type, LxFamide-type, and LxLamide-type motifs, then the occurrence of SALMFamide precursors in asterozoans and echinozoans that are exclusively or predominantly comprised of peptides with a LxFamide-type motif (L-type precursor) or FxFamide-type motif (F-type precursor) is interesting from both an evolutionary and functional perspective. It suggests that following the putative duplication of a gene encoding an ancestral-type SALMFamide precursor in a common ancestor of echinozoans and asterozoans, there was specialization toward on the one hand a precursor of L-type peptides (LxFamide) and on the other hand a precursor of F-type peptides (FxFamide). Conversely, peptides with a LxLamide-type motif, FxLamide-type motif, or FxMamide-type motif that predominate in the <italic>A. mediterranea</italic> precursor are either absent or are minor components of SALMFamide precursors in echinozoans and asterozoans (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). This specialization of SALMFamide precursors as sources of either L-type or F-type SALMFamide neuropeptides would presumably reflect acquisition of distinct physiological roles. Therefore, it will be of interest to compare the patterns of expression of L-type precursors and F-type precursors and the pharmacological actions of their constituent neuropeptides in echinozoan and asterozoan species.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis to that outlined above is that a second SALMFamide-type precursor remains to be identified in crinoid species and that it remains undiscovered because of sequence divergence or incomplete transcriptome data. Another scenario is that two SALMFamide-type precursors existed ancestrally in crinoids but there has been loss of one precursor in a lineage that gave rise to extant feather star species such as <italic>A. mediterranea</italic> and <italic>A. wilsoni</italic>. If either of these scenarios is correct, then the question arises as to the relationship of the crinoid SALMFamide-type precursor identified here with the L-type and F-type SALMFamide precursors in asterozoa and echinozoa. Based on the number of constituent peptides, the crinoid SALMFamide-type precursor identified here is more similar to F-type SALMFamide precursors than L-type SALMFamide precursors. Further insights on the evolutionary relationships of SALMFamide neuropeptides and their precursors will be gained if the receptors that mediate their effects are identified.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>This study was conceived and co-ordinated by Maurice R.
