The goal of this study was to perform whole genome gene expression profiling in adipose tissue to detect common patterns of gene regulation associated with obesity and insulin resistance. We used phenotypic and genotypic data from 308 Mexican American participants from the Veterans Administration Genetic Epidemiology Study (VAGES). Basal fasting RNA was extracted from adipose tissue biopsies from a subset of 75 unrelated individuals, and gene expression data generated on the Illumina BeadArray platform. The number of gene probes with significant expression above baseline was approximately 31,000. We performed multiple regression analysis of all probes with 15 metabolic traits. Adipose tissue had 3,012 genes significantly associated with the traits of interest (false discovery rate, FDR &#x02264; 0.05). The significance of gene expression changes was used to select 52 genes with significant (FDR &#x02264; 10<sup>-4</sup>) gene expression changes across multiple traits. Gene sets/Pathways analysis identified one gene, alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (<italic>ADH1B</italic>) that was significantly enriched (P &#x0003c; 10<sup>-60</sup>) as a prime candidate for involvement in multiple relevant metabolic pathways. Illumina BeadChip derived <italic>ADH1B</italic> expression data was consistent with quantitative real time PCR data. We observed significant inverse correlations with waist circumference (2.8 x 10<sup>-9</sup>), BMI (5.4 x 10<sup>-6</sup>), and fasting plasma insulin (P &#x0003c; 0.001). These findings are consistent with a central role for <italic>ADH1B</italic> in obesity and insulin resistance and provide evidence for a novel genetic regulatory mechanism for human metabolic diseases related to these traits.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported in part by grants from the Veterans Administration: Merit Review Award 11487646 (CPJ) and Genetic Epidemiologic Grant (RAD) and the National Institutes of Health: DK79195 (CPJ), DK067690 (CPJ), DK53889 (RD), HD41111 (RD), DK70746 (DML) and MH59490 (JB).

Approximately 26 million people in the United States (US) are estimated to have diabetes, and about 48 million people are projected to have diabetes by the year 2050 if current demographic trends persist [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2010, 79 million US adults 20 years or older were estimated to have prediabetes (26% of the population) [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and 36% of US adults were obese [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The prevalence rates of T2D and obesity are particularly high in US ethnic minorities such as the Mexican American population [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. T2D is a complex metabolic disease, characterized by insulin resistance (IR) and impaired &#x003b2;-cell function [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In its early &#x0201c;pre-diabetes&#x0201d; stage, elevated glucose levels co-occur with elevated insulin due to defective insulin responses in insulin target tissues, notably skeletal muscle, liver and fat, and by defects in insulin secretion from pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119941.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We previously showed that Mexican Americans have a high genetic predisposition for IR, T2D and related conditions [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119941.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We also have shown that compensatory hyperinsulinemia is an early metabolic change that precedes the onset of hyperglycemia and overt T2D, and represents a physiological response offsetting IR. This compensatory hyperinsulinemia manifests as an increase in fasting plasma insulin (FPI) in normoglycemic subjects with a positive family history of T2D [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119941.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In typical T2D, individuals pass through a pre-diabetes &#x0201c;gate&#x0201d;, characterized by IR, increased FPI, and elevated glucose, prior to the development of overt T2D, which is eventually accompanied by a progressive decline in insulin secretion following Starling&#x02019;s Curve of the pancreas, originally described by DeFronzo et al. [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. IR is an underlying factor that co-occurs with a cluster of highly correlated traits including obesity, T2D, hypertension (HTN), and dyslipidemia (DL). This cluster of traits is referred to as the insulin resistance, or metabolic, syndrome (MS) and is a predictor of cardiovascular disease and stroke. One pervasive form of insulin resistance, obesity, is a major risk factor for T2D [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119941.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Whole body IR includes a range of tissue-specific metabolic abnormalities which are linked by a common failure to respond to insulin. Primary tissues involved are skeletal muscle, liver, adipose tissue, and pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells, and these are augmented by the gut and brain. The two key endocrine tissues involved are the pancreas and adipose tissue. Pre-diabetes is an insulin resistant state that typically precedes diabetes and may lead to T2D when accompanied by a primary defect in the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells.</p><p>Both genetic and environmental factors play important roles in the development of T2D [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119941.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. There have been continuing efforts to localize and characterize T2D susceptibility genes using a variety of approaches: genome-wide linkage (GWL), genome-wide association studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing (WGS) and genome-wide gene expression (transcriptomics). Transcriptomic studies provide a strategy for moving from gene localization towards direct gene characterization and functional analysis. The BeadArrays used in the present study included oligonucleotide probes for a total of 47,324 transcripts, which cover most known genes plus several common splice variants and small non-coding RNAs [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119941.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In recent years the genome-wide association study (GWAS) has become a popular study design with several notable successes in localizing novel putative T2D susceptibility genes/variants [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This approach is based on the common variant/common disease hypothesis, and generally uses data from samples of unrelated cases and controls rather than from related family members. So far, more than 70 [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] T2D susceptibility genes have been localized with genome-wide significance [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Of these, the most significant gene was the transcription factor 7-like 2 (<italic>TCF7L2</italic>) which was localized in a follow-up study to our previous report of linkage of T2D to the 10q chromosomal region in Mexican Americans [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, in most cases the identity of the causal genes and the functional relevance of the implicated genetic variants have yet to be established. As has been the case with various GWASs of other complex diseases, the genetic contribution of common variants identified by the GWASs to the overall susceptibility to T2D is rather modest. Most T2D GWASs to date have involved populations of European ancestry and their relevance to other ethnic groups remains uncertain. Mexican Americans, who are at high risk of T2D, have been examined to a limited extent to resolve issues such as allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium differences among diverse populations [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>We previously demonstrated modulation of the expression of IR-associated inflammation genes in skeletal muscle from normal glucose tolerant (NGT) subjects in response to acute hyperinsulinemia during an insulin clamp.[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] We also reported a marked fibrotic inflammatory response in skeletal muscle in response to lipid-induced IR.[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Using DNA microarrays we observed increased expression of extracellular matrix genes, and increases in the corresponding proteins, following a 48 hour lipid infusion[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and described common alterations in expression of genes in the first global comparison of the skeletal muscle transcriptome and proteome[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] to evaluate the relationship between RNA and protein expression in the pathophysiology of IR. These studies provided evidence that transcriptomic data can provide valuable information to generate novel hypotheses regarding muscle function in disease states including insulin resistance. Those findings were extended to adipose tissue in the present study.</p><p>Fat is one of the largest tissues in the body with a normal mean of 18&#x02013;24% body weight in males, 25&#x02013;31% in females and &#x0003e;30% in obese individuals. It is essential for normal energy homeostasis. Dysregulation of normally insulin-sensitive adipose tissue function has been repeatedly shown to be involved in whole body IR, lipotoxicity, obesity and T2D [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119941.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition to its role in energy storage and mobilization in response to fluctuating energy demands, adipose is a dynamic endocrine tissue producing a variety of potent adipokines which interact with other tissues, including skeletal muscle, liver, brain and pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells. Under energy sufficient states insulin promotes the uptake of glucose in fat, its conversion to triacylglycerol for storage, and a decrease in lipolysis of triacylglycerols to produce circulating free fatty acids and glycerol. In energy deficient states, under the control of insulin-antagonistic counterregulatory hormones, including glucagon, these processes are normally reversed such that energy is released from fat stores as free fatty acids for &#x003b2;-oxidation and energy production in skeletal muscle and liver. The term &#x0201c;adiposopathy&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;sick fat&#x0201d; has been used to describe a state of metabolic dysregulation wherein fat becomes resistant to the effects of insulin, failing to take up glucose and switch off lipolysis in response to insulin and producing inappropriate amounts of adipokines [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Adipocyte IR is a complex metabolic disease leading to excess accumulation of triacylglycerols in multiple fat depots, and dysregulated hormonal interaction with other tissues. Thus, adipose IR contributes to whole body IR, obesity and T2D [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>To date there have been no reported systematic studies of adipose tissue genome-wide gene expression (transcriptome) and correlation with clinical metabolic traits in Mexican Americans.

The gene expression dataset was representative of the entire VAGES cohort except that the proportion of individuals with T2D was lower because we selected mainly non-diabetic participants for the transcriptomic/physiologic studies. Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (FAT) biopsies were obtained from a subset of 75 unrelated non-diabetic individuals. In addition, we obtained whole blood (WBCs) samples from 308 individuals and skeletal muscle (SKM) biopsies from 74 non-diabetic individuals. All tissue samples were obtained under fasting conditions in the morning during the participant&#x02019;s clinic visit. RNA samples were used for preparation of cDNAs, and expression of transcripts was measured using Illumina BeadArrays (Human HT-12 V4) in three batches (275, 39, and 168 samples, respectively, with each batch containing samples from all 3 tissues). All but one FAT sample provided high quality gene expression data. Significantly expressed probes were identified within each tissue and batch at a false discovery rate (FDR) set at 5%, and significant probes in any tissue and batch were kept for full processing, so that the probe set includes all relevant probes and the probe sets are identical between tissues for ease of comparison. Subsequently, the expression values for these probes were subjected to background noise subtraction, log<sub>2</sub> transformation, and three rounds of quantile normalization (within tissue of a given batch, across tissues in a given batch, and across batches). A total of 31,545 probes (67% of all probes) were significantly expressed in at least one tissue and batch.

The proportions of significantly expressed genes shared in common (overlapping) between each pair of traits is shown in the upper triangle. Each proportion was calculated with respect to the smaller of the two sets of genes in each trait pair. The largest proportion of genes shared in common was between FPI and HOMA-IR (94%, 992 genes) followed by FPG and HbA1c (85%, 29 genes), and BMI and WC (69%, 106 genes). The large numbers of significantly expressed genes in common between these trait pairs was not surprising given the known physiological relationships between these pairs of traits. For example FPI is a marker of IR and a factor used in the calculation of HOMA-IR; FPG and HbA1c represent levels of blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (which is dependent on levels of blood glucose); and BMI and WC represent related measures of obesity. HbA1c- and FPG-related genes did not overlap with any other traits. Both FPI and HOMA-IR also overlapped with BMI, WC, HDL and ISI, with 21&#x02013;50% of genes shared in common within each trait pair. Both BMI and WC overlapped significantly with HDL and ISI, with overlaps of 18&#x02013;26%. Based on the overall proportion of significantly expressed genes in common, the most strongly related traits were clearly HOMA-IR/FPI/WC/BMI in one &#x0201c;IR cluster&#x0201d; and HbA1c/FPG in a second &#x0201c;glycemic cluster&#x0201d;.

When the duplicate and triplicate genes were taken into account, there remained 36 unique probes. Probe IDs were converted to gene names manually using the Illumina v4 probe list. Several genes were interrogated by more than one unique probe (4 genes had 2 probes each and one gene had 3 probes) and there was one probe with no current annotation (removed from Ensembl in 2009). When these were accounted for, the list of remaining unique genes was 29 (i.e. 36 probes&#x02014;[6 multiplicate probes + 1 non-functional probe] = 29 final genes) (<bold><xref rid="pone.0119941.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref></bold>).

Purely <italic>in silico</italic> annotation was excluded from analysis to minimize potentially spurious results. Following this analysis, two closely related genes, <italic>ADH1A</italic> and <italic>ADH1B</italic> (see below), were significantly enriched in GO categories potentially related to IR/obesity (<bold><xref rid="pone.0119941.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref></bold>). They were the only genes to be significantly associated with putative IR/obesity related mechanisms and pathways and fulfilled multiple related GO criteria for potential involvement in glycolysis and FFA metabolism. No other genes met these criteria. Several other genes scored highly on mechanisms related to cellular structure and muscle contraction. While these potential housekeeping genes cannot be completely excluded from consideration, the likelihood of their involvement in IR/obesity metabolism is smaller. We repeated these gene sets / pathway analyses using the WEB-based Gene Set AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt) analytical engine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/">http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/</ext-link>) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg">www.genome.jp/kegg</ext-link>, accessed 8 December, 2013). Despite the use of this alternative statistical test for enrichment, the results were essentially identical (results not shown). For completeness we next analyzed the gene sets significant at FDR &#x02264; 0.05 for the 8 traits with any significant genes (see <xref rid="pone.0119941.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) containing from 33&#x02013;1437 probes (data not shown). We found little to no improvement in significance for the key GO terms related to glycolysis and FFA metabolism despite, in several cases, an increase in the number of probes within these specific categories. For example, for 175 BMI genes, the number of genes for fatty acid and glycolysis metabolism increased from two to five (with 3 <italic>different</italic> additional genes in each case) with <italic>P</italic> values of 3.81 x 10<sup>&#x02013;3</sup> and 4.25 x 10<sup>&#x02013;2</sup>, respectively, representing no improvement in significance for pathway enrichment.

Given this prior data we therefore focused most of our attention on the B isoform. We performed comparative gene expression measurements on the same fat RNA samples using an independent method, qRT-PCR, to precisely quantitate the transcript abundance of <italic>ADH1B</italic> present in fat samples. All qRT-PCR expression measures were converted to &#x0201c;Calibrated Normalized Relative Quantities&#x0201d; (CNRQs). We previously have shown good agreement between Affymetrix microarray expression data and qRT-PCR measurements of RNA expression (32). qRT-PCR was performed as previously described (32).

However, this may be due to the limited sample size since our prior bivariate analysis in non-diabetics from the entire VAGES cohort revealed a highly significant correlation between lnFPI and lnBMI including a strong genetic component (<bold><xref rid="pone.0119941.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref></bold>).

We repeated correlations of <italic>ADH1B</italic> log<sub>2</sub>expression with lnBMI, lnWC and lnFPI, after adjusting for drinking level (plus age and sex covariates).

Although these studies are specific to the Mexican American population, which has a relatively high prevalence of T2D and related conditions, it is likely that similar gene functional effects will be generalizable to other populations manifesting the same disease-related traits.</p><p><italic>ADH1B</italic> expression, measured both by Illumina BeadArrays and qRT-PCR, was negatively correlated with BMI, WC, FPI and HOMA-IR and positively correlated with the Matsuda ISI. It was not correlated with FPG or FFA. The lack of correlation with FFA could relate to the fact that about half of the FFA produced by lipolysis undergoes local reuptake and re-esterification by adipocytes and thus may not be an ideal measure of adipocyte function. These results clearly indicate decreased expression of <italic>ADH1B</italic> with higher levels of BMI, WC and FPI and hence an inverse relationship with obesity and IR. These relationships were also evident within subjects stratified by pre-T2D status. A negative correlation was found with WC, BMI and FPI in the NGT and IFG/IGT groups. The highly significant correlations of <italic>ADH1B</italic> expression with WC provide evidence for a potentially greater role for this gene in central obesity which is highly correlated with IR. It is not implausible that this relationship might be enhanced by the abdominal location of the adipose tissue biopsies, although they were subcutaneous rather than visceral. The RNA expression results were confirmed at the protein level by Western blotting. ADH1B protein expression was approximately 5-fold higher, on average, in adipose tissue from 6 low-BMI individuals compared with 6 high-BMI individuals. In summary, these direct correlations of <italic>ADH1B</italic> expression with various metabolic measures indicate a strong association of <italic>ADH1B</italic> with obesity and insulin resistance and a possible link with prediabetes.</p><p>The <italic>ADH1A</italic> and <italic>ADH1B</italic> genes are remarkably similar. They are located approximately 15 kb apart in a 380 kb Mb region on chromosome 4q23 that encodes a family of 7 homologous alcohol dehydrogenase genes in a tandem head-to-tail orientation. They share high structural and sequence homology at the DNA sequence level (&#x0003e;90% in exons, &#x0003e;70% in introns). Each has 9 exons and they appear to have arisen by gene duplication events, probably within the primates, with the divergence between <italic>ADH1A</italic> and <italic>ADH1B</italic> having occurred most recently.[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] The proteins share 94% amino acid sequence homology (sharing 355 of 375 aa) and have almost identical tertiary structures and enzymatic mechanisms.[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] Nevertheless despite this close similarity the expression of these two genes in adipose tissue is strikingly different.</p><p>Our selection of <italic>ADH1B</italic> rather than <italic>ADH1A</italic> was largely driven by the compelling evidence of substantially higher, and tissue-specific, expression of <italic>ADH1B</italic> in adipose tissues. Nevertheless, the fact that we have identified two very similar genes (in sequence, structure and enzymatic function) with highly significant correlation with multiple traits, provides stronger evidence since it argues for the relevance of the related functional pathway to the traits of interest. We searched the [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] for any <italic>ADH1B</italic>-related SNP with a threshold P value &#x02264; 10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> (a P value of &#x02264; 10<sup>&#x02013;8</sup> is generally considered necessary to establish genome-wide significance).

This underscores the relative difficulties of GWAS to be able to detect some types of genetic variation at the DNA level which may nevertheless be observable at the gene expression level, especially using precise, accurate physiological measures.</p><p>In a 2006 transcriptomic study of visceral adipose tissue gene expression in 5 type 2 diabetic vs 5 age- and BMI-matched normal glucose tolerant East Asian females, <italic>ADH1B</italic> showed significantly decreased expression in the diabetic patients (Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO] accession GSE16415; &#x0201c;Genome wide gene expression profiling of visceral adipose tissue among Asian Indian diabetics&#x0201d;). Gene expression was four-fold decreased in the diabetic patients vs the controls (52 vs 203 arbitrary units, respectively.) A transcriptomic study of obese vs non-obese subjects approximately equally divided into 3 T2D-related categories (T2D, IGT and NGT; total N = 33) found a significant decrease in <italic>ADH1B</italic> expression in each of the 3 obese groups compared with the matched controls (GEO accession GSE27951)[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>ADH1B and other members of the ADH enzyme family metabolize a wide variety of substrates, including ethanol, retinol, other aliphatic alcohols, hydroxysteroids, and lipid peroxidation products. ADH1B can potentially enhance energy mobilization through two linked mechanisms. (1) It is involved directly in the reversible oxidation of ethanol to acetyl-CoA via acetaldehyde and acetate. Acetyl-CoA feeds directly into the Krebs cycle to be converted to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O with associated energy production. (2) It is involved in the reversible conversion of alcohol to fatty acids, which can then produce acetyl-CoA via &#x003b2;-oxidation. Therefore, elevated levels of ADH1B in human adipocytes could plausibly promote efficient metabolism of energy from alcohol, moderating its storage as fat. This would be consistent with our findings of higher <italic>ADH1B</italic> expression in adipose tissue of subjects with low BMI. (3) A third mechanism linking ADH1B with obesity/IR is its reversible conversion of retinal to retinol (vitamin A alcohol) from precursors. Retinol is specifically transported in the blood by the retinol binding protein (RBP4). RBP4 is an adipokine, secreted by adipocytes, that contributes to IR and obesity although there is some conflict between human and animal studies [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119941.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Retinol and intracellular retinol binding proteins are also important for adipogenesis.</p><p>Apart from ethanol consumption, a second potentially important source of circulating ethanol, even in individuals who do not consume alcoholic beverages, comes from anaerobic fermentation of carbohydrates by microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract (the microbiome)[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Humans are evolutionarily well adapted to utilize ethanol produced by microorganisms in the digestive tract[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and perhaps elsewhere in the body.[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] Krebs demonstrated in 1970 that significant amounts of alcohol, at a rate of up to an ounce (30.4 g) of pure alcohol per day[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], are normally formed in the digestive tract. An important function of liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, representing several similar enzymes) is the detoxification of normally occurring ethanol, with 75&#x02013;90% being oxidized by the liver under normal conditions.[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] Numerous studies have provided extensive evidence for the presence of endogenous ethanol in the human circulatory system [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The levels of circulating endogenous ethanol are low compared with those from typical sources of exogenous ethanol. The lowest reported levels vary from 0.40 mg/l in normal healthy controls, to 6.6-fold higher levels in patients with T2D (2.64 mg/l, P &#x0003c; 0.01)[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], obesity[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] (2.6-fold) and in ob/ob genetically obese mice (3.5 fold).[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] Thus, endogenous ethanol represents a chronic background level of a readily metabolized fuel, second only to fat in caloric density. If 90% of this is oxidized by the Krebs cycle in the liver, the net ethanol in the bloodstream would be 3.04 g or 608 mg/l (in 5 l of blood). This is 1,520-fold higher than the normal mean circulating levels, indicating that approximately 3 g of ethanol may be oxidized elsewhere in extra-hepatic tissues. Thus, about 1% of the recommended daily food intake is available in the blood as endogenous ethanol for potential oxidation in extra-hepatic tissues. Under normal circumstances this additional source of energy is continually removed from the circulation and oxidized, maintaining a constant level of about 0.40 mg/l in the blood. However, if this regular energy supply is supplemented by higher daily food intake, augmented by ethanol intake, or enhanced by decreased energy expenditure, then the effect of this ethanol burning, or lack thereof, could be substantial. If the levels of the extra-hepatic ethanol burning enzyme(s) are relatively decreased then the effect will be even greater.</p><p>Ethanol that is not oxidized by liver ADH is available for metabolism elsewhere in the body. Adipose is one of the largest tissues in the body and one of the most complex and metabolically active, storing and furnishing energy under intricate hormonal control. Furthermore it has by far the highest expression of alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (<italic>ADH1B</italic>) RNA of all tissues examined. It is not currently known what contribution <italic>ADH1B</italic> activity in adipocytes may make to whole body ethanol clearance. However, as noted by Crabb and colleagues[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] ethanol metabolism has not been closely studied in obese individuals in whom adipose tissue might make a substantial contribution to alcohol elimination. For example, even if adipose tissue has 10% of the ADH activity of liver, obese individuals may have 50 times more adipose tissue than liver and adipose metabolism may make a substantial contribution to ethanol removal. This could vary depending on genetic and/or environmental factors. Thus, down-regulation of <italic>ADH1B</italic> expression in the adipose tissue of individuals who transition from lean to obese phenotypes could potentially exacerbate the worsening detrimental metabolic effects of increased adiposity. Many epidemiological studies have reported little, no, or negative weight gain related to alcohol consumption although this is a multifactorial trait and can vary significantly within different cohorts. In a population-based study of the relationship among alcohol intake, body fat, and physical activity, using data (N = 10,550 subjects) from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), moderate and hazardous alcohol drinkers had significantly lower BMI (p &#x0003c; 0.01) and body weight (p &#x0003c; 0.01) than non-drinkers[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In the present study we also found a significant negative correlation between alcohol intake and BMI although alcohol consumption was not a significant covariate and did not affect the correlations between <italic>ADH1B</italic> expression and BMI, WC or FPI.</p><p>The 4q23 chromosomal region has previously been genetically linked to hypertension in a study in Mexican Americans living in San Antonio [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and was recently linked to hip circumference in a study of T2D, obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension in residents of the island of Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia.[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] We previously found evidence for genetic linkage of small dense atherogenic LDL particles at chromosome 4q23 (LOD = 4.1) in Mexican Americans from the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS)[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].

It is, therefore, possible that the link between decreased <italic>ADH1B</italic> gene expression and obesity/IR which we have established in this study may exist both in individuals who do not ultimately develop T2D and those who are highly likely to develop this disease. However, this does not preclude a role for <italic>ADH1B</italic> in T2D given the fact that obesity and IR are primary risk factors for T2D. IR is present in approximately 25% of NGT individuals.[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] Given the multiple well established relationships between obesity/IR and severe metabolic disorders (including the metabolic syndrome, hypertension and cardiovascular disease) it remains the case that disordered regulation of <italic>ADH1B</italic> expression may be involved in manifold complex metabolic diseases with a high societal and economic burden. The functional nature of this relationship, and the specific role of <italic>ADH1B</italic> in adipose tissue, remains to be determined and warrants further investigation.</p><p>Taken together these findings provide strong experimental support for a potential role for adipose <italic>ADH1B</italic> in obesity/IR and T2D. This evidence includes high and specific expression in adipose tissue, strong inverse correlation with BMI, WC, FPI, HOMA-IR, pre-T2D and the Matsuda-ISI (positive correlation), highly significant association with glycolysis and fatty acid metabolism in gene sets analysis, highly significant expression across multiple transcriptomic studies, particularly those involving adipocytes and adipocyte differentiation, and supportive evidence from previous linkage studies, some of which were performed in the same target population of San Antonio Mexican Americans from which adipose tissue biopsies were donated for this study. In conclusion, we have established that there is a strong and consistent pattern of expression of human adipose <italic>ADH1B</italic> associated with various measures of obesity and IR. These findings are consistent with a central role for <italic>ADH1B</italic> in obesity and insulin resistance and provide evidence for a novel genetic regulatory mechanism for human metabolic diseases related to these traits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec015"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Parent Study: The Veterans Administration Genetic Epidemiology Study (VAGES)</title><p>Demographic, genotypic and phenotypic data were collected from Mexican American individuals who were enrolled in the Veterans Administration Genetic Epidemiology Study (VAGES). VAGES families were ascertained on at least 2 siblings and one parent affected with T2D. The study procedures have been described elsewhere (24). The baseline clinical characteristics of all VAGES participants are reported in <bold><xref rid="pone.0119941.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref></bold>. The VAGES baseline [<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] plus its extension data analyses involved information from 1,546 individuals (females = 63.8%, mean age = 50.6 years, T2D = 58.4 and mean BMI = 37.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The heritability (h<sup>2</sup> &#x000b1; SE) of T2D in VAGES data was determined to be 0.54 &#x000b1; 0.11 after adjusting for the significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) covariate effects of age, sex, age<sup>2</sup> and age<sup>2</sup> x sex.

Correlations between T2D-related continuous traits were determined using bivariate genetic analysis and trait-specific covariates. The additive genetic correlation (&#x003c1;<sub>G</sub>) is a measure of the shared genetic basis of the two traits (i.e, pleiotropy). The environmental correlation (&#x003c1;<sub>E</sub>) indexes common nonshared environmental factors influencing the two traits. We partitioned the phenotypic correlations (&#x003c1;<sub>P</sub>) between the traits into genetic (&#x003c1;<sub>G</sub>) and environmental (&#x003c1;<sub>E</sub>) correlations. All &#x003c1;Ps between the trait pairs were highly significant, ranging from -0.32 (fasting insulin/non-diabetics and HDL cholesterol) to 0.73 (BMI and waist circumference [WC]). As expected, HDL-cholesterol was inversely correlated with fasting insulin, BMI, and fasting glucose. All &#x003c1;Gs were significantly influenced by common genetic factors (i.e., pleiotropy) excluding the trait pair fasting insulin and TG which was not significant. The significant &#x003c1;Gs ranged from -0.55 (fasting insulin/non-diabetics and HDL cholesterol) to 1.00 (fasting insulin/non-diabetics and SBP). As expected, HDL-cholesterol was inversely genetically correlated with fasting insulin, BMI, and fasting glucose. Only the &#x003c1;Es between, fasting insulin and triglycerides (TG), fasting glucose and HDL-cholesterol, BMI and WC were statistically significant. In summary, these data reveal that phenotypic correlations among the trait pairs are largely influenced by genetic correlations and these trait pairs are under strong, significant common genetic or pleiotropic influences. These genetic influences underpin the gene expression effects on clinical traits examined in this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Phenotypic Data</title><p>We used data from the VAGES to select 308 individuals for recall to undergo a standard OGTT with blood draws every 30 minutes. The phenotypic data for various metabolic and anthropometric traits, including medical history information, were collected for all study participants. FPG levels were measured during the OGTT. Subjects were classified as having T2D, if they had a fasting glucose concentration &#x02265; 126 mg/dl and/or 2h glucose level &#x02265; 200 mg/dl according to the 1999 criteria of the World Health Organization[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Participants who did not meet these criteria, but reported that they were under treatment with either oral anti-diabetic agents or insulin, and who gave a history of diabetes, also were considered to have T2D. Anthropometric data (i.e., height, weight, and WC) were collected using standardized procedures. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Based on glucose levels at zero and 120 minutes (t<sub>0</sub>, t<sub>120</sub>) of the OGTT, subjects were divided into four pre-diabetic categories: NGT, IFG, IGT, combined IFG/IGT, and T2D.

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA), and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. All clinical procedures were performed at the Diabetes Clinical Center at the South Texas Veterans Health Care System Audie L. Murphy Hospital. Fasting blood samples were analyzed for relevant analyses including: FPG, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), FPI, TG, HDL, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), total cholesterol (TC) and free fatty acids (FFA). These were used to calculate well-validated whole body insulin resistance metrics including the homeostasis model assessment of IR HOMA-IR[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the Matsuda Insulin Sensitivity Index[<xref rid="pone.0119941.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] (measuring the reciprocal of IR), and adipocyte IR index (Adipo-IR).</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Pre-T2D and Adipose IR in the Study Subjects</title><p>Pre-diabetes (pre-T2D) categories were calculated from glucose levels before and at the end of the OGTT. These included impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), combined IFG/IGT in addition to normal glucose tolerance (NGT). We also measured relevant anthropometric variables including BMI, WC, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Glucose, insulin and FFA were measured every 30 minutes during the OGTT in the 309 subjects. Subjects were partitioned by glycemic response into NGT, IFG, IGT, IFG/IGT or T2D. These categories relate to insulin sensitivity defects (i.e. IR) predominantly in liver (IFG), skeletal muscle (IGT) or both (IFG/IGT).

Only one sample (a fat sample) was found to be an outlier with poor quality, leaving 481 samples for further processing. Separately within each tissue and within batch, based on the &#x0201c;detection p-value&#x0201d; provided for each probe by Illumina software, we conducted a binomial test, assessing whether more samples of a given tissue in a given batch had a &#x0201c;detection p-value&#x0201d; &#x02264; 0.05 than expected by chance, before calculating the false discovery rate for a given probe in a given tissue and batch. Those probes significant at FDR 0.05 in any tissue batch (31545 probes, or 67% of all probes) were then subjected, within each tissue and batch, to background noise subtraction, log2 transformation, followed by quantile normalization within tissue and batch, another quantile normalization across tissues within a batch, and lastly a third quantile normalization across the three batches.

In a simple model, variances or covariances between relatives as a function of the genetic relationships can be specified, and the proportion of phenotypic variance that is attributed to additive genetic effects (i.e., heritability: h<sup>2</sup>) can be estimated from the components of variance. The phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlations between T2D-related traits were determined using bivariate genetic analysis. This is an extension of the VC approach where the phenotypic correlation (&#x003c1;<sub>P</sub>) between a pair of quantitative traits can be partitioned into additive genetic (&#x003c1;<sub>G</sub>) and environmental (&#x003c1;<sub>E</sub>) components. To address the issue of non-normality, for a given analysis, outliers, defined as &#x000b1; 4 standard deviations from the mean were excluded. In addition, data were transformed using inverse normalization.
