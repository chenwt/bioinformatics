Since the sequence of events following the blockage of the CD44-HA interaction has not yet been studied in detail, we profiled xenograft tumors by RNA Sequencing to elucidate the mode of action of the anti-CD44 antibody RG7356. Analysis of tumor and host gene-expression profiles led us to the hypothesis that treatment with RG7356 antibody leads to an activation of the immune system. Using cytokine measurements we further show that this activation involves the secretion of chemo-attractants necessary for the recruitment of immune cells (i.e. macrophages) to the tumor site. We finally provide evidence for antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) of the malignant cells by macrophages.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Roche Innovation Center Munich provided support in the form of salaries for authors DM, FB, EV, AN, SB, TF, BG, SW, and VR, but did not have any additional role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

It is overexpressed in several cancer types [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and there is also evidence that its expression is involved in the initiation, progression and prognosis of these cancers [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although the CD44 protein is a rather simple transmembrane molecule (single-chain, single-pass transmembrane receptor), its complexity is the result of multiple isoforms [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which arise by the alternative splicing of variant exons 1&#x02013;10 (v1-v10). Exon v1 is not expressed in human cells since it contains a stop codon. Furthermore, CD44 isoforms are highly N- and O-glycosylated proteins [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Signaling through CD44 involves the formation of complexes with various receptors which have also been involved in cancer, such as cMET, EGFR, HER2 and VEGFR [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], as well as the interaction with its main natural ligand, hyaluronic acid (HA) [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We have recently shown that blocking CD44-binding to HA with RG7356, an anti-CD44 antibody directed against the constant region of CD44, prevents tumor cell adhesion <italic>in vitro</italic> and leads to tumor growth inhibition in several <italic>in vivo</italic> xenograft models [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Furthermore, in a previous global phospho-proteomic analysis we showed that treatment with RG7356 leads to a significant down-regulation of the MAPK cascade after 4.5 hours [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the detailed sequence of transcriptional changes and subsequent events following the blockage of the CD44-HA interaction has not yet been studied in detail.</p><p>Here, we aimed to elucidate the mode of action of RG7356 to understand the tumor microenvironment changes triggered by this antibody. For this purpose, we profiled xenograft tumors by RNASeq which allows assessment of treatment-specific effects on both human tumor and mouse stroma cells in a single expression profiling experiment. We show that RG7356 has an immune stimulatory effect whereas cytokine measurements suggest that this effect is mainly driven by macrophages. We further provide evidence that the immune-stimulatory nature of the molecule is Fc&#x003b3;R-dependent and that antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) constitutes its main mode of action.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>RNA sequencing reveals differences in immune response activation between the tumor and the host</title><p>Using a global phospho-proteomics analysis, we have previously shown that treatment with RG7356 triggers the modulation of the MAPK pathway in an MDA-MB-231 xenograft model, where RG7356 (1mg/kg) leads to 85% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In a subsequent set of experiments we aimed to understand the extent of the observed phospho-proteomic changes and their relevance in differential gene expression. Interestingly, a combined gene-expression and phospho-proteomics analysis suggested an activation of the immune system in this immune-deficient (SCID/bg) xenograft model in response to treatment with RG7356 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0159716.s009">S1 Materials and Methods</xref>). In order to test if the observed immune response involves only the host&#x02019;s stroma and the limited immune cell infiltrate, or also the tumor cell line of human origin, an analysis of both human and mouse immune modulators is necessary. This would additionally shed some light on the underlying mechanisms leading to the activation of an overall immune response and the interplay between tumor and host. On the other hand, since RG7356 is not mouse cross-reactive, the secretion of murine cytokines cannot be initiated by direct binding of RG7356 to CD44 on immune cells but can be either Fc&#x003b3;R-mediated and/or indirectly triggered by tumor-derived immune modulators. With this in mind, we chose an experimental setup including an analysis pipeline enabling the measurement of both the tumor&#x02019;s and the host&#x02019;s gene-expression profile at the same time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0159716.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><p>In brief, MDA-MB231 xenografts were grown for 64 days until median tumor volume reached approximately 250 mm<sup>3</sup> before treatment with RG7356 was started. In order to elucidate the role of the Fc moiety of RG7356, which&#x02013;as an IgG1 &#x02013;bears immune effector functions, an &#x0201c;Fc-silent&#x0201d; version of this antibody was also included in the study, in which RG7356 was expressed as IgG4. Whole tumors were then excised at 4, 8 and 168 hours post-treatment, RNA was extracted and sequenced using Illumina RNA sequencing (RNASeq) which, in contrast to array platforms, allows the measurement of mouse and human RNA patterns in a single experiment. The detailed RNAseq data analysis workflow can be found in Material and Methods. Briefly, reads were aligned against the mouse and human transcriptomes and reads that mapped to both transcriptomes were discarded from further analysis. Gene expression levels (RPKMs) were computed as proposed by Mortazavi <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and DESeq [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] was then used to identify differentially regulated genes between the conditions of interest. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159716.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, we observed time-course-dependent human gene-expression profiles with a high number of acute changes occurring at early time points and almost no significant changes 168 hours post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159716.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, left panel). This pattern was also observed for the murine genes with about twice as many differentially expressed transcripts detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159716.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, right panel). In contrast, almost no significantly differentially expressed genes were observed after treatment with the IgG4 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159716.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0159716.s014">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0159716.s015">S6</xref> Tables).</p><fig id="pone.0159716.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0159716.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>RG7356 treatment leads to a deregulation of genes in both tumor and host at early time points.</title><p>(A) Number of differentially expressed human and mouse transcripts at 3 different time points of anti-CD44 treatment bearing the IgG1 backbone compared to vehicle control.

Together with our previous findings [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], this work provides further insights into the cascade of events upon treatment with RG7356. Recent reports regarding anti-CD44 therapies mostly cover either inflammatory diseases and diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], or rather concentrate on the clinical aspects of oncological treatments [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Here, we provide evidence that one of the main cellular events following CD44-targeting results in macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells. Using RNA sequencing and protein measurements of both tumor and host, we initially hypothesized that treatment with RG7356 not only affects the CD44-dependent tumor biology [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], but also modulates the malignant microenvironment by up-regulating cytokines and chemo-attractants responsible for the activation and recruitment, respectively, of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Furthermore, these RG7356-specific effects seem to be on the one hand Fc&#x003b3;R-dependent (since using the effector-function silent IgG4 version of the same antibody abolishes the immune modulatory reactions), and on the other hand are CD44-specific since an anti-CD45 binding IgG1 does not lead to phagocytosis (data not shown). Although TAMs are known to promote tumor progression [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], it has recently been shown that they maintain Fc-dependent anti-tumor functions and are able to phagocytose tumor cells in the presence of monoclonal antibodies targeting specific tumor antigens [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. RG7356, therefore, belongs to such a group of antibodies that are able to influence the characteristic plasticity of TAMs in order to unmask their anti-tumor potential.</p><p>In Weigand <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we have shown that treatment with RG7356 results in the down-regulation of the MAPK pathway at 4.5h after treatment, which seems contradicting to the activation and initiation of an immune response that we observed in the present gene-expression study. However, we have analyzed further phospho-proteomics data of very early time points after treatment (0.5h and 1.5h, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0159716.s009">S1 Materials and Methods</xref>). Here, an activation of the MAPK cascade can be observed which results into an activation of the immune response observed at 4h and 8h in the tumor and the microenvironmet. The following down-regulation of signaling events as presented in Weigand et al. [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] then translate into a receding immune response and within a week, all levels are back to normal.</p><p>The reasons why the HCC-1937 cell line is not responsive to treatment with RG7356 remain unclear. Very recently, we have shown that there is a strong correlation between the predominant CD44 isoform and RG7356-mediated tumor growth inhibition [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], where the co-expression of any variable exon (&#x0201c;CD44v&#x0201d;) on a tumor cell is predictive for unresponsiveness, probably due to favorable cellular gained functions that arise from CD44v interactions <italic>in cis</italic> with other survival relevant receptors. For example, it has been shown that CD44v is able regulate the redox status in cancer cells by stabilizing the xCT protein (a glutamate-cystine transporter) which, in turn, promotes tumor growth [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, it is conceivable that, in this kind of cases, the tumor cells rely on this new gained function for survival and inhibiting the CD44-HA interaction remains biologically less relevant. Furthermore, HCC-1937 cells not only do carry the CD44v isoform but, in addition, secrete significantly low levels of hyaluronic acid, which is also associated to the isoform status and efficacy to treatment [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These observations together with the fact that HA is described as a strong activator of the immune response [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] might explain the present observations.</p><p>In summary, taken together these data indicate that upon binding to CD44<sup>+</sup> tumor cells <italic>in vivo</italic> RG7356 triggers the secretion of chemo-attractants that are necessary for the recruitment of immune cells (i.e. macrophages) to the tumor site, finally leading to antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) of the malignant cells by macrophages. These RG7356-specific effects are Fc-receptor dependent and seem to take place very early during treatment as they recede to baseline levels within a week.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p>MDA-MB-231 cells (ATCC) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 2mM L-Glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1mM sodiumpyruvate.

We then computed RPKM values for each gene as described by Mortazavi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] using the genes composite length, i.e. the sum of the length of all non-overlapping exon groups, as normalization factor using in-house tools. In order to identify differentially regulated genes we used the DESeq software package [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Pathway and biological function analysis</title><p>For pathway analysis purposes, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Built-in Fisher&#x02019;s Exact Test was used for enrichment analysis of canonical pathways, Downstream Effects Analysis (DEA) was used for prediction of activation of biological processes. DEA was used as described in [<xref rid="pone.0159716.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Luminex data analysis</title><p>The analysis of the Luminex data was initiated with a cluster analysis for descriptive analysis of the data using Ward&#x02019;s method. Additionally, a statistical linear model including the factors compound, time, species and all pairwise interactions was fit to the data of each analyte. The benefit of this method is the potential to assess the effects of all factors on the data simultaneously. Of main interest were significant effects of species, compound and time; interactions of these factors gave additional information on the behavior of a specific analyte. All analyses were performed using the software JMP (SAS Institute Inc., Version 10.0).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Luminex cytokine panel</title><p>For the analysis of the cytokine expression pattern and change during treatment MDA-MB-231 tumor xenograft samples were collected 8 and 168 hours after single treatment with RG7356, &#x0003c;CD44&#x0003e; IgG4 or vehicle. Lysates were generated and measured for human and mouse cytokines using commercial available cytokine multiplex assay kits from BioRad (BioPlex Mouse Cytokine Assay and Bio-Plex Human Cytokine Assay). Tests were done according to manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol using a BioPlex 200. In total, 29 human and 27 mouse cytokines of interest were evaluated with 22 overlapping analytes.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>ELISA assay with tumor lysates</title><p>Excised and weighed tumors were mechanically homogenized in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle. After homogenization and prior to thawing of the powdered tissue tumor lysis buffer (1000 &#x003bc;l per 100 mg of tumor tissue, composition: 10 mM Tris buffer at pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml aprotinin, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF, 0.4 mM orthovanadate) was added. The material was carefully mixed and transferred to Eppendorf tubes and allowed to thaw completely for 15 min. at 4&#x000b0;C. Subsequently the lysate was centrifuged for 15 min. at 20,000g and 4&#x000b0;C. After removal of the fat layer the supernatant was separated from the solid pellet material, split in aliquots and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until analysis. An aliquot was assessed by BCA-assay (Thermo Scientific #23223) giving protein concentrations in the range of 5&#x02013;10 mg/ml.</p><p>Concentrations of mouse MIP-1alpha and MCP-1 were detected using the corresponding ELISA kits from R&#x00026;D Systems (MMA00 and MJE00) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title><italic>Ex vivo</italic> analysis of tumor infiltrates</title><p>Explanted tumors were immediately transferred to RPMI1640-containing plates on ice and cut into 2&#x02013;4mm pieces using scalpel. An enzymatic digestion was then performed during 30min at 37&#x000b0;C in medium containing Dispase II (1 mg/ml; Roche), Collagenase I (1mg/ml; Sigma) and DNAse I (0.01%; Roche). Samples were passed through a 70 &#x003bc;m-cell strainer, centrifuged, resuspended in medium and passed through a 40 &#x003bc;m-cell strainer. After one more washing step, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS containing 3% FCS and 2mM EDTA) and incubated with CD16/CD32 Fc Block (BD) before staining with the following specific antibodies (or their corresponding isotype controls): CD45-APC, CD11b-BV570, MHCII-FITC, CD163-PE, Ly6G-PerCP-Cy5.5, F4/80-PE-Cy7 and Ly6C-APC-Cy7, for 20min on ice (all antibodies from Biolegend). Finally, cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer containing 1 &#x003bc;g/ml DAPI and measured at a FACS Canto II (BD).</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Phagocytosis assays</title><p>For flow cytometry assays, mouse macrophages were generated by isolating bone marrow cells from healthy 5-week old C57BL/6 mice and culturing them on 10 cm UpCell plates (Nunc) for 7 days in DMEM medium (PAN Biotech) supplemented with 10% FCS (Gibco), 2mM L-Glutamine (PAA), Penicilin/Streptomycin (Roche), and 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse M-CSF (Biomol) before being activated for 24h with 100 ng/ml LPS (Sigma). Tumor cells were labeled with 2 &#x003bc;M CMFDA green (Life Technologies) for 1h before plating them together with the activated macrophages at a 1:2 ratio (tumor:macrophage) in the absence or presence of control or anti-CD44 antibodies at the given concentrations. Co-cultures were incubated for 30min and then cells were detached, washed and stained using an anti-CD11b BV570 antibody (Biolegend) to label the macrophages. DAPI was finally added for viable/dead gating, samples were measured at FACS Canto II and data analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar). A similar set of assays was performed using human macrophages, generated as stated below, yielding the same results. The phagocytic index (PI) was calculated according to the following formula: PI = (total number of engulfed cells/total number of counted macrophages) &#x000d7; (number of macrophages containing engulfed cells/total number of counted macrophages) &#x000d7; 100, where the total number of engulfed cells was calculated as the difference between the initial and final counts of tumor cells, and the CD11b<sup>+</sup>CMFDA<sup>+</sup> double positive cells were considered as the number of macrophages containing engulfed cells. Two-way ANOVA was performed for statistical analysis and the Bonferroni&#x02019;s method was used for multiple testing correction.</p><p>For live imaging, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from whole blood by Ficoll centrifugation followed by negative isolation of human monocytes using the Monocyte Isolation kit II from Miltenyi. The obtained monocytes were stimulated with 20ng/ml rh-MCSF (Biomol) for 6 days in UpCell dishes (Nunc), then medium (RPMI-1640 without phenolred + 10% heat-inactivated FCS + 2mM L-glutamine + penicillin/streptomycin) was aspirated and fresh medium containing 20ng/ml rh-MCSF and 10ng/ml rh-IL-10 (RnD Systems) was added. After incubation for further 24h at 37&#x000b0;C, macrophages were detached, stained with 5 &#x003bc;M CMTMR Orange (Life Technologies), seeded at 1x10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in 96er microtiter plates and further incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 24h. Tumor cells were stained with 2&#x003bc;M CMFDA Green (Life Technologies) on assay day. After staining and detaching, target cells were incubated with 10&#x003bc;g/ml anti-CD44 antibody or huIgG1 isotype for 30min at RT. After two washing steps with PBS to remove excess antibody, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15min at RT. Finally, 5x10<sup>3</sup> tumor cells were pipetted to each well onto the macrophages. Plate was immediately spun down and images were recorded every 30 min for 10 hours using a Perkin Elmer Operetta HTS (a minimum of 15 fields/well/time point were recorded). The total number of CMFDA-positive cells was monitored using the Harmony software and statistically analyzed by Two-way ANOVA and the Bonferroni&#x02019;s multiple comparison test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0159716.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Experimental setup for short-term MDA-MB231 xenograft in vivo study.</title><p>(PPTX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0159716.s001.pptx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0159716.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Functional analysis of gene-expression data.</title><p>(A) Overview of biological processes and functions affected by anti-CD44 treatment RG7356 treatment in the tumor (left) and the mouse (right); (B) Heatmap view of predicted activity of biological processes obtained from IPA downstream processes analysis for the tumor (left) and the host (right).
