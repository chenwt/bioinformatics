Increased expression and function of NR4A2 have been attributed to various signaling pathways, but little is known about microRNA (miRNA) regulation of <italic>NR4A2</italic> in cancer. To investigate the posttranscriptional regulation of <italic>NR4A2</italic>, we used a 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) reporter screen and identified miR-34 as a putative regulator of <italic>NR4A2</italic>. By using computer predictions, we identified and confirmed an miRNA recognition element in the 3&#x02032; UTR of <italic>NR4A2</italic> that was responsible for miR-34&#x02013;mediated suppression. We next demonstrated that overexpression of exogenous miR-34 or activation of the p53 pathway, which regulates endogenous miR-34 expression, decreased NR4A2 expression. Consistent with previous reports, overexpression of <italic>NR4A2</italic> blocked the induction of p53 target genes, including <italic>mir-34a</italic>. This was a phenotypic effect, as <italic>NR4A2</italic> overexpression could rescue cells from p53-induced inhibition of proliferation. In summary, our results are the first characterization of a cancer-related miRNA capable of regulating <italic>NR4A2</italic> and suggest a network and possible feedback mechanism involving p53, miR-34, and NR4A2.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily is a group of ligand-regulated transcription factors that control specific gene activity. NRs are thus important drug targets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The 48 members of the human NR family share a common modular structure that includes an N-terminal domain containing an activation function 1 (AF-1) region, a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a hinge region, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) that also harbors an AF-2 domain. NR subfamily 4 group A (NR4A) consists of three highly homologous NRs, including <italic>NR4A2</italic> (also called Nurr1, NOT, TINUR, or NGFI-B&#x003b2;), that are characterized as immediate-early genes induced by mitogens, growth factors, and other stimuli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The NR4A receptors have been implicated as having roles in multiple tissues and diseases, including cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, and their expression and function are associated with various oncogene and tumor suppressor pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>NR4A2 is involved in cancer progression through a mechanism that has yet to be fully described. Most research indicates that NR4A2 has an oncogenic-like role, as it mediates cell proliferation, survival, transformation, invasion, and migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. NR4A2 is highly expressed in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), as compared to normal patient tissues, and prostaglandin-mediated induction of NR4A2 expression in SCC leads to increased resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The effects of NR4A2 on chemoresistance are also seen in colorectal cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, and high expression of NR4A2 predicts a poor outcome for gastric cancer patients receiving 5-FU therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. NR4A2 may mediate these effects through a previously described NR4A2-p53 interaction that serves to suppress p53 transactivation, thereby protecting cells from p53-induced apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Another NR4A family member, NR4A1 (also called Nur77, TR3, or NGFI-B&#x003b1;), has also been implicated in p53 suppression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>As the main arbiter of cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and apoptosis, p53 is a central hub for regulating tumor suppression. These effects are mediated through p53 target genes, which include the microRNA-34 (miR-34) family<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous, noncoding RNAs that help regulate target gene networks by binding complementarily to the 3&#x02032; untranslated regions (UTRs) of target genes to degrade or prevent their translation into proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The miR-34 family, which consists of three isoforms (miR-34a, miR-34b, and miR-34c) encoded by two p53 direct transcriptional target genes (<italic>mir-34a</italic> and <italic>mir-34b/c</italic>), is considered to be partly responsible for carrying out p53&#x02019;s tumor suppressive function by targeting the 3&#x02032; UTRs of genes that are critical to the cell cycle and survival, such as <italic>BCL2</italic>, cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and <italic>MYCN</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In mice, <italic>mir-34a</italic> is expressed at higher levels than <italic>mir-34b/c</italic>, except in lung tissues, where <italic>mir-34b/c</italic> is dominantly expressed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Although miR-34 is dispensable for p53 tumor suppression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, it is critical for enhancing p53 stability and activity through miR-34&#x02013;mediated suppression of negative regulators of p53, such as Sirt1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and Hdm4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The miR-34 isoforms have been clinically characterized as tumor suppressors in multiple cancer types, often independent of p53 mutation, as in neuroblastoma, where <italic>mir-34a</italic> is commonly deleted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, or in other cancers characterized by epigenetic silencing of miR-34<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p><p>Recently, miR-132 was reported to target mouse <italic>Nr4a2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>; the first characterization of an miRNA targeting an NR4A member. In this study, to determine whether human <italic>NR4A2</italic> is regulated by miRNAs and investigate its oncogenic-like role, we used an miRNA screening approach to identify cancer-relevant posttranscriptional regulatory networks of <italic>NR4A2</italic>, a subject that has not been fully explored. We identified miR-34 as a direct regulator of <italic>NR4A2</italic> through a specific sequence in its 3&#x02032; UTR. Furthermore, we determined that elevated miR-34 levels, resulting from exogenous overexpression or endogenous induction in a p53-dependent manner, decreased the levels of NR4A2. Corroborating the reported NR4A2-mediated inhibition of p53<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, we found that overexpression of NR4A2 inhibited the ability of p53 to activate its target genes, including <italic>mir-34a</italic>. Lastly, overexpression of NR4A2 attenuated the sensitivity of cells to the p53 activator Nutlin-3a. These data are consistent with previous findings and, for the first time, identify miR-34 as a direct negative regulator of <italic>NR4A2</italic>. Together, they reveal a novel regulatory network linking p53, miR-34, and NR4A2, in which p53 can overcome its inhibition by endogenous NR4A2 through upregulating miR-34.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of miRNAs directly targeting the 3&#x02032; UTR of <italic>NR4A2</italic></title><p>Increased <italic>NR4A2</italic> expression in cancer has been characterized as resulting from cell signaling events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, but miRNA-mediated regulation of <italic>NR4A2</italic> in cancer has hitherto been unexplored. To identify putative miRNAs capable of regulating <italic>NR4A2</italic> through its 3&#x02032; UTR, we assessed the effects of 75 cancer-relevant miRNAs by using a luciferase reporter system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Precursor miRNAs selected from an established library<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) or an miRNA negative control (pSIF) were cotransfected with the <italic>NR4A2</italic> 3&#x02032; UTR reporter plasmid (WT 3UTR) in 293T cells. We observed that several miRNAs, including miR-34c, were capable of decreasing the luminescence reporter signal to a significantly greater extent than was miR-132, an miRNA that targets <italic>Nr4a2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> (log2 fold changes of &#x02212;0.47521 and &#x02212;0.29685, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.0001 and <italic>P&#x02009;=&#x02009;</italic>0.0086, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). This suggested that miR-34c was a modulator of <italic>NR4A2</italic> through its 3&#x02032; UTR.</p><p>By using three different miRNA prediction algorithm tools (TargetScan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, miRanda<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, and PicTar<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), we identified <italic>NR4A2</italic> as a predicted target of the miR-34 family (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), further suggesting that this family of miRNAs were regulators of <italic>NR4A2</italic>. As expected, miR-132 was also predicted to target <italic>NR4A2</italic>. To corroborate the findings from &#x0201c;first-generation&#x0201d; prediction tools, we used the CoMeTa interactive database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, which integrates thousands of publicly available gene-expression datasets with the assumption that the predicted targets of an miRNA will be coexpressed with each other. The authors noted that targets falling within the top 50<sup>th</sup> percentile of the CoMeTa analysis &#x0201c;co-rank&#x0201d; list for putative miRNA targets are highly predictive, based on previous dataset validation. CoMeTa analysis indicates that <italic>NR4A2</italic> falls within the top 40.568 and 39.182 percentiles for miR-34a and miR-34c-5p, respectively. By using the prediction algorithms, we identified a predicted miRNA recognition element complementary to the miR-34 seed region in the 3&#x02032; UTR of <italic>NR4A2</italic> and mutated this sequence to disrupt the complementarity in order to determine if there was direct regulation by miR-34 at this specific site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The wild-type 3&#x02032; UTR (WT 3UTR) reporter signal was effectively suppressed by cotransfection of miR-34a or miR-34c (52% and 62% of the control level, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.0001 for all) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). The effect of miR-34a or miR-34c, compared to that of the control, was not significant when the miRNA was cotransfected with the 3&#x02032; UTR containing the seed-region mutation (34mut). Mutation of this predicted seed region was able to rescue the attenuation of the luminescence signal by miR-34a or miR-34c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>), increasing the signal from 52% to 99% and from 62% to 111% of the control level, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.0001 for all). These data indicate that miR-34 can target <italic>NR4A2</italic> at a specific seed complementarity region within its 3&#x02032; UTR. Furthermore, by analyzing a dataset from 97 patient samples with rectum adenocarcinoma, we found that the expression of <italic>NR4A2</italic> and miR-34a was inversely correlated to a similar extent as other miR-34 targets <italic>AXL</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> and <italic>SIRT1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S1 and S2</xref>). The read counts for miR-34b and miR-34c in this dataset were very low (data not shown), which is consistent with the known expression patterns of <italic>mir-34b/c</italic> primarily in lung tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, making correlation analyses for the <italic>mir-34b/c</italic> isoforms not suitable.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>miR-34 regulates endogenous NR4A2 levels</title><p>We next determined the <italic>in vitro</italic> effect of miR-34 on endogenous NR4A2 mRNA and protein levels through the use of miRNA mimics. Mature miR-34a-5p or miR-34c-5p mimics or a control (CmiR) were overexpressed in HCT116<sup><italic>TP53</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (KO) or HCT116 wild-type (WT) isogenic cell lines to assess the direct effects of forced miRNA expression on <italic>NR4A2</italic>. Transfection of mature miR-34 mimics increased the expression of each miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Transfection of miR-34a-5p slightly increased miR-34c-5p expression, probably because of specificity differences in the stem loop primers caused by the approximately 80% sequence homology of the two miR-34 isoforms. Overexpression of the miR-34a-5p mimic reduced the endogenous <italic>NR4A2</italic> expression to 59% and 64% of the control level in KO and WT cells, respectively, by 12&#x02009;h post-transfection, whereas overexpression of the miR-34c-5p mimic reduced the <italic>NR4A2</italic> expression to 71% and 66% of the control level in KO and WT cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), and this effect was independent of p53 status. At 24&#x02009;h post-transfection, the effect of the miR-34 mimics on <italic>NR4A2</italic> levels in HCT116 with wild-type p53 was no longer obvious, by comparison to the control. Additionally, the transfection of miR-34 mimics led to increased expression of the p53 target gene <italic>CDKN1A</italic>/p21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>), increased p53 protein expression and acetylation, and subsequent p21 protein levels (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>) in wild-type HCT116 cells. The observation that increased levels of miR-34 led to enhanced p53 protein expression and activity probably reflects the known suppressive function of miR-34 on negative regulators of p53 protein stability (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, though <italic>TP53</italic> gene expression (in terms of mRNA levels) was also slightly increased by the miR-34 mimics (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). The slight but significant increase in <italic>TP53</italic> expression induced by the miR-34 mimics is consistent with the observation that the levels of <italic>NR4A2</italic> correlate inversely with that of <italic>TP53</italic> gene expression, as discussed later. After 48&#x02009;h of miR-34 mimic overexpression in HCT116 cells, the protein levels of NR4A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>) and another miR-34 target, Sirt1 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>), were reduced in both KO and WT cells. Additionally, the effect of mature miR-34 mimics on <italic>NR4A2</italic> expression was assessed in another colorectal cancer cell line, RKO, with similar results observed on <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>NR4A2</italic> expression (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). These data demonstrate that exogenous overexpression of a mature miR-34 decreases the levels of endogenous NR4A2 at both mRNA and protein level, regardless of the p53 status. The differential effect of exogenous miR-34 mimic on endogenous <italic>NR4A2</italic> may be attributable to the different levels of endogenous <italic>NR4A2</italic> mRNA in <italic>TP53</italic>+/+ and <italic>TP53</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells, although NR4A2 protein expression was substantially decreased in both <italic>TP53</italic>-isogenic backgrounds in response to exogenous miR-34 mimic. Additionally, we found that the protein level of NR4A2 was enhanced in RKO cells by a miR-34a inhibitor (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>), further supporting the regulation of NR4A2 by miR-34.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>p53 activation suppresses endogenous NR4A2 levels</title><p>As <italic>mir-34a</italic> is a direct transcriptional target of p53<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, we next sought to determine if <italic>NR4A2</italic> expression was regulated by endogenous miR-34a in a p53-dependent manner. We treated cells with a chemical activator of p53, Nutlin-3a<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, and confirmed that the p53 protein level increased after the treatment in cells expressing wild-type p53 (WT) but not in p53-deficient (KO) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). As expected, the expression of transcriptional targets of p53, <italic>CDKN1A</italic>/p21 and <italic>BBC3</italic>/Puma, was also induced in a p53-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). HCT116<sup><italic>CDKN1A</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and HCT116<sup><italic>BBC3</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells were used to demonstrate that Nutlin-3a acts upstream of <italic>CDKN1A</italic>/p21 and <italic>BBC3</italic>/Puma through p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We also found increased expression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic>/p21 and <italic>mir-34a</italic> in cells expressing wild-type p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>), accompanied by decreased <italic>NR4A2</italic> transcript levels after 48&#x02009;h of treatment with Nutlin-3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The NR4A family, including <italic>NR4A2</italic>, are immediate-early responsive genes that are inducible by many external stimuli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, and at an earlier time point (24&#x02009;h), the levels of <italic>NR4A2</italic> mRNA were actually increased by Nutlin-3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). In agreement with mRNA expression, Nutlin-3a treatment for 48&#x02009;h also caused a decrease in the NR4A2 protein expression in WT cells, but not in KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>), further demonstrating the p53 requirement for Nutlin-3a&#x02013;induced NR4A2 decrease. In addition to NR4A2, Nutlin-3a was also capable of decreasing the protein expression of Sirt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>), a known target of miR-34<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, suggesting that p53 activation can regulate other downstream factors, possibly through miR-34. We confirmed these results in other colorectal cell lines (RKO and SW48) that are isogenic for <italic>TP53</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S5 and S6</xref>). These data indicate that p53 activation can induce the expression of <italic>mir-34a</italic>, while also decreasing the endogenous levels of NR4A2 and another known target of miR-34 (Sirt1). These results are consistent with the observation that the levels of miR-34 and NR4A2 are inversely correlated.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Overexpression of <italic>NR4A2</italic> suppresses p53 activation</title><p>It was previously reported that NR4A2 suppressed the transcriptional activity of p53 in the presence or absence of doxorubicin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. We sought to determine the effects of <italic>NR4A2</italic> overexpression on the induction of p53 activation by Nutlin-3a. HCT116 cells were transduced with lentivirus expressing empty vector control (EV) or 3xFlag-NR4A2, and overexpression of <italic>NR4A2</italic> was confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The EV- or 3xFlag-NR4A2&#x02013;transduced cells were treated with Nutlin-3a to determine the effect on p53 downstream target genes. Upon Nutlin-3a treatment, overexpression of <italic>NR4A2</italic> led to a significant attenuation of the p53-induced expression of the target genes <italic>mir-34a</italic> and <italic>CDKN1A</italic>/p21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>). To assess the effect of NR4A2 on the binding of p53 to target gene promoters, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay.

This process can be quite complex, as overlapping miRNA-mRNA networks can be formed, with a single miRNA having multiple targets or a single mRNA being a target for multiple miRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Research on miRNA regulation and the validation of biological targets has continued to increase in an effort to understand the multiple cellular pathways that are affected by specific miRNAs, and this area remains of particular interest as additional miRNA-based therapies are investigated and placed into clinical trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.</p><p>The NR4A family of orphan nuclear receptors has been studied extensively in various cancer models, and its regulation and function have been connected to multiple oncogenic and tumor suppressive pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. However, the contribution of miRNAs to the expression of the NR4A family is unclear. In this report, we have presented a novel p53&#x02013;miR-34 regulatory mechanism of the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A2, in which miR-34 directly and negatively regulates NR4A2, which is itself able to repress p53-induced gene expression to rescue the inhibition of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). This is the first miRNA to be characterized as targeting the human NR4A2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p><p>Based on the known roles of NR4A2 in oncogenic processes within cancer, we posited that a likely candidate miRNA would be one that harbored tumor-suppressive functions and was downregulated in cancer, consequently leading to upregulation of NR4A2. As presented here, we identified and described the direct regulation of NR4A2 by miR-34, a well-described tumor suppressor&#x02013;like miRNA that targets genes involved in cancer progression and is increasingly being exploited for its therapeutic advantage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Whereas other putative miRNAs were identified as targeting <italic>NR4A2</italic>, we focused on the miR-34 family because of the known role of NR4A members in inhibiting p53<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and the positive regulation of miR-34 by p53<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, thereby framing our discovery of the regulation of NR4A2 by miR-34 as a possible feedback mechanism. The miR-34 isoforms, predominantly <italic>mir-34a</italic>, have tumor suppressor functions in multiple cancer types, which is sometimes attributed to their p53 status<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, though the mechanisms of chromosomal deletion or epigenetic silencing are also major contributors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, and miR-34 expression is prognostic for patient outcome or relapse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Likewise, several studies have demonstrated the ability of miR-34a restoration to sensitize cells to chemotherapeutic agents, including erlotinib<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, Adriamycin/doxorubicin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, and 5-FU<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. By using a colorectal cancer cell line pair that was sensitive or resistant to 5-FU, Akao <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that miR-34a was significantly downregulated in the resistant cells, and this was accompanied by increased expression of <italic>SIRT1</italic>, a target of miR-34. The expression of endogenous miR-34a remained low in 5-FU&#x02013;resistant cells treated with 5-FU, and the restoration of miR-34a or knockdown of <italic>SIRT1</italic> in the resistant cells overcame their resistant phenotype. In light of this observation, it would be interesting to study the relationship of miR-34 and NR4A2 with respect to chemoresistance, as increased NR4A2 expression is correlated with worse patient outcomes with regard to 5-FU therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>By using an <italic>in vitro</italic> luminescence reporter-based screening assay and three computer-based prediction algorithms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, we identified miR-34c as a putative regulator of <italic>NR4A2</italic> via its 3&#x02032; UTR region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). This regulatory effect was confirmed by using mutagenesis of the predicted miRNA recognition element that is complementary to the miR-34 seed region. Other miRNAs from this screen have been evaluated using computer-based and mutagenesis approaches (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and unpublished data), and the functional significance of these miRNA regulators of <italic>NR4A2</italic> remains to be elucidated in future studies. Using publically available data, we found a weak negative (inverse) correlation of miR-34a with <italic>NR4A2</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S1 and S2</xref>), which was similar to the correlations of miR-34a with other known miR-34 target genes, such as <italic>AXL</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> and <italic>SIRT1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, although <italic>NOTCH1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> did not show a negative correlation as expected. Interestingly, the patient sample data demonstrated two populations of <italic>TP53</italic>-expressing cells, and when we considered only those patient tumor samples with normal levels of <italic>TP53</italic>, the correlation became stronger. As we would hypothesize, there was a positive correlation of <italic>NR4A2</italic> with <italic>AXL</italic> and <italic>SIRT1</italic> since these genes share a common miRNA regulator, miR-34. Consistent with our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figures 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5e</xref>, the level of <italic>NR4A2</italic> was negatively correlated to that of <italic>TP53</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p>The next objective was to determine whether miR-34 could regulate endogenous NR4A2, at both mRNA and protein levels. Indeed, overexpression of mature miR-34 isoforms reduced the endogenous levels of NR4A2 mRNA and protein in both wild-type and p53-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). This would be expected, as forced expression of exogenous miR-34 bypasses the requirement for p53. Additionally, miR-34 overexpression enhanced the p53 activity in wild-type cells, probably because of the known regulatory effect of miR-34 on negative regulators of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). This effect is largely the result of increased p53 protein levels rather than substantial changes in <italic>TP53</italic> transcript levels (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). The effect of miR-34 on <italic>NR4A2</italic> was not as dramatic in the HCT116 p53 wild-type cells, especially at a later time point (24&#x02009;h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), possibly because the lower levels of <italic>NR4A2</italic> in these cells no longer respond to exogenous miR-34 expression after the initial transfection, although reduced protein expression was observed at 48&#x02009;h post-transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). This effect could also result from the delicate balance of <italic>NR4A2</italic> expression being regulated directly by miR-34 or indirectly through cellular stress. Correspondingly, RKO p53 wild-type cells had higher levels of endogenous <italic>NR4A2</italic> and responded better to miR-34 mimics than their p53-deficient counterpart (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>), further supporting the notion that endogenous levels of <italic>NR4A2</italic> affect its response to exogenous miR-34.</p><p>To further understand the importance of miR-34 regulation of <italic>NR4A2</italic> in the cellular context, we examined the relationship between endogenous miR-34 and endogenous <italic>NR4A2</italic> by using our isogenic cell line pairs that possess wild-type or deleted <italic>TP53</italic>. One interesting observation was that treating HCT116 cells with Nutlin-3a at an early time point (24&#x02009;h) led to increased <italic>NR4A2</italic> expression, but the opposite effect was observed at a later time point (48&#x02009;h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Consistent with this result, the NR4A2 protein expression was also reduced after 48&#x02009;h of Nutlin-3a treatment in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). The NR4A family are immediate-early genes that are inducible by many stimuli, including cell stress and cytotoxic agents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, whereas Nutlin-3a has a p53-independent role and can induce a DNA damage response leading to cell cycle arrest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. One of these properties might account for the earlier induction of <italic>NR4A2</italic> by Nutlin-3a, as the NR4A family mediates DNA double-strand break repair<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. This hypothesis could be further tested by using <italic>MDM2</italic>-deficient cells to determine if these effects are independent of the primary role of Nutlin-3a in Mdm2 inhibition.</p><p>Finally, we investigated the previously reported inhibitory effect of NR4A2 on p53 activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> to determine if this regulation had an effect in the cellular context. We confirmed that overexpression of exogenous <italic>NR4A2</italic> can inhibit p53 induction of target genes in response to Nutlin-3a treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>) and that the opposite effect is seen when <italic>NR4A2</italic> expression is reduced by using siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Our data indicate that this effect might be achieved at least partially through NR4A2 suppression of <italic>TP53</italic>/p53 gene expression. Further investigation is warranted to determine if this suppression results from direct or indirect repression of the <italic>TP53</italic> promoter. The suppressive effect of NR4A2 on the expression of p53 and its transcriptional targets was not reflected in changes in the binding of p53 to its target gene promoters. However, this finding may reflect the sensitivity of the assay, as even in the presence of NR4A2, enough p53 may be present to saturate the promoter response elements during Nutlin-3a treatment. It is also possible that NR4A2 is not inhibitory to p53 binding but is repressive of p53 transactivation at its target gene promoters.</p><p>NR4A2 inhibition of the p53 response has previously been investigated only with respect to the genotoxic agent doxorubicin; here, we have demonstrated a similar effect using a more targeted p53 activator. When cells overexpressing <italic>NR4A2</italic> were subjected to prolonged treatment with Nutlin-3a, we observed a substantial rescue of cells from Nutlin-3a&#x02013;induced inhibition of proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of <italic>NR4A2</italic> on p53 activation is responsible for phenotypic observations that are indicative of p53-induced tumor suppression. Interestingly, in cells overexpressing <italic>NR4A2, NR4A2</italic> expression was increased in Nutlin-3a&#x02013;treated cells after prolonged treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). This effect may be attributable to the ability of <italic>NR4A2</italic> to repress the inhibition of cell proliferation, and as the selective pressure of Nutlin-3a is applied to all the cells, those cells expressing the highest levels of <italic>NR4A2</italic> persist in culture.</p><p>In summary, our study identified and confirmed a novel regulation of NR4A2 by miR-34. This regulatory effect is observed in the context of p53 activation, and NR4A2 itself is able to repress the p53 response. These events can be regarded as a positive feedback loop for p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>), much like other miR-34 targets that also suppress p53<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In tumors expressing wild-type p53, this can serve as a means by which p53 can release itself from repression by NR4A2, further enhancing the p53 response. Alternatively, cells that contain p53 mutations or that overexpress <italic>NR4A2</italic> through other means may lack the p53-mediated suppression of NR4A2, allowing NR4A2 to perform other oncogenic activities through its role as a transcription factor. As tumors lose expression of <italic>mir-34</italic>, through promoter methylation or the loss of p53, the expression and function of NR4A2 may become enhanced, shifting the balance from tumor suppression to tumor progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>), though this may not be directly traceable because of the complexity of miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>All cell lines were grown in culture at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Cell extracts were digested for 10&#x02009;min with 50&#x02009;units of micrococcal nuclease (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and further sonicated to yield sheared DNA fragments with an average length of 200 to 1000 base pairs. The sonicated samples were centrifuged to pellet the cell debris, and the supernatant was diluted 7-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2&#x02009;mM EDTA, 16.7&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167&#x02009;mM&#x02009;NaCl, and protease inhibitor cocktail). The samples were precleared with ChIP-grade Protein G agarose beads (Cell Signaling, #9007) in ChIP dilution buffer (1:1 ratio). Diluted supernatant (100&#x02009;&#x003bc;L) was reserved as input (10%) for each treatment. Chromatin (1&#x02009;mL) was used for each immunoprecipitation and was incubated overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with mouse anti-p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-126; DO-1) or control mouse IgG. The antibody-protein-DNA complexes were precipitated by incubation with Protein G&#x02013;agarose beads for 2&#x02009;h at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The protein-DNA complexes were eluted from the beads with elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>). The crosslinks were reversed, and DNA was eluted from the protein-DNA complexes by adding 200&#x02009;mM&#x02009;NaCl and incubating at least overnight at 65&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. DNA was recovered and purified after protein digestion with Proteinase K at 45&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02009;h using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood &#x00026; Tissue Kit (Qiagen Cat. No: 69506). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to determine the changes in p53 occupancy at various known sites of p53 binding. The double-negative controls were nonspecific antibody (normal mouse IgG) and primers coding for regions that do not interact with p53. The thermal cycling conditions were 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;min followed by 45 cycles of 25&#x02009;s at 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 30&#x02009;s at 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and 30&#x02009;s at 72&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.

(<bold>c</bold>) The cells were then collected and expression of <italic>NR4A2</italic> was determined using TaqMan qPCR probes (normalized to <italic>ACTB</italic>). The value for DMSO-treated EV was set as 1.

Additionally, our studies extend the finding that NR4A2 can suppress p53 expression and transcriptional targets, including Nutlin-3a&#x02013;induced activation of <italic>mir-34a</italic>. The p53&#x02013;miR-34 regulation of <italic>NR4A2</italic> may serve as a protective mechanism to prevent p53 suppression by NR4A2, in addition to suppressing other tumorigenic properties of NR4A2. The long arrow indicates activation; the blunt arrows indicate inhibition; the blunt arrow with the dotted line highlights the inhibition of <italic>NR4A2</italic> by miR-34 that indirectly activates p53. As tumors lose expression of mir-34, the expression and function of NR4A2 may become enhanced, shifting the balance from tumor suppression to tumor progression.</p></caption><graphic
