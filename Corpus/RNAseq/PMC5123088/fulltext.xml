The resultant hyperglycaemia has deleterious effects on many tissues, including &#x003b2;-cells. Here we show that chronic hyperglycaemia impairs glucose metabolism and alters expression of metabolic genes in pancreatic islets. In a mouse model of human neonatal diabetes, hyperglycaemia results in marked glycogen accumulation, and increased apoptosis in &#x003b2;-cells. Sulphonylurea therapy rapidly normalizes blood glucose levels, dissipates glycogen stores, increases autophagy and restores &#x003b2;-cell metabolism. Insulin therapy has the same effect but with slower kinetics. Similar changes are observed in mice expressing an activating glucokinase mutation, in <italic>in vitro</italic> models of hyperglycaemia, and in islets from type-2 diabetic patients. Altered &#x003b2;-cell metabolism may underlie both the progressive impairment of insulin secretion and reduced &#x003b2;-cell mass in diabetes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

This process is impaired in diabetes, leading to chronic elevation of the blood glucose concentration. Long-term hyperglycaemia has deleterious effects in many tissues. In &#x003b2;-cells, it causes a reduction in insulin release, in insulin granule density and in &#x003b2;-cell number, a phenomenon termed glucotoxicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Numerous studies have examined the effects of hyperglycaemia on &#x003b2;-cell structure and function, both <italic>in vitro</italic>, using isolated islets or insulin-secreting cell lines, or <italic>in vivo,</italic> using obese diabetic animal models, but few have examined the time dependence and reversibility of the effects of hyperglycaemia, or the mechanisms involved. We have therefore investigated the progressive changes in &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction produced by diabetes, and their reversal, using an inducible mouse model of neonatal diabetes caused by an activating mutation in the ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>The K<sub>ATP</sub> channel couples blood glucose levels to insulin secretion by virtue of its sensitivity to changes in &#x003b2;-cell metabolism. Elevation of blood glucose stimulates glucose uptake and metabolism by the &#x003b2;-cell, thereby increasing intracellular ATP. This closes K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and leads to &#x003b2;-cell depolarization, calcium influx and insulin granule exocytosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Gain-of-function mutations in either the Kir6.2 (<italic>KCNJ11</italic>) or SUR1 (<italic>ABCC8</italic>) subunit of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel are a major cause of neonatal diabetes, a rare inherited disorder characterized by the development of diabetes within the first 6 months of life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In neonatal diabetes, failure of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel to close in response to metabolically generated ATP prevents &#x003b2;-cell electrical stimulation and insulin release, causing hypoinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Sulphonylurea drugs are used to treat patients with neonatal diabetes as they selectively block the open K<sub>ATP</sub> channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. This results in far better glycaemic control, with fewer fluctuations in plasma glucose concentration, a lower HbA1C, a reduced incidence of hypoglycaemia and a simpler medication regime<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>Recent studies demonstrate that chronic hyperglycaemia in mice expressing an activating K<sub>ATP</sub> channel mutation results in striking &#x003b2;-cell remodelling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. This is characterized by a marked loss of insulin granules, a reduction in islet number and dysregulation of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-cell identity genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>We now show that diabetes causes marked changes in &#x003b2;-cell carbohydrate metabolism and glucose-stimulated ATP production as soon as 24&#x02009;h after exposure to hyperglycaemia. Prolonged diabetes also resulted in substantial glycogen accumulation that led to increased &#x003b2;-cell apoptosis. Restoring euglycaemia induced autophagy, rapidly dissipated glycogen stores, normalized metabolism and reversed many of the gene expression changes. Analysis of mice expressing an activating mutation in glucokinase revealed that enhanced glucose metabolism, rather than glucose <italic>per se</italic>, was responsible for the changes in gene expression and glycogen storage. Glycogen accumulation was observed also in islets of patients with type-2-diabetes. The progressive impairment of &#x003b2;-cell function with chronic hyperglycaemia helps explain why sulfonylurea therapy is more effective in neonatal diabetes patients with shorter diabetes duration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and has implications not only for the aetiology and treatment of neonatal diabetes, but also for other forms of diabetes.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activation results in rapid diabetes</title><p>We investigated the time course of the &#x003b2;-cell changes induced by hyperglycaemia and its reversal <italic>in vivo</italic> in an inducible mouse model of neonatal diabetes (&#x003b2;V59M)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion was switched off in &#x003b2;V59M mice at 12&#x02013;14 weeks of age by &#x003b2;-cell-specific expression of an activating K<sub>ATP</sub> channel mutation (Kir6.2-V59M) commonly found in human neonatal diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. This resulted in blood glucose levels &#x0003e;28&#x02009;mM within 2 days. Euglycaemia could be restored by subcutaneous administration of the sulphonylurea glibenclamide, which closes the open K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, or by insulin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p><p>No differences in plasma lipid levels were found between control mice and diabetic &#x003b2;V59M mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig.1</xref>). Free fatty acids, total serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL/VHDL cholesterol were unchanged. Triglycerides were slightly but not significantly elevated. Aminoalanine transferase (ALT) activity, a marker of liver damage, was also unaffected. Thus the changes we observe are a result of hyperglycaemia/hypoinsulinaemia and not a secondary consequence of altered lipid metabolism.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Diabetes duration impacts &#x003b2;-cell function</title><p>Diabetes was associated with progressive changes in &#x003b2;-cell mass and ultrastructure. &#x003b2;-cell mass, assessed as the percentage of insulin staining per cm<sup>2</sup> of pancreas, was markedly lower in islets from 2- or 4-week diabetic &#x003b2;V59M mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Islet density also fell, reflecting a decrease in both islet number and size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The reduction in insulin-labelled cells was paralleled by an increase in glucagon-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). There was also a time-dependent decrease in insulin granule density, as shown by electron microscopy (EM), and a gradual development of large areas of unstructured cytoplasm in &#x003b2;-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>) that increased with the duration of diabetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Hyperglycaemia for 24&#x02009;h, however, had no effect on islet insulin labelling, granule number or islet ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>).</p><p>Blood glucose levels in diabetic &#x003b2;V59M mice were rapidly normalized with either insulin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> or sulphonylurea (glibenclamide) therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). However, the ability of sulphonylureas to restore euglycaemia was dependent on diabetes duration, as seen in human patients with neonatal diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Following 2 weeks of diabetes, glibenclamide normalized blood glucose within 24&#x02009;h in 88&#x00025; (7/8) of mice, but it was only successful in 47&#x00025; (7/15) of mice after 4 weeks of diabetes. Only mice in which euglycaemia was restored within 48&#x02009;h were used in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Islet insulin content was unaffected at 1 week of diabetes but decreased by 50&#x00025; after 2 weeks of diabetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>): in our earlier studies, it fell by 70&#x00025; after 4 weeks of diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Glibenclamide therapy both prevented, and reversed, changes in islet insulin content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p>Both glibenclamide and insulin treatment also reversed the ultrastructural and histochemical changes induced by diabetes but the time course was very different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,d</xref>). Remarkably, in mice exposed to 4 weeks of diabetes, &#x003b2;-cell ultrastructure was completely normalized within 24&#x02009;h of starting glibenclamide therapy. By contrast, substantial areas of electrolucent cytoplasm remained after 24&#x02009;h of euglycaemia in insulin-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>): however, these were largely absent after 1 week of euglycaemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Functional consequences of altered glucose handling in &#x003b2;-cells</title><p>We next explored the functional consequences of progressive diabetes on &#x003b2;-cell function by measuring glucose-stimulated changes in NAD(P)H autofluorescence and ATP content in freshly isolated islets from control and diabetic &#x003b2;V59M mice.</p><p>In control islets, increasing glucose caused a clear dose-dependent increase in both NAD(P)H autofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>) and ATP content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). By contrast, glucose elevation elicited much smaller increases in NAD(P)H fluorescence in islets from 24-h diabetic &#x003b2;V59M mice, and minimal change after 4 weeks of diabetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Similarly, glucose did not elicit an increase in ATP content in 4-week diabetic islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). There was no significant difference in ATP concentration at basal glucose (2&#x02009;mM) between control and diabetic islets.</p><p>Remarkably, these effects were rapidly reversed by <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture at low glucose. Culture of 4-week &#x003b2;V59M diabetic islets at 5&#x02009;mM glucose for 48&#x02009;h partially restored both the NAD(P)H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>) responses to 20&#x02009;mM glucose. Addition of the sulphonylurea gliclazide (which closes K<sub>ATP</sub> channels) produced an even greater effect. Culture of 4-week &#x003b2;V59M diabetic islets at 25&#x02009;mM glucose, however, did not restore the ATP response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>), indicating that reversal is a consequence of low glucose rather than <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture.</p><p>The changes in &#x003b2;-cell metabolism induced by diabetes were accompanied by striking changes in expression of metabolic genes. Microarray analysis of mRNA extracted from isolated islets demonstrated that expression of numerous genes was significantly altered in response to 2 weeks of hyperglycaemia. Over 780 genes were upregulated &#x0003e;1.5-fold, and &#x0003e;300 genes were downregulated: full details are given at (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/%20for%20experiment%20E-MTAB-5086">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/ for experiment E-MTAB-5086</ext-link>). Importantly, many genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were also strongly affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1a,b</xref>).</p><p>To validate these changes in key metabolic genes, we performed quantitative PCR using islets from control mice, &#x003b2;V59M mice exposed to diabetes for 24&#x02009;h or 4 weeks, and &#x003b2;V59M mice exposed to 4 weeks of diabetes followed by 4 weeks of glibenclamide therapy. We focused on genes involved in gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>), glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>), the Krebs cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>), and mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3i</xref>) that were substantially altered in the microarray data.</p><p>It is evident that some genes changed their expression within 24&#x02009;h of diabetes, whereas others did not. For example, <italic>G6pc2, Pfkfb2, Ogdh1</italic> and <italic>Cox6a2</italic> were significantly affected by 4 weeks of diabetes but were unchanged by 24&#x02009;h of hyperglycaemia. Conversely, <italic>Pdk1, Fbp1, Fbp2</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic> were fully upregulated within 24&#x02009;h: thus, these genes may be under different metabolic control than those that take longer to change. Some of these gene changes were reversed by 4 weeks of glibenclamide therapy (for example, <italic>G6pc2, Pfkfb2, Ogdh1, Cox6a2</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic>) but, interestingly, many others were not (for example, <italic>Pdk1, Fbp1, Fbp2</italic>).</p><p>Overall, the gene changes we observed are expected to reduce flux through the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, and increase gluconeogenesis. For example, downregulation of the glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (<italic>Pfkfb2</italic>) and upregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (<italic>Pdk1</italic>) would reduce entry of acetyl CoA into the Krebs cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f,g</xref>). In addition, downregulation of the Krebs cycle enzymes fumarase (<italic>Fh1</italic>) and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (<italic>Ogdh1</italic>) would decrease entry of reducing equivalents (NADH) into the electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>). This, together with the reduced expression of cytochrome c oxidase (<italic>Cox6a2</italic>) mRNA, the last enzyme in the electron transport chain, explains why glucose fails to stimulate NAD(P)H and ATP production in diabetic &#x003b2;V59M islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3i</xref>). However, ATP synthase (<italic>ATP6</italic>) did not change.</p><p>Upregulation of the gluconeogenic genes <italic>Fbp1</italic> and <italic>Fbp2</italic> (which catalyse hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate) and downregulation of <italic>G6pc2</italic> (which catalyses the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>), implies that glucose entering the &#x003b2;-cell will accumulate as glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). In turn, this will lead to glycogen storage, as G6P is a potent allosteric stimulator of glycogen synthase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and glucose is an inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase. Most enzymes directly involved in glycogen synthesis did not change their expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3j</xref>), but <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic> (PTG), which activates glycogen synthase, was strongly upregulated after 24&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3k</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Glycogen accumulation in diabetic &#x003b2;-cells</title><p>Collectively, these gene changes, together with the enhanced substrate availability and the impaired ATP production, suggest that glucose entering diabetic &#x003b2;V59M &#x003b2;-cells will be stored as glycogen. This was investigated by both light microscopy (using Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining) and electron microscopy.</p><p>No PAS staining was detected in control &#x003b2;-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) or &#x003b2;-cells exposed to hyperglycaemia for 24&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). However, considerable glycogen staining was evident in &#x003b2;-cells exposed to high glucose for &#x0003e;2 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). After 4 weeks of diabetes, many &#x003b2;-cells appeared &#x02018;clear' or &#x02018;empty' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>), due to loss of glycogen during processing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Such loss becomes more evident when glycogen deposits are very substantial and leads to an apparent decrease in glycogen staining and the appearance of an &#x02018;empty' cytoplasm. Strikingly, no glycogen was detected in 4-week diabetic &#x003b2;V59M &#x003b2;-cells after 24&#x02009;h of glibenclamide therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). By contrast, substantial glycogen staining remained in insulin-treated mice after 24&#x02009;h of euglycaemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>), and this was not fully abolished even after 1 week of euglycaemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>).</p><p>Ultrastructural studies using lead-citrate fixation to preserve glycogen revealed extensive deposits of glycogen particles in most &#x003b2;-cells of &#x003b2;V59M islets after 4 weeks of hyperglycaemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h,i</xref>). Indeed, in some &#x003b2;-cells the glycogen content was so excessive that it constituted the majority of the cytoplasm and caused distortion of the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum. However, no glycogen was found in control islets. It is important to note that glycogen is not detected using conventional EM fixatives, as it is water soluble and easily washed out of cells during fixation. This leaves large regions of electrolucent &#x02018;unstructured' cytoplasm, like those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4j</xref> (and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2d</xref>, which correspond to the &#x02018;empty' cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Metabolic dysfunction disrupts protein turnover</title><p>Glycogen exists as a large macromolecular complex with numerous associated proteins, and its accumulation in other tissues is controlled by autophagy as well as metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.

Marked &#x003b2;-cell apoptosis is also observed in mutGCK mice following prolonged activation of the transgene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. We therefore explored whether altered metabolism and glycogen accumulation contribute to &#x003b2;-cell death in diabetes.</p><p>In a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, we found no obvious increase in the number of apoptotic nuclei after 4 weeks of diabetes when assessed by nuclear morphology (chromatin condensation) with electron microscopy. However, this approach may underestimate the extent of apoptosis as few cells can be examined, apoptosis and cell debris removal are quickly complete, and earlier time points were not assessed. Thus, we examined earlier steps in the &#x003b2;-cell death pathway, which are more readily detectable. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7a,b</xref> shows that cleaved caspase-3 was not present in control islets but significant labelling was detected in &#x003b2;V59M islets after 2 weeks of hyperglycaemia, by which time glycogen accumulation was extensive. Furthermore, active caspase-3 was found with glycogen in insulin-positive cells (arrow), but was absent in glycogen-negative cells (arrowhead) and in glucagon-positive &#x003b1;-cells (which did not accumulate glycogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>). Apoptotic bodies (&#x02018;cellular blebbing'), a hallmark of apoptosis were also seen in electron micrographs of &#x003b2;-cells of 4-week diabetic &#x003b2;V59M islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e,f</xref>). Interestingly, these apoptotic bodies were filled with glycogen granules when measures were taken to preserve glycogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f</xref>).</p><p>To further examine the relationship between glycogen accumulation and &#x003b2;-cell death, we manipulated glycogen levels independently of the ambient glucose level. First, we used the antidiabetic drug metformin, which inhibits glycogen synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, to reduce glycogen levels at high external glucose concentrations. In the presence of 25&#x02009;mM glucose, metformin prevented glycogen accumulation in INS-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7g,h</xref>) and reduced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7i</xref>). Furthermore, expression of <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic> (PTG) was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7j</xref>). This protein targets protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) to glycogen and its expression is closely linked to glycogen content<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In cells in which glycogen had already accumulated, subsequent addition of metformin did not affect glycogen or cleaved caspase-3 levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). This suggests metformin, at least at the concentration we used, does not itself reduce caspase-3 activation.</p><p>Secondly, we further enhanced glycogen levels at high glucose concentrations by silencing UDP-glucose-pyrophosphorylase-2 (UGP2) in INS-1 cells. A significant decrease in both UGP2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7k</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7l</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7A</xref>) was observed following 72&#x02009;h of knockdown. We had expected this to lower glycogen levels, because UGP2 catalyses the addition of UDP to glucose-1-phosphate to promote glycogen formation. Unexpectedly, however, it led to a paradoxical rise in glycogen at high glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7m,n</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). We attribute this to the fact that <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic> expression was enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7o</xref>). Importantly, the elevated glycogen was accompanied by increased caspase-3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7p</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7B</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these studies demonstrate that caspase activation correlates with glycogen content, suggesting that excessive glycogen accumulation may mediate, at least in part, enhanced &#x003b2;-cell death in response to chronic hyperglycaemia.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data show that hyperglycaemia results in a progressive impairment of &#x003b2;-cell carbohydrate metabolism and metabolic gene expression that begins within 24&#x02009;h of exposure to high blood glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). As diabetes duration increases, insulin granule density decreases and glycogen accumulates to such an extent that it causes gross distortion of &#x003b2;-cell ultrastructure. Changes in gene expression, metabolic pathways and impaired autophagy may contribute to glycogen accumulation. Studies of mutGCK mice further indicate that increased glucose metabolism, rather than glucose <italic>per se</italic>, drives glycogen synthesis and many of the changes in metabolic gene expression. Impaired autophagy and increased cleaved caspase-3 suggest apoptotic pathways are also stimulated. Similar changes to those seen in islets of &#x003b2;V59M mice <italic>in vivo</italic> were also observed in control mouse islets, in islets from non-diabetic human donors and in INS-1 cells exposed to hyperglycaemia <italic>in vitro.</italic></p><p>Restoration of euglycaemia by glibenclamide rapidly restored normal glucose metabolism, dissipated glycogen stores, stimulated autophagy and inhibited apoptosis. This was more easily achieved after short-term hyperglycaemia. The progressive decline in &#x003b2;-cell structure, function and insulin content caused by chronic hyperglycaemia likely account for the reduced ability of &#x003b2;V59M mice with a longer duration of diabetes, and of older patients with neonatal diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, to respond to sulphonylurea therapy.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, hyperglycaemia is linked with hypoinsulinaemia, making it difficult to distinguish which is causative with certainty. However, because the insulin concentration of the culture medium was constant in our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of islets and INS-1 cells, the changes we observed must be a function of hyperglycaemia. This is supported by experiments using partially pancreatectomized rats where expression of many genes important for glucose-stimulated insulin release, and a range of &#x003b2;-cell specific transcription factors, was altered by hyperglycaemia and restored by correction of blood glucose alone with phloridzin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>Analysis of a mouse model with an activating glucokinase mutation targeted to the &#x003b2;-cell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> revealed that enhanced glucose metabolism, rather than glucose <italic>per se</italic>, drives glycogen formation. This is evident because mutGCK animals were normoglycaemic at the age at which we studied them. In &#x003b2;-cells exposed to high glucose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) increases rapidly because intracellular glucose tracks the extracellular concentration and glucokinase is a high capacity, high K<sub>m</sub> enzyme. Despite their normal blood glucose levels, G6P is also expected to be elevated in mutGCK mouse &#x003b2;-cells, due to the enhanced glucokinase activity. Glucose-6-phosphate is a potent allosteric activator of glycogen synthase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and both glucose and G6P inhibit glycogen phosphorylase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. These allosteric effects on enzyme activity potentiate glycogen accumulation, ensuring that it is rapidly initiated when glucose increases and quickly reversed when glucose levels fall.</p><p>Glycogen stores are only evident when measures are taken to preserve glycogen during fixation and processing; if this is not done, glycogen loss leads to areas of unstructured cytoplasm that have been variously described as &#x02018;clear', &#x02018;empty' or &#x02018;vacuolated' at the light microscope level. Such &#x02018;empty &#x003b2;-cells' have been reported previously in patients with severe uncompensated diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and in numerous more recent studies of pancreatic islets from diabetic mouse models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. These studies used fixation methods that were not designed to preserve glycogen, suggesting that the &#x02018;empty' cells observed may not, in fact, have been empty but contained glycogen that was lost during processing. This would also argue that altered metabolism and glycogen accumulation is a feature of all diabetic &#x003b2;-cells.</p><p>Small amounts of glycogen can be beneficial to a cell, by providing an energy store at times when the substrate supply falls. However, excessive glycogen may be deleterious: in other cell types it is associated with cell death. For example, glycogen accumulation in human diabetic nephropathy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> is accompanied by enhanced apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, and in neurones, glycogen accumulation triggers a decrease in autophagy that leads to cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. The marked increase in cleaved caspase-3 in glycogen-positive &#x003b2;-cells, and the gross distortion of &#x003b2;-cell ultrastructure we observed suggests excessive glycogen deposition may also be deleterious in &#x003b2;-cells.</p><p>In support of this idea, we found a strong positive correlation between the extent of cleaved caspase-3, the density of &#x003b2;-cell glycogen granules and the level of PTG (<italic>Ppp1r3c</italic>) expression that was independent of extracellular glucose. When the glucose concentration was held constant at 25&#x02009;mM, metformin reduced both PTG levels and glycogen accumulation, and led to a decrease in cleaved caspase-3. Conversely knockdown of UGP2 increased PTG and glycogen at 25&#x02009;mM glucose further, while simultaneously elevating cleaved-caspase-3. This suggests that increased &#x003b2;-cell glycogen may lead to caspase-3 activation and subsequent &#x003b2;-cell apoptosis. Indeed, we observed a striking accumulation of glycogen in apoptotic bodies in &#x003b2;V59M islets. It is likely that the deleterious effect of glycogen on the &#x003b2;-cell varies with the extent of its accumulation, and thus with the duration and degree of diabetes; and that there is a threshold below which glycogen has no adverse action.</p><p>Currently it is widely assumed that &#x003b2;-cells do not store or metabolise glycogen. Indeed, a role for glycogen in normal &#x003b2;-cell function has recently been excluded by examining the effects of overexpression of PTG and knockdown of glycogen synthase I in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. However, this does not exclude a role for glycogen accumulation in diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Indeed, our data provide evidence that in combination with metabolic dysfunction and changes in autophagy, glycogen accumulation in severe uncompensated diabetes may promote &#x003b2;-cell loss via increased caspase-dependent apoptosis, and thereby enhance the hyperglycaemia. The presence of glycogen in islets from type-2 diabetic patients, further suggests that glycogen accumulation may contribute to &#x003b2;-cell failure in diabetes.</p><p>Glycogen accumulation implies a change in glucose handling by the &#x003b2;-cell. Our data demonstrate that chronic hyperglycaemia produces a dramatic change in &#x003b2;-cell metabolism, such that after 4 weeks of diabetes glucose fails to elevate NAD(P)H or ATP in &#x003b2;V59M islets. Failure of glucose to elevate NAD(P)H in diabetic mice carrying an activating Kir6.2 mutation has also been reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. As NAD(P)H signals are principally mitochondrial in origin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, our data indicate that hyperglycaemia impairs oxidative metabolism, which accounts for the reduction in glucose-stimulated ATP production and the diversion of glucose into glycogen. At least some of the marked changes we observed in the expression of key metabolic genes may underlie the altered ATP and NAD(P)H responses to glucose.</p><p>It is remarkable that, <italic>in vivo,</italic> all glycogen disappears from the &#x003b2;-cell within 24&#x02009;h of normoglycaemia produced by sulphonylurea therapy, indicating glycogen breakdown is enhanced and/or glycogen synthesis is reduced. Both <italic>G6pc2</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic> are among the genes whose expression levels are rapidly restored by normoglycaemia. In combination with the reduced substrate concentration and restoration of normal metabolism (see below), these changes in gene expression are expected to lead to reduced glycogen synthesis when euglycaemia is restored. Our data also provide evidence that glycogen is broken down via autophagy when blood glucose is normalized. This has been demonstrated previously in other tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, but not in &#x003b2;-cells.</p><p>Insulin was also able to reverse the diabetes-induced changes in islet insulin content and glycogen, but took longer to do so. This likely reflects the ability of sulphonylureas to promote membrane depolarization and calcium entry, which in turn facilitates activation of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent metabolic enzymes such as mitochondrial dehydrogenases and glycogen phosphorylase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>.</p><p>Importantly, the glucose-stimulated increases in NAD(P)H and ATP in &#x003b2;V59M islets, like the glycogen accumulation, were restored within 48&#x02009;h of normoglycaemia. Yet despite the rapid restoration of oxidative metabolism, the expression levels of some metabolic genes were not normalized, even after 4 weeks of euglycaemia. Changes in expression of these specific genes therefore may not be the only factor regulating glucose-stimulated ATP production. The data also raise the possibility that hyperglycaemia induces a form of metabolic reprogramming, in which some gene expression changes are either not reversed, or require lower glucose concentrations or longer time periods, to do so.</p><p>It is noteworthy that all the hyperglycaemia-induced changes in gene expression in INS-1 cells were fully reversed on return to low glucose, whereas this was not the case for those caused by 4-weeks of diabetes <italic>in vivo</italic>. This may reflect the longer duration of diabetes <italic>in vivo</italic>, or the fact that the return glucose concentration was lower and more stable in the INS-1 cell experiments. The differences observed in cultured cells emphasize the importance of <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. Chronic hyperglycaemia cannot be mimicked <italic>in vitro</italic> as INS-1 cells die when exposed to &#x0003e;25&#x02009;mM glucose for more than a few days. Similarly, cultured islets may become ischaemic in the islet core, due to the lack of vascular perfusion. Thus in both cases long-term changes in &#x003b2;-cell structure and function due to diabetes cannot be faithfully recapitulated <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Many of the changes seen in &#x003b2;V59M mice are also found in islets isolated from patients with type-2 diabetes (T2DM). Similar alterations in insulin content/staining<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> and expression of key metabolic genes (for example, fructose bisphosphatase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>) have been reported. The marked decrease in glucose-stimulated ATP production we observe in &#x003b2;V59M islets is also seen in T2DM islets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>, and would be expected to impair insulin secretion. Although this cannot be demonstrated in &#x003b2;V59M islets (because K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activation prevents ATP-induced membrane depolarization) it likely contributes to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin release in T2DM. We also found significant glycogen stores in patients with T2DM who had documented poor glycaemic control. Early studies of islets isolated from patients with uncompensated diabetes (who died of diabetic coma) support this finding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. These data provide evidence that type 2 diabetes is associated with impaired &#x003b2;-cell metabolism that, at least in part, derives from the elevated blood glucose. Our results also reveal that, in mice, metformin has a protective effect on both glycogen accumulation and &#x003b2;-cell death induced by high glucose. It is possible that this may contribute to the efficacy of this drug in treating type-2 diabetes.</p><p>In conclusion, hyperglycaemia in &#x003b2;V59M mice induces profound metabolic dysfunction in &#x003b2;-cells. This is evidenced by progressive changes in metabolic gene expression profiles, decreased oxidative metabolism, impaired glucose-stimulated ATP production and glycogen accumulation. Prolonged exposure to hyperglycaemia also leads to loss of &#x003b2;-cells via caspase-dependent apoptosis. Studies on mice with an activating GCK mutation suggest that increased glucose metabolism drives most of these changes. Glycogen deposits were also found in the &#x003b2;-cells of patients with poorly controlled type-2 diabetes, and may contribute to impaired &#x003b2;-cell function in type-2 diabetes. Provided diabetes duration was short, restoration of euglycaemia dissipated glycogen stores and restored &#x003b2;-cell metabolism. However, many of the diabetes-induced changes in gene expression were not reversed. It is possible this will make the &#x003b2;-cell more susceptible to a subsequent metabolic insult. It was also more difficult to reverse diabetes of longer duration. Thus our data highlight the importance of good glycaemic control not only in patients with neonatal diabetes, but also those with type-2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animal care</title><p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with the UK Animals Scientific Procedures Act (1986) and University of Oxford ethical guidelines.
