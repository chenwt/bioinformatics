We have previously found that amplification of chromosome 6p22 is significantly associated with the muscle-invasive rather than superficial TCC-UB. Here, we demonstrated that Sox4, one of the candidate oncogenes located within the chromosome 6p22 amplicon, confers bladder cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. Down-regulation of Sox4 led to the inhibition of cell migration, colony formation as well as mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Interestingly, knockdown of Sox4 also reduced the sphere formation, enriched cell population with high levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH <sup>high</sup>) and tumor formation potential. Using gene expression profiling, we further identified novel Sox4 target genes. Last, immunohistochemistry analysis of human bladder tumor tissue microarrays (TMAs) indicated that high Sox4 expression was correlated with advanced cancer stages and poor survival rate. In summary, our data show that Sox4 is an important regulator of the bladder CSC properties and it may serve as a biomarker of the aggressive phenotype in bladder cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bladder cancer</kwd><kwd>chromosome 6p22 amplification</kwd><kwd>Sox4</kwd><kwd>bladder cancer stem cell</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bladder cancer is the fifth most common malignancies worldwide <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Many genetic and epigenetic alterations have been identified as to contribute directly or indirectly to the generation of transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder (TCC-UB) <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. In general, bladder cancer can be divided into two classes, majority of them (~80%) are non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer representing low-grade bladder cancer, as well as the muscle-invasive bladder cancer (~20%) that is of high-grade and has less favorable prognosis <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Genetic alterations occurring in low-grade superficial TCC-UB are most frequently caused by activating mutations of proto-oncogenes, of which fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and HRAS are most prevalent, with mutations in up to 75% and 30% of the papillary tumors, respectively <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Since both these oncogenes activate the RAS/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, they appear to be mutually exclusive <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. In contrast, the majority of muscle-invasive TCC-UB arises through inactivation of the tumor suppressor pathways of TP53, RB1 or PTEN <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. These mutations result in genomic instability and an anti-apoptotic phenotype, which enables tumor progression through accumulation of mutations. We and others found that amplification of chromosome 6p22 was significantly associated with muscle-invasive TCC-UB in contrast to superficial TCC-UB <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In addition, the rate of 6p22.3 amplification in pN&#x0003e;1 patients (37%) was more than twice that of pN1 (17%) patients, indicating that there are potential oncogenes residing in this region that may contribute to muscle-invasive bladder cancer progression and invasion <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p>One of the candidate oncogenes at the chromosome 6p22 locus is Sox4. Sox4 is a member of the Sox (SRY-related HMG-box) family of transcription factors with a critical role in the embryonic development and in cell-fate determination during organogenesis of the heart, pancreas, central nerve system and T lymphocyte differentiation <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Elevated Sox4 expression has been documented in all major human cancers, including breast, lung, brain, prostate, colorectal, bladder, pancreatic, ovarian cancer and leukemia <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Through the oncogenic-retrovirus-induced insertional mutagenesis analysis, Sox4 locus has been identified as one of the common integration sites, providing the first evidence that Sox4 may act as an oncogene <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Sox4 has been reported to function as an oncogene in more advanced stages of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) by promoting intrahepatic metastasis <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. In breast cancer, sox4 induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cooperated with the RAS oncogene in cancer progression <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. More recently, it has been reported that sox4 acts as a master regulator of EMT by controlling the epigenetic program <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Last, using a conditional knockout of Sox4 in stratified epithelia, Foronda et al. demonstrated that loss of functional Sox4 increased the skin stem cell quiescence and resistance to chemical carcinogenesis <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>.</p><p>The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis is based on the observation that many cancers, including bladder cancer, are driven by a subpopulation of tumor-initiating cells (popularly known as CSCs) and promote tumor growth <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. In addition, CSCs are resistant to chemotherapy and radiation treatments, which potentially explains the limitations of these agents in curing human malignancies <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. The normal human urothelium comprises a layer of basal cells that are in contact with the basement membrane, several layers of intermediate cells and a single layer of large, superficial 'umbrella' cells with a specialized apical membrane to accommodate bladder expansion and contraction <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. The basal cells residing at the tumor-stroma interface have been indicated possessing tumor-initiating ability and may represent the origin cells of bladder cancer <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. Recent study suggests that such cancer stem cells may contribute to therapeutic resistance by repopulating residual tumors between chemotherapy cycles <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>.</p><p>Here we demonstrated that Sox4, one of the candidate oncogenes located in the chromosome 6p22 amplicon, confers bladder cancer stem cell (CSC) properties.

The care and use of animals was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute (Buffalo, NY).</p></sec><sec><title>RNAseq analyses</title><p>The sequencing libraries are prepared with the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit (Illumina Inc), from 1ug total RNA. Following manufacturer's instructions, the first step depletes rRNA from total RNA. After ribosomal depletion, the remaining RNA is purified, fragmented and primed for cDNA synthesis. Fragmented RNA is then reverse transcribed into first strand cDNA using random primers. The next step removes the RNA template and synthesizes a replacement strand, incorporating dUTP in place of dTTP to generate ds cDNA. AMPure XP beads are used to separate the ds cDNA from the second strand reaction mix resulting in blunt-ended cDNA. A single 'A' nucleotide is then added to the 3' ends of the blunt fragments. Multiple indexing adapters, containing a single 'T' nucleotide on the 3' end of the adapter, are ligated to the ends of the ds cDNA, preparing them for hybridization onto a flow cell. Libraries are purified and validated for appropriate size on a 2100 Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). The DNA library is quantitated using KAPA Biosystems qPCR kit, and then normalized to 2nM prior to pooling. Libraries are pooled together in an equimolar fashion, following experimental design criteria. Each pool is denatured, diluted to 10pM, and clustered to individual lanes of a HiSeq Flow Cell using an Illumina cBot and the corresponding single-read or paired-end read TruSeq cluster kit. Pooled, clustered samples are then run on a HiSeq2500 sequencer according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Illumina Inc.).</p><p>Raw reads passed quality filter from Illumina RTA have been first pre-processed by using FASTQC for sequencing base quality control. Then the reads were mapped to the human (hg19) and ENSEMBLE annotation database using STAR <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. Second-round QC using RSeQC was applied to mapped bam files to identify potential RNAseq library preparation problems. From the mapping results, reads that matched a single unique location in the genome were kept, allowing up to two mismatches for further analysis. The number of reads aligning to each gene was calculated using HTSeq <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. Differentially expressed genes were identified using DESeq2, a variance-analysis package developed to infer the statically significant difference in RNAseq data. In addition, biological hypothesis was tested using generalized linear model implemented in DESeq2 by construct corresponding contrasts. List of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was analyzed for enriched Gene Ontology and/or KEGG pathway term with the GAGE Bioconductor package <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>.

Selection of patients included all in this time period with adequate material in the RPCI archival bank, i.e., adequate material for tissue microarray (TMA) construction and follow-up in the RPCI Tumor Registry. The RPCI Institutional Review Board gave approval for this study. The median patient age at first diagnosis was 69 years (average 68; range 36-91) with 242 males and 67 females. The majority (255 of 309; 82%) were either a current smoker at the time of diagnosis or reported a history of smoking. To more specifically describe this cohort of 309 patients, they were then divided into two general cohorts as either superficial TCC-UB (pTa, Tis, T1) or muscle-invasive TCC-UB (&#x0003e;pT2).</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue microarrays</title><p>Three 1-mm tissue cores from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded donor blocks were precisely arrayed into a new recipient paraffin block, including tumor specimens as well as controls.

Of note, Sox4 expression was not detectable in the immortalized non-tumorigenic urothelial epithelial SV-HUC and UROTSA cells, whereas it was highly expressed in the majority of muscle-invasive bladder cancer cells, especially in the 6p22-amplicon containing 5637 and TCCSUP cells. To further investigate the role of Sox4 in cell proliferation, we designed lentiviral shRNA constructs that specifically targeted Sox4 and transduced them into the RT-112 bladder cancer cells. The knockdown efficiency was confirmed by immunoblotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). Knockdown of Sox4 has no effects on cell proliferation in 2D culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). To our great interest, knockdown of Sox4 significantly reduced the cell migration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D). In addition, ablation of Sox4 dramatically reduced the potential for clonogenicity as well as the colony formation in soft agar (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E, F). Together, these results strongly suggested that Sox4 may play an important role in the bladder cancer cell migration and transformation.</p></sec><sec><title>Depletion of Sox4 induces mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)</title><p>Sox4 has been indicated as a regulator of the TGF-&#x003b2;-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>.

As expected, knockdown of Sox4 induced morphological changes of cells from the scattered to the epithelial-like phenotype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). Meanwhile, down-regulation of Sox4 increased the level of epithelial marker CDH-1 and reduced the mesenchymal markers CDH-2 and vimentin as revealed by immunoblotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). Immunofluorescence staining further showed that Sox4 depletion preserved the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin on the cell membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D). Interestingly, we found knockdown of Sox4 induced dramatically repression of EMT inducer ZEB2 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E). All these results demonstrated that loss-of-function of Sox4 was capable of reversing bladder cancer cells from the malignant-associated mesenchymal back to more differentiated epithelial-like phenotype and it may through down-regulation of ZEB2.</p></sec><sec><title>Sox4 is required for bladder sphere and tumor formation</title><p>Accumulating evidence points to the existence and contribution of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and/or cancer stem cells (CSCs) in tumor progression and relapse <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>.

For example, Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 A1 (ALDH1A1) has been demonstrated as a marker for cancer stem or stem-like cells in human malignancy including bladder cancer <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>. Also, sphere culture is being used increasingly as a method to enrich stem cells based on their property of anchorage-independent growth <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. It is generally agreed that the tumor-sphere-forming cells have higher capacity of proliferation, self-renewal and tumorigenicity. Therefore, to test whether ablation of Sox4 would alter the bladder cancer stem properties, we first examined the ALDH1A1-positive population at different Sox4 status in the RT-112 bladder cells by FACS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). It was found that knockdown of Sox4 significantly decreased the ALDH1A1-positive cell population (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). To further test whether Sox4 contributes to the self-renewal properties, we next performed the bladder sphere formation. Of great interest, knockdown of Sox4 also dramatically reduced the sphere formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C). Taken together, our <italic>in vitro</italic> data so far indicated that Sox4 may contribute to the bladder cancer stem cell traits.</p><p>To test the functional contribution of Sox4 to primary tumor formation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we subcutaneously transplanted the sh-Control or sh-Sox4 transduced RT-112 cells into the SCID mice and followed up the tumor growth. As expected, knockdown of Sox4 in RT-112 cells resulted in significantly reduced primary tumor size (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A, B) and weight (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C). Immunoblotting analysis further documented an efficient depletion of Sox4 expression in these harvested primary tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D). Last, to further characterize the tumor initiation properties of Sox4, we performed limited dilution analysis and found that the tumorigenicity potential was significantly reduced in the Sox4-knockdown cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Together, these results showed that Sox4 confers bladder cancer stem cell traits and plays an important role in the bladder tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of Sox4 target genes</title><p>Next, to extensively examine the Sox4-mediated pro-tumorigenic transcriptional program, we performed RNA-seq differential gene and transcript analysis on the siControl or siSox4 transduced RT-112 cells after 48 hours. Genes found to be differentially expressed according to the Sox4 status were further analyzed for Sox4-binding motifs within one-kilobase of their transcription start site and altogether 1117 genes were identified in siSox4 cells (fold change log2&#x0003e;1.5; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of differentially regulated transcripts in the siSox4 gene cluster/signature revealed an overrepresentation of up-regulated genes associated with focal adhesion and down-regulated genes associated with cell cycle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). Furthermore, using DAVID (database for annotation, visualization and discovery), we wanted to assess whether any GO biological or molecular processes were statistically over- or under-represented. Indeed, some over-represented pathways (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) were identified, including those involved in cytoskeleton organization, growth factor binding, cell junction, chromatin remodeling, DNA replication and cell cycle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B; Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>).</p><p>Among these candidate genes, we further validated by qRT-PCR cell cycle regulated genes, such as CCND1, CDK1, FGFR1, FGFR3, MYB and MYC, as specifically down-regulated in response to siSox4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C). In addition, we found that tight junction proteins, e.g., CRB3, TJP1, TJP3, were specifically up-regulated in response to knock down of Sox4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D). Our gene expression profiling data demonstrated that Sox4 is not only involved in the classic cell cycle regulation, but also in other signaling pathways and cellular processes that regulate cell migration and invasion.</p></sec><sec><title>High Sox4 expression is present in the muscle-invasive bladder cancer patient samples and correlated with poor survival</title><p>To understand the clinical relevance of Sox4 expression in bladder cancer patients, we carried out the immunohistochemistry staining analysis using bladder cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A). In our cohort of TCC-UB, the Sox4 expression was detected in both non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive tumors, but with a strikingly higher rate in the muscle-invasive samples (p=7.00E-04) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Comparison of Sox4-positivity in females (34%; 23/67) versus males (37%; 89/242) (t-test p=0.77), age &#x0003c;60 (35%; 23/64) versus age &#x02265;60 (36%; 9/245) (p=1) and smokers (37%; 96/255) versus non-smokers (31%; 16/52) (p=0.43) revealed no significant difference. Intensive examination of Sox4 within the standard pathological settings such as tumor grade, depth of invasion (pT) and nodal metastasis (pN) proposed for its association with a more aggressive phenotype. For example, in regard to tumor invasion, significantly different Sox4 positivity was observed between superficial (23%; 20/87) and muscle-invasive TCC-UB (46%; 65/142) (p=7.00E-04). Similarly, a strong association between Sox4 and more advanced tumor stage was also noted, as only 5% (3/59) of low-stage TCC-UB expressed Sox4 in contrast to 46% (109/203) (<italic>p</italic>=3.71E-10) of high-stage TCC-UB. Such significance of Sox4 as a marker for aggressiveness was accentuated in the evaluation of nodal metastatic disease for the rate of Sox4 expression in pN&#x0003e;1 (61%; 20/33) was significantly higher than that in pN0 patients (34%; 55/160) (<italic>p</italic>=0.0061). Of particular note, there was a remarkable association between Sox4 and poor survival (<italic>p</italic>=3.76E-07) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). Together, our IHC analysis of bladder cancer TMAs revealed that high Sox4 expression was significantly associated with higher tumor grade, invasiveness and unfavorable patient outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we found that the transcription factor Sox4 is upregulated in muscle-invasive bladder cancer cells. Up-regulation of Sox4 is partially through the gain of DNA copy numbers. On the other hand, knockdown of Sox4 inhibited cell migration and colony formation of bladder cancer cells and reversed the tumor cells from a mesenchymal state to epithelial-like state. Of note, loss-of-function of Sox4 reduced the ALDH<sup>high</sup> population and sphere formation, which manifest cancer stem cell (CSC) properties, as well as decreased dramatically the potential for primary tumor formation. Furthermore, our RNAseq gene expression profiling identified Sox4-regulated pathways involved in cytoskeleton regulation, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle regulation and so on. Last, we found that high level of Sox4 expression was frequently observed in the muscle-invasive subset and had a significant correlation with more advanced tumor stage, lymph-node metastasis and poor survival. As a potential biomarker for TCC-UB, examination of Sox4 level can greatly add to the risk assessment of advanced pT or pN stage in the pre-cystectomy biopsy setting as typical surgical pathology can only provide information about the presence or absence of muscle invasion.</p><p>The SOX family members are critical in many developmental processes involving both the maintenance of stem cells and control of the terminal differentiation of a wide variety of cell types <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. Sox4 was reported to play an important role in the cardiac outflow tract development and differentiation of pro-B and T cells <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Of interest, elevated expression of Sox4 has been reported in various solid tumors <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, yet disparate observation that Sox4 overexpression in the bladder HU609 cell line decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis also exists <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. Here we demonstrated that ablation of Sox4 inhibited colony formation and reduced the bladder CSC potential as well as tumor formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Such discrepancy may result from the different genetic background of cell lines. Consistently with our observation, it has been reported that Sox4 potentiated RAS-induced breast tumorigenesis <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and reduction of whole-body Sox4 expression in a transgenic mouse model displayed lower cancer incidence <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Taken together, these studies indicate that Sox4 may cooperate with other genes to promote solid tumorigenesis and metastasis.</p><p>As a transcription factor, Sox4 most likely functions in malignant processes through its direct regulation of target genes. As revealed by our gene expression profiling analysis, Sox4 regulates a wide range of cell cycle related genes, such as CCND1, CDK1, FGFR1, FGFR3, MYB and MYC, which is consistent with other study results on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, prostate cancer <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, lung cancer <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> and endometrial cancer <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. In addition, we also identified decreased Ezh2 level in response to knockdown of Sox4 (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>); and Ezh2 expression has been reported in a recent study to be directly regulated by Sox4 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Of particular note, our data also showed possibility of Sox4 as a transcriptional repressor, as we found that knockdown of Sox4 activated some cell junction proteins, including CRB3, TJP1 and TJP3. Further characterization of these Sox4 target genes is in order and may contribute greatly to a better understanding of the CSC regulation, tumorigenesis and metastasis.</p><p>In summary, we provided here evidence that Sox4 in 6p22-amplified bladder tumors is a potential oncogene of importance. Specifically, the correlation between Sox4 expression and poor patient survival strongly suggest for its role as a prognostic biomarker for bladder cancer patients. Future directions may include investigation of the interaction between Sox4 and other genes in the 6p22 amplicon, e.g., E2F3. Meanwhile, other oncogenes, such as CCND1 and MYC, that are not in the 6p22 amplicon but frequently altered in bladder cancer may also interact with Sox4 cooperatively or synergistically in cancer development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><caption><p>Supplemental Figure 1.
