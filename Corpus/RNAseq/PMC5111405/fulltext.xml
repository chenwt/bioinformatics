A previous mutant screen demonstrated that the heme uptake system (Chu) is required for full colonization of the chicken gastrointestinal tract.

Here we confirm that both the heme uptake system and HeuR are required for full chicken gastrointestinal tract colonization, with the <italic>heuR</italic> mutant being particularly affected during competition with wild-type <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic>. Transcriptomic analysis identified the <italic>chu</italic> genes&#x02014;and those encoding other iron uptake systems&#x02014;as regulatory targets of HeuR. Purified HeuR bound the <italic>chuZA</italic> promoter region in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Consistent with a role for HeuR in <italic>chu</italic> expression, <italic>heuR</italic> mutants were unable to efficiently use heme as a source of iron under iron-limiting conditions, and mutants exhibited decreased levels of cell-associated iron by mass spectrometry. Finally, we demonstrate that an <italic>heuR</italic> mutant of <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> is resistant to hydrogen peroxide and that this resistance correlates to elevated levels of catalase activity.

The prevalence of <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> infection is due to its ability to reside asymptomatically within the gastrointestinal tract of avians, especially chickens. During processing of poultry, <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> is released from the gastrointestinal tract, contaminating meat products as a result. Patients with <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> infection typically develop mild to severe, bloody diarrhea that may be accompanied by fever. Additionally, several postinfectious disorders have been associated with <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> infection, including Guillain-Barre Syndrome, postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome, and reactive arthritis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Further highlighting these concerns is increasing resistance of <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> to the clinically relevant antibiotics azithromycin and ciprofloxacin, prompting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to list antibiotic-resistant <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> as a &#x0201c;serious threat&#x0201d; to public health (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Due to the importance of chickens in human <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> infection, much emphasis has been placed on identifying and characterizing factors that are required for colonization of the chicken gastrointestinal tract. Previously, our group has used both signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) and insertion sequencing (transposon sequencing [Tn-Seq]) approaches to identify colonization determinants of <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The earlier STM approach identified genes involved in chemotaxis and flagellar biogenesis, but several other colonization factors were identified using the Tn-Seq approach. One determinant identified to be reduced by 250-fold in cecal outputs by Tn-Seq was a component of the heme utilization gene cluster <italic>chuB</italic> (Cjj81176_1602), indicating that acquiring iron from heme may be important during colonization of the chicken gastrointestinal tract (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Due to the prominent redox potential of Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup>, most organisms require iron as a redox cofactor for enzyme complexes. Since the host often restricts iron availability to limit microbial growth&#x02014;a process termed nutritional immunity&#x02014;many bacterial species have developed methods for obtaining iron from host molecules, including heme (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The heme utilization gene cluster of <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> consists of genes encoding a predicted TonB-dependent heme receptor (<italic>chuA</italic>), a hemin ABC transporter permease (<italic>chuB</italic>), a hemin ABC transporter ATP-binding protein (<italic>chuC</italic>), and a periplasmic hemin-binding protein (<italic>chuD</italic>) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Divergently transcribed from the transport genes is a previously characterized heme oxygenase, <italic>chuZ</italic>, which directly binds heme and degrades it in the presence of an electron donor (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). All components of the heme utilization gene cluster are required for efficient use of heme as a sole iron source, and the ferric uptake repressor (Fur) protein directly binds to the promoter region of the gene cluster, implicating Fur as a <italic>chu</italic> locus regulator (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>These data are consistent with observations that, in most organisms, intracellular iron levels are tightly regulated to avoid forming toxic hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions via Haber-Weiss-Fenton catalysis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Iron homeostasis specifically impacts the <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> response to oxidative stress in two ways: (i) excess iron is associated with repressed catalase production, thereby increasing hydrogen peroxide levels within the cell, and (ii) iron is a required cofactor for periplasmic reductases such as Mfr which interact with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic>, like most bacteria, requires nutrient iron to grow and proliferate, leading it to have evolved elaborate regulatory circuits to govern the expression of iron acquisition, metabolism, and efflux. While the above studies indicated that increased iron levels repress <italic>chu</italic> gene expression, likely via Fur binding, no positive regulators of heme and/or iron uptake have been identified. Due to the importance of iron in combating oxidative stress in <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic>, it would be surprising if <italic>Campylobacter</italic> did not have some mechanism for increasing iron uptake under unfavorable redox states. As such, we hypothesized that <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> likely maintains intracellular iron levels using both negative regulation, as seen in previous work with Fur, and positive regulation.</p><p>In subsequent Tn-Seq experiments that aimed at finding additional chicken colonization determinants, a candidate regulator was identified, Cjj81176_1389 (unpublished data). This regulator is predicted to contain an N-terminal Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain. The PAS domain is a ligand-binding domain that interacts with a chemically diverse array of small molecules (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). These domains, while highly divergent in primary sequence identity, maintain a conserved three-dimensional architecture (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). When ligand binds to a PAS domain, the protein either directly initiates a signaling response, or the protein-ligand complex becomes capable of responding to a secondary cue, including gas molecules, photons, or redox potential (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). We reasoned that since the heme utilization gene cluster and Cjj81176_1389 appear to be required for full colonization of the chicken gastrointestinal, and since Cjj81176_1389 may be sensing intracellular redox potential, Cjj81176_1389 could be directly regulating <italic>chu</italic> gene expression.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that Cjj81176_1389 mutants have significantly reduced ability for chicken gastrointestinal tract colonization, particularly during competition with wild-type <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic>. Subsequent transcriptomic analysis found that this regulator, here referred to as HeuR (for <bold><underline>he</underline></bold>me <bold><underline>u</underline></bold>ptake <bold><underline>r</underline></bold>egulator), positively influences <italic>chu</italic> gene expression, as well as other iron uptake systems. Purified HeuR specifically binds the <italic>chuZA</italic> promoter region, indicating it may regulate <italic>chu</italic> gene expression directly. Furthermore, <italic>heuR</italic> mutants are unable to efficiently use heme as the sole iron source and exhibit decreased levels of cell-associated iron. Finally, we show that loss of <italic>heuR</italic> leads to hydrogen peroxide resistance, in turn due to elevated levels of catalase activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="h1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s1.1"><title><italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> strains lacking <italic>heuR</italic> are unable to efficiently colonize the chicken gastrointestinal tract.</title><p>Colonization studies using defined insertion deletion mutants were performed using day-of-hatch chicks.

One determinant was a component of the <italic>Campylobacter</italic> heme utilization gene cluster <italic>chuB</italic>. In this work, we describe a regulator, which we have named HeuR, that is also required for wild-type levels of colonization of the chicken gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, because HeuR is predicted to contain a PAS domain&#x02014;a protein signature often associated with gas molecule and redox potential sensing&#x02014;and because it and <italic>chu</italic> are both required for chicken colonization, we hypothesized that HeuR regulates heme uptake through <italic>chu</italic> gene expression.</p><p>Recently, HeuR was also found to control expression of Cjj81176_1390, as the gene product was overexpressed in a <italic>heuR</italic> mutant (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The group that identified this phenotype named HeuR the <italic>Campylobacter</italic> &#x0201c;flagella interaction regulator&#x0201d; (CfiR) due to flagellar interactions that occurred in response to gene disruption. This group further found that the gene product of Cjj81176_1390 forms dimers linked by a disulfide bridge that may be responsive to the redox status of the cell (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Our observations, recounted below, show that HeuR controls more genes than just those that promote flagellar interactions, including many that may be involved in combating oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref>). As such, we suggest that the designation CfiR does not accurately represent the full regulatory role in the bacterium, and it is our recommendation that the name be changed to HeuR.</p><fig id="fig7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;7&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>Model of HeuR regulation of the <italic>chuABCDZ</italic> loci and heme homeostasis in <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic>.

The ChuBCD proteins transport heme to the cytoplasm of the cell, where iron is liberated from by the heme oxygenase ChuZ. The <italic>heuR</italic> mutant exhibits decreased expression of the <italic>chuABCDZ</italic> loci, decreased ability to use heme and hemoglobin as a source of nutrient iron, and decreased cell-associated iron levels as a consequence. Additionally, the <italic>heuR</italic> mutant exhibits decreased alpha-hemolysis and increased catalase production.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mbo0061630710007"/></fig><p>By RNA-Seq analysis of a <italic>heuR</italic> mutant strain, we identified several genes whose mRNA products were significantly less abundant, including those in the previously identified <italic>Campylobacter</italic> heme utilization (<italic>chu</italic>) gene cluster. Purified 6&#x000d7;His-HeuR was found to bind specifically to the <italic>chu</italic> promoter, albeit at relatively high levels (125&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g). Previously, regulators containing a PAS domain were found to be inhibited for DNA binding by the PAS domain itself (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). While the reason behind this observation is unknown, it may be due to insufficient copurification of ligand that is required for a higher-efficiency conformation. This may be similar for HeuR and may explain why more protein was required. We are currently working to determine whether this is the case, as well as identifying the specific binding site of HeuR relative to the <italic>chu</italic> promoters.</p><p>Additionally, transcript levels of several genes involved in enterochelin transport were decreased in the mutant strain, but were not identified by COG analysis as being involved in ion transport. As a result, this COG analysis is not comprehensive as the number of genes in the HeuR regulon that are involved in iron transport and metabolism is likely underreported. Nevertheless, based on these results, it becomes apparent that HeuR is primarily involved in maintaining sufficient levels of intracellular iron by upregulating systems that can scavenge for iron from diverse sources, which is supported by our ICP-MS data.</p><p>In addition to those genes that were underexpressed, transcripts of several were more abundant in the <italic>heuR</italic> mutant. Most of these genes are in two gene clusters: Cjj81176_1390 to -1394 and Cjj81176_1214 to -1217. The former, Cjj81176_1390 to -1394, includes the overexpressed gene (Cjj81176_1390) noted above whose product promotes flagellar interactions, supporting both the previous study and our work (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The latter gene cluster that is upregulated includes one gene that encodes an additional ion transporter and multiple genes predicted to be involved in methionine biosynthesis. The methionine biosynthetic enzymes encoded by these genes have been shown in other organisms to be sensitive to oxidation/oxidative stress (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In an oxidative environment, these enzymes may need to be replenished, and their inverse expression with that of iron-scavenging systems may be common. Whether upregulation of these genes is a direct or indirect effect of HeuR is currently unknown.</p><p>Growth assays using an iron chelator found that both the <italic>heuR</italic> and <italic>chuA</italic> mutants are reduced for growth under iron-limiting conditions. That this was observed in media without hemoglobin may indicate that the Chu system is partially responsible for the transport of free iron. As such, it would likely be an accessory system since growth was restored when iron was supplemented back, indicating the presence of another iron transport system. When heme and hemoglobin were added to these mutants, growth was not restored, supporting the conclusion that both are required for using heme as an iron source.</p><p>Analysis of cell-associated levels of iron showed that the <italic>heuR</italic> mutant is significantly decreased for iron and that these levels resemble those of a <italic>chuA</italic> mutant. Most of the iron reduction observed in these experiments is likely due to decreased heme utilization, as cultures were obtained from media containing sheep&#x02019;s blood. This is further supported by the observation that complementation with <italic>heuR</italic> restores iron levels in an <italic>heuR</italic> mutant background, but was unable to do so in a <italic>chuA</italic> mutant background. As our data indicate a minor role for HeuR and the Chu system in acquiring iron independently of heme, we are currently determining whether decreased iron is apparent in the <italic>heuR</italic> and <italic>chuA</italic> mutants grown in media without heme or hemoglobin. This will help us determine to what extent other iron sources are impacting cellular iron levels in these mutants.</p><p>When the <italic>heuR</italic> mutant was grown on blood plates, differences in the hemolytic pattern relative to wild-type <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> became apparent. Typically, <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> exhibits alpha-hemolysis on blood plates, likely due to the production of hydrogen peroxide that oxidizes the hemoglobin in the blood to methemoglobin (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Alpha-hemolysis was not observed in the <italic>heuR</italic> mutant, indicating that this mutant either produces less hydrogen peroxide or exhibits increased catalase activity. The mutant was highly resistant to hydrogen peroxide, which was associated with elevated levels of catalase activity; reintroduction of <italic>heuR</italic> led to both decreased resistance to hydrogen peroxide and catalase activity. Of the genes known to regulate catalase activity in <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic>&#x02014;including <italic>ahpC</italic>, <italic>fur</italic>, <italic>katA</italic>, and <italic>perR</italic>&#x02014;none was found to be significantly up- or downregulated in the <italic>heuR</italic> mutant (data not shown). Also, since iron levels are similar in the <italic>chuA</italic> mutant, it is unlikely that iron levels are responsible for the elevated catalase activity. Thus, we hypothesize that HeuR regulates the production of an unknown factor that perhaps posttranscriptionally regulates the activity of <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> catalase. We are currently working to determine what this factor is.</p><p>The <italic>heuR</italic> mutant exhibited significant decreases in colonization of the chicken cecum. This leads to the following two questions. (i) Is this system mainly required for combating oxidative stress in the cecum, or is it used for other cellular processes? (ii) Is the system acquiring iron from a heme source, or does it serve the dual purpose of acquiring free iron from the environment?</p><p>Oxidative stress in the cecum may come from a variety of sources, like metabolism by the intestinal microbiota or from the generation of reactive oxygen species due to intestinal inflammation. While the <italic>Campylobacter</italic>-chicken relationship is often considered to be commensal in nature, <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> colonization of the chicken gastrointestinal tract may result in low levels of transient inflammation (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>; L. M. Davis and V. J. DiRita, unpublished observation). Also, iron acquisition systems like Chu may be more important for acquiring iron that can be used in other cellular processes, including energy generation and DNA replication (6). Based on the results from the colonization studies, either scenario is possible. During monoinfection, the <italic>heuR</italic> mutant does not need to compete for iron with wild-type <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> and should colonize to relatively high levels, which is what we observe. Conversely, during competition, the <italic>heuR</italic> mutant would need to compete with wild-type <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> for resources and would be at a disadvantage for colonization&#x02014;the observed phenotype. We are currently working to determine whether decreasing oxidative stress in the chicken rescues colonization of the <italic>heuR</italic> mutant or whether other processes, like energy production or DNA replication, are affected. Since they are not mutually exclusive, it is possible that both scenarios are supported.</p><p>Second, the question arises as to whether <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> uses the Chu system to acquire iron from either/or a heme or nonheme source. It is currently unknown how much heme chickens consume in a commercial diet, and we could find no data on heme availability in their natural diet. With the exception of higher plants that can produce heme in the plastids, the absence of heme molecules in most grains, plants, and insects makes it less obvious how chickens would have access to heme-containing molecules (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The likelihood then becomes that <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> uses this system to scavenge heme either from a microbial source or from the host. The <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> 81-176 genome encodes all heme biosynthetic enzymes, with the exception of homologs for protoporphyrinogen oxidase (<italic>hemY</italic> or <italic>hemG</italic>). As such, in an iron-rich environment, <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> can likely synthesize its own heme. It could then use the heme uptake system to recover heme from other <italic>Campylobacter</italic> cells or from heme-producing residents of the microbiota. Finally, it remains possible that this system is able to transport free iron. While the heme receptor and heme oxygenase (ChuA and ChuZ, respectively) would likely not be needed for free iron transport, the accompanying ABC transport system (ChuBCD) may be promiscuous and function similar to other iron transporters. It should be noted that growth of both the <italic>heuR</italic> and <italic>chuA</italic> mutants could be rescued in chelator-treated media by the addition of iron. This suggests that other iron transport systems are active, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>, so the requirement of the Chu system for <italic>in vivo</italic> iron transport appears unlikely. Regardless, both scenarios are supported by the colonization assays since a mutant deficient for uptake of either heme or nonheme iron would be at a disadvantage in the host. We are currently investigating whether the ChuBCD transporter can translocate nonheme iron into <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni.</italic></p><p>Campylobacters, like most organisms, have evolved tight regulation on iron acquisition. This is largely due to the observation that iron is a required cofactor for numerous cellular processes but also has the capacity to participate in the formation of reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative stress within the bacterial cell (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). HeuR participates in controlling the utilization of alternate iron sources. The canonical ferric uptake regulator (Fur) represses iron acquisition under conditions where iron is abundant and readily available and also promotes resistance to both acid and oxidative stress (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Fur exists as a monomer under low-iron conditions, but when iron is present, Fur dimerizes and binds to discrete locations, termed &#x0201c;Fur boxes&#x0201d; to alter gene expression. PerR is another iron-responsive regulator that contributes to peroxide and superoxide stress defense (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Thus, <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> has evolved separate but overlapping regulons controlled by HeuR, Fur, and PerR to aid the cellular response to stimuli, including changes in iron availability and cognate perturbations in cellular oxidative stress (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the question also arises as to the impact of HeuR and the Chu system on dissemination of <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> to extraintestinal sites like the spleen and/or liver in poultry (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Similarly, this system may also be important in human infection as <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> has been shown to infect the blood, liver, and pancreas of patients, causing bacteremia, hepatitis, and pancreatitis, respectively (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). These sites, compared to the gut, are presumably more restricted for free iron, and the ability of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> to acquire iron from a heme source may be important during these infections.</p><p>In conclusion, our work demonstrates that HeuR is a transcriptional regulator that binds to the promoter region of <italic>chuZA</italic> and induces expression of bacterial factors which play a role in inorganic ion transport. As a result of HeuR activity, <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> elaborates proteins that aid in the utilization of both heme and hemoglobin as alternate sources of nutrient iron, thereby elevating cell-associated iron in response to iron restriction via nutritional immunity. Lack of HeuR promotes resistance to peroxide, a phenotype that is correlated with elevated catalase production. Together, these results reveal that HeuR is critical for colonization of the gastrointestinal tract of an animal host by promoting metal homeostasis and regulating cellular processes, which are critical for pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="h3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3.1"><title>Day-of-hatch chick colonization.</title><p>Day-of-hatch white Leghorn chickens were inoculated by oral gavage with 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of an approximately 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>-CFU/ml bacterial suspension in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (10<sup>8</sup>&#x000a0;CFU).

Cultures were grown overnight under microaerobic conditions at 37&#x000b0;C. Strains were passed for a second night on fresh media and harvested for iron quantification. Approximately 1,010 cells were washed three times with 5&#x000a0;ml and resuspended in 500&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of molecular-grade, distilled water. Cells were solubilized overnight at 50&#x000b0;C in 1&#x000a0;ml 50% nitric acid, followed by the addition of 9&#x000a0;ml of water.Extracts were analyzed for 57Fe using a Thermo Scientific ICAP Q quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer in kinetic energy dispersion mode. Instrument calibration was done with aliquots of an Fe synthetic standard solution diluted at 2.5, 10, and 100&#x000a0;ppb and natural water standards NIST SRM 1640 and 1643e. A solution of 100&#x000a0;ppb Fe was analyzed every 5 to 6 samples to monitor instrumental drift; all samples were corrected for linear drift. The oxide formation rate was determined to be &#x0003c;2% by measuring CeO/Ce, and the double-charged cation formation rate was found to be &#x0003c;3% by measuring <sup>137</sup>Ba<sup>2+</sup>/<sup>137</sup>Ba from a solution with approximately 1&#x000a0;ppb Ce and 1&#x000a0;ppb Ba.</p><p>Parts-per-billion levels for each strain were normalized to those observed for the wild-type equivalent in each experiment and the standard deviation was plotted.

Typically, <italic>C.&#x000a0;jejuni</italic> exhibits alpha-hemolysis on blood plates, likely due to the production of hydrogen peroxide that oxidizes the hemoglobin in the blood to methemoglobin. Strains were passed for a second night on new media under the same conditions. Cells were harvested into MH broth and normalized to an optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.05. These suspensions were added to equal volumes (100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l:100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l) of 2-fold dilutions of MH broth with hydrogen peroxide in a 96-well plate. Hydrogen peroxide concentrations ranged from 10&#x000a0;mM to 0.16&#x000a0;mM. This dilution resulted in bacterial concentrations of 0.025 OD units and hydrogen peroxide concentrations ranging from 5&#x000a0;mM to 0.08&#x000a0;mM. These cultures were grown statically for 48&#x000a0;h at 37&#x000b0;C under microaerobic conditions followed by resuspension of bacteria and recording of terminal OD<sub>600</sub> values. IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated using nonlinear regression analysis of normalized responses with variable slopes in GraphPad Prism 6. Statistical analysis of differences between strains at each concentration of hydrogen peroxide was performed using a Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>&#x000a0;test.For complementation analysis of the <italic>heuR</italic> phenotype, the complemented strains used for ICP-MS analysis were subjected to the same hydrogen peroxide dose-response assay as the strains described above.

Care was given to avoid contaminating the suspensions with media since blood exhibits catalase activity. Suspensions were normalized to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.0, and 10 &#x000b5;l of suspension was added to 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of 30% hydrogen peroxide (J. T. Baker) on a glass slide.
