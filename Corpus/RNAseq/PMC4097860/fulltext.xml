In addition to this phenotypic wealth, <italic>B. oleracea</italic> offers unique insights into polyploid evolution, as it results from multiple ancestral polyploidy events and a final Brassiceae-specific triplication event. Further, <italic>B. oleracea</italic> represents one of the diploid genomes that formed the economically important allopolyploid oilseed, <italic>Brassica napus</italic>.

Two dense genetic maps are generated to anchor almost 92% of the assembled scaffolds to nine pseudo-chromosomes. Over 50,000 genes are annotated and 40% of the genome predicted to be repetitive, thus contributing to the increased genome size of <italic>B. oleracea</italic> compared to its close relative <italic>B. rapa</italic>. A snapshot of both the leaf transcriptome and methylome allows comparisons to be made across the triplicated sub-genomes, which resulted from the most recent Brassiceae-specific polyploidy event.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Differential expression of the triplicated syntelogs and cytosine methylation levels across the sub-genomes suggest residual marks of the genome dominance that led to the current genome architecture.

The most agriculturally significant species are found within the Brassiceae tribe where selection for targeted traits in both seed and vegetative tissues has generated high-value oilseed, vegetable and condiment crops. <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> represents an important species integral to human diets that encompasses multiple cultivar groups that are classified based on the specialized morphology of their edible structures, namely kales, cabbages, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and kohl rabi. In addition to this radical morphological variation, the cultivars and their related wild species accumulate a range of secondary metabolites that have been implicated in promoting human health, such as compounds functioning as anti-carcinogens and anti-oxidants. <italic>B. oleracea</italic> (n = 9, CC genome) along with its close relative <italic>Brassica rapa</italic> (n = 10, AA genome) are the extant descendants of the two diploid species, which fused to form the amphidiploid <italic>Brassica napus</italic> (canola or oilseed rape; n = 19, AACC genome), arguably the most economically valuable species among the Brassiceae.</p><p>Brassica research has been enhanced through the recent publication of the <italic>B. rapa</italic> genome sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the current report we present the genome of the close relative <italic>B. oleracea,</italic> which diverged from <italic>B. rapa</italic> some 4 million years ago (Mya) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The completion of the genome sequences of these diploid species and the anticipated assembly of the amphidiploid <italic>B. napus</italic> genome will provide foundational resources for not only crop improvement but also studying polyploid evolution. The importance of polyploidy as a driving force in plant speciation, diversification and evolution has been widely acknowledged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The <italic>Brassica</italic> species carry remnants of three whole genome duplication (WGD) events, the &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], the most recent of which, the &#x003b1; event, dates from approximately 47 Mya. In addition, the <italic>Brassica</italic> diploid species are mesopolyploids, having experienced an hexaploidization event approximately 23 Mya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As such, <italic>Brassica</italic> species offer a unique opportunity to study the impacts of WGD on genome evolution, and in particular the mechanisms employed to mitigate or exploit the impact of maintaining multiple copies of each gene. Analysis of the <italic>B. rapa</italic> genome suggested that the hexaploidy event occurred in two discrete steps (from diploid to tetraploid, then from tetraploid to hexaploid) with a reduction in gene number at each stage, resulting in one genome (least-fractionated) copy maintaining a higher percentage of genes than the other two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It has also been suggested that genome dominance has led to the inequity in the maintenance of gene copies after the WGD events, such that the least-fractionated genome of <italic>B. rapa</italic> exhibits higher levels of gene expression than its nuclear counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the mechanisms for maintaining such dominance are unknown, although epigenetic phenomena have been suggested as possible determinants.</p><p>The current report describes the generation of a reference genome for the mesopolyploid <italic>B. oleracea</italic> along with transcriptome and methylome characterization. The genome was compared with its close relative <italic>B. rapa</italic> to provide insights into the observed difference in genome size, with <italic>B. oleracea</italic> being approximately 20% larger than <italic>B. rapa</italic>. In addition, the legacy of the mesopolyploidy event relative to maintenance of gene copy number, relative gene expression and cytosine methylation levels was assessed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Genome assembly</title><p>A genome assembly of the doubled haploid <italic>B. oleracea</italic> kale-like type TO1000DH was generated from approximately 94&#x000d7; coverage of the estimated 648 Mb genome (Figure S1 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The sequence data comprised previously available Sanger sequencing reads (0.01 Gb) and newly generated Illumina (56.33 Gb) and Roche/454 (0.31 Gb) sequencing data (Table S1 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). A hybrid assembly approach was taken using a <italic>de Bruijn</italic> graph-based short read assembler to generate initial contigs and scaffolds incorporating all available sequence data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The software tool Bambus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], which provides a hierarchical approach to defining contig adjacencies, was used to generate scaffolds taking advantage of large insert mate-pair libraries (8 and 17 kb) and paired bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences. The final assembly totaling 488.6 Mb (with 9% uncalled bases) covered approximately 75% of the estimated genome size (648 Mb) and was arranged into 33,459 scaffolds (2,172 of which were greater than 2 kb), with an N50 of 850 kb (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The quality of the assembled sequence was validated through CEGMA analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], reference mapping of paired-end reads to the assembly and sequence alignment with publicly available BAC sequences (Table S2 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>; Figure S2 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Assembly statistics for </bold><bold><italic>Brassica oleracea</italic>

The first approach, restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) mapping, uses a single restriction enzyme (<italic>Eco</italic>RI) combined with shearing to capture a fraction of the genome for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery and mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

The relative genome coverage of each method differed due to both the distribution of restriction sites and the impact of cytosine methylation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). RAD captured a greater portion of the genome (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>a) and a higher percentage of the potential sites were tagged and sequenced (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>b).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of efficacy of GBS methods.

These data were compressed based on recombination breakpoints to provide 2,299 anchor points that were used to generate a high-density linkage map for <italic>B. oleracea</italic> (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Based on the linkage analyses, 66 scaffolds were found to be mis-assembled and were separated according to the SNP positions and available genome synteny data. In regions of low recombination the order and orientation of the scaffolds were assigned based on their syntenic relationship with <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and/or <italic>B. rapa</italic>. The final map was confirmed through alignment of the GBS data, which provided 15,909 SNP loci that were compressed into 826 genetic bins. This allowed almost 94% of the assembly to be assigned to one of the nine pseudo-chromosomes of <italic>B. oleracea</italic>.

Varying reports of such levels have been found for plants ranging, for mCG, from 22% in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], to 51% in soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and 59% in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The <italic>B. oleracea</italic> genome was enriched for mCG when compared to levels more commonly observed for <italic>A. thaliana</italic> but demonstrated similar levels of cytosine methylation in the mCHG and mCHH contexts. The pattern observed in <italic>B. oleracea</italic> was in contrast to that noted recently for the paleopolyploid soybean, where higher levels of both mCG and mCHG were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The distribution of methylated cytosines across the genome mirrored the distribution of repetitive elements, with methylation enrichment observed in particular towards the centromeric regions (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This biased distribution is a reflection of the higher levels of cytosine methylation found in all contexts at the individual repetitive element level (Table S8 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). The average level of mCG methylation for repeat elements ranged from 88% to 100%, with SINEs showing the highest levels. mCHG and mCHH are commonly associated with silencing of repetitive elements, and although showing more variation compared to mCG, they were consistently two to seven times the observed genome-wide levels across all repeat types (Table S8 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p><p>The average cytosine methylation varied across gene structures, with higher levels observed upstream and downstream of the predicted translational start and stop sites (Figure S5 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Interestingly, and in contrast to <italic>A. thaliana</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], higher levels of cytosine methylation, in particular mCG, were observed for intronic sequences compared to exons (Table S8 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). However, the most marked differences were observed between syntenic and non-syntenic predicted genes. A total of 16,601 non-syntenic genes were identified, which were either outside of ancestral blocks or were within block boundaries but lacked a syntenic orthologue in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and were homologous to an <italic>A. thaliana</italic> gene from elsewhere in the genome. Non-syntenic genes could result from transposition of single genes or small segmental translocations of multiple linked genes. Cytosine methylation in all contexts was significantly enhanced across non-syntenic genes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>; Figure S6 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Additional evidence, including generally high <italic>Ka</italic>/<italic>Ks</italic> levels (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), indicating low purifying selection, shorter average gene length and lower average number of exons, suggests that the non-syntenic genes may be undergoing pseudogenization (Figure S7 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Similar observations were made for genes repeated in tandem and for <italic>B. oleracea</italic>-specific genes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>; Figure S6 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Cytosine methylation levels across specific categories of genes of the </bold><bold><italic>B. oleracea </italic></bold><bold>genome.</bold> The mCG (red), mCHG (green) and mCHH (blue) levels are shown for each gene model (includes promoter regions, UTRs, exons, introns and 3&#x02032; flanking), based on a sliding window of 500 kb.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2014-15-6-r77-6"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Correlation of cytosine methylation and expression levels</title><p>Expression levels assessed using FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped) values calculated from leaf transcriptome RNASeq data showed a non-linear relationship to mCG levels across the gene body (exons and introns) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>a). Although high expression tends to be associated with lower methylation levels, there were exceptions, with non-expressed genes showing limited methylation and heavily methylated genes being expressed, but in general moderately expressed genes showed some level of gene body methylation.

This WGD preceded the divergence of <italic>B. oleracea</italic> from <italic>B. rapa</italic> and except for a limited number of additional gross chromosomal rearrangements both species have maintained a similar genome structure. In addition, comparable levels of biased gene fractionation have resulted in one sub-genome maintaining higher numbers of orthologous genes relative to the other two. It has been suggested that genome dominance post-polyploidy determines the fate of duplicated genes and gene expression has been positively correlated with maintenance of gene copies in other species and may play a similar role in <italic>Brassica</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>After fractionation only 2,242 genes have been fully retained across the three sub-genomes of <italic>B. oleracea</italic>. This subset of genes was used to detect any residual effects of genome dominance on gene expression (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>a). Analysis of sub-genome (G) by tissue-type (T) interactions across four tissue types identified 26% (588) of the fully retained triplets with a statistically significant effect (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; Tukey test for interaction). Of these 588 triplets, 43% showed higher expression in the LF sub-genome, while 29% and 28% showed higher expression in MF1 and MF2, respectively, indicating an expression bias for the LF. Hierarchical clustering of expression patterns for 5,872 fully retained genes showing expression variation across all four tissues resolved 15 clusters, which showed tissue-specific patterns (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>b). The majority of the triplicated genes (83%) were separated across clusters signifying independent regulation of gene copies, which implies post-polyploidy mechanisms such as neo- or sub-functionalization are acting on the gene duplicates.Since cytosine methylation appears to play a role in regulating gene expression, levels of cytosine methylation were determined at both the sub-genome level and across the fully retained triplicated gene copies. At the sub-genome level there was no significant difference in gene density, yet assessing methylation across ancestral blocks indicated that although not significantly different, the levels of methylation in all contexts were lowest for the least fractionated genome (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>c). However, there was no correlation or bias observed between cytosine methylation in any context across the gene body with sub-genome copy (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>d). The bias in methylation observed at the sub-genome level could reflect an earlier trend towards suppression of the more fractionated genomes and the process of gene fractionation may have removed the requirement for continued involvement of cytosine methylation in maintenance of gene expression levels for the remaining duplicated copies. Although no evidence of genome dominance was observed at the gene level, each sub-genome copy appeared to have independent patterns of cytosine methylation, which could provide further evidence of functional diversification (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>d). The order of pairwise correlations in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>d was determined using principle component analysis, which clustered similar patterns, showing greater correlation between the context of cytosine methylation within the sub-genomes than between methylation patterns across the sub-genomes.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Genome dominance and functional diversification of </bold><bold><italic>B. oleracea </italic></bold><bold>homologues retained across three sub-genomes.

Of these morphotypes, TO1000, a kale-like plant, was selected as an excellent experimental model since it is rapid cycling, self-compatible, uncommon within <italic>B. oleracea</italic>, and has associated genomic and genetic resources, including a BAC-based physical map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], a doubled haploid mapping population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and a mutagenized population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus, the reference genome sequence of TO1000 will provide an excellent tool for dissecting the molecular basis of the remarkable variation found within the species. In addition, <italic>B. oleracea</italic> is a close relative of the C genome species that hybridized with <italic>B. rapa</italic> to form the economically important oilseed crop <italic>B. napus</italic>; as such, the genome sequence will provide a foundation for further research in the allopolyploid relative.</p><p>The assembled nuclear genome sequence of TO1000 indicates that the increased genome size of <italic>B. oleracea</italic> compared to <italic>B. rapa</italic> results from multiplication of both repetitive and genic sequences. However, the two genomes evolved from a common ancestor and, as such, are remarkably similar with minimal large-scale chromosomal rearrangements having occurred since their divergence approximately 4 Mya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The two genomes share the Brassiceae-specific hexaploidization event and 77.8% of the annotated genes from <italic>B. rapa</italic> have a retained <italic>B. oleracea</italic> orthologue. Thus, even with on-going independent fractionation post-polyploidization and species divergence there is significant conservation of syntenic gene content between the A and C genomes, which is reflected in the composition of ancestral blocks along with their fractionation status in the two genomes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The maintenance of the syntenic block structure reflects the recent shared ancestry of the two genomes. The mechanism by which the non-syntenic genes have evolved is unclear, although they now show evidence of pseudogenization. It has been suggested that such changes could result from transposon activity causing transduplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and there was a slight bias in prevalence of transposable elements flanking non-syntenic genes; however, 30% of syntenic genes also had transposable elements annotated within 500 bp of the coding region, which largely reflects the higher density of such structures in the <italic>B. oleracea</italic> genome (Table S9 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). It appears that the majority of the gene loss observed in the two <italic>Brassica</italic> diploids occurred prior to species divergence. Although the chromosomal rearrangements and independent repetitive element evolution may be sufficient to ensure inter-specific incompatibility, the majority of the species morphological characteristics presumably stem from allelic diversification and expansion of particular gene families.</p><p>Polyploidy is a prevalent evolutionary mechanism and it has been suggested that most angiosperms have experienced one or more polyploidy events in their history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. <italic>Brassica</italic> species are excellent models for the study of this mode of genome evolution since at least four WGD events underlie their current genome architecture, three shared with the Brassicaceae experimental model <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and the most recent (estimated at approximately 23 Mya) specific to Brassiceae. The genome sequence of <italic>B. rapa</italic> allowed a detailed analysis of the three ancestral genomes that had fused to form the Brassiceae tribe, revealing an asymmetrical pattern of gene loss, suggesting a two-step polyploidy event with the last genome to join retaining the highest number of ancestral genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The genome of <italic>B. oleracea</italic> mirrors this observation. It has been proposed that the genome dominance inferred to regulate this biased gene loss stems from imbalances in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and our analyses of transcriptome data from four <italic>B. oleracea</italic> tissue types supports this hypothesis, since higher expression of genes from the LF genome was observed for 43% of the fully retained triplets showing a significant sub-genome by tissue type interaction. However, study of the retained triplicated genes provides more compelling evidence for functional diversification of gene duplicates, with 83% of the triplicated genes showing independent expression patterns across the four tissue types. The fate of duplicate gene copies following WGD has been the subject of much debate and numerous models have been proposed to explain their retention or loss with discussion seemingly favoring dosage balance, neo-functionalization and sub-functionalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Perhaps at one time controlled through dosage balance, which would require coordinated expression, the maintenance of duplicate genes post-hexaploidy in <italic>B. oleracea</italic> appears now to result from neo- or sub-functionalization.</p><p>The mechanisms that respond to WGD to provide meiotic stability post-polyploidy are unknown but the rapidity of change offered by epigenetic effects has suggested their potential role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Indeed, methylation re-patterning post-hybridization has been found in specific plant lineages, including <italic>Brassica</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Cytosine methylation has been shown to have an impact on gene expression and its role in controlling the activity of transposable elements could influence genome stability. In addition, cytosine methylation itself can be a source of further molecular variation through spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines. Through single base resolution we have provided the first cytosine methylation map for the reference <italic>B. oleracea</italic> genome, which parallels findings in other eukaryotic genomes. Biased distribution reflecting the role of cytosine methylation in repeat element suppression was observed and patterns of methylation across gene structures were similar to those observed for multiple species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although methylation across the three ancestral sub-genomes was imbalanced, with the least fractionated genome experiencing lower levels, this did not appear to be reflected at the level of the retained triplicate genes. Since the triplicate genes appear to have undergone a significant level of functional diversification, the influences of residual genome dominance from cytosine methylation seem minimal at the gene level. If cytosine methylation was an influencing factor in restoring balance in the nucleus of the ancestral polyploid <italic>B. oleracea</italic>, its effects are no longer apparent. It has been shown that methylation patterns can be conserved across orthologous genes within lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] yet the patterns observed for the fully retained triplicated homologues in <italic>B. oleracea</italic> appeared largely independent. Thus, it is possible that cytosine methylation played a significant role early in the ancestry of <italic>B. oleracea</italic> to quickly establish relative expression differences but may now be involved in diversification of gene expression among the three sub-genomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We present a reference genome for the mesopolyploid <italic>B. oleracea</italic>, a resource for further study of polyploid evolution and a platform for genetic improvement of an array of Brassica vegetable crop types.

Briefly, approximately 40 g of fresh leaf tissue was homogenized in 200 ml buffer (HB; 0.01 M Trizma base, 0.08 M KCL, 0.01 M EDTA, 1 mM spermidine, 1 mM spermine, 0.5 M sucrose plus 0.15% &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, pH 9.4 to 9.5). The homogenate was filtered and the nuclei pelleted by centrifugation (1,800 g at 4&#x000b0;C for 20 minutes). The pellet was resuspensed (1 &#x000d7; HB plus 0.5% Triton-&#x000d7;100) and centrifuged three times. Finally, the nuclei were resuspended in 10 ml lysis buffer (100 mM TrisCl, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, 2% SDS). High molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted by traditional proteinase K (0.05 mg/ml; 65&#x000b0;C for 2 h) digestion followed by RNAase A treatment, two cycles of phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Quantification of genomic DNA was performed using PicoGreen dsDNA kit (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies Inc., Burlington, ON, Canada). Genomic DNA (5 to 40 &#x003bc;g) was randomly sheared using one of: Covaris S2 ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA, US); Hydroshear (Genomic Solutions Inc., Ann Arbor, MI, US); or gas-driven nebulizers.

Inside each superfamily, elements sharing more than 80% sequence identity over more than 80% of their length, and at least 80 bp, are considered as belonging to the same family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The merged TE database was used for comparative repeat masking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] of the <italic>B. oleracea</italic> and <italic>B. rapa</italic> genomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Synteny analysis</title><p>Sequence homology was detected by BLASTP of the predicted proteins against the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> proteome. BLAST hits with E-value 1E-20 or better and within the top 40% from the best bit score were kept for further analysis. The chains of syntenic <italic>B. oleracea</italic>-<italic>A. thaliana</italic> gene pairs were computed by DAGChainer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] using the default parameters. In the case of a <italic>B. oleracea</italic> gene participating in more than one syntenic chain due to duplication in the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome, the <italic>B. oleracea</italic>-<italic>A. thaliana</italic> pair in the weaker scoring chain was removed from the analysis. The syntelog table was generated by placing the syntenic chains onto the <italic>B. oleracea</italic> chromosomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of expression divergence</title><p>All calculations were completed using R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. For the 2,242 triplets of (fully retained) <italic>B. oleracea</italic> genes the raw expression values (FPKM) from each of the four tissue types (T) and three sub-genomes (G) were transformed by adding 1 and taking the natural logarithm. All subsequent calculations were done with the transformed values. The means for each sub-genome were taken over the four tissue types, and the genome with the highest expression was recorded. With no replication interaction (G&#x000d7;T) cannot be separated from random error, so the gene triplets were sorted by the <italic>P</italic>-value for an extra interaction term (Tukey) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] that is the product of the main effects terms in the ANOVA model for the expression data for a gene triplet. The cumulative frequency of each genome with the highest expression was plotted against the Tukey <italic>P</italic>-values.</p><p>Hierarchical clustering of gene expression was carried out using 1 minus the Pearson sample correlation coefficient as the distance measure, which requires the variances of the expression values for each gene to be non-zero. This clusters correlated sets of expression values regardless of the absolute magnitude of the expression levels. The average linkage method was used to form the clusters.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein family classification</title><p>An all-against-all BLASTP (E-value cutoff of 1E-10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] similarity search was performed among predicted protein sequences of four completely sequenced Brassicaceae species, <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, <italic>B. rapa</italic> and <italic>B. oleracea</italic>. The pairwise similarities generated by this analysis were parsed and stored in a matrix that served as input for clustering by the TRIBE-MCL approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The groups of homologous proteins were clustered using Markov cluster (MCL) algorithm at an inflation rate (I) of 3.0 and other default parameters. A &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was performed to determine if significant expansion of gene families among the Brassicaceae species occurred. &#x003c7;2 probability values were adjusted by Bonferroni correction and the post-hoc test was conducted only if the <italic>P</italic>-value after Bonferroni correction was &#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Single base resolution methylome sequencing</title><p>Genomic DNA was isolated from <italic>B. oleracea</italic> TO1000 nuclei prepared according to the method found in Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] from leaf tissue as above. TO1000 genomic DNA (5 &#x003bc;g), along with 0.5% w/w of unmethylated lambda DNA (Promega, Madison, WI, US) included to assess bisulfite conversion efficiency, was sheared using the Diagenode Bioruptor Plus to produce an average fragment size of 300 bp. Library construction was performed using the Illumina Paired-End Sample Prep Kit and QIAGEN PCR Purification kits according to the Illumina Whole-genome Bisulfite Sequencing for Methylation Analysis protocol. Methylated adapters from the Illumina TruSeq DNA Sample Prep Kit v2 were substituted for the unmethylated adapters within the Illumina Paired-End Sample Prep Kit. Ligation products equivalent to 450 bp were purified using the BluePippin DNA size selection system (Sage Science). Bisulfite conversion of this DNA was performed using the QIAGEN EpiTect Bisulfite kit. The libraries were quantified using a BioAnalyzer (Agilent) and KAPA library quantification kit for Illumina (KAPA Biosystems), and sequenced from both ends (paired-end) for 100 cycles on either an Illumina HiSeq 2000 or Illumina HiScanSQ.</p><p>BSMAP (v2.74) and an associated python script (methratio.py) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] were used to analyze cytosine methylation ratios. All reads were trimmed for quality and adapter sequence, potential PCR duplicates were removed and only those reads mapping uniquely to the genome were retained. Sequencing of cytosines in lambda DNA included in each library provided an error rate for non-conversion; this rate was used in a custom Perl script to identify methylated cytosines using the binomial probability distribution at a false discovery rate of &#x0003c;5% (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).</p><p>Perl was used for text manipulation to assign pseudochromosome coordinates to gene features, 5&#x02032; promoter, 5&#x02032; UTR, gene, exon, intron, 3&#x02032; UTR and 3&#x02032; regions, and incorporate these annotations in a custom .gff file. A combination of Perl and R was used to perform statistical analyses on these data. Graphics summarizing the observed statistical relationships were developed using ggplot2, RGL and corrgram in R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. All relevant Perl and R scripts are open source and freely available upon request.</p></sec><sec><title>Accession numbers</title><p>All the raw data used in the assembly of the genome, the RNASeq data used in the expression analysis, and the bisulfite sequence data have been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank short read archives under accession numbers SRP040796, SRS586190, SRS586272, SRS586273.
