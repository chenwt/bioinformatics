Cilia are found on almost every cell type of the human body and numerous diseases, collectively termed ciliopathies, are associated with defects in cilia, including respiratory infections, male infertility, situs inversus, polycystic kidney disease, retinal degeneration, and Bardet-Biedl Syndrome. Here we show that Illumina-based whole-genome transcriptome analysis in the biflagellate green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> identifies 1850 genes up-regulated during ciliogenesis, 4392 genes down-regulated, and 4548 genes with no change in expression during ciliogenesis. We examined four genes up-regulated and not previously known to be involved with cilia (ZMYND10, NXN, GLOD4, SPATA4) by knockdown of the human orthologs in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (hTERT-RPE1) cells to ask whether they are involved in cilia-related processes that include cilia assembly, cilia length control, basal body/centriole numbers, and the distance between basal bodies/centrioles. All of the genes have cilia-related phenotypes and, surprisingly, our data show that knockdown of GLOD4 and SPATA4 also affects the cell cycle. These results demonstrate that whole-genome transcriptome analysis during ciliogenesis is a powerful tool to gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which centrosomes and cilia are assembled.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>flagella</kwd><kwd>deflagellation</kwd><kwd>ZMYND10</kwd><kwd>NXN</kwd><kwd>SPATA4</kwd><kwd>GLOD4</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name> DJS Export </meta-name><meta-value>v1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Cilia are hair-like organelles protruding from many types of cells in the human body. They play both signaling and mechanical roles in cells. At the base of cilia lie microtubule-based structures called basal bodies, which template and anchor cilia and recruit proteins needed for ciliary assembly. The presence of cilia and basal bodies is linked to the cell cycle in many organisms; mammalian cells that exit the cell cycle are quiescent, nonproliferating, and assemble cilia (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Tucker <italic>et al.</italic> 1979</xref>). When cells re-enter the cell cycle, they absorb their cilia in late G1 (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Rieder <italic>et al.</italic> 1979</xref>) and basal bodies convert to centrioles to become part of the spindle pole during mitosis. The prevailing hypothesis is that the cell cycle regulates the basal body/centriole and the assembly of cilia. Depletion of cdk or cyclin A or E eliminates centriole separation (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lacey <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>). In many unicellular organisms such as Paramecium or Tetrahymena, cilia are retained during division.</p><p>In recent years, interest in cilia as an important organelle resurfaced due to a growing list of human diseases associated with ciliary defects, which cause a wide range of phenotypes that include renal cysts, liver disease, cognitive impairment, retinal degeneration, obesity, skeletal bone defects, laterality defects, and polydactyly (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Albee and Dutcher 2012</xref>). Abnormal formation or function of these structures has been implicated as an underlying cause of many syndromes and disorders that have traditionally been recognized as disjoint conditions. The identification, characterization, and implication of human ciliopathy disease genes have greatly benefited from study in the model organism <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Pazour <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Chlamydomonas is a unicellular, green alga that has two cilia/flagella that are morphologically and biochemically similar to cilia found in humans. When environmental pH is lowered, Chlamydomonas cells shed their cilia and ciliogenesis begins immediately once a neutral pH is restored. The specific transcriptional induction of genes encoding many known cilia components during ciliogenesis have been widely reported and underscores one of the advantages of using Chlamydomonas as a model organism to study cilia and ciliogenesis.</p><p>Proteomic approaches using isolated Chlamydomonas cilia have generated an important list of ciliary components albeit with the caveat that low abundance and membrane proteins are not well represented (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Pazour <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). This analysis has identified numerous structural components, but components that regulate cilia assembly or function such as those which preassemble dynein components in the cytoplasm were not identified (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mitchison <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). Genomic comparisons have also added to the list of ciliary components (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Avidor-Reiss <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Merchant <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kwan <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hodges <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). These methods are complementary to proteomic methods, but they also generate an incomplete list because genes with conserved motifs such as kinases are discarded as a result of being in a nonciliated species. Many of the known ciliary components are up-regulated during ciliogenesis in Chlamydomonas. Previous methods to look at transcript levels focused on known genes (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lefebvre and Rosenbaum 1986</xref>), genes found by genomic comparisons (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>) or proteomics (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Pazour <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), or used an incomplete version of the Chlamydomonas genome (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Stolc <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). In addition, these studies focused on genes with increased fold change at 30 min and this single time point may also yield an incomplete list of ciliogenesis genes.</p><p>To generate a more complete picture of the genes required for ciliogenesis, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Nagalakshmi <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>) and mapped the reads to the v5.3.1 Chlamydomonas genome assembly. We compared transcript abundance at 3, 10, 30, and 60 min during ciliogenesis with the predeflagellation transcript levels. We identified 1850 genes with an increased fold change of at least 2.5 at one or more of the time points. From this set, we analyzed four genes with homologs in humans using retinal pigment epithelial cells (hTERT-RPE1) expressing centrin-1/green fluorescent protein (GFP) and found that gene knockdown affects cilia, basal bodies/centrioles, and two genes also play an unexpected role in cell cycle progression.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Chlamydomonas sample preparation and RNAseq analysis</title><p>Chlamydomonas cell cultures were grown in 150 mL of Sager and Granick medium (R) to a concentration of 7.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells per mL and 87.5% flagellated (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lux and Dutcher 1991</xref>).

To summarize, genes are first sorted by decreasing variance of the profile, and the top 75% of genes are then grouped by fuzzy k-means clustering. In contrast to standard k-means clustering, fuzzy k-means clustering assigns each profile a probability of membership in each cluster and allows multicluster membership for a given gene. Once initial membership is determined, the method determines the appropriate membership probability cut-off such that the average gene is assigned to one cluster (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Brady <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). Similarity between clusters is then determined by the Pearson correlations between their mean profiles and a single-linkage hierarchical tree is generated. Branches of the tree with Pearson correlation &#x0003e;0.9 were merged into the final set of clusters and the mean profile for each cluster determined. Individual genes were then assigned to clusters for which the Pearson correlation between their profile and the mean profile of the cluster was &#x0003e;0.85, resulting in nearly every gene being assigned to exactly one cluster (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Brady <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Gene knockdown experiments</title><p>Multiple constructs expressing short hairpin (sh)RNA (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Moffat <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.orglookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.113.006338/-/DC1/006338SI.pdf">Supporting Information</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.113.006338/-/DC1/TableS1.pdf">Table S1</ext-link>) were used for each gene and delivered into cells using the lentiviral system in the presence of 10 &#x003bc;g/mL polybrene.

The flagellar proteome contains 624 genes with v5.3.1 Chlamydomonas gene predictions with two or more peptides (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Pazour <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Of these, 357 are found in our RNAseq dataset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Of the 1429 genes in the flagellar proteome identified by a single peptide that have v5.3.1 gene predictions, 483 are found in our dataset. This finding suggests that not all structural proteins in the flagella show up-regulation. <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Stolc <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> used microarray analysis to identify genes up-regulated 30 min after deflagellation, similar to our method. Of the 214 genes with v5.3.1 gene matches that they identified, 196 genes are in our RNAseq dataset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Of the 18 genes identified by Stolc <italic>et al.</italic> not found in our RNAseq data, 10 are heat shock proteins and may represent a stress response rather than a ciliogenesis response. Five of genes have either no similarity to known genes or no predicted domains. The remaining three genes include a DEAD-box helicase, a potential splicing factor, and a membrane transporter. RNAseq of mouse tracheal epithelial cells (MTECs) undergoing differentiation to become multiciliated, identified 649 genes (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hoh <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>) and of these 397 have homologs in Chlamydomonas. There are 222 genes (56%) with RNAseq support in both Chlamydomonas and mouse. The MTECs generate 200&#x02212;300 cilia per cell and must duplicate their basal bodies in addition to generating cilia. Some of the genes identified in MTECs may be due to basal body duplication or multiciliarity and may explain why only roughly half of those genes are found in our data. This comparison shows that overall our data agrees with previously published studies and reports many new genes that are likely to be involved in ciliogenesis.</p><table-wrap id="t2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Comparison with previous published results</title></caption><table frame="above" rules="groups"><col width="33.34%" span="1"/><col width="33.33%" span="1"/><col width="33.33%" span="1"/><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Evidence</th><th valign="top" align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. Genes Supported by RNAseq</th><th valign="top" align="center" scope="col" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. Genes with v5 Predictions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Flagellar proteome 2 or more peptides<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t2n1"><italic><sup>a</sup></italic></xref></td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">357</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">624</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Flagellar proteome 1 or more peptides<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t2n1"><italic><sup>a</sup></italic></xref></td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">483</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1429</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Microarray <xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t2n2"><italic><sup>b</sup></italic></xref></td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">196</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">214</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RNAseq mouse tracheal cells <xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t2n3"><sup>c</sup></xref></td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">222</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">397</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t2n1"><label>a</label><p><xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Pazour <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>.</p></fn><fn id="t2n2"><label>b</label><p><xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Stolc <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>.</p></fn><fn id="t2n3"><label>c</label><p><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hoh <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>We further tested for genes up-regulated in the RNAseq experiment by using qRT-PCR of five genes with previous support [&#x003b1;-tubulin (<italic>TUA1</italic>), radial spoke protein (<italic>RSP3</italic>), outer dynein arm (<italic>ODA6</italic>), kinesin (<italic>KLP1</italic>), and flagellar protein 178 (<italic>FAP178</italic>)] and found agreement between our qRT-PCR and RNAseq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

We chose these to look at early timepoints based on previous studies showing that many flagellar mRNAs begin to increase between 10 and 30 min and return to predeflagellation levels 2&#x02212;3 hr postdeflagellation (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Silflow and Rosenbaum 1981</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Schloss <italic>et al.</italic> 1984</xref>). Sixteen principal regulation profiles are identified and then grouped into five main patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The Arch group, containing patterns Arch1 and Arch2, shows increased expression at 3 min, a peak expression at 10 min, and then decreasing expression at 30 and 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Arch2 is the most common pattern with 343 genes, whereas Arch1 is the second most common pattern with 336 genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.113.006338/-/DC1/TableS3.xlsx">Table S3</ext-link>). Altogether, 37% of genes display the Arch pattern. The Staggered (Stag) group consists of four profile patterns that show a burst of expression at the 3, 10, 30, or 60 min time points with continued expression thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Stag30 is the third most common pattern with 226 genes, Stag10 is the fourth most with 189 genes, and Stag60 and Stag3 are the fifth and tenth most common with 165 and 49 genes, respectively. Together the six patterns in the Arch and Staggered groups contain 71% of the up-regulated genes. The remaining up-regulated genes are categorized into three groups of profile patterns: Hump, Pulse, and Up-Tick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, C</xref>&#x02212;E; the number of genes in each pattern is listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.113.006338/-/DC1/TableS3.xlsx">Table S3</ext-link>). The Hump pattern shows significant up-regulation over the course of two time points, either at 3 min and 10 min (Hump1) or 10 min and 30 min (Hump2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The Pulse pattern is similar to Hump patterns, but significant up-regulation is sustained for a single time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We observe a pulse pattern at each of the 3-minute (Pulse3), 10-minute (Pulse10) or 30-minute (Pulse30<italic>)</italic> time points. We note that a fraction of up-regulated genes categorized as Stag60 may actually exhibit a 60-minute pulse if further data were gathered at later time points. Up-Tick patterns have more complicated profiles with multiple peaks and can be further subdivided by the time points of their expression peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Profile clustering identifies 16 principal up-regulation expression profiles organized into five pattern groups.

The first and second most common principal expression profiles are found with this pattern: Arch1 (n = 336; 18%) and Arch 2 (n = 343; 19%), respectively. The Arch1 pattern shows expression that peaks at 10 or 30 min but is still up at 60 min. The Arch2 pattern is similar to Arch1 except that the genes are not up-regulated at the 60-min time point. (B) The Staggered (Stag) pattern shows genes with a burst of expression at the 3, 10, 30, or 60 min time points. The third, fourth, fifth, and tenth most common expression profiles are found with this pattern: Stag30 (n = 226; 12%), Stag10 (n = 189; 10%), Stag60 (n = 165; 9%), and Stag3 (n = 49; 3%). (C) The Pulse pattern shows up-regulation at a single time point and accounts for 11% (n = 196) of the up-regulated genes. (D) The Up-Tick pattern describes genes that show increased expression at one time point followed by down-regulation at another time point followed by up-regulation at a third time point. Up-Tick patterns comprise 3% (n = 51) of up-regulated genes and can be further subdivided by the time point of the up-tick. (E) Hump patterns comprise 16% (n = 290) and are profiles that are pulse-like, but significant up-regulation is sustained over two consecutive time points. Of the remaining fraction, 0.5% (n = 9) show profiles that are outliers in that their profiles are not adequately similar to any principal expression profile found in this analysis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="979f2"/></fig><p>We then examined structural ciliogenesis genes to determine whether these genes may show similar patterns of expression.

SPATA4 is also a good candidate for having a cilia-related phenotype because of its high expression in the testes of many animals (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2004a</xref>,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2005a</xref>). In our assay, cells that had reduced mRNA levels of SPATA4 have no change in the length of cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, A and B</xref>); however, fewer cells had a cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Few SPATA4 knockdown cells incorporate EdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), which suggests a cell-cycle arrest. Surprisingly, cells have increased numbers of basal bodies/centrioles that are at least 8 &#x003bc;m apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, D and E</xref>), whereas the control basal bodies are never more than 0.76 &#x000b1; 0.08 &#x003bc;m apart. All of these phenotypes could be rescued by a shRNA-resistant copy of SPATA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, B</xref>&#x02212;F). SPATA4 localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus but did not specifically localize to either the centrioles or cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). This finding is consistent with cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of SPATA4 observed in HEK293T (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Duarte <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Similar to the phenotypes observed after SPATA4 knockdown, depletion of the origin of replication complex 2 leads to S-phase arrest with excess centrioles (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Prasanth <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). To ask whether S-phase arrest always causes cilia and basal body/centriole defects, we looked at the ciliogenesis phenotypes from UPF1 knockdown, a gene known to arrest cells in early in S-phase (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Azzalin and Lingner 2006</xref>). It shows very similar phenotypes to SPATA4. Few cells assemble cilia and few cells uptake EdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, A, B, and E</xref>). The basal bodies/centrioles are also far apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>); however, unlike SPATA4 knockdown, there were normal numbers of basal bodies/centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Thus S-phase arrest does not always lead to overduplication of basal bodies/centrioles (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Azimzadeh <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Loncarek <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Steere <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>).

Many genes required for ciliogenesis are up-regulated, including all 16 IFT Complex B genes, six IFT Complex A genes, three anterograde motor and associated proteins, and four retrograde motor and associated proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.113.006338/-/DC1/TableS4.xlsx">Table S4</ext-link>). All 41 proteins, all 18 radial spoke proteins, and 13 of 15 central pair proteins had their transcripts up-regulated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.113.006338/-/DC1/TableS4.xlsx">Table S4</ext-link>). Additional genes that have been implicated in cilia assembly and function are found in our RNAseq data. These include MORN1 (FAP266) that has been implicated in basal body assembly in Toxoplasma (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Lorestani <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), PIH1D1, which is part of the prefoldin complex and interacting proteins Reptin and Pontin have been implicated in cystic kidney disease in zebrafish (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Sun <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>) and in Chlamydomonas. Tubby is linked to adult onset obesity (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Coleman and Eicher 1990</xref>) and retinal degeneration (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Ohlemiller <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>) in mice and the Tubby like proteins (TULP1-4) are also implicated or directly involved in cilia related processes (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Mukhopadhyay and Jackson 2011</xref>). We find evidence of up-regulation for Chlamydomonas genes with human homologs that were previously predicted to be involved in cilia by comparative genomics studies, but for which there existed neither qRT-PCR nor proteomic evidence. Our data identify human genes with Chlamydomonas homologs that are up-regulated during ciliogenesis. This set includes six genes that have existing evidence of their involvement in cilia or ciliogenesis (KAT, KIF21A, TXNDC3, DYNLT1, TUBB, ACT). There are other genes with existing nonciliopathy disease genes or mutant phenotypes to which our data assign novel cilia annotations, thereby suggesting some cilia involvement in new diseases or mutant phenotypes, including COACH syndrome, Noonan syndrome, cleft lip and palate gene, polycystic ovary syndrome, and perinatal lethality in mice. The largest category in the remainder of the set contains solute carriers/transporters, followed by Golgi/membrane trafficking proteins, chaperonins, and kinases and phosphatases. The remainder of the protein annotation groups includes proteins that are involved in or that are associated with mitochondria, lipid and inositol metabolism, cell cycle, ubiquitin, proteins that act on disulfide bonds, and DNA repair. These results suggest new areas in which there may be cilia involvement and indicate the potential of using Chlamydomonas as a model organism for the study of these diseases and phenotypes.</p><p>We observed the LBR gene to be up-regulated in our dataset. In Chlamydomonas, the LBR homolog is involved in sterol biosynthesis. Sterols play crucial roles in membranes where they regulate membrane permeability and fluidity by interactions with other lipids and proteins. Sterols are frequently enriched in detergent-resistant membranes, which organize molecules involved in specialized signaling processes that include Agg2 and Agg3 in Chlamydomonas. Chlamydomonas synthesizes ergosterol rather than cholesterol as in animal cells. We looked at other genes in the ergosterol pathway to ask if they are up-regulated after deflagellation. This pathway uses the mevalonate-independent 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway to synthesize delta-3-isopentenyl-pyrophosphate as the start of the isoprenoid pathway. Chlamydomonas has homologs of 11 of the 12 genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis in yeast. It may have additional genes that are needed for a sterol C24- methylation-C25-reduction (&#x00394;(25(27))-olefin) step not observed in yeast (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). None of the genes in the mevalonate-independent 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway are up-regulated, whereas 9 of the 11 genes in the IPP pathway are up-regulated more than 2-fold (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.113.006338/-/DC1/TableS5.xlsx">Table S5</ext-link>). These results implicate sterols as being important for ciliogenesis.</p><p>We analyzed the function of four human homologs and found knockdown of all four genes cause ciliogenesis defects in human retinal pigmented epithelial cells, which indicates that up-regulation during ciliogenesis in Chlamydomonas is an excellent way to identify genes that are conserved in ciliogenesis. To our surprise, knockdown of two genes in RPE cells also had profound effects on the cell cycle.</p><p>We expected to find genes that produced cells with few cilia or short cilia. This is a common phenotype seen with other genes with ciliary functions including the IFTs, kinesins and dyneins. As we expected, knockdown of ZMYND10, NXN, and GLOD4 affected cilia formation and showed short cilia. Previous work suggests a wide range of functions for these genes. The expression of ZMYND10 is down-regulated in cancers and may be a tumor suppressor (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Shao <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Its expression pattern in ciliated tissues suggested it may be involved in ciliogenesis (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">McClintock <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>), but our data are the first to demonstrate that it has a role in ciliogenesis and affects cilia length and cell-cycle progression. NXN is a nucleoredoxin that inhibits Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Funato <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) and inhibits planar cell polarity (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Funato <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). Disruption of Wnt signaling may affect cilia so it is possible that ciliary phenotypes seen in NXN knockdown cells are the result of a defect in this pathway. Unlike other Wnt pathway mutants however, NXN also leads to disengagement of the basal bodies/centrioles and may play a novel role or multiple roles in ciliogenesis. GLOD4 contains a glyoxalase domain and thus may function as an enzyme. It was previously shown to be downregulated in a canine model of retinitis pigmentosa (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Genini <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), but we are the first to show a ciliary and cell cycle phenotype after knockdown.</p><p>SPATA4 is up-regulated during spermatogenesis in several organisms (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2004a</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2005a</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2005b</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Xie <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>) although its role in spermatogenesis is not clear. From our data, SPATA4 knockdown had no effect on cilia length, but fewer cells were able to build a cilium. Knockdown of SPATA4 also leads to an arrest of cells in S-phase. Basal bodies must be released from cilia to become centrioles and initiate duplication in S phase. By examining cells that cannot progress through S-phase, we highlight the lack of cilia in S phase cells. It may be that SPATA4 is required for cell cycle progression during spermatogenesis.</p><p>All of our ciliary phenotypes were rescued by shRNA-resistant copies of our genes. The rescue constructs also had C-terminal YFP tags to allow for localization of the proteins. It is surprising that none of our genes localized to the basal bodies or cilia. ZMYND10 had the most distinctive localization of cytoplasmic puncta, which may suggest its involvement in ciliary protein trafficking like has been shown for other proteins (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Follit <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Knodler <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Donaldson and Jackson 2011</xref>). NXN, GLOD4, and SPATA4 did not localize to any distinctive cellular structure. This lack of localization has been shown previously for NXN (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kurooka <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Funato <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) and SPATA4 (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Duarte <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). The shRNA resistant copies of these genes are functional because they rescue the ciliary phenotypes and these genes are clearly involved in ciliogenesis because upon knockdown the cells have fewer cilia and/or short cilia. It is possible that these proteins are found in cilia or basal bodies at a specific part of the cell cycle. It is also possible that they may be cytoplasmic assembly components like DNAAF3 (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mitchison <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). In a recent paper looking at proteomics in primary cilia (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ishikawa <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>), the authors generated GFP and FLAG tagged constructs of 18 of identified hits and found only 8 that localize to primary cilia. The authors interpreted this such that 10 were not <italic>bona fide</italic> ciliary components, but our data suggest that more genes than previously thought that are involved in ciliogenesis, but do not localize to the cilium.</p><p>It has been known for three decades that cilia are generally found on cells that have exited the cell cycle but only more recently has it been appreciated that genes involved in ciliogenesis also have roles in cell-cycle progression. Our data add to the list of known genes involved in ciliogenesis and cell-cycle progression. It is not clear what signals control cilia absorption and reentry of the cell cycle. Cilium absorption requires HEF1, AuroraA, and HDAC6, although these genes appear to function independent of cell-cycle progression (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Pugacheva <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). The interaction between HEF1 and AuroraA activates HDAC6 to deacetylate the acetylated microtubules in the cilium, which causes them to become unstable and allows resorption to occur (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Pugacheva <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). NDE1 and TCTEX-1 are also required for the transition from G<sub>0</sub> to mitosis and their depletion causes cell cycle arrest (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Depletion of NDE1 arrests cells leading to longer cilia (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Furthermore, it was found that cells express low levels of NDE1 in G<sub>0</sub> where it localizes to the mother centriole, but greater levels in mitosis. Overexpression of NDE1 results in shorter cilia, which suggests that NDE1 regulates ciliary length (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Like, NDE1, TCTEX-1, a dynein light chain, is also needed for cell cycle re-entry in a cilia-dependent manner (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) although there is some discrepancy as to whether it also regulates ciliary length (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Palmer <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>).</p><p>Another gene involved in ciliary absorption is the gene <italic>PIFO</italic> that is expressed in the mouse embryonic node (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kinzel <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Two human patients haploinsufficient for <italic>PIFO</italic> show cilia defects, centrosome overduplication, and mitotic defects stemming from uncoupling of cilia resorption and cell cycle progression. The basal body fails to detach from the cilium although centrosome duplication still occurs causing severe mitotic defects including both mitotic spindles and cilia in the same cells (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kinzel <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>PIFO</italic> appears to only be conserved in vertebrates, thus it may not be part of a conserved mechanism for cilia resorption. Our results show SPATA4 has similar phenotypes to <italic>PIFO</italic> mutant cells including centrosome over-duplication and cell-cycle arrest. Because we only examined knockdown phenotypes of genes that were conserved between Chlamydomonas and humans, GLOD4 and SPATA4 may be part of a conserved mechanism of cilia resorption and warrant further study.</p><p>Whole-genome transcriptome analysis gives us insight into entire pathways required for ciliogenesis. The cilia assembly pathway is tightly linked to the cell cycle in mammalian cells as only cells in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> have cilia. Most of the genes we tested have both cilia and cell cycle effects that support the idea that these two cellular processes are intimately involved. Further analysis of additional genes will help to provide more mechanistic understanding the coordination of these pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material">
