Decoding these complexities is essential for understanding human development and tumorigenesis. Here, we tackle this problem by carrying out the first genome-wide RNAi-mediated screens in mice. Focusing on skin development and oncogenic (Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-induced) hyperplasia, our screens uncover novel as well as anticipated regulators of embryonic epidermal growth. Among top oncogenic screen hits are Mllt6 and the Wnt effector &#x003b2;-catenin; they maintain Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-dependent hyperproliferation. We also expose &#x003b2;-catenin as an unanticipated antagonist of normal epidermal growth, functioning through Wnt-independent intercellular adhesion. Finally, we document physiological relevance to mouse and human cancers, thereby establishing the feasibility of <italic>in vivo</italic> mammalian genome-wide investigations to dissect tissue development and tumorigenesis. By documenting some oncogenic growth regulators, we pave the way for future investigations of other hits and raise promise for unearthing new targets for cancer therapies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Genome-wide cellular RNAi screening has advanced the identification of genes involved in oncogenic growth control. To date, however, high throughput screens in mammalian cells have been limited to cultures, which even for the best systems, incompletely model physiological environments. We&#x02019;ve overcome this impediment by devising methods to efficiently and selectively transduce murine epidermis through <italic>in utero</italic> lentiviral targeting of progenitors in E9.5 embryos<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. When coupled with shRNA expression, lentiviral transduction is stably propagated throughout skin epithelium, resulting in RNAi-mediated reductions in target transcript and protein levels. This enables rapid analysis of complex genetic pathways in mammals, something previously only possible in lower eukaryotes<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The correlation between a tissue&#x02019;s growth and turnover rates and its susceptibility to cancer makes embryonic epidermis an attractive model for exploring how rapidly growing tissues balance proliferation and differentiation, and what prevents them from doing so in tumor progression. Given the efficacy of our system to single gene studies, we&#x02019;ve now expanded this scale by &#x0003e;four orders of magnitude to conduct genome-wide RNAi screens. Our objectives were to first, demonstrate the feasibility of such screens in mammals; second, identify epidermal growth regulators in their native, physiological environment; third uncover how epidermal growth control changes when it is propelled by a well-known oncogene; and fourth, demonstrate the implications of our findings for tumor progression in mice and humans.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Epidermal growth is rapid and uniform</title><p id="P4">Following completion of gastrulation and continuing to birth, mouse surface ectoderm commences rapid growth to match embryo expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Beginning as a monolayer, E9.5 ectoderm differentiates into a stratified, multi-layered epidermis that by birth constitutes a barrier that retains fluids and excludes microbes. Mature epidermis maintains an inner progenitor layer, which fuels tissue homeostasis and wound repair.</p><p id="P5">To quantify epidermal growth, we randomly marked single cells at clonal density by infecting E9.5 Rosa26<sup>lox-stop-lox-yfp</sup> Cre-reporter embryos (<italic>r26<sup>yfp/+</sup></italic>)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> with an LV-Cre lentivirus<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, and then monitored their expansion during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). By E18.5, single YFP<sup>+</sup> cells at E10.5 had grown to clones constituting ~40 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>; ~5-6 divisions/cell). Variability in clone size ranged within 1-2 cell divisions, indicating strikingly uniform growth throughout the epidermis.</p><p id="P6">We next examined how growth is affected by oncogenic <italic>Hras1</italic>, found mutated in many cancers and the primary target in skin carcinogenesis models<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. <italic>K14</italic>-Cre<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> driven, epidermal-specific expression of G12V-Hras from its endogenous locus (Hras<sup>Lox-WT-STOP-Lox-G12V</sup>)<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> resulted in mice whose skin displayed epidermal overgrowth as well as oncogenic Hras dose-dependency for one (<italic>K14-Cre; Hras<sup>LSL-G12V/+</sup></italic>; Hras<sup>oncoX1</sup>) or two copies (<italic>K14-Cre; Hras<sup>LSL-G12V/LSL-G12V</sup></italic>; Hras<sup>oncoX2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Additional distinctions included expansion of both progenitors (keratin 5+) and differentiating layers (spinous, keratin 10+; granular, filaggrin+) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figs. 1-3</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To quantify the impact of oncogenic Hras on epidermal growth, we used a Cellular Growth Index (CGI) assay<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Cre-reporter (<italic>r26<sup>yfp/+</sup></italic>) embryos, transduced with LV-Cre and RFP-expressing lentivirus (LV-RFP) mix showed similar relative numbers of YFP<sup>+</sup> to RFP<sup>+</sup> keratinocytes across several embryos, indicating that control YFP<sup>+</sup> and RFP<sup>+</sup> populations grew at comparable rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). Transduction of the same lentiviral mixture into test animals (where Cre-transduction induces Hras<sup>G12V</sup>) revealed consistently more YFP<sup>+</sup> (Hras<sup>G12V</sup>) than RFP<sup>+</sup> (control) cells (CGIs=1.82, one copy; 3.32, two copies Hras<sup>G12V</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1e,f</xref>). These findings demonstrate that Hras<sup>G12V</sup> confers a dose-dependent growth advantage to skin epidermis and that growth rates can be documented and quantified.</p><p id="P8">Hras<sup>G12V</sup> not only conferred a dose-dependent increase in proliferation, but also in suppression of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Additionally, consistent with established pro-inflammatory effects of Hras<sup>G12V</sup>, innate and adaptive immune cells infiltrated underlying dermis. Lastly, real-time PCR revealed no evidence for oncogenic induction of cellular senescence-associated CDK inhibitors<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Establishing pooled screen parameters</title><p id="P9">Based upon the principle of our CGI assay, we expected that following epidermal transduction with a pool of shRNA-expressing lentivirus, any shRNA that targets an essential mediator of growth will be reduced or lost during development, while shRNAs targeting negative growth regulators will become overrepresented. By comparing relative shRNA abundance in the initial pool and at E18.5, we expected to identify shRNAs and their targets that confer either growth advantage or disadvantage.</p><p id="P10">The success of the approach depended upon our ability to: a) modify growth at a low Multiplicity of Infection (MOI &#x02264; 1), b) measure individual shRNA abundance in the pool, c) transduce embryonic epidermis at an MOI &#x02264; 1, and d) achieve complete screen coverage, where every shRNA in the pool is tested. We set up a series of controls to ensure that these parameters are met. Underscoring the feasibility of pooled-formats for <italic>in vivo</italic> RNAi screens, we demonstrated that targeting of a) anaphase promoting complex component <italic>Anapc5</italic> during normal growth, and b) <italic>Hras1</italic> during oncogenic hyperplasia, significantly reduced average clone sizes, even with transductions where most cells harbored only a single shRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To quantify individual shRNA representation in a complex pool, we used the Illumina-based count-by-sequencing principle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). We designed oligonucleotides to amplify the target sequence of each shRNA, and optimized pre-amplification and clean-up pipelines to yield a product to apply directly to the sequencing cell. We tested our protocol against a defined template generated by combining genomic DNAs from independently transduced cell lines, so that individual genome-integrated shRNAs were present in amounts corresponding from a single cell (6pg) up to 2,048 cells (12.3ng).</p><p id="P12">We amplified and sequenced this standard set, and showed that reactions were: a) quantitative, with increased sequencing reads corresponding to shRNA abundance in the pool, b) sensitive, detecting all three single-copy shRNAs, and c) highly reproducible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Independent counts of the standard set showed identical sequencing bias for a given shRNA, and thus became neutralized in relative comparisons of absolute counts, especially with &#x02265;32 copies of the shRNA. Indeed, a &#x0003e;30-fold screen coverage proved sufficient to sample all shRNAs in our pool (see below). At this level, growth-neutral shRNAs were &#x0003e;1,000-fold represented in the E18.5 sequencing quantification reaction, since each E9.5 epidermal cell generates ~40 cells by E18.5.</p><p id="P13">We next determined that at an infection level of 13-27%, most transduced epidermal keratinocytes carried a single lentivirus (MOI&#x02264;1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). To ensure that at least 30 individual cells were infected with each shRNA at E9.5, a pool of ~78,000 shRNAs required ~10<sup>6</sup> cells to be targeted. We used high-resolution imaging of TOPRO3-labeled embryos and established that at E9.5, surface ectoderm contained &#x02265;120,000 cells/embryo. Together, this suggested that transducing &#x02265;90 embryos would achieve the requisite coverage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Screens identify known growth regulators</title><p id="P14">We pooled the genome-wide collection of murine shRNA lentiviruses in roughly equal concentrations<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, and profiled the starting composition of the pool (t=0), in transduced primary mouse keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Physiological screens were performed in control and Hras<sup>oncoX2</sup> embryos transduced at E9.5 <italic>in utero</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Epidermal cells were collected after 24hrs (initial pool) and 9d of development, and integrated lentiviral hairpins from genomic DNAs were sequenced and quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Our pre-amplification and sequencing reactions did not bias shRNA quantification, and Illumina sequencing reads were of high quality. They mapped to the shRNA library with predictable efficiency and indicated complete coverage of the pool (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 9,10</xref>). Significantly altered shRNAs were identified and ranked based on two independent methods. To ensure reproducibility, we used DESeq statistical package<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, which accounted for biological variability among our replicates (sets of 30 embryos/condition) and is the best method to identify candidates per se (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d-k</xref>). However, informative yet variable shRNAs can be excluded by the high stringency of DESeq, which reduces the ability to control for off-target effects by requiring that multiple shRNAs show consistent behavior. We therefore also analyzed pooled data sets (90 embryos/condition; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>) using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, which reduces variability by averaging individual shRNA abundance. By maximizing screen coverage, this method produces a more inclusive list of significantly altered shRNAs, and hence was preferred for ranking candidates identified by DESeq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f,j,k</xref>). Importantly, the overlap between these approaches was extensive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>), underscoring the robustness of our data.</p><p id="P16">We identified ~1,800 genes as essential for normal growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1,2</xref>), and were significantly enriched for function in protein synthesis (<italic>P</italic>=3.1E-10) and gene expression (<italic>P</italic>=2.6E-10). Genes encoding 60S and 40S ribosomal proteins were also highly represented and among the top 10% of all hits for normal growth, underscoring our screen&#x02019;s power to identify regulators of normal growth/viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). Indeed our top 10 candidates for regulators of normal growth featured six ribosomal genes and two genes essential for mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j</xref>).</p><p id="P17">In our screen for specific regulators of Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-dependent oncogenic growth, ~160 genes surfaced as candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3,4</xref>). They diverged in identity and function from those implicated in normal growth regulation, as most housekeeping growth regulators were eliminated by pair-wise comparison of control and Hras<sup>oncoX2</sup> shRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). The oncogene-specific regulators included Hras1, and downstream Ras pathway members Raf1, MEKs, and Akts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>). Equally notable was the absence of upstream oncogenic Ras regulators, e.g. guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which are not expected to arise in a screen for hairpins suppressing Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-induced growth. Our top 10 hits for regulators of oncogenic growth included well-established Ras pathway members <italic>Akt3</italic> and <italic>Raf1</italic>, as well as the Ras-regulated <italic>Pawr</italic><sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2k</xref>). Cyclin C (<italic>Ccnc</italic>), a putative regulator of hematopoietic stem cell quiescence<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> was also on this list, as was <italic>Mllt6</italic>, encoding an MLL translocation partner in acute leukemia and a component of an epigenetic modifier complex<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">The very top candidate for preferential regulation of oncogenic growth was <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>, encoding the Wnt signaling and intercellular adhesion effector &#x003b2;-catenin. At first glance, &#x003b2;-catenin seemed obvious, as its over-activation has been implicated in a variety of cancers, including those of skin<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. However, &#x003b2;-catenin is also thought to be essential for stem cells<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Hence, it was surprising that its hairpins surfaced in a screen for <italic>selective inhibitors</italic> of oncogenic and not normal growth. Even more paradoxical was that in our parallel genome-wide screen, <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> was the top candidate for negative regulation of normal epidermal growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1,2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Validating oncogene-specific regulators</title><p id="P19">We chose <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> and <italic>Mllt6</italic> for further study. For both <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> and <italic>Mllt6</italic>, a direct correlation was observed between transcript knockdown <italic>in vitro</italic> and severity of growth defects <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>), strongly arguing against off-target effects. We validated our candidates as oncogenic growth regulators with a modified <italic>in vivo</italic> CGI assay involving two lentiviral vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In one, Cre-recombinase fused to monomeric RFP (LV-Cre::mRFP) contained a scrambled shRNA control. In the other vector, untagged Cre was used; this vector encoded the test shRNA against the candidate. Transduction of E9.5 control or Hras<sup>oncoX2</sup> Cre-reporter embryos marked two separate populations: RFP<sup>+</sup>YFP<sup>+</sup> cells represented the baseline rate of normal (in control) or oncogenic growth (in Hras<sup>oncoX2</sup>); YFP<sup>+</sup> cells represented the rate of growth that occurs when the target transcript is depleted.</p><p id="P20">The ratios of YFP<sup>+</sup> cells normalized to YFP<sup>+</sup>RFP<sup>+</sup> cells in Hras<sup>oncoX2</sup> and control animals revealed that two independent <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> shRNAs displayed reductions of ~2-4-fold in oncogenic relative to normal growth. Similar ~two-fold reductions in YFP<sup>+</sup> cells were observed in the Hras<sup>oncoX2</sup> background when <italic>Mllt6</italic> transcripts were diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The physiological effects of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> or <italic>Mllt6</italic> knockdown were profound: the neonatal oncogenic phenotype was significantly ameliorated, and epidermal proliferation in Hras<sup>oncoX2</sup> embryos was markedly and reproducibly suppressed. By contrast, no significant effects were seen on apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Equally interesting to the selective effects of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> knockdown on suppressing Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-dependent oncogenic growth were its positive effects on normal growth. These differences appeared physiologically significant, as they were reflected at the level of EdU-incorporation and thickness of epidermal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). Although hitherto overlooked, the proliferative effects of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> hairpins on normal epidermis are recapitulated upon conditional targeting of &#x003b2;-catenin<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">&#x003b2;-Catenin is both an adherens junction component and a nuclear cofactor for Wnt-regulators LEF/TCF and other DNA binding proteins<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. However in contrast to its nuclear functions, &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02019;s role in adhesion has been assumed to be redundant with plakoglobin<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Given that intercellular defects can promote proliferation, we revisited this issue using a sensitive <italic>in vitro</italic> adhesion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d-f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Despite plakoglobin upregulation, <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>-null keratinocytes inefficiently formed cell-cell adhesions upon calcium induction. Moreover, the Wnt inhibitor XAV939<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> failed to phenocopy these defects. Finally, consistent with the view that loss of &#x003b2;-catenin compromises contact-inhibition and leads to cellular overgrowth, <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>-null cells were hyperproliferative and formed overgrown foci upon reaching confluence.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Oncogenic growth and Wnt signaling</title><p id="P23">Although intercellular adhesion is often viewed as tumor-suppressive, Wnt signaling is often associated with oncogenic growth.

Illumina reads were trimmed to the 21 nt hairpin sequence using the FASTX-Toolkit and aligned to the TRC 2.x library with BWA (v 0.6.2)<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> using a maximum edit distance of 3. Putative growth regulators were identified by combining two methodologies. First, Illumina reads from 3 sets of 30 embryos were treated as independent biological replicates in the DESeq R package<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Dispersions (variability) for each hairpin were estimated using a local fit to the data for each genotype, and hairpins with a p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 by the negative binomial test were considered for downstream analysis. Second, an analysis was carried out on a pooled data set in which the reads from 3 sets of embryos were combined to maximize screen coverage and average biological variability. Although this precludes estimation of within-group variability, it has the effect of reducing noise for poorly counted hairpins when operating close to the minimum required screen coverage. Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was applied on a per-hairpin basis using combined reads by assembling a 2&#x000d7;2 contingency table<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. The columns of the table are the treatment conditions (e.g. control and Hras<sup>oncoX2</sup>), and the rows correspond to the sequencing counts for a given hairpin in the first, and the counts for all other hairpins in the pool in the second. The test thus calculates the probability of observing a difference in hairpin representation relative to the expected representation in the pool. We further adjust the p-value for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Hairpins with a p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 were considered for further analysis. A gene was considered significantly enriched or depleted if at least 2 hairpins exhibited a 2-fold or greater change in normalized reads with a significant p-value, and no hairpins in the set exhibited a change of equal magnitude in the opposite direction. Hits common to both analyses were ranked by number of significant hairpins and the magnitude of their effect.

When operating close to the minimum required screen coverage or when it is not feasible to perform many independent replicates, this strategy can be advantageous to increase coverage and reduce noise if combined with additional stringent criteria (i.e. requiring a gene to be targeted by multiple hairpins) and validation.</p><p id="P45">Because this methodology does not explicitly account for sample-to-sample variability (instead maximizing coverage and averaging out variability), we independently analyzed our data using two additional statistical methodologies that directly address variability within biological replicates. Importantly, both of these methods employed the same stringent set of thresholds (2-fold change in hairpin count, and a requirement for least 2 hairpins to show a significant effect in same direction, and none in the opposite). First, we utilized DESeq<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, an R package designed for the analysis of Illumina sequencing-based assays, which estimates and accounts for biological variability in a statistical test based on the negative binomial distribution. Second, we treated independently sequenced sets of 30 embryos as biological replicates, and generated replicate-specific lists of candidate genes. Comparison of hits shared between these replicates to the hits identified in our analysis of pooled samples yielded a highly conserved set of candidate genes consistent with strong reproducibility of our data. Both analyses identify a list of candidates that substantially overlaps with those identified by our pooling and ranking scheme, with nearly all of our top hits identified regardless of the methodology.</p><p id="P46">When conducting shRNA drop-out screens, perhaps the most important criteria in identifying potential candidates is that a gene be targeted by multiple, independent hairpins to avoid off-target effects. We thus felt our data would be best-served by combining an analysis of pooled data, which tends to be more inclusive at the level of hairpins and enables ranking by number of independent hairpins, and the results of DESeq, which ensures reproducibility of hits.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>RNAseq and IPA network analyses</title><p id="P47">Epidermal progenitors were FACS sorted into TrizolLS (Invitrogen) and RNA was purified using Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research) per manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.
