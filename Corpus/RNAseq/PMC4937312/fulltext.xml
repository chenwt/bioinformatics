Here, we describe a mechanism which involves both aspects: truncated transgenes, which fail to produce intact mRNA, induce siRNA accumulation and silencing of homologous loci <italic>in trans</italic> in the ciliate <italic>Paramecium</italic>. We show that silencing is achieved by co-transcriptional silencing, associated with repressive histone marks at the endogenous gene. This is accompanied by secondary siRNA accumulation, strictly limited to the open reading frame of the remote locus. Our data shows that in this mechanism, heterochromatic marks depend on a variety of RNAi components. These include RDR3 and PTIWI14 as well as a second set of components, which are also involved in post-transcriptional silencing: RDR2, PTIWI13, DCR1 and CID2. Our data indicates differential processing of nascent un-spliced and long, spliced transcripts thus suggesting a hitherto-unrecognized functional interaction between post-transcriptional and co-transcriptional RNAi. Both sets of RNAi components are required for efficient <italic>trans</italic>-acting RNAi at the chromatin level and our data indicates similar mechanisms contributing to genome wide regulation of gene expression by epigenetic mechanisms.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>08 July 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA interference has been described to be an important epigenetic regulator in almost all eukaryotes. This includes post-transcriptional inactivation by mRNA cleavage or inhibition of translation. Moreover, newest insights describe a highly dynamic cross-talk between transcription, siRNA accumulation, and histone modifications: small RNAs guide heterochromatin formation by recruitment of the histone modifying machinery (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Three core components are described for RNAi in plants, animals, fungi and protists (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>): RDR, Dicer and Argonaute. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) derive from double stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors which are generated by bidirectional transcription or by the activity of a RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RDR), converting single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) into dsRNA. The endonuclease Dicer or Dicer-like (Dcl) is required to cleave siRNAs of 20&#x02013;24nt from dsRNA precursors. These are then bound by proteins of the Argonaute family: siRNAs guide Argonautes to their target in a homology-dependent manner, thus inducing silencing by RNA cleavage (post-transcriptional gene silencing, PTGS) or by recruitment of chromatin modifying components an individual locus (transcriptional gene silencing, TGS). Argonautes divide in the Ago clade which was mainly described to act on miRNAs and siRNAs whereas the Piwi clade appears to be expressed mainly in germline cells interacting with Piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Especially research in <italic>S. pombe</italic> led to our current view of transcriptional silencing: siRNAs guide enzyme complexes to nascent transcripts to establish repressive chromatin marks. Thus, RNAi-induced heterochromatin formation requires active transcription (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In this mechanism of co-transcriptional silencing (CTGS), <italic>cis</italic>-acting siRNAs are produced from the silenced locus itself.</p><p>Another class of small RNAs, piRNAs, were described to act in epigenetic silencing of transposable elements in the germline or germline related cells. The biosynthesis mechanism distinguishes piRNAs from siRNAs as the former are amplified in a Dicer-independent manner in the ping-pong cycle (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, recent evidence suggests that piRNAs also have siRNA-like functions because of (i) reports for piRNA-mediated silencing of mRNA producing loci in somatic tissues (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and (ii) several studies revealing that piRNAs can trigger transcriptional silencing comparable to CTGS rather than pure PTGS: piRNAs direct Piwi to nascent transcripts, thus recruiting histone methyltransferases to silence transposons (reviewed in ref. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)).</p><p>In almost all studied organisms, introduction of constructs producing dsRNA or hairpin RNA induces siRNAs or miRNAs, which silence gene expression of homologous endogenous genes. Introduction of hairpin RNA was also shown to induce efficient TGS in plants (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, <italic>trans-</italic>acting siRNAs that mediate TGS in <italic>S.pombe</italic> occur in few cases only: (i) if the target gene position is close to heterochromatic loci, (ii) in knockouts of the exoribonuclease <italic>ERI1</italic>, (iii) or in <italic>HP1</italic> (<italic>Swi6</italic>) over-expression lines at targets showing antisense transcription (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). As the classical system in which CTGS was discovered and subsequently characterized are the centromeric repeats in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, only few studies spent attention to CTGS regulation of protein coding genes (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), such as the regulation of stress response genes (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Interestingly, interaction of RNAi and the exosome has also been shown to control heterochromatin formation at genomic domains of genes and retrotransposons (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). We therefore just started to discover the extent of RNAi induced heterochromatin formation as well as to understand which endogenous trigger mechanisms interact with the RNAi machinery.</p><p>Ciliates are unicellular organisms with an equidistant phylogenetic relationship to the kingdoms of plants, animals and fungi. Although being unicellular, they evolved differentiation between germline and soma by presence of generative Micronuclei (Mic) and a somatic Macronucleus (Mac) in a single cell. A developmental-specific RNAi pathway has been described in <italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> which produces scnRNAs during meiosis, controlling the DNA content of F1 progeny by RNA-induced DNA eliminations (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Apart from the germline-specific scnRNA pathway, also vegetative RNAi has been extensively studied in <italic>Paramecium</italic> by PTGS, induced by feeding of dsRNA producing bacteria involving siRNAs (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In <italic>Paramecium</italic>, recent studies demonstrate another RNAi pathway involving the highly divergent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RDR3 to control endogenous gene expression, suggestive of transcriptional control (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Further, RNAseq analyses suggest that such epigenetic mechanisms contribute to transcriptional robustness of the transcriptomic landscape in <italic>P. tetraurelia</italic>, thus raising the question about the extent and the molecular details of this mechanism (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>It was therefore the aim of this study to uncover the molecular characteristics of <italic>trans</italic> silencing in <italic>P. tetraurelia</italic>. RNAi against endogenous genes can be triggered by introduction of truncated transgenes (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). We have previously shown that transgene-induced silencing depends on RDR3 (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Analysis of further genetic requirements suggests that this pathway is distinct to post-transcriptional silencing, although individual RNAi components are shared by both pathways (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, it remains unclear why and how truncated transgenes trigger RNAi. Here, we show that transgene induced silencing works at the chromatin level and is triggered by a variety of transgene derived siRNAs with complex genetic requirements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cell culture &#x00026; RNAi by feeding</title><p><italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic> strain 51 was grown in wheat grass powder (WGP, Pines International Co., Lawrence, KS) infusion medium bacterized with <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> supplemented with 0.8 &#x003bc;g/ml &#x003b2;-sitosterol, unless otherwise stated.

Sequencing statistics and read count of Mac mapping reads can be found in Supplementary Figure S8. We are not aware about normalization methods specialized for small RNA-seq data sets. However, many methods have been proposed to normalize mRNA-seq data. There are two prevalent classes of mRNA-seq normalization methods, (i) total count scaling (TCS) methods and (ii) methods that analyze the median log fold change, or a similar quantity, among all genes between mRNA-seq experiments (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The latter methods assume that gene annotation is available and that most of the genes between samples are not differentially expressed. As little is known about the location, size, and expression variability of endogenous small RNA loci in <italic>P. tetraurelia</italic>, this second class of methods was not applicable.</p><p>Therefore we used a variant of TCS as introduced for mRNA-seq data (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), which normalizes by scaling through a factor that estimates the difference in the number of reads mapped between samples. However, the disadvantage of TCS methods is that the used normalization factors were shown to be biased by highly expressed genes in the dataset, because this kind of normalization ignores the fact that the repertoire of expressed RNAs may change between conditions (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). This effect is exacerbated in our knockdown samples compared to wild type samples, because large amounts of siRNAs against the knockdown gene are introduced into the cells. These primary siRNAs are known to trigger the production of other, secondary siRNAs, against the knockdown gene, all of which we are sequencing. Therefore, we removed from the estimated total library size, all small RNA reads that mapped against the knockdown gene(s), this quantity is denoted <italic>K</italic> below. Further, we removed small RNAs from highly abundant structural RNAs that are known to produce small RNAs, e.g. ribosomal RNAs, which are mostly RNA degradation products. In addition, other small RNAs that may have been introduced due to feeding cultures are removed, leaving only small RNA reads mapping to the rest of the <italic>Paramecium</italic> genome, this quantity is denoted <italic>T</italic> below.</p><p>In detail, assume read count <italic>R</italic> for a region of interest that we want to compare between samples.

We subsequently analysed splice efficiency by counting reads mapping to intron and exon/exon junctions (Supplementary Table S1) revealed only a slight difference of the proportion of spliced transcripts for the five sense introns between the native endogenous gene (average of 90%), the poly-A enriched (78.6%) and in the non-polyA enriched (70%) pTI-/- data sets. Thus, un-spliced transcripts accumulate in the presence of the transgene. As the vast majority of the detected derives from the transgene and not from the endogenous gene (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), we conclude that the transgene RNA shows a lower splice frequency compared to the endogenous gene.

However, sequencing of long RNA yielded only few antisense reads. We did not find any long antisense RNAs showing sense exon/exon junctions which would indicate RDR activity on spliced sense RNAs. However, we found two antisense introns in antisense reads. As these reads also contain the transgene junction, they need to derive from the transgene and not from the endogenous locus. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> shows a schematic representation of an antisense read which contains sense intron no. 2 but shows splicing of an antisense intron with the typical <italic>Paramecium</italic> intron boundaries. Splicing of these antisense introns was verified by Sanger sequencing of strand-specific RT-PCRs (Supplementary Figure S2). Thus, splicing of antisense- but not sense introns in antisense RNAs clearly demonstrates bidirectional transcription at the transgene locus.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-4"><title>Transgene-siRNAs trigger 5&#x02032;-monophosporylated secondary siRNAs</title><p>To analyse siRNAs of the transgene, deep sequencing of small RNA was carried out and reads were mapped to the endogenous <italic>ND169</italic> locus. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, small RNA reads are combined with the coverage of reads deriving from non-polyA enriched/ribo-depleted long RNAseq. The Figure shows that <italic>ND169</italic> mapping siRNAs were predominantly antisense in almost the entire transgene region (NDgene), except for the ultimate 5&#x02032;- region (ND-5&#x02032;). The region between the transcription start site and the first intron showed a clear sense bias, suggesting that siRNAs at the 5&#x02032;-end have distinct accumulation criteria.</p><p>Interestingly, siRNAs were also apparent in regions of the endogenous <italic>ND169</italic>, which are not part of the transgene (ND-1 and ND-2), thus demonstrating that siRNA production and transitivity occurs at the remote locus. In the following, we refer to these siRNAs as secondary siRNAs. For the subsequent analyses we had to consider that reads mapping to the transgene represent a mix of primary (1&#x000b0;) and secondary endo <italic>ND169</italic> (2&#x000b0;) siRNAs. The coverage of 2&#x000b0; siRNAs was drastically lower compared to the transgene sequence (&#x0223c;5% in ND-1, &#x0223c;1% in ND-2), thus we conclude that the majority of transgene-mapping siRNAs represent 1&#x000b0; siRNAs. The read length distribution showed all siRNAs to be predominantly 23nt (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), which was also the major length of small RNAs reported in PTGS induced by dsRNA feeding in <italic>Paramecium</italic> (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p>A closer look at the 2&#x000b0; siRNA coverage revealed that the ND-1 region adjacent to the 5&#x02032;-end accumulated more siRNAs than the ND-2 region located at the 3&#x02032;-end. This unequal distribution of 2&#x000b0; siRNAs is different in PTGS in <italic>Paramecium</italic> showing an even coverage of 2&#x000b0; siRNAs along the mRNA (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). However, at this point, we cannot exclude that different mechanisms trigger 2&#x000b0; siRNAs. 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-transitivity could trigger 2&#x000b0; siRNAs in the ND-1 region. Contrarily, in the ND-2 region only 3&#x02032;-transitivity occurs, because no 1&#x000b0; siRNA can target downstream of the ND-2 region (see below).</p><p>To ensure that we do not miss a large number of small RNAs due to the 5&#x02032;-monophosphate specific cloning procedure and thus to exclude that another small RNA species such as 5&#x02032;-triphosphorylated RDR products exist, we treated transgene RNA samples with pyrophosphatase and prepared libraries containing both, 5&#x02032;-mono- and potential di- and tri-phosphorylated siRNAs (Supplementary Figure S4). Pyrophosphatase treatment did not alter the predominant length of sequenced RNAs of 23nt, nor the ratio between 1&#x000b0; and 2&#x000b0; siRNAs (Supplementary Figure S4B). We previously demonstrated that NDgene mapping siRNAs are 5&#x02032;-monophosphorylated using northern blots (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Therefore, we conclude, that 2&#x000b0; siRNAs (of ND-1 and ND-2 regions) are predominantly monophosphorylated. This indicates that a Dicer or a putative phosphatase is involved 2&#x000b0; siRNA biogenesis and that these are no direct and unprocessed <italic>de novo</italic> initiated RDR products. The normalized read count of siRNAs after phosphatase treatment is slightly lower compared to untreated samples (Supplementary Figure S4B).This is likely due to normalization: if more small RNAs map to the <italic>Paramecium</italic> genome after phosphatase treatment, the relative number maps to the transgene becomes smaller. Vice versa, this indicates that other small RNA species exist in <italic>Paramecium</italic>. Whereas we show here that the occurrence of 2&#x000b0; siRNAs is a result of a high copy transgene in the pTI-/- line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), we can demonstrate that 2&#x000b0; siRNA accumulation is not due to over-expression of the transgene. In Supplementary Figure S5 we show siRNA quantifications of pTI-/- lines injected with different copy numbers. Even in a line harbouring a transgene copy number of only &#x0223c;2-fold higher than that of the endogenous gene, 2&#x000b0; siRNAs could be detected. In all analysed transgenic lines, the amount of 2&#x000b0; siRNAs is &#x0223c;2-5% of the 1&#x000b0; siRNA abundance independent of the transgene copy number (Supplementary Figure S5F). We can conclude that 2&#x000b0; siRNA accumulation is a direct function of 1&#x000b0; siRNA abundance and the occurrence of 2&#x000b0; siRNAs in the low copy number transgenic line (pTI-/-1) indicates that this kind of transitivity can also be triggered by endogenous defective genes such as pseudogenes.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>Genetic requirements of 1&#x000b0; and 2&#x000b0; siRNAs</title><p>A series of RNAi components have been described in previous studies to be involved in transgene-induced silencing by phenotypic analysis. These components include RDR3, the Piwi ohnologs PTIWI08 and PTIWI14, and a set of RNAi components which are also involved in PTGS: RDR2, CID2, DCR1 and PTIWI13 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This raises the question why two sets of RDRs and Piwis should be necessary for efficient silencing. RDR2 is a canonical and essential RDR which does not show phenotypes in pTI- transgene lines but only those showing moderate silencing (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and, in our study, in all pTI-/- transformed clones.</p><p>To see whether the involvement of the two sets of RNAi components is due to different genetic requirements of 1&#x000b0; and 2&#x000b0; siRNAs, we induced knockdown of all individual RNAi components and quantified siRNAs of the defined <italic>ND169</italic> regions by deep sequencing. As the importance of PTIWI08 in transgene-induced silencing could not be clearly distinguished from that of its highly similar ohnolog PTIWI14 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), we induced double knockdowns to ensure proper silencing of both genes. However, northern blot analyses indicated that PTIWI08 contributes only to a minor degree to siRNA accumulation during vegetative growth (Supplementary Figure S6C).</p><p>All knockdown experiments were carried out in biological replicates with different transgenic lines using RNAi by dsRNA-feeding against the different components. To guarantee for comparable transgene copy numbers, the different transgenic lines were chosen by fluorescence analysis of GFP which we found to correlate with transgene copy number as well with the phenotype (Supplementary Figure S5). Two samples per RNAi component were chosen from different transgene lines for RNA analysis.

As mentioned above, these lines show a weaker reduction of transgene siRNAs compared to the first series (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The weaker effect can be explained for most lines (except <italic>RDR3</italic> and <italic>PTIWI08/14</italic>), as the decrease of transgene siRNAs correlates with the number of dsRNA-feeding associated siRNAs, representing the feeding efficiency and thus the knockdown efficiency of the RNAi component (Supplementary Figure S6A/B). It seems tempting to speculate here that RNAi against <italic>RDR3</italic> and <italic>PTIWI08/14</italic> (which our data suggest to be associated in CTGS as discussed below) may involve a self enforcing loop of RNAi stabilization. The reduction of transgene-induced silencing would then not solely represent the function of <italic>RDR3</italic> and <italic>PTIWI08/14</italic> silencing efficiency.</p><p>Consequently, this indicates that all RNAi components are involved in 1&#x000b0; siRNA accumulation and we can exclude that a subset is exclusively necessary for 2&#x000b0; siRNAs. In our data, the interpretation of 2&#x000b0; siRNA fold changes appears difficult, as additional to the knockdown of RNAi components also the abundance of 1&#x000b0; siRNAs greatly affects 2&#x000b0; siRNA synthesis, as mentioned above. Although tempting, we cannot attribute any RNAi component to be additionally involved in 2&#x000b0; siRNA accumulation by their stronger effect on 2&#x000b0; siRNAs. However, the data shows that both regions specific for 2&#x000b0; siRNAs do not react in the same manner/uniformly to the knockdown. In both replicate series, ND-1 shows for instance less sensitivity to <italic>DCR1</italic> silencing compared to ND-2, otherwise the ND-2 region shows the greatest fold change in <italic>RDR2</italic> knockdown lines. Therefore, the data indicates different behaviour of 2&#x000b0; siRNAs in the 5&#x02032;- and the 3&#x02032; -region, thus suggesting different accumulation pathways.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-6"><title>Two classes of 1&#x000b0; siRNAs?</title><p>Analysing the strand orientation of 1&#x000b0; siRNAs, we found that only <italic>RDR2</italic> and <italic>CID2</italic> knockdown lines altered the strict antisense ratio of 1&#x000b0; siRNAs (shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). This raises the question why this effect cannot be seen in all knockdown lines with sufficient reduction of siRNAs. As we described above that the ultimate 5&#x02032;-region of the transgene shows a sense- rather than an antisense bias, we already hypothesized that the transgene derived 1&#x000b0; siRNAs may have more than one accumulation pathway. To uncover potential differences in the bulk of 1&#x000b0; siRNAs, we focused on intron- and exon/exon junction-mapping siRNAs. Our analysis of long RNAs did not indicate accumulation of RDR-derived precursors, as very few antisense transcripts with spliced sense introns were detected. In small RNA data however, a large number of antisense siRNAs mapping to sense exon-exon junctions were detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). This clearly demonstrates that RDR activity on a sense template strand occurs. These long precursors appear to become very rapidly and quantitatively diced into siRNAs thus explaining why we cannot find long as RNAs. As <italic>RDR2</italic> and <italic>CID2</italic> knockdown lines showed a loss of the strong antisense bias of these siRNAs (arrowheads in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>), these components appear to be the prime candidates for synthesis of antisense siRNA from long, spliced sense RNA templates in agreement with the conclusions for RDR2 and CID2 in PTGS associated transitivity (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p>Comparing intron and junction mapping reads, a mirror image becomes apparent: junctions showed a higher coverage at the 3&#x02032;-end of the <italic>ND169</italic> gene, whereas introns showed higher and constantly decreasing coverage from the 5&#x02032;- to the 3&#x02032;-end. Especially junction nos. 1 and 2 showed very weak coverage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Interestingly, intron mapping reads did not show a clear antisense bias in all analysed cultures which therefore distinguishes them from the total bulk of antisense 1&#x000b0; siRNAs. Contrarily, junction mapping reads showed the clear antisense bias and again here, only silencing of <italic>RDR2</italic> and <italic>CID2</italic> altered the antisense ratio of these junction mapping reads (arrowheads in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>) indicating that these two components are indeed responsible for antisense siRNA accumulation from spliced sense RNAs. Therefore, the general distribution and antisense bias of intron and junction mapping siRNAs and their different behaviour upon <italic>RDR2</italic> and CID2 silencing suggests differential processing of two classes of long RNA transcripts. Full length and spliced transcripts are processed by the RDR2/CID2 into predominantly antisense siRNAs and un-spliced 5&#x02032;-nascent transcripts are processed differently, presumably by RDR3.</p><p>Thus, transgene siRNA accumulation appears to depend on two different sets of RNAi components, showing preferences for different RNA-templates.

For this, we eliminated a third region of <italic>ND169</italic> and replaced it with an exogenous sequence (a fragment of the yeast K28 toxin gene).

Now, we can rule out that the decreasing coverage could be due to different targeting mechanisms as mentioned above: both, the ND-1 and ND-3 region, can theoretically be targeted by 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-transitivity and thus should be targeted to similar extent by 1&#x000b0; siRNAs.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref> moreover indicates strong reduction of 2&#x000b0; siRNAs in all knockdown lines.

This specific effect of <italic>RDR2</italic> (as well as <italic>PTIWI13</italic>, which is also involved in PTGS by dsRNA-feeding) on the ND-2 region but not on the ND-1 and ND-3 region let us again hypothesize that RDR2 together with PTIWI13 have a specific role in 3&#x02032;-transitivity. Although this effect was not obvious in the pTI-/- lines, silencing of both components showed the strongest reduction in the ND-2 region in all samples, together with CID2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). It seems conceivable that the less efficient silencing of the pTI-/-K28 construct allows for stronger accumulation of full-length mRNAs from the <italic>ND169</italic> locus that are randomly degraded from the 3&#x02032;-end when RDR2 does not convert them into siRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-9"><title>Injection of truncated transgenes induces heterochromatin formation <italic>in trans</italic></title><p>The decreasing coverage of transgene-triggered 2&#x000b0; siRNAs clearly distinguishes these from those occurring in dsRNA-feeding induced PTGS (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In combination with the involvement of RDR3 with its above-described involvement in TGS of the surface antigen genes it seemed likely that transgene-induced silencing does not act entirely on the post-transcriptional level.

Simultaneously, two histone marks which are typically associated with actively transcribed chromatin (H3K9ac and H3K4me3) showed a strong enrichment in promoters when the gene was expressed (un-injected cells) and the pull-down levels were clearly reduced when the gene was silenced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">D</xref>).

It is likely that efficient heterochromatin formation requires either a certain abundance of triggering siRNAs or proximity to a heterochromatic region. However, our data also shows that silencing is a quantitative phenomenon, which is linked to transgene copy number and primary siRNA abundance: the comparison of transgene lines with different copy numbers show low numbers of 2&#x000b0; siRNAs even in transgene lines of &#x0223c;2x of the endogenous copy number (Supplementary Figure S5).

Differences in e.g. antisense bias may be due to different precursor molecules because the remote locus is likely affected by silencing of the transcriptional elongation (see below).</p><p>Compared to <italic>S.pombe</italic> which possesses only one Dicer, one RDR and one Ago, the genome of <italic>Paramecium</italic> reveals eight Dicers (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), four RDRs (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and seventeen Piwi (ref.

This is supported by the role of RDR2 in accumulation of PTGS associated 2&#x000b0; siRNAs, which are predominantly antisense to the mRNA (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). CID2 is a nucleotidyltransferase family member involved in RNA surveillance mechanisms: in yeast, CID12 interacts with the RITS (RNA-induced transcriptional silencing complex) and therefore connects RNA surveillance and RNA mediated heterochromatin formation (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Thus, the borders between clear TGS and PTGS blur indeed in the light of increasing number of studies demonstrating RNA surveillance mechanism associated with heterochromatin formation. These include e.g. the recruitment of RITS and associated RNA surveillance mechanisms to silence meiosis specific genes (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), but it was interestingly also shown, that the exosome can induce heterochromatin in an RNAi independent manner (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, a single RDR associates in complexes (RDRCs) with different nucleotidyltransferase subunits and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments suggest that uridinylation at the 3&#x02032;-end of primary transcripts support conversion into dsRNA by RDR (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Consequently, it seems logic that CID2 recognizes the aberrant transgene transcripts to initiates the silencing cascade and RDR2-mediated synthesis of RNA complementary to spliced transcripts. This would be the same action as reported for RDR2 in exogenously triggered PTGS (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), as well as in our example on the endogenous <italic>ND169</italic>: in the two latter cases, the RDR2 template represents intact mRNA, which is targeted by 1&#x000b0; siRNAs. Further support for our hypothesis comes from the Piwi domain architecture: as PTIWI13 is the only Piwi involved with a potential Slicer activity (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), it makes sense that this Piwi is associated with accumulation of antisense siRNAs to attack sense transcripts. Thus, implication of RNAi components as well as their associated siRNAs let us hypothesize that the set of RDR2, CID2 and PTIWI13 are indeed involved in a PTGS, or PTGS similar mechanism here. With respect to the diversification of <italic>Paramecium</italic> RNAi, it would have been surprising if this set would have an entirely distinct role here compared to their role in PTGS.</p><p>In addition, un-spliced transcripts contribute to 1&#x000b0; siRNA accumulation and as the above-described RDR2-mediated mechanism has apparently less influence on siRNAs from nascent transcripts, we cannot directly assign individual RNAi components to their accumulation. We can speculate that RDR3 and PTIWI14, which have until now been exclusively described to be involved in the transgene-induced RNAi, are responsible for their accumulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Nascent sense transcripts may directly form dsRNA with antisense transcripts. As RDR3 has a highly divergent domain lacking conservative residues, it may be catalytically dead but could be necessary to mediate hybridization of the two strands rather than synthesizing new RNA. However, in this scenario Dicer activity would need to cut the dsRNA before loading siRNAs into PTIWI14 (see model Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). In this case, the antisense bias of transgene siRNAs would then be the result preferential loading and stabilization by PTIWI proteins. This hypothesis in fostered by the involvement of RDR3 in transcriptional silencing of the surface antigen gene family (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) which is accompanied also by accumulation of sense siRNAs but here from active loci (unpublished data).</p><p>Our data shows that a PTGS aspect is involved in transgene-induced heterochromatin formation. A similar hypothesis was made for flies and fission yeast, that RNAi pathways that modify chromatin by targeting nascent RNA need an additional post-transcriptional mechanism to ensure efficient silencing (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). According to our results, involvement of RDR2 does not simply provide additional PTGS, because RDR2 knockdown resulted in deficiency of heterochromatin formation at the endo<italic>ND169</italic> locus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). We conclude that both silencing modes indeed interact with each other rather than to be a consequence of one another, because this is the only explanation why silencing of any component reduced all individual classes of siRNAs (sense/antisense &#x00026; introns/junctions) to similar extent. Although we cannot exclude that individual components may be involved in both, CTGS and PTGS, it seems more likely that both pathways are functionally linked this may occur on the RNA level if antisense siRNAs are triggered by sense RNAs (and vice versa). In agreement with the above.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-2"><title>Does the PTGS factor in transgene-induced silencing limit transitivity?</title><p>Transitivity occurs in many systems such as siRNA-mediated PTGS in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> or <italic>C. elegans</italic> and CTGS in fission yeast (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Our results indicate that transitivity is strictly limited to the transcribed region of the <italic>ND169</italic> gene and that the coverage of 2&#x000b0; siRNAs decreases from the 5&#x02032;- to the 3&#x02032;-end of the CDS. The decreasing coverage of 2&#x000b0; siRNAs can be explained by the nascent transcript model. PolII would initiate transcription, and then nascent transcripts can be attacked by 1&#x000b0; siRNAs giving rise to 2&#x000b0; siRNAs. As the transgene sequence cannot produce siRNAs that fit to the endo <italic>ND169</italic> promoter, silencing occurs likely at the step of elongation rather than transcriptional initiation.</p><p>If we apply the above-hypothesized model to 2&#x000b0; siRNAs assuming that the very same mechanism acts at the remote locus, the association of RDR2, CID2, and PTIWI13 would also be consistent with our findings. The observed 3&#x02032;-transitivity in the ND-2 region, which cannot be initiated by downstream binding of 1&#x000b0; siRNAs, can only be due to RDR activity. The prime candidate for this would be RDR2, as it is the only catalytic RDR involved in the mechanism, and its knockdown had the strongest influence on the ND2-region. In addition, copying of full-length transcripts by RDR activity is confirmed by the presence of siRNAs antisense to exon-exon junctions of <italic>ND169</italic>. Our hypothesis that RDR2 is responsible for this is based on our finding that its knockdown had a stronger influence to this region compared to all other RNAi components, that this region shows the strongest antisense bias and finally, that RDR2 is responsible for 3&#x02032;-transitivity in PTGS (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p>Another interesting aspect are the margins for transitivity: as 2&#x000b0; siRNA accumulation is limited to the transcribed region of the <italic>ND169</italic> gene, the native mRNA transcription start and stop sites appear to limit the siRNA precursor transcription. Consequently, this can only be a sense transcript. This is different to recent reports of piRNA-mediated TGS at loci harbouring transposable elements in flies where silencing spreads into flanking protein coding genes (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Our data indicate that the involvement of PTGS components may be a tool to restrict transitivity to one individual gene. This would be an important mechanism in the highly condensed <italic>Paramecium</italic> Mac genome to avoid side effects of siRNA-mediated heterochromatin formation.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-3"><title>Implications of transgene-induced silencing to endogenous gene regulation and inheritance</title><p>Across kingdoms, most studies investigating <italic>trans</italic> silencing use hairpin constructs to apply directly a dsRNA fragment to induce RNAi. This means that a dsRNA triggering RNAi is directly present. Alternatively, 2&#x000b0; siRNA accumulation can be triggered by piRNAs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>: in a transgene model, these 2&#x000b0; siRNAs were shown to act in trans on another transgene thus triggering heritable silencing and 3&#x000b0; siRNA accumulation in trans at a homologous region in a paramutation like manner (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). In our study, it remains unclear what the direct precursor is. We show that mRNA transcription impairs siRNA synthesis, letting us assume that an RNA surveillance mechanism is involved as discussed above. Similarly, also a pseudogene could trigger siRNA accumulation. On the other hand, the data shows clearly that a mRNA producing locus can also be converted into a siRNA producing locus by <italic>trans</italic> acting siRNAs.</p><p>In general, the importance of small RNA-producing pseudogenes emerged earlier for the understanding of the evolutionary impact of gene duplication as well as our current understanding of gene regulation <italic>in trans</italic> and the recent genome wide siRNA annotations across kingdoms reveal more and more siRNA producing pseudogenes which moreover can regulate their parental coding genes (reviewed in ref. (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>)). In the unicellular pathogen <italic>Trypanosoma</italic>, triggering dsRNA and siRNA was recently shown to be formed by two pseudogenes with partially complementary sequences as well as by dsRNA hybrids by pseudo- and coding genes, especially the latter possibility was shown to occur on pseudogenes of the VSG-family (variant surface glycoprotein) (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Also in <italic>Paramecium</italic>, our microarray analysis of <italic>RDR3</italic> knockdown cultures showed that the surface antigen multigene family is affected (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). This multigene family which is responsible for antigenic variation showing some similarity to that of pathogenic protists (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), was also shown to consist of intrachromosomal gene duplicates (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) whose contribution to the gene expression mechanisms has to be clarified. However, a genome wide analysis of pseudogenes and siRNA clusters is right now missing in this organism. One exception is a siRNA cluster on chromosome22 formed by two overlapping orfs and we can show that these siRNAs depend on all components of the transgene RNAi pathway except RDR3 (Supplementary Figure S6C).</p><p>With this study, we contribute more knowledge on detailed mechanisms how non-coding genes can produce siRNAs without requiring the formation of hairpin precursors. As indicated by a recent transcriptome analyses, siRNA-mediated heterochromatin formation might not only contribute to the regulation of a large number genes, but also to an epigenetically determined robustness counteracting rapid transcriptome dynamics (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>It remains to be noted that the siRNAs described here, as well as their endogenous counterparts, may be responsible for transgenerational inheritance of gene expression: transgene-induced silencing as well as PTGS by dsRNA feeding was described to cause deletions of homologous DNA sequences during the development of a new Mac in the sexual progeny (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, the authors discuss whether this is a direct effect of the 23nt siRNAs or whether they act indirectly by targeting maternal transcripts. The latter normally specifically hybridize to scnRNAs, which mediate the deletion of sequences not determined to be retained in the in F1 Mac, thus 23nt siRNA may counteract the deletion protecting maternal transcripts (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>Although we cannot answer this question, we know that at least DCR1 and RDR3 are also involved in accumulation of 23nt siRNAs of surface antigen genes (Simon M, unpublished data). As this multigene family can pass on its expression pattern to sexual progeny (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) without causing a gene deletion effect it seems likely that 23nt siRNAs can transfer gene expression patterns, by determining chromatin states, to the developmental Mac. PTIWI08 may be a good candidate for this process: as it is the ohnolog of PTIWI14 (sharing a high degree of homology) and it is strongly up-regulated during autogamy (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), it may load the same siRNAs as PTIWI14, transferring them to the zygotic nucleus.</p></sec></sec>
