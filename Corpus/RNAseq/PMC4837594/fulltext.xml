Though L1 elements have helped to shape mammalian genome evolution over millions of years, L1 activity can also be mutagenic and result in human disease. L1 expression has the potential to contribute to genomic instability via retrotransposition and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Additionally, L1 is responsible for structural genomic variations induced by other transposable elements such as Alu and SVA, which rely on the L1 ORF2 protein for their propagation.

Most of the approximately 500,000&#x000a0;L1 loci have been truncated or mutated and are incapable of further retrotransposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. L1 is required for the mobilization of non-autonomous retrotransposons such as Alu and SVA elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and together these retroelements comprise about a third of the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The fully functional L1 element encodes two proteins (ORF1p and ORF2p), both of which are required for&#x000a0;its retrotransposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. ORF1p is an RNA-binding protein with nucleic chaperone activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and ORF2p is a multifunctional protein with endonuclease and reverse transcriptase enzymatic activities and a cysteine-rich domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. L1 and L1-driven retroelements amplify through a copy-and-paste mechanism, resulting in <italic>de novo</italic> insertions in the genome. After integration, these retroelements can interfere with gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or serve as substrates for non-allelic homologous recombination events, which can lead to disease-relevant genomic deletions, inversions or translocations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>L1 and its Alu and SVA parasites have significantly impacted the human genome for better or worse (reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). L1 has had a major role in generating structural variations in the host genome through retrotransposition and post-insertional genomic rearrangements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, expression of functional L1 loci can potentially be detrimental at the cellular or organismal level. Transient expression of L1 in mammalian cells results in L1 retrotransposition, and the generation of&#x000a0;DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This genomic damage can be significant and lead to apoptosis or senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Both L1 retrotransposition and L1-induced DSBs result from the activity of the endonuclease domain present in the ORF2 protein, which functions to introduce nicks into the cellular DNA in preparation for L1 integration via target-primed reverse transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Mutations within the endonuclease domain have the potential to impair endonuclease activity and thereby diminish subsequent L1-induced genomic damage. Aside from a few critical residues that have been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], it is not known how well the endonuclease domain can tolerate mutations in terms of maintaining its function.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed full-length L1 loci within the human genome to identify naturally occurring mutations within the ORF2 endonuclease domain. Some of these mutated residues are evolutionarily conserved or presumed to be structurally important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Moreover, several of these mutated residues were predicted to be phosphorylation sites for various cellular kinases. Recent studies reported that the phosphorylation of ORF1p is required for L1 retrotransposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and that these and other putative phosphorylation sites within ORF1p may be involved in the regulation of L1 activity by melatonin receptor signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These studies raise the question of whether ORF2p could also be post-translationally modified. Focusing on putative phosphorylation sites, as a way to investigate a manageable subset of positions with possible biological relevance to L1 function, we mutated several amino acid residues within the ORF2 endonuclease domain and investigated the effect of these mutations on endonuclease activity. We characterized the ability of the mutated ENp and ORF2p to cause toxicity, induce H2AX phosphorylation (a marker for DNA DSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]), and drive Alu retrotransposition. Our findings demonstrate that all of the tested individual mutations, as well as most of the various combinations of these mutations, are tolerated without significantly impacting the L1 ORF2 endonuclease function, either in the context of the full-length ORF2p or in the ENp alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identification of mutations in the endonuclease domain of full-length human L1 loci</title><p>Using L1Base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], we analyzed the sequences of full-length L1 loci present in the human genome to identify naturally occurring mutations in the ORF2 endonuclease domain. Our search parameters were set to identify L1 loci that contain intact ORF1 and ORF2 sequences (no gaps, premature stops or frameshifts). We identified 134&#x000a0;L1 loci that satisfy these search criteria, the majority of which were L1Ta and L1PA2 families (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). None of the 134 full-length L1 loci fitting our search criteria had any mutations at amino acid H230 and only one locus contained a mutation at D205 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). These two residues are absolutely critical for ORF2 endonuclease function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The maximum number of mutations found in the endonuclease domain of any of the 134 full-length L1 loci was 11. Aligning the ORF2 protein sequences of the full-length L1 loci&#x000a0;extracted from L1Base against the active human L1.3 element revealed that 118 of the 239 amino acids in the endonuclease domain were mutated at least once (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). However, three of these mutations may be specific to the L1PA2 sequence (I15V, A21P, V208L).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Mutations in the ORF2 endonuclease domain from full-length L1 loci in the human genome.

Our bioinformatic analysis identified multiple mutations of serines and threonines in the endonuclease domain, which may be of particular interest as these amino acids are commonly phosphorylated by cellular kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. We utilized the ELM prediction tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] to identify several short linear motifs within the endonuclease domain that were expected to be recognized by serine/threonine kinases. We also used the NetPhos 2.0 prediction program to identify amino acids having a high probability of being phosphorylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The following amino acids were predicted to be phosphorylated by both programs: S29, S33, S37, S79, T82, S151, S188, T189, T220, T224 and S228 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). Additionally, ELM and NetPhos 2.0 identified two very high&#x000a0;probability residues just outside of the endonuclease domain (S312 and S335). To evaluate the evolutionary conservation of the putative phosphorylation sites identified by the prediction programs, we aligned the amino acid sequence of the L1 ORF2 endonuclease domain from eight representative species within the Supraprimate clade of mammals (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S2). With respect to the human L1 sequence, S37, S188 and T189 were moderately conserved (present in 50 % or more of the investigated species), while S79, S151 and S228 were highly conserved (present in almost all investigated species). Even the least conserved residues were still&#x000a0;shared among the hominid clade of primates (humans, chimpanzees and bonobos).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Mutations of several putative phosphorylation sites in the ORF2 endonuclease domain did not alter its ability to drive Alu retrotransposition, cause toxicity, or impact expression of the full-length ORF2p</title><p>As our main interest is in understanding the impact of mutations on L1 endonuclease function, we chose to investigate the functional impact of mutations in putative phosphorylation sites because, if found relevant, these sites could also play a regulatory role. Amino acid residues that were scored by both the ELM and NetPhos prediction programs were selected for mutagenesis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). We generated expression plasmids containing codon-optimized human L1 ORF2 sequence with either serine to alanine (S to A) or threonine to alanine (T to A) point mutations in putative phosphorylation sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The resulting plasmids contained one (S29A; S33A; S37A; S79A; S188A; S228A), two (S29A/S37A; S79A/T82A; S188A/T189A), three (S29A/S37A/S228A), or four (S29A/S37A/S188A/T189A) point mutations in putative phosphorylation sites within the endonuclease domain. The ORF2 11m construct was designed to include mutations in sites predicted to be phosphorylated by kinases in the CMGC group (<italic>C</italic>DK, <italic>M</italic>APK, <italic>G</italic>SK3 and <italic>C</italic>LK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

Because these mutant constructs were tested in transiently transfected HeLa and 293 cells, we used an NGS RNAseq approach to confirm that these cell lines express many cellular kinases (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the putative phosphorylation sites within ORF2 mutated in this study.

A positive or negative change in ORF2p toxicity may mask or cause subsequent variations in ORF2p-driven Alu mobilization. Using a previously described assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], we measured acute toxicity following transient transfection of the ORF2 putative phosphorylation plasmids to determine if variations in cellular toxicity may contribute to the observed reduction in Alu retrotransposition driven by the ORF2 11m protein (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S3A). For this reason, the same amount of DNA that was transfected in the retrotransposition assay was used for evaluation of potential changes in ORF2p toxicity. Results in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> demonstrate that there were no significant differences in toxicity between the functional ORF2p and any of the putative phosphorylation mutant proteins after transient expression in HeLa cells. In contrast to previously reported results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], we did not observe any toxicity associated with the expression of functional or mutant ORF2 proteins in HeLa cells under our experimental conditions. This discrepancy is likely due to the 20-fold difference in the amount of plasmid DNA transfected per cell between the reported transfection conditions (2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g plasmid per 100,000 cells in a 6-well plate) and the conditions used here (0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g per 500,000 cells in a T75 flask). Additionally, it was reported that expression of the full-length ORF2p alone was not as efficient in generating &#x003b3;H2AX foci in HeLa cells as was the&#x000a0;expression of&#x000a0;the&#x000a0;full-length L1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

The vast majority of full-length L1 loci have become inactive through the accumulation of post-insertional mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Given the importance of endonuclease activity to retrotransposition and its relevance to human health, we examined the sequences of full-length L1 loci to find naturally occurring mutations in the endonuclease domain with the potential to affect its function. Our bioinformatic analysis of 134 full-length human L1 loci revealed that all but one locus have retained the wild-type amino acid at position 205 (D205), a residue that is confirmed to be important for endonuclease function (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Overall, our bioinformatic analysis identified 118 amino acid positions within the sequence of the endonuclease&#x000a0;domain that were mutated relative to the L1.3 sequence. These mutations appear to be randomly distributed throughout the endonuclease sequence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p>Further investigation revealed that 25 % of the 118 mutated positions were serines, threonines, or tyrosines. Combined, serines, threonines and tyrosines comprise about 20 % of the functional endonuclease sequence. More than 50 % of all serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues present in the endonuclease domain were found to be mutated in at least one locus (11 of 20 serines; 15 of 21 threonines; 4 of 7 tyrosines). Most of these mutations did not appear to be due to the presence of CpG dinucleotides within the codons encoding serines and threonines, as there are only two CpG-containing codons (S47, T157) in the human ORF2 endonuclease domain. The underrepresentation of CpG-containing codons is not surprising, given the AT-richness of the L1 coding sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p>Identification of a subset of naturally occurring mutations with potential biological relevance to L1 endonuclease function provided a rationale for investigating the functional effect of mutations at some of these positions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). With the exception of the ORF2 11m mutant, all of the ORF2 proteins with single or multiple point mutations of putative phosphorylation sites behaved similarly to the functional ORF2p in terms of expression and ability to support Alu mobilization. We did not observe any additive effect on the ability of ORF2p to drive Alu retrotransposition as the number of mutations was increased from one to four (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Interestingly, the ORF2 11m protein, which contained 11 point mutations, was still able to drive fairly efficient Alu retrotransposition in HeLa cells, albeit at a 50 % lower level than the functional ORF2p (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This reduction is consistent with the 50 % decrease in the steady-state levels of its expression relative to the functional ORF2p (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Out of the 11 putative phosphorylation sites that were mutated in the ORF2 11m construct, only 3 sites (S151A, T220A and T224A) were not tested individually or in combination with any of the other 8 mutations for their ability to affect L1 ORF2p expression and retrotransposition. This raises the possibility that the reduction in ORF2 11m protein expression and its ability to drive Alu mobilization may be entirely due to one or more of those three mutations. Alternatively, a combination of all 11 mutations may be responsible for the observed effect. Regardless, the important finding remains that many mutations within the ORF2p endonuclease domain, individually or in various combinations, were tolerated by the enzyme. Despite containing as many as 11 mutations, the Alu retrotransposition potential was only reduced by 50 %.</p><p>As with the results from the mutant ORF2 proteins in the retrotransposition assays, we did not observe any additive effect on the ability of ENp to cause toxicity as the number of mutations was increased from one to four (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Figure S5). The reduction in toxicity observed with the EN 9m mutant in comparison to the functional ENp may suggest that a threshold was crossed at a higher number of mutations. Alternatively, the 3 putative phosphorylation site mutations that were not tested individually (S151A, T220A and T224A) may have been responsible for the observed reduction. Though still highly toxic in comparison to the non-functional ENp, expression of the EN 9m mutant protein was significantly less toxic than the functional ENp in HeLa cells. Additionally, western blot analysis detected significantly higher steady-state levels of the EN 9m protein in comparison to the functional ENp (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), consistent with the previously observed increase in expression of non-functional L1 ORF2 and endonuclease proteins relative to their active counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. It is particularly interesting that we did not detect any significant differences in endonuclease activity with the EN or ORF2 proteins containing the S228A mutation when compared to the functional proteins. The S228 residue of the ORF2p endonuclease is predicted to be structurally important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This residue is also highly conserved, and it is even present in its ancient evolutionary ancestor APE1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Additionally, the S228 residue is in close proximity to the critical H230 residue, the mutation of which is known to eliminate endonuclease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Together these results demonstrate that many mutations within the endonuclease domain of ORF2p can be tolerated without substantially impairing endonuclease function and Alu retrotransposition. Although it is plausible that ORF2p mutations may affect L1 and Alu amplification differently, we did not observe any significant variation in the effect of the putative phosphorylation&#x000a0;sites mutations tested in both L1 and Alu retrotransposition. The function of the endonuclease domain is predicted to be similar in L1 and Alu retrotransposition, so perhaps a lack of variation is to be expected. The finding that none of the mutations in putative phosphorylation sites that were evaluated in this study eliminated endonuclease activity suggests that, if phosphorylation of these sites occurs, it is not required for endonuclease function in HeLa and 293 cells. However, we cannot rule out the potential impact of these putative phosphorylation sites for ORF2p function in cell types other than the ones tested in this study (HeLa and 293), because cellular kinases often exhibit cell-type-specific expression or activity. All of the putative phosphorylation sites in this study were mutated to alanine, which was a common naturally occurring substitution found in our bioinformatic analysis of the full-length human L1 loci (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). Perhaps mutating serine 228 to an alanine was a conservative substitution and did not distort the local protein structure enough to interfere with the function of the neighboring H230. In fact, it is entirely possible that we may have seen different outcomes if any of these sites had been mutated to a different amino acid. It is also worth noting that ORF2p may be phosphorylated at sites other than those investigated in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that the ORF2 endonuclease domain can tolerate many mutations without significantly impacting its function, either in the context of the full-length ORF2p or in the ENp alone.
