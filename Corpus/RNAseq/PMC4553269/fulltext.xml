To define its mutational landscape, we performed whole genome, exome, RNA and targeted DNA sequencing on 65 infants (47 <italic>MLL</italic>-R and 18 non-<italic>MLL</italic>-R) and 20 older children (<italic>MLL</italic>-R cases) with leukemia. Our data demonstrated infant <italic>MLL</italic>-R ALL to have one of the lowest frequencies of somatic mutations of any sequenced cancer, with the predominant leukemic clone carrying a mean of 1.3 non-silent mutations. Despite the paucity of mutations, activating mutations in kinase/PI3K/RAS signaling pathways were detected in 47%. Surprisingly, however, these mutations were often sub-clonal and frequently lost at relapse. In contrast to infant cases, <italic>MLL</italic>-R leukemia in older children had more somatic mutations (a mean of 6.5/case versus 1.3/case, <italic>P</italic>=7.15&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) and contained frequent mutations (45%) in epigenetic regulators, a category of genes that with the exception of <italic>MLL</italic> was rarely mutated in infant <italic>MLL</italic>-R ALL.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) arising in infants less than one year of age accounts for 2.5 to 5% of all childhood ALL. Up to 80% of the infant ALL cases are characterized by rearrangements of the <italic><underline>M</underline></italic>ixed <italic><underline>L</underline></italic>ineage <italic><underline>L</underline></italic>eukemia (<italic>MLL</italic>) gene at 11q23<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Although current event free survival rates (EFS) for childhood ALL have reached greater than 85%<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, the outcome for infant ALL with <italic>MLL</italic> rearrangements (<italic>MLL</italic>-R) remains poor with an EFS of only 28&#x02013;36%<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Thus new therapeutic approaches are needed to improve cure rates for these patients. Studies on this leukemia subtype have demonstrated that the <italic>MLL</italic> translocation often occurs <italic>in utero</italic>, and that clinically overt leukemia develops with a very short latency, with rare cases presenting at birth<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that <italic>MLL</italic>-R ALL requires few additional mutations to induce full transformation. Consistent with this, genome-wide studies on <italic>MLL</italic>-R ALL using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays have shown that this leukemia subtype contains on average only one copy number alteration (CNA) per case<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, murine models of <italic>MLL</italic>-R leukemia suggest that expression of the <italic>MLL</italic> chimeric gene alone is insufficient for full transformation<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. To gain a better understanding of the complete landscape of somatic mutations in infant <italic>MLL</italic>-R ALL, we performed a genome-wide analysis on this leukemia subtype as part of the St. Jude Children&#x02019;s Research Hospital &#x02013; Washington University Pediatric Cancer Genome Project (PCGP)<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Infant <italic>MLL</italic>-R ALL has an exceedingly low mutation frequency</title><p id="P3">Paired-end whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on diagnostic leukemia cells and matched remission bone marrow or peripheral blood cells from a discovery cohort of 22 infants with <italic>MLL</italic>-R ALL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The leukemic genomes had an average haploid coverage of 39X. Somatic alterations including single nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertions/deletions (indels), structural variations (SV) and CNAs were detected using multiple analytical pipelines<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and validated using orthogonal DNA sequencing approaches (Online Methods).</p><p id="P4">WGS revealed that the infant <italic>MLL</italic>-R ALL genomes contained an average of 111 somatic sequence mutations (range 29&#x02013;229) and 10 CNAs/SVs (range 2&#x02013;26), per case (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 3 and 4</xref>), yielding a median somatic coding mutation rate of 7.30&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> per base (range 0&#x02013;2.29&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>). With the exception of pediatric low-grade glioma<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, this is 2&#x02013;180 fold lower than those reported in adult and pediatric cancers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). The mutation spectrum across the cohort did not suggest any specific mutational mechanisms with the most common nucleotide changes being C&#x0003e;T/G&#x0003e;A transition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The number of somatic alterations affecting the coding region of annotated genes or regulatory RNAs averaged 8.2/case, including 2.2 non-silent SNVs (range 0&#x02013;4) and 6.0 CNA/SVs (range 2&#x02013;19) per case (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a&#x02013;c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 3, 4 and 6&#x02013;8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 2&#x02013;3</xref>). RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in 21/22 cases demonstrated 48% of the non-silent SNVs to be expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 9&#x02013;11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5</xref>). Despite the paucity of mutations, 81% of the expressed missense mutations were predicted to have a deleterious effect on protein function.</p><p id="P5">Importantly, the majority of the CNAs/SVs were a direct consequence of the <italic>MLL</italic> rearrangement, with the break point of both <italic>MLL</italic> and its partner gene typically accompanied by the gain or loss of adjacent genetic material (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> and see below). If the <italic>MLL</italic>-related CNAs/SVs are removed, the average CNAs/SVs per case decreases to 3.0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 12</xref>). Additionally, 40% of the identified somatic SNVs were detected at a mutant allele frequency (MAF) below 30% despite the high tumor purity (average 92%, range 74%&#x02013;100%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 1, 4, 8 and 13</xref>). This suggests that these mutations reside in minor diagnostic sub-clones. Confirmation of this was achieved by performing custom capture and deep sequencing at an average of 437X coverage of all tier 1&#x02013;3 somatic mutations identified in five cases. This analysis demonstrated the presence of significant intra-tumor heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7</xref>). If we focus only on the mutations (including SNVs and indels) present in the dominant leukemia clone, the average number of non-silent mutations decreases to 1.3/case (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 13</xref>), with only 0.6 expressed at the RNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). A direct comparison of these mutation frequencies to those observed across 29 human cancers revealed infant ALL to have one of the lowest number of somatic mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The majority of the <italic>MLL</italic> rearrangements are unbalanced</title><p id="P6">WGS detected a total of 133 SVs and CNAs across the infant ALL cohort that affected annotated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 3, 7, 12 and 14</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note</xref>). Approximately half (n=67) of the 133 SVs/CNAs, were a direct result of the <italic>MLL</italic> rearrangement. Within the remaining half (n=66) of the 133 SVs/CNAs, the most frequently affected genes were <italic>PAX5</italic> (5 cases), <italic>CDKN2A/CDKN2B</italic> (3 cases) and the non-coding RNA genes <italic>DLEU1/2</italic> (3 cases).

Moreover, even &#x0201c;so-called&#x0201d; simple cytogenetically balanced <italic>MLL</italic> translocations that involved only two chromosomes were found at the base pair level to have focal deletions and/or insertions of sequences at the breakpoints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 15</xref>). As a result, although each <italic>MLL</italic> rearrangement would be predicted to encode an in-frame <italic>MLL</italic>-partner gene fusion protein, only 10/22 of the analyzed cases would be predicted to encode an in-frame reciprocal partner gene-<italic>MLL</italic> fusion protein. RNAseq on available samples demonstrated that 6 of 9 cases with a predicted reciprocal fusion expressed the reciprocal product, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 16 and 17</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.

In addition, although eight infant <italic>MLL</italic>-R ALL cases contained two or more mutations in genes in this pathway, the MAF for each mutation was below 30% in six of these cases. Importantly, all of the activating tyrosine kinase/PI3K/RAS mutations were expressed, which was in contrast to other non-silent mutations in the discovery cohort, where only 38% were expressed. Even more surprising, in our analysis of seven matched diagnostic and relapse infant <italic>MLL</italic>-R samples, five of which contained a diagnostic mutation in the tyrosine kinase/PI3K/RAS pathway, we found that these mutant genes were maintained at relapse in two cases, decreased in one, and lost in two.

These data suggests that the co-existence of the MLL fusion protein with an activating mutation in tyrosine kinase/PI3K/RAS signaling pathways is not essential for either the establishment or maintenance of the leukemia; however its presence likely confers a growth advantage. Our data also raises the possibility that the high degree of clonal heterogeneity observed in infant <italic>MLL</italic>-R ALL<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> may directly contribute to its poor prognosis, in that conventional ALL treatment regimens may not fully eliminate all clones, allowing the emergence of relapsed disease from a minor clone present at the time of diagnosis.</p><p id="P22">Interestingly, in non-infant <italic>MLL</italic>-R leukemias most somatic mutations were found to reside within a single dominant clone.

This raises the possibility that there may be a fundamental difference in the target cell of transformation, the microenvironment, or both between infants and older patients. This is further supported by the finding that non-infant <italic>MLL</italic>-R leukemias carry significantly more mutations in genes encoding epigenetic regulators than infant cases, suggesting that the target cell in infants may already have a chromatin state that is more permissive to transformation by the <italic>MLL</italic> gene rearrangement.</p><p id="P23">These data provide a unique look into the underlying molecular pathology of this highly aggressive pediatric leukemia.

These cells gain few additional mutations during their proliferative expansion, although the frequent targeting of genes within tyrosine kinase/PI3K/RAS signaling pathways suggest that activation of this pathway can cooperate in leukemogenesis, although not to a level that results in the establishment of a dominant clone. Moreover, the loss of these latter mutations at relapse in a number of patients suggests that specifically targeting these activating lesions will likely provide little therapeutic benefit. On the other hand, the clear implication that the MLL fusion protein is a potent driver gene in this aggressive leukemia, and that the leukemic cells lack a high mutational rate raises the possibility that therapy directed toward the MLL fusion protein, or proteins required for its biological actions, may be a fruitful approach for targeted therapy in this aggressive leukemia.</p></sec><sec id="S10" specific-use="web-only"><title>ONLINE METHODS</title><sec id="S11"><title>Patients</title><p id="P24">Paired-end whole genome sequencing on diagnostic leukemia blasts and matched germ line samples was performed on a discovery cohort of 22 infants with <italic>MLL</italic> rearranged (<italic>MLL</italic>-R) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 2 matched relapse samples (INF001R and INF002R) using the Illumina sequencing platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA).

All predicted transcripts were analyzed and transcripts that would lack a CDS start or stop site were filtered out. The CDS length were then computed by taking the sum of the lengths of the coding portions of the exons containing the CDS start and stop sites with the lengths of all intermediate exons. In cases where both breakpoints of an event occurred inside exons, we reduced both exons to a single fused exon that was built by assembling the reads at the SV breakpoints and aligning the assembled contig back to the reference. If the fused exon lay between the CDS start and stop sites, the fused exon&#x02019;s length were included in the CDS length calculation. In addition, if the predicted CDS length was a multiple of three, the fusion transcript was classified as &#x0201c;in-frame&#x0201d;. If the transcript was altered from the annotated CDS of one of the genes, it was classified as &#x0201c;modified in-frame&#x0201d;.

All CNAs were manually reviewed and compared with Affymetrix SNP 6.0 or 500K CNA results. Regions of LOH were identified from the high quality SNVs. First, heterozygous SNVs with mutant allele frequency between 40&#x02013;60% in the germline sample were used to estimate the LOH signal.
