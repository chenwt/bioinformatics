There are also significant differences in molecular features between pediatric and adult HGG<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. <italic>Histone H3</italic> (<italic>H3F3A</italic> and <italic>HIST1H3B</italic>) pK27M mutations are frequent in DIPGs, which arise in the brainstem almost exclusively in children, and in pediatric HGGs in midline structures such as thalamus and cerebellum, while pG34R/V <italic>histone H3</italic> mutations occur in pediatric HGGs of the cerebral cortex<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. In contrast, histone H3 mutations are extremely rare in adult HGGs <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. HGGs arising in infants younger than 3 years of age have a better prognosis, and a lower frequency of <italic>TP53</italic> mutations, suggesting that there may be age-dependent subgroups of HGG even within the pediatric population<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Thus, the selective pressures driving gliomagenesis in children vary with age and anatomical site.</p><p id="P3">To more comprehensively understand the pathways driving childhood glioma, we analyzed the genomic landscape of HGGs from 118 pediatric patients (127 tumors, 108 matched to germline DNA) consisting of 57 DIPGs and 70 non-brainstem HGGs (NBS-HGG) by whole genome (WGS) (n= 42), whole exome (n= 80) or transcriptome sequencing (n= 75) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Tables 1-9</xref>). A total of 39,590 sequence mutations, including single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and small insertions or deletions, and 2,039 structural variations (SVs) were found by WGS while an additional 2,600 sequence mutations and 138 SVs were found by exome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing, respectively. Overall, the cohort showed a median background mutation rate of 9E-07 and a median of 22 SVs per genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). All SNVs and SVs found in WGS were verified experimentally by independent sequencing methods (Online Methods).</p><p id="P4">Among recurrent mutations in pediatric HGG, the most frequently mutated gene not previously identified in cancer was <italic>ACVR1</italic> (also known as <italic>ALK2</italic>) encoding a BMP type I receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2-3</xref>). Clonal missense <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutations were found exclusively in DIPGs (32%), and were significantly associated with younger age, longer survival, and the presence of pK27M <italic>HIST1H3B</italic> (p&#x0003c;0.0000001), or <italic>PIK3CA</italic> or <italic>PIK3R1</italic> mutations (p&#x0003c;0.005)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Tables 4 and 5</xref>). Four of these somatic <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutations were the same as germline mutations previously identified in the autosomal dominant syndrome fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), in which aberrant cellular differentiation drives progressive heterotopic ossifications<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. All residues impacted by mutation in DIPG cluster around either the inhibitory glycine/serine rich (G/S) domain or the ATP binding pocket of the kinase domain, and would be expected to shift the kinase to an active conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Indeed, mutations of these residues induced a weak gain of function<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. A previous study showed that the R206H <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutation caused a ventralized phenotype in zebrafish embryos, an indicator of BMP pathway activation<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. We tested all of the <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutations found in DIPG using this assay. Zebrafish embryos injected with <italic>ACVR1</italic><sup>WT</sup> mRNA (WT) displayed a mild dorsalized phenotype consistent with BMP pathway inhibition, while all six <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutants, shown in order of severity, exhibited varying degrees of ventralization with partial to complete loss of head and dorsal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d,e</xref>). A moderate dose of LDN-193189 (LDN), a highly selective antagonist of the BMP pathway<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, partially reversed the ventralization effects induced by <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutants as can be seen by the rescue of dorsal head structures for R258G, G328E, G328W, R206H and the reduced severity of ventralization for G356D and G328V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Expression of <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutants in mouse primary astrocyte cultures caused increased levels of phospho-SMAD1/5, a downstream indication of active BMP signaling, with varying magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). LDN also effectively blocked signaling to phospho-SMAD1/5 downstream of the mutant ACVR1 in primary astrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The recurrent and clonal activating mutation of <italic>ACVR1</italic> in 32% of DIPGs provides strong evidence that it is an oncogenic driver in this disease. However, germline <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutation in the genetic syndrome FOP is not associated with cancer predisposition, indicating that <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutation likely provides a selective advantage in the presence of other critical mutations, rather than driving tumor initiation. Consistent with this hypothesis, all 6 of the DIPG-associated ACVR1 mutants failed to render <italic>Tp53</italic>-null astrocytes tumorigenic when implanted into brain (not shown). BMP signaling is associated with contrasting effects dependent on context, driving astrocytic differentiation, or proliferation of early hindbrain progenitors<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, and inducing differentiation of medulloblastoma<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, but driving either a differentiation or proliferative response in glioblastoma stem cells, related in part to the epigenetic state of the cell<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. These context-dependent consequences likely drive the exclusive association between <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutation and DIPG.</p><p id="P6">Principal Component Analysis using the 1000 most variable probesets shows that HGG samples clustered by tumor location with no segregation of DIPGs by their <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutation status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3g</xref>). Genes involved in regulation of immune system processes were significantly different between DIPGs with and without <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutation (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, p=0.0002, FDR=0.26%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 10</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Structural variants generating fusion genes are common, and were identified in 47% of pediatric HGG, in equal proportions of DIPGs and NBS-HGGs, from transcriptome and WGS data. Gene fusions involving the kinase domain of each of the three neurotrophin receptor (<italic>NTRK)</italic> genes and five different N-terminal fusion partners, were identified in 4% of DIPGs and 10% of NBS-HGGs. Notably, 40% (4/10) of NBS-HGGs in children younger than 3 years old contained an <italic>NTRK</italic> fusion gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Tables 7 and 8</xref>).

NTRK fusion genes have recently been identified at low frequency in low-grade pediatric astrocytomas as well as adult glioblastomas<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Two of the five <italic>NTRK</italic> fusions found in our cohort, <italic>TPM3-NTRK1</italic> and <italic>ETV6-NTRK3</italic>, were previously identified in other cancer types and shown to be oncogenic<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">To test the ability of <italic>NTRK</italic> fusion genes to drive glioma formation, we implanted <italic>Tp53</italic>-null primary mouse astrocytes transduced with retrovirus expressing FLAG-tagged TPM3-NTRK1 or BTBD1-NTRK3 into mouse brain. Both NTRK fusions induced high-grade astrocytomas with very short latency and complete penetrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.4</xref>). The resulting tumors showed elevated levels of phospho-Akt and phospho-p42/44 Mapk, downstream indicators of PI3K and MAPK pathway activation.</p><p id="P9">Although <italic>NTRK</italic> activating fusions were specifically found at high frequency in infant tumors, activation of RTK/RAS/PI3K signaling through other mutations was frequent across the entire cohort, occurring in 69% of DIPGs and 67% of NBS-HGGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref> and Online Methods). In contrast to previous reports detecting <italic>EGFRvIII</italic> expression in pediatric HGG<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>, we only detected <italic>EGFRvIII</italic> in one out of the 85 tumors analyzed by WGS or RNA seq.</p><p id="P10">In addition to recurrent <italic>histone H3, ATRX</italic> and <italic>SETD2</italic> mutations reported previously,<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> frequent mutations of other histone writers and erasers, and chromatin remodeling genes, were also detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Interestingly, mutations in histone H3 writers were significantly more frequent in NBS glioblastomas (p=0.007), while mutations in histone erasers were not significantly different between DIPG and NBS-HGG (p=0.3). Although only <italic>ATRX</italic> mutations were highly recurrent, collectively this group of genes involved in epigenetic regulation was targeted by mutation in 22% of DIPGs and 48% of NBS-HGG, excluding <italic>histone H3</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). These mutations were often concurrent with missense mutations in <italic>histone H3</italic>. Indeed, including <italic>histone H3</italic> mutations, 91% of DIPGs, 70% of midline NBS-HGGs, and 48% of hemispheric NBS-HGGs contain mutations in histone and/or this subgroup of epigenetic regulators. pK27M H3.3 or H3.1 mutation results in a dominant loss of H3K27me3 in the entire cellular pool of histone H3<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>-<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>.

For treatment with LDN-193189, cells were incubated in standard astrocyte growth media <sup><xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup> with vehicle (DMSO) or LDN-193189 (1&#x003bc;M). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). 20&#x003bc;g of protein was resolved on 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected with antibodies targeting p-SMAD1/5 (Cell Signaling, 9516, 1:1000), total SMAD1/5/8 (Santa Cruz, sc-6031, 1:500), p-p38MAPK (Invitrogen, 44-684G, 1:1000), total p38MAPK (Cell Signaling, 9212, 1:1000), FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804, 1:1000) and tubulin (Santa Cruz, sc-23948, 1:1000).

The initial criterion is oscillation between 2 main CNV states <sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>, which were found in 15 HGG tumors in this study. Most recently, Korbel and Campbell <sup><xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> proposed four potential criteria for assessing chromothripsis: 1) clustering of breakpoints; 2) randomness of DNA fragment joins; 3) randomness of DNA fragment order; and 4) ability to walk the derivative chromosome. Since randomness of DNA fragment order (Criterion 3) was not entirely valid, even in Korbel and Campbell&#x02019;s own analysis, we decided not to evaluate this feature. For the 13 tumors in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 12</xref>, we performed Bartlett&#x02019;s goodness-of-fit test for exponential distribution to assess whether the distribution of SV breakpoints in each tumor departs from the null hypothesis of random distribution. A significant departure from random distribution supports clustering of SV breakpoints. To evaluate whether there is any bias in the DNA fragment joints categorized by the SV types (<italic>i.e</italic>. deletion, tandem duplication, head-to-head re-arrangements and tail-to-tail re-arrangements), we applied goodness-of-fit test separately for inter- and intra-chromosomal events with a minimum of 5 SVs. A significant <italic>p</italic> value suggests biased fragment joins, which would <italic>not</italic> support chromothripsis. When both inter- and intra-chromosomal data are available, we reported the lower <italic>p</italic> value to represent a more conservative assessment of the random distribution for DNA fragment joints.</p><p id="P40">Details of Tumor Purity and Tumor Heterogeneity Estimations, and Tumor Evolution Analysis are included in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Note</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS573627-supplement-1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1553" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>2</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS573627-supplement-2.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1557" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S14"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the St. Jude Children&#x02019;s Research Hospital &#x02013; Washington University Pediatric Cancer Genome Project, ALSAC of St Jude Children&#x02019;s Research Hospital, and by grants from the NIH (P01 CA096832 to SJB, JZ, and DWE, and R01 CA135554 to SJB), The Cure Starts Now Foundation and Smile for Sophie Forever Foundation, and by Tyler&#x02019;s Treehouse and Musicians Against Childhood Cancer.

Notably, there were no mutations in writers or erasers of K27, which is directly mutated at high frequency in DIPG, and to a lesser degree in NBS-HGG.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms-573627-f0004"/></fig><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>CIRCOS plots showing the range of structural alterations in pediatric HGG</title><p>CIRCOS plots display the genome by chromosome in a circular plot, and depict structural genetic variants, including DNA copy number alterations, intra- and inter-chromosomal translocations, and non-sequence mutations.

The SNVs and indels for these two cases were too numerous to include on the plot for these two cases. The hypermutator tumor with more than 800,000 somatic mutations had an extremely stable genome (SJHGG003_D), while the second tumor with approximately 100-fold fewer SNVs, carried typical genomic copy number and structural abnormalities as seen in other HGGs (SJHGG003_A), thus demonstrating the broad range and complexity of mutations associated with germline <italic>PMS2</italic> mutation. SJHGG016_D is an infant NBS-HGG with a <italic>TPM3-NTRK1</italic> fusion and very stable genome. SJHGG027_D is an NBS-HGG from a patient with A-T, showing a relatively stable genome. This tumor sample was collected prior to radiotherapy. SJHGG004_D, is a DIPG with chromothripsis driving <italic>BTBD1-NTRK3</italic> fusion, shown in more detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>. SJHGG044_D is an NBS-HGG showing dramatic chromothripsis. For the examples of chromothripsis, the names of genes disrupted by structural variants were too numerous to display.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms-573627-f0005"/></fig></floats-group></article>
