The presence of CAFs is a strong predictor of poor prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Despite significant progress in determining the role of CAFs in tumor progression, the mechanisms contributing to their activation remain poorly characterized, in part due to fibroblast heterogeneity and the scarcity of reliable fibroblast surface markers. To search for such markers in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), we applied a novel approach that uses RNA-sequencing data derived from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). Specifically, our strategy allowed for an unbiased identification of genes whose expression was closely associated with a set of bona fide stroma-specific transcripts, namely the interstitial collagens COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL3A1. Among the top hits were genes involved in cellular matrix remodeling and tumor invasion and migration, including platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR&#x003b2;), which was found to be the highest-ranking receptor protein genome-wide. Similar analyses performed on ten additional TCGA cancer datasets revealed that other tumor types shared CAF markers with OSCC, including PDGFR&#x003b2;, which was found to significantly correlate with the reference collagen expression in ten of the 11 cancer types tested. Subsequent immunostaining of OSCC specimens demonstrated that PDGFR&#x003b2; was abundantly expressed in stromal fibroblasts of all tested cases (12/12), while it was absent in tumor cells, with greater specificity than other known markers such as alpha smooth muscle actin or podoplanin (3/11). Overall, this study identified PDGFR&#x003b2; as a novel marker of stromal activation in OSCC, and further characterized a list of promising candidate CAF markers that may be relevant to other carcinomas. Our novel approach provides for a fast and accurate method to identify CAF markers without the need for large-scale immunostaining experiments.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR 44883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trojanowska</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was in part supported by NIH grant R01 AR 44883, and by the Evans Center for Interdisciplinary Biomedical Research ARC on &#x0201c;Etiology and Pathogenesis of Oral Cancer (EPOC)&#x0201d; at Boston University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bumc.bu.edu/evanscenteribr/">http://www.bumc.bu.edu/evanscenteribr/</ext-link>).

CAFs, due to their ability to produce and dynamically modulate extracellular matrix (ECM), play a particularly important role in tumor invasion and subsequent metastatic colonization [<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. CAFs also produce angiogenic factors, proteases, growth factors, immune response-modulating proteins, anti-apoptotic proteins, and signaling molecules&#x02014;all highly relevant to tumor biology. The cross-talk between tumor cells and CAFs is bi-directional, with fibroblasts evolving in parallel with tumor cells and undergoing phenotypic modifications in response to changes occurring in tumors [<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The specific mechanisms underlying these complex interactions are only beginning to be elucidated and are likely to be influenced by the type of tumor and the local tissue microenvironment.</p><p>The activated tumor stroma shares some similarities with generic wound repair, as well as tissue fibrosis. It can be viewed as a biological response to a disrupted or damaged epithelial layer with stromal activation representing a repair process to restore tissue integrity and homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The origin of CAFs can be diverse and involve both local and distant reservoirs. Locally, CAFs can arise from resident tissue fibroblasts, where TGF&#x003b2;, as well as a stiffening matrix can promote their differentiation to alpha smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;SMA)-positive myofibroblasts [<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Alternative local sources may include mesenchymal or adipose-derived stem cells (MSC or ASC), as well as endothelial cells that can give rise to CAFs through endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EnMT). In some tumors, epithelial tumor cells may acquire a CAF-like phenotype through epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). The contribution of bone marrow-derived MSCs and circulating CD34+ fibrocytes was also documented in several tumor models [<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The importance of CAFs in oral cancer is supported by several reports that show correlation between the presence of &#x003b1;SMA-positive fibroblast cells and poor prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In a large study of OSCC patients, the abundance of myofibroblasts was the best independent predictor of patient mortality [<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, the source of these phenotypically-active fibroblastic cells in OSCC lesions and the mechanisms underlying their activation remain poorly understood. The progress in this field is hindered by the lack of reliable fibroblast-specific markers owing to the heterogeneity and remarkable plasticity of fibroblast cells. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis aimed at identifying such markers using high-throughput, genome-wide expression data is yet to be performed.</p><p>Here, we report our evaluation of PDGFR&#x003b2;&#x02019;s role as a potential CAF marker in human OSCCs through a combination of high-throughput gene expression analyses of large primary tissue datasets and experimental validation using a panel of OSCC specimens and cell lines. To allow for an unbiased identification of fibroblast-specific markers in OSCC, we searched for genes whose expression closely associated with typical fibroblast-specific genes, namely, the interstitial collagens COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL3A1, using mRNA sequencing data derived from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). We identified several candidate CAF-specific markers in OSCC, including receptor protein PDGFR&#x003b2;, among the top hits. Subsequent analyses of OSCC specimens demonstrated that PDGFR&#x003b2; was abundantly expressed in stromal fibroblasts, while it was absent in tumor cells, with greater specificity compared to other markers such as &#x003b1;SMA or podoplanin. By then extending the collagen-based interrogation to multiple cancer types, we highlighted the potential importance of PDGFR&#x003b2; as a marker in other cancers. Overall, our data suggest that PDGFR&#x003b2; can serve as a reliable marker for identification of CAFs in OSCC, and offer a list of additional candidates that may serve as an important resource for CAF detection and diagnostic strategy development in cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>TCGA RNA-sequencing data processing</title><p>RNA-sequencing (RNASeq) data was downloaded for TCGA Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC) cancer cohort using Firehose v0.4.3 corresponding to the February 4th 2015 Firehose release. RNASeq version 2 data pertaining to Level 3 RSEM-normalized gene expression values was used. OSCC data was derived from the HNSC dataset by only including patients that corresponded to OSCC anatomic neoplasm subtypes, namely alveolar ridge, base of tongue, buccal mucosa, floor of mouth, oral cavity and oral tongue (N = 352). Adjacent morphologically normal epithelial (AE) samples were defined using TCGA sample barcoding information and used as a control group.

The described NN analysis was applied to each dataset, similar to OSCC (see Genome-wide collagen Nearest Neighbor (NN) analysis), yielding a ranked list of genes for each dataset sorted in decreasing order of Pearson correlation coefficient. The top 50 genes for each cancer type were then tested for enrichment against each of the other cancer types by a Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (KS) test (using the ranked list in the given cancer type as a reference). This yielded pairwise KS D statistics for all 11 cancer types. Since enrichment for a given pair of cancer types was tested in both directions, the two values were averaged. Cancer types were then clustered using hierarchical clustering with average linkage for the agglomeration rule.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Stromal score analysis</title><p>Correlation of stroma scores obtained using the ESTIMATE algorithm with mean collagen expression was computed (Pearson r = 0.88, p-value &#x0003c; 0.0001).

Identification of CAFs remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of CAF markers across different cancer types. Our novel approach, combining a high-throughput gene expression analysis of large primary tissue datasets with experimental validation of OSCC specimens, permits relatively rapid and comprehensive characterization of CAF markers without having to resort to large-scale immunostaining experiments. Taken together, our results suggest that PDGFR&#x003b2; is the most consistent cellular marker of stromal activation both during early and late stages of OSCC progression, and could be utilized for the isolation and further characterization of stromal fibroblasts in OSCC. Our analyses also suggest that PDGFR&#x003b2; may be similarly relevant in additional carcinomas, however, this should be further investigated.</p><p>A large study of several tumors, which did not include OSCC, systematically evaluated expression of PDGFR&#x003b2; as well as PDGFR&#x003b1; on fibroblasts and pericytes by immunohistochemistry [<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The data revealed a variable expression of these receptors in different tumors, with fibroblast expression of PDGFR&#x003b2; most common in lung and colon tumors. Interestingly, stromal expression of PDGFR&#x003b2; in breast cancer correlated with poor prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is important to note that in our study PDGFR&#x003b2; was not expressed on carcinoma cells, however with the limited number of specimens analyzed, we cannot exclude a possibility that PDGFR&#x003b2; may be expressed in a subset of OSCCs, as has been shown for other cancers [<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Interestingly, many of the top-ranking ECM-specific genes in our analysis have previously been evaluated in OSCC and linked to tumor progression. Of particular interest are matricellular proteins, SPARC and POSTN. Elevated expression of both genes was documented in OSCC [<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and correlated with the presence of metastases [<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

On the other hand, increased hypermethylation of NID2 promoter was observed in OSCC samples, indicative of decreased gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0154645.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, expression of NID2 in the TCGA OSCC dataset was higher in tumor samples compared to adjacent normal epithelia with a sustained elevated expression in tumor grades 1 to 3 (data not shown).
