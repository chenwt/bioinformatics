This study demonstrates the accuracy of genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) of a large collection of autotetraploid potato cultivars using next-generation sequencing. It is still costly to reach sufficient read depths on a genome wide scale, across the cultivated gene pool. Therefore, we enriched cultivar-specific DNA sequencing libraries using an in-solution hybridisation method (SureSelect). This complexity reduction allowed to confine our study to 807 target genes distributed across the genomes of 83 tetraploid cultivars and one reference (DM 1&#x02013;3 511). Indexed sequencing libraries were paired-end sequenced in 7 pools of 12 samples using Illumina HiSeq2000. After filtering and processing the raw sequence data, 12.4 Gigabases of high-quality sequence data was obtained, which mapped to 2.1 Mb of the potato reference genome, with a median average read depth of 63&#x000d7; per cultivar. We detected 129,156 sequence variants and genotyped the allele copy number of each variant for every cultivar. In this cultivar panel a variant density of 1 SNP/24 bp in exons and 1 SNP/15 bp in introns was obtained. The average minor allele frequency (MAF) of a variant was 0.14. Potato germplasm displayed a large number of relatively rare variants and/or haplotypes, with 61% of the variants having a MAF below 0.05. A very high average nucleotide diversity (&#x003c0;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0107) was observed. Nucleotide diversity varied among potato chromosomes. Several genes under selection were identified. Genotyping-by-sequencing results, with allele copy number estimates, were validated with a KASP genotyping assay. This validation showed that read depths of &#x0223c;60&#x02013;80&#x000d7; can be used as a lower boundary for reliable assessment of allele copy number of sequence variants in autotetraploids. Genotypic data were associated with traits, and alleles strongly influencing maturity and flesh colour were identified.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by a grant from the Dutch technology foundation STW, project WPB-7926.

They can be assayed and exploited as high-throughput molecular markers and are widely used for marker assisted and genomic selection, association analysis and mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL), and haplotype and pedigree analysis in several crops and model plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Grattapaglia1">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Moose1">[7]</xref>. Genotyping of DNA sequence variants in highly heterozygous polyploid species, such as potato (<italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic>), is more challenging than in diploid species, because a given gene may be represented by up to four different alleles per locus per genotype. Therefore, genetic analysis in tetraploid potato requires a genotyping system that can distinguish among alleles and quantify the allele copy number. In tetraploid species, the possible allele copy number (zygosity) categories include nulliplex (0), simplex (1), duplex (2), triplex (3), and quadruplex (4).</p><p>Several studies have shown that direct resequencing of amplicons by Sanger sequencing is sufficiently quantitative to allow the simultaneous discovery and genotyping of sequence variants in polyploids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Rickert1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Sattarzadeh1">[9]</xref>. Amplicon sequencing is a reasonable method to analyse a single or small number of target gene(s), but beyond that scale, more effort is required to design unique primers and optimize PCR parameters to ensure equal amplification of all alleles. Furthermore, in species like potato that exhibit high nucleotide diversity, the many indels usually create uninterpretable sequence reads that further reduces the throughput of Sanger-based amplicon resequencing. With the introduction of the next-generation massively-parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies, several novel approaches have been developed to discover, sequence and genotype not tens, but hundreds to thousands of genes simultaneously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Hamilton1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Craig1">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Myles1">[14]</xref>. Similar to Sanger sequencing, MPS can be used directly to genotype sequence variants. Using the former technology, genotype data are retrieved from chromatogram peak intensities at variant positions. For MPS, accumulation of sequence reads provides allele copy number estimates for each variant. Accuracy of this allele copy number estimate is dependent on sequencing depth. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) of tetraploids will require higher read depth compared to diploids. In humans, for example, a sequence read depth of 30&#x02013;35&#x000d7; is considered appropriate for accurate genotyping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Pelak1">[15]</xref>. In order to identify each allele in tetraploids a simulation model suggested a read depth of at least 15&#x000d7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Griffin1">[13]</xref>. However, accurate genotyping (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.95) of an autotetraploid organism implies also to discriminate digenic-simplex (<italic>aaab</italic>) as opposed to digenic-duplex (<italic>aabb</italic>) zygosity. Based on a binominal distribution this will require a sequence depth of at least 48&#x000d7;.</p><p>To achieve an increase in read depth, the portion of the genome that is sequenced can be reduced by applying, for example, RNAseq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Hamilton1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Gore2">[16]</xref>, restriction enzyme based complexity reduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Elshire1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-vanOrsouw1">[18]</xref>, or sequence capture methods such as SureSelect, Nimblegen, and Raindance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Gnirke1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Kiss1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Nijman1">[21]</xref>. RNAseq is less suitable for GBS, since alleles may vary in transcription level across genes, tissues and stages, and thus may generate inaccurate genotyping data. Methods based on restriction enzyme treatments, on the other hand, are more likely to target non-coding parts of the genome, producing less useful data for functional gene analysis. Furthermore, restriction-based methods cannot target specific regions of interest, and nucleotide variants in the restriction site may interfere with digestion and cause null alleles. Sequence capture methods like SureSelect use oligonucleotide baits designed to bind to regions of interest, which can be specifically selected and enriched before sequencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Davey1">[22]</xref>. For example, whole exomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Mamanova1">[23]</xref> or regions associated with particular traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Gnirke1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Hodges1">[24]</xref> can be targeted.

We subsequently used this data to identify sequence variants within and across cultivars and to call the genotypes of resequenced individuals. The accuracy of genotyping-by-sequencing was validated using a SNP genotyping assay. The resulting marker dataset is useful for describing allele frequencies, nucleotide diversity, and population structure in potato, and for validating QTLs via association analysis. Our approach is an efficient means of producing data for the design of both high and low-density SNP genotyping assays applicable to a wide range of potato cultivars, and the resulting tools can be used to address questions in population genetics and marker-trait association research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design of the Capture Library</title><p>A custom-designed SureSelect capture library containing 57,054 RNA oligonucleotide baits of 120-bp length each was developed.

To pair the adapter strands, mixtures of the forward and reverse strands (each 50 &#x000b5;M in TE) were incubated at 95&#x000b0;C for 2.5 minutes, followed by a cool down (&#x02212;1&#x000b0;C/30 sec.) to 25&#x000b0;C and subsequently diluted to a working concentration of 12.5 &#x000b5;M. DNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext DNA Sample Master Mix Set 1 (New England Biolabs). Purifications were carried out between end-repair, dA-tailing, and adapter ligation steps using AMPure XP beads (Agencourt Bioscience). To index the 84 potato DNA extracts, each of the twelve unique adapters was ligated to seven different DNA samples by mixing adapter and DNA in a molar ratio of approximately 20&#x02236;1. After the initial ligation of 15 minutes at 20&#x000b0;C, samples were held at 4&#x000b0;C overnight and purified using AMPure XP beads.

The use of index-specific blocking oligos to reduce non-specific pull-down due to adapter-adapter hybridisation can also be avoided when pre-amplification is excluded, as non-amplified Y-adapters do not concatenate.

The expected mutation rate or pairwise nucleotide diversity was set to 0.01. In order to include an alternate allele as a variant, supporting bases required a minimum base quality (BQ) of at least 13, and at least one supporting alignment was required to have BQ&#x02265;20. Furthermore, the alternate allele had to be observed in at least 5 reads and represent at least 12.5% of the observations of reads at that locus within a single potato sample.

For one of the two cultivars duplicated in the KASP assay, all genotype calls were identical between replicates, and for the other cultivar, only two genotype calls varied between replicates. The expected KASP genotyping error rate of this subset of SNPs is thus very low (0.4%). For concordance analysis, expected genotype calls were obtained from these 270 KASP assay SNPs and observed genotype calls were obtained by the GBS results. Scored as either homozygous (i.e., nulliplex or quadruplex) or heterozygous (i.e., simplex, duplex, or triplex), 97.9% of the homozygous and 99.9% of the heterozygous GBS calls were concordant with the results of KASP genotyping. When heterozygous GBS calls were split into simplex, duplex and triplex categories, overall concordance with KASP genotyping dropped to 94.4%. For duplex calls, which were most difficult to classify, only 90.3% of the calls were concordant. We therefore applied a genotype quality (GQ) filter to validate GBS/KASP concordance in the five discrete zygosity classes. A threshold of GQ&#x02265;26 was required to reduce the number of discordant duplex calls below 5%. Applying the GQ26 filter to the complete set of 129,156 sequence variants yielded 74.8% of variants with an assigned genotype call, with an average of 63 out of 84 cultivars genotyped per variant position.

Below, we will argue that our method of target enrichment was of great importance for genotyping accuracy. Target enrichment allowed the achievement of sufficient read depth. Furthermore, bait-hybridisation enrichment allowed exclusion of complex multi-copy or repetitive regions of the genome, and avoidance of potential difficulties in distinguishing allelic variants from paralogous sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Ng1">[51]</xref>. We focussed on a single copy genes, e.g. from the set of conserved orthologous sequence genes (COSII) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Wu1">[30]</xref> and used uniquely mapped genes to define the genomic target regions. It is not excluded that individual potato genotypes may be polymorphic for specific gene duplications (Copy Number Variants). Indeed, for some genes read depths were observed twice or more than average in specific cultivars, suggesting gene duplications in these cultivars (data not shown). In these rare cases the duplication maps to the same location on the reference genome and could affect genotype calling. However, we feel confident that this is a relatively rare phenomenon, because the validation of genotype calling with KASP assays showed high concordance.</p><p>The SureSelect enrichment method yielded sequences of which 45% aligned to the target sequences. Other in-solution DNA enrichment studies in plant species have not yet been published, but this on target percentage is consistent with the 40&#x02013;50% reached in human and animal studies that have used the SureSelect system for target enrichment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Gnirke1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Harismendy1">[40]</xref>.</p><p>To reduce sequencing costs we multiplexed twelve cultivars in a sequencing pool. The custom index adapters have proven valuable as multiplex adapters; no index-specific bias in read counts was observed and over 96% of the generated reads were assigned to cultivars. The inclusion of these indices permits tracking of the alleles&#x02019; cultivar source so that zygosity can be determined in individual genotypes, allowing GBS of many individuals. Larger numbers of indices can be easily created <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Elshire1">[17]</xref> and allow multiplexing of tens to hundreds of individuals. We found consistent enrichment across all indexed samples, and virtually all target sequences were covered covered at a sufficient depth, with a median average read depth of 88&#x000d7; per cultivar for nuclear target sequences (63&#x000d7; for the extended &#x0201c;accessible&#x0201d; genome). The read depth of nuclear sequences was reduced by the large number of cpDNA reads (60% of total reads) generated in this study. This large share of cpDNA reads was unforeseen in view of the 4% share of cpDNA baits used for target enrichment. In retrospect, this large proportion is almost certainly due to the copy number variation between nuclear DNA and cpDNA. The latter is present in about 100 copies per plastid and about 100 plastids per leaf cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Daniell1">[52]</xref>. Hence, bait library design should avoid sequences from, or homologous to extra-nuclear DNA.</p><p>In the estimate of allele copy number we assume no ascertainment bias; i.e., the relative number of allele-specific sequencing reads is proportional to the allele copy number. However, in-solution hybridisation based target enrichment may bias the pool of captured DNA targets that are sequenced towards those variants which preferentially hybridize and have higher sequence similarity to the reference bait sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Gnirke1">[19]</xref>. Anticipating this bias, we used a high probe tiling redundancy (6&#x000d7;, one RNA bait every &#x0223c;20 bp) to reduce allele-specific bias during hybridization. Furthermore, we relaxed mapping quality settings for counting the reads mapped to the reference genome. In a preliminary genotype analysis performed after sequence variant calling, only reads with a very high mapping quality (&#x02265;MQ30) were used to determine the relative number of allele-specific sequencing reads. This caused a large ascertainment bias due to severe underrepresentation of non-reference alleles. Inclusion of reads with a lower mapping quality (MQ&#x02265;13) strongly reduced this ascertainment bias. When the GQ-filter was applied, 95% of the sequence variants were concordant, as shown by the KASP validation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062355-t005">Table 5</xref>). The average read ratio for these calls shows no bias. We conclude from this study that hybridisation based capture bias hardly affected genotype calling, even in potato germplasm where reference and non-reference reads often have only about 95% sequence homology. We have not examined the genotyping accuracy of MNPs or indels, but larger indels are likely to reduce capture and mapping efficiency.</p><p>We used a mapping approach to align the sequencing data to the potato genome sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Xu1">[25]</xref>. An advantage of alignment to an annotated reference genome is that it allows prediction of whether a sequence variant falls within or near a gene of interest, and whether it is expected to cause a functional change in the protein product (e.g. synonymous vs. non-synonymous) that might alter the enzyme activity of the protein. This can be very useful in determining whether a particular sequence variant is likely to be responsible for a phenotype of interest. We observed approximately twenty-five thousand non-synonymous variants, with 50 variants that cause premature stop codons in 43 out of 807 genes. Hence, natural diversity of potato offers a substantial resource for the identification of knockouts for gene-function studies.</p><p>A disadvantage of mapping sequence reads toward a reference sequence is that structural variation like chromosome rearrangements, inversions and large (transposon) insertions are likely to be missed. Structural variation between reads and reference genome complicates the mapping of reads. This disadvantage can be partly avoided by <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, but computational difficulties associated with the assembly of highly diverse polyploid species like potato makes mapping sequence reads to a reference sequence a more straightforward approach. In this study we did not systematically look for structural variants, nor did we consider gene copy number variants (CNVs). Methods for detecting both structural variants and CNVs using a mapping approach have however been developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Lam1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Krumm1">[54]</xref> and could be applied.

In a previous study in potato, SNPs have been identified in cDNA of a set of three to six &#x02013; mainly North-American &#x02013; potato cultivars, using Sanger EST-sequences available in GeneBank from three potato cultivars, and using high-throughput transcriptome sequencing on three additional cultivars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Hamilton1">[2]</xref>. The SNPs identified in this relatively small sample, are expected to mainly represent the common SNPs from all coding sequences, whereas this study included introns and sampled rare alleles. Based on exons sequenced in both studies an overlap of only 2,572 variants was expected between our 129,156 variants and the 69,586 mapped SNPs identified by Hamilton et al. (2011). We detected 2,362 (92%) of these SNPs. As only one cultivar was included in both studies (cv. Bintje), the 8% of variants undetected in our study might represent rare variants more specific to the North American cultivars predominantly sampled by Hamilon et al. (2011), or may be false positive/negatives in either study. As a result of the at least 14-fold larger sample size and larger geographic diversity targeted by our study, we find approximately 15,000 extra variants in the exon sequences covered by both studies. These include multi-allelic sequence variants at 6% of the base positions where SNPs were called by Hamilon et al. (2011). When these SNPs are assumed bi-allelic, they may complicate genotype calling in a SNP genotyping array.</p><p>An important feature affecting the application of sequence variants as molecular markers is their MAF, which influences the type of information provided by the marker in different populations.

This paper presents an L-shaped distribution of the MAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062355-g005">Figure 5</xref>) which points to an abundance of rare alleles in the cultivated gene pool. In comparison with another vegetatively propagated outbreeder, <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>, the average MAF of potato (0.14) is lower. <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> has an average MAF of 0.24 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Lijavetzky1">[62]</xref>. In a population of 80 grapevine cultivars, over 80% of SNP variants had a MAF above 0.10, while in potato we found only 48% of the variants had a MAF above 0.10. We expect that wild species introgressions with low MAF contribute significantly to the high variant density in potato.</p><p>To investigate whether we could identify potential signatures of selection in the potato genome, we examined the nucleotide diversity of loci along the physical position of each chromosome. Nucleotide diversity values were very variable both between and within chromosomes. Chromosomes 5 and 11 exhibited highest nucleotide diversity. Introgression of resistance genes from wild species is a likely explanation, as chromosome 5 and 11 contain the largest clusters of resistance genes, conferring resistance to a wide variety of pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Bakker1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Jupe1">[64]</xref>. In contrast, overall nucleotide diversity was reduced on chromosome 10. Some of the most conserved genes in the dataset are located near the position of the skin colour, tuber shape and eye depth QTL on chromosome 10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Li1">[65]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-VanEck2">[67]</xref>. An eye-catching difference between commercial western germplasm and Latin American land races are the highly variable tuber shapes and anthocyanin pigmentation patterns in tuber skin and flesh. Hence this reduced nucleotide diversity could well reflect a selective sweep.</p><p>Within all chromosomes, individual genes were found with reduced nucleotide diversity as well. It is not possible at this stage to say whether these genes themselves, rather than closely linked loci are under selection, but some of these genes are good candidate genes for phenotypic traits under strong selection like day-length dependent tuberisation and some resistance traits. An example of a good direct candidate gene is the <italic>CONSTANS</italic> gene that has been shown to affect the day-length regulation of tuber induction in potato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-GonzlezSchain1">[68]</xref> and is the second most conserved gene we sampled on chromosome 2.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Chloroplast Types and Population Structure</title><p>The presence of an extreme cytoplasmic bottleneck in cultivated potato has been described before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Provan1">[69]</xref>. Five main cpDNA types (A, S, C, W and T) and a number of sub-types have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Hosaka1">[70]</xref>. The A haplotype is most frequent in Group Andigena and the T haplotype in Chilean S. <italic>tuberosum</italic> and modern cultivars. Diploid <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> Group Phureja is assigned to the S-type and wild material like <italic>S. vernei</italic> and <italic>S. demissum</italic> to the W-type. Our phylogeny of chloroplast haplotype data supports previous work suggesting that most modern cultivars have chloroplasts resembling those of the <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> Group Tuberosum genepool (T-Type) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Hosaka2">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Spooner1">[72]</xref>. Two cultivars have a W-type haplotype originating from <italic>S.vernei</italic> (VE71&#x02013;105 and VTN62-33-3) and thirteen cultivars have a W-type haplotype originating from <italic>S. demissum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-VanBerloo1">[73]</xref>. These chlorotypes have been introduced during introgression of resistance traits. More remarkably, four heirloom cultivars in our sample (cv. Belle De Fontenay, cv. Kepplestone Kidney, cv. Home Guard, and cv. Shamrock) have chloroplast haplotypes phylogenetically close to that from the <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> Group Phureja (S-Type). This chlorotype might represent the <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> Group Andigena type (A-Type) that was more common in cultivars from before the 1840s late blight (<italic>Phytophtra infestance</italic>) epidemic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Powell1">[74]</xref>.</p><p>The genome-wide population structure of this study largely corresponds with the structure observed using AFLP markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Dhoop2">[48]</xref>. While the AFLP study distinguished five divergent cultivar groups, we identified four, with one outlier forming its own group. Both analyses support genetic similarity within heirloom cultivars and within starch cultivars, but the high-throughput approach used here did not support separate groups of fresh consumption, processing (crisps or fries), and additional miscellaneous cultivars. Instead, PCA analysis suggested the existence of a cluster of cultivars originating from continental Europe, consisting mainly of processing cultivars, along with a cluster containing cultivars of mixed, world-wide origin. Given that the first three components of the principal component analysis account for less than 15% of the total variation, it seems that there is little population structure within the cultivated potato gene pool, as was also observed by D&#x02019;hoop et al. (2010).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Concordance between GBS and KASP Genotyping in an Autotetraploid</title><p>In diploids it is known that the accuracy of variant detection and genotyping depends on sequence depth and the mode of sexual reproduction (homozygous selfers vs. heterozygous outbreeders) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Kenny1">[75]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Tewhey1">[76]</xref>. Genotyping variants in polyploid species, such as potato, is more challenging than in diploids, because a given gene may be represented not only by a number of different alleles, but also by different zygosity levels. We therefore tested the accuracy of genotype calls made by GBS by testing a small subset of binary SNPs using an independent KASP genotyping platform. The genotype calls of GBS were found to be over 99% consistent with KASP when scored as homozygous or heterozygous. We applied a genotype quality (GQ) parameter to account for differences in read depth requirement across all zygosity classes (nulliplex, simplex, duplex, triplex, and quadruplex). Over 95% of duplex calls (the zygosity class with lowest consistency between GBS and KASP) were consistent between the two genotyping methods at a threshold of GQ26. Overall concordance of the five zygosity classes was 98.4% at this threshold. In conclusion, for genotyping autotetraploids a GQ26 is recommended to achieve reliable genotype calls using our pipeline. In a more general sense, our results indicate that read depths of 60&#x02013;80x are sufficient for reliable, dosage diagnostic genotype calls in GBS in autotetraploid potato.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Association Analysis using GBS</title><p>The GBS dataset was tested for its performance in GWAS. Even though the data do not represent a complete genome, but a focussed survey at 807 loci randomly distributed across the genome, and although the number of 83 potato cultivars severely limits statistical power, several interesting traits could be mapped. It appeared that the 129,156 sequence variants provide a robust dataset to detect alleles influencing monogenic traits such as plant maturity and tuber flesh colour (this paper) and various other monogenic traits such as tuber shape and pathogen resistance (unpublished data). The sequence variants associated with tuber flesh colour and plant maturity are indeed located in and near the respective candidate genes <italic>CHY2</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Wolters1">[34]</xref> and <italic>StCDF1</italic>. The latter was recently shown to be the causal gene involved in potato day-length signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Kloosterman1">[77]</xref>. We observed that a simplistic dominant model (0/1 data reflecting absence/presence of an allele) gave similar GWAS results as the more detailed additive model (0/1/2/3/4 copies of the allele). This makes sense, since 61% of the sequence variants have a MAF below 0.05. If such variants follow Hardy-Weinberg expectations, in practice the minor allele will be absent in &#x0223c;81% of the cultivars and simplex in &#x0223c;17% of the cultivars, while a duplex cultivar is hardly expected (1.4%). This notion, that many sequence variants have a low allele frequency, points to the advantage that the input GBS data does not require the more stringent genotype quality filtering necessary for accurate estimation of allele copy number.</p><p>GWAS requires marker densities surpassing the decay in LD. In this study only a fraction (2.1 Mb, 0.25%) of the 840 Mb potato genome was re-sequenced, but in most cases the genetic distance between our 807 candidate genes will be less than the estimated LD decay of 4&#x02013;10 cM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Dhoop2">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0062355-Simko1">[56]</xref>. For the data generated here, both short- and long-range LD still needs to be analysed. Although short-range LD could have been analysed, long-range LD requires the robust ordering of superscaffolds of the DM reference genome into physical chromosomes, preferentially in combination with an aligned high-resolution genetic linkage map. These maps and pseudo-molecules are currently being developed to estimate LD decay on both genetic (cM) and physical (bp) scale in the near future. We expect that the identified sequence variants and regions covered in this study are in LD with most functional alleles. We also expect that identification of haplotypes and phasing of the sequence variants can be achieved by using a &#x02018;read-backed phasing&#x02019; approach (unpublished data) for use in a multiallelic GWAS analysis. Since a large number of genes in our study were either known candidate genes, or primary- and secondary metabolism genes, the annotated biochemical pathway may suggest a biological link between the gene underlying the sequence variants, and the QTL. Alternatively, the potato genome browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://solanaceae.plantbiology.msu.edu">http://solanaceae.plantbiology.msu.edu</ext-link>) will support the identification of candidate genes in proximity to QTL.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062355.s001"><label>Supporting Information S1</label><caption><p><bold>Supporting Tables and Figures.</bold></p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0062355.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062355.s002"><label>BED-file S1</label><caption><p><bold>SureSelect baits mapped (MQ&#x02265;37) to the superscaffolds of the DM reference genome.</bold></p><p>(BED)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0062355.s002.bed" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062355.s003"><label>BED-file S2</label><caption><p><bold>Accessible genome regions of the DM reference genome.</bold></p><p>(BED)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0062355.s003.bed" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062355.s004"><label>CSV-file S1</label><caption><p><bold>Annotations for sequence variants identified in the accessible genome, including allele copy numbers of each of the 84 samples.</bold></p><p>(GZ)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0062355.s004.gz" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="x-zip-compressed"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062355.s005"><label>FASTA-file S1</label><caption><p><bold>SureSelect RNA bait sequences.</bold></p><p>(FASTA)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0062355.s005.fasta" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062355.s006"><label>FASTA-file S2</label><caption><p><bold>SureSelect target sequences.</bold></p><p>(FASTA)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0062355.s006.fasta" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062355.s007"><label>VCF-file S1</label><caption><p><bold>Sequence variants and genotypes identified in the accessible potato DM genome of 84 samples.</bold></p><p>(GZ)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0062355.s007.gz" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="x-zip-compressed"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062355.s008"><label>VCF-file S2</label><caption><p><bold>Sequence variants identified in the chloroplast genome.</bold></p><p>(VCF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0062355.s008.vcf" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062355.s009"><label>XLS-file S1</label><caption><p><bold>Annotations for genomic SureSelect targets, including observed coverage in resequencing data.</bold></p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0062355.s009.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062355.s010"><label>XLS-file S2</label><caption><p><bold>Annotations for accessible genome regions, based on sequence data collected in this study.</bold></p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0062355.s010.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062355.s011"><label>XLS-file S3</label><caption><p><bold>Annotations of nucleotide diversity for accessible genes.</bold></p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0062355.s011.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Dr. Roeland Voorrips for genotyping the Kaspar markers and Dr. Joao Paulo and Ir.
