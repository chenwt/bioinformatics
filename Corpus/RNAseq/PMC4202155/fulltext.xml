In the present work, we investigated the expression of galectin-7 (gal-7) in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells and studied its functional relevance. Immunohistochemical analysis of gal-7 expression in tissue microarrays showed that while gal-7 was not detected in normal ovarian tissues, positive cytoplasmic staining of gal-7 was detected in epithelial cells in all EOC histological subtypes but was more frequent in high grade tumors and metastatic samples. Gal-7 expression correlated with a significant difference in the overall survival of patients with ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma. Furthermore, using human EOC cell lines, we found that gal-7 expression was induced by mutant p53. Mechanistically, Matrigel invasion assays and live cell imaging showed that gal-7 increased the invasive behavior of ovarian cancer cells by inducing MMP-9 and increasing cell motility. EOC cells can also secrete gal-7. Recombinant human gal-7 kills Jurkat T cells and human peripheral T cells, suggesting that gal-7 also has immunosuppressive properties. Taken together, our study validates the clinical significance of gal-7 overexpression in ovarian cancer and provides a rationale for targeting gal-7 to improve the outcome of patients with this disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>galectin-7</kwd><kwd>ovarian cancer</kwd><kwd>immunosupression</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>MMP-9</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) accounts for approximately 85&#x02013;90% of total ovarian cancers and is the leading cause of gynecologic malignancies in North America and worldwide [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite improvements in various treatments, the 5-year survival of patients with advanced stage disease remains less than 40%. Largely, this is due to the fact that EOC tends to be diagnosed at advanced stages, the lack of effective treatments for patients and incomplete understanding of the molecular underpinnings of the disease progression. Therefore, it is essential to identify potential biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets that are involved in ovarian cancer initiation, progression and outcome to help improve clinical outcomes.</p><p>Members of the galectin family are recognized for their ability to bind &#x003b2;-galactosides via their carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). They play an important role in several physiological processes including cell migration, programmed cell death and regulation of the immune response (as reviewed in [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). They are also involved in a number of pathological conditions including cancer. In fact, galectins have been shown to induce systemic and local immunosuppression by killing immune cells. They can also bind to the surface of tumor cells to form cell surface lattices that stabilize expression of key growth factor receptors. In doing this, galectins increase cell growth, motility, and the overall invasive properties of cancer cells [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, so far most of the attention has been focused on galectin-1 and galectin-3, and we still know very little about how gal-7 expression affects cancer progression and its distinctive role. Unlike other galectins, gal-7 is strictly expressed in epithelial cells. In fact, this galectin is generally considered to be a marker of epithelial differentiation. It is present in normal epithelial cells of various tissues and is rarely expressed in any other cell types including hematopoietic cells, muscle cells, neurons, fibroblasts, adipocytes, or endothelial cells. While gal-7 expression in normal epithelial cells has been relatively well documented, we are just beginning to understand its role in cancers of epithelial origin. For example, in breast cancer we found that gal-7 was exclusively expressed in aggressive subtypes including HER2-positive and basal-like breast cancer [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We also found that gal-7 expression in cell lines that express low or undetectable levels of gal-7 resulted in increased metastasis to the lung and bone and larger osteolytic lesions [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This is in contrast to earlier reports showing that gal-7 is absent in some types of malignant cells and may sensitize cells to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, while prior studies cannot predict whether any changes in gal-7 expression will result in resistance to apoptosis in epithelial cancers, differential expression patterns in epithelial cancers may represent a helpful biomarker. Differential expression of galectins may facilitate differential diagnoses if it is correlated with stage/grade, especially in cases where a morphological diagnosis is controversial. Accordingly, because galectins are implicated in a wide range of diseases, intensive efforts have been employed to identify highly selective and potent galectin inhibitors. In the present work, we investigated expression of gal-7 in EOC cells and studied its functional relevance.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title><italic>Gal-7</italic> expression is increased in ovarian cancer tumors</title><p>To study the role of gal-7 in ovarian cancer, we first conducted an <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of <italic>gal-7</italic> gene expression in EOC cells using publically available datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Interestingly, a microarray dataset (GDS1375) obtained from profiling a murine model of ovarian cancer indicated that while <italic>gal-7</italic> mRNA was rarely detectable at early and intermediate stages of transformation, it was expressed at significantly higher levels at later stages of transformation (P&#x0003c;0.001) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These data prompted us to assess gal-7 expression in human ovarian tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using TMAs constructed from samples obtained from a cohort of 112 patients with different EOC histological subtypes and containing core samples from matched normal adjacent tissues (n=17) and normal (n=7) ovarian tissues. While we found no detectable expression of gal-7 in normal ovarian tissues, including the single layer of ovarian surface epithelium, gal-7 positive staining was detected in epithelial cells in all EOC histological subtypes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">I</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B-C</xref>). Positive staining for gal-7 was seen primarily in the cytoplasm of tumor cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). No correlation was found between expression of gal-7, the age of the patients or the stage of the disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). However, we found that gal-7 was present more frequently in metastatic samples compared to non-metastatic samples (P&#x0003c;0.05) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Histopathological scoring further revealed that gal-7 expression was significantly higher in high grade, borderline and metastatic tumors when compared to benign tumors. Low grade tumors also had significantly lower scores than metastatic samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C and E</xref>). Analysis of the public RNAseq datasets obtained from the cBio Cancer Genomics Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cbioportal.org">http://cbioportal.org</ext-link>) also showed a significant correlation (P&#x0003c;0.03) between overexpression of <italic>gal-7</italic> mRNA and a lower overall survival of patients with ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table I</label><caption><title>Expression of gal-7 in ovarian tumors</title></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" valign="middle" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Gal-7 expression</th><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total</th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Positive (n=44)</th><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Negative (n=68)</th><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(n=112)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Normal</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (100 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adjacent</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17 (100 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Benign serous</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (50 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (50 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Benign mucinous</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (8.33 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (91.77 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bordeline serous</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (83.33 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (16.67 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bordeline mucinous</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (100 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Serous</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 (43.73 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18 (56.25 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mucinous</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (71.43 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (28.57 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Endometrioid</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (61.54 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (38.46 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Transitional cell</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (80 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (20 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clear cell</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (75 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (25 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Granular</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (100 %)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Expression of gal-7 in ovarian tissues</title><p>(A) mRNA expression of <italic>gal-7</italic> in EOC at different stages of transformation.

These data may explain why gal-7 is often constitutively expressed in cancer cells harboring mutant forms of p53 [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To determine whether a similar scenario exists in ovarian cancer, we tested whether mutant forms of p53 that are commonly expressed in ovarian cancer could regulate gal-7 expression. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) database, mutations at codons His175, Met243 and Arg273 in the <italic>p53</italic> gene are the most frequently occurring mutations in ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure S1</xref>) [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

However, we found gal-7 in the supernatants of both OVCAR-3, and SK-OV-3 cells transfected with an expression vector encoding human gal-7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The presence of gal-7 in the supernatants was confirmed by ELISA (with a range between 100 pcg/ml and 2.5 ng/ml). Confocal microscopy of permeabilized and non-permeabilized OVCAR-3 cells confirmed that endogenous gal-7 was also bound to the cell surface and in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Similar data were obtained using SK-OV-3 cells transfected with an expression vector encoding gal-7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).

The effect of gal-7 on apoptosis was dependent on its lectin activity, as tested in experiments using lactose as an inhibiting sugar (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Similar results were obtained using freshly isolated human PBMCs. Multiparametric analysis by flow cytometry showed that CD14-positive monocytes and CD4- or CD8-positive T cells all showed increased annexin V staining following incubation with recombinant gal-7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D-H</xref>). Interestingly, although we found that gal-7 binds to the surface of ovarian cancer cells, it did not induce detectable apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure S4</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Binding of recombinant gal-7 to Jurkat cells</title><p>RT-PCR (A) and western blot (B) analysis of gal-7 expression in Jurkat cells.

In the present work, we examined the clinical significance of gal-7 overexpression in ovarian cancer and investigated its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of ovarian cancer. More specifically, we found that while gal-7 is not detected in normal ovarian tissues, its expression is induced in benign, borderline and malignant tumors. In fact, analysis of histopathological scores indicated that its expression is significantly augmented in high grade, borderline and metastatic tumors compared to benign tumors. Moreover, overexpression of <italic>gal-7</italic> mRNA correlated with a poor overall survival of patients with serous cystadenocarcinomas, which account for the vast majority of EOC. We found that mutant forms of p53 most likely induce gal-7 expression in ovarian cancer cells, because <italic>de novo</italic> expression of the most common mutant forms of p53 induced gal-7, while suppression of p53 by siRNA reduces gal-7 expression. Finally, our <italic>in vitro</italic> data support the idea that gal-7 expression has the potential to impact ovarian cancer progression by increasing the invasive properties of ovarian cancer cells and by killing immune cells. Taken together, our study validates the clinical significance of gal-7 overexpression in ovarian cancer and provides a rationale for targeting gal-7 to improve the outcome of patients with this disease.</p><p>Mutations in the <italic>p53</italic> gene are among the most common genetic alterations found in cancer. In ovarian cancer, these mutations are observed in more than 90% of the cases and are more frequently observed in later stage tumors compared to early stage tumors [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In many cases, the presence of specific mutations is associated with a gain of function, often by inducing expression of genes involved in various aspects of cancer biology [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which specific mutant forms of p53 can induce gal-7 in ovarian cancer cells is currently unknown. Our findings suggest that gal-7 might in fact be part of a gain-of-function pathway that is frequently observed in many types of cancer [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This possibility is supported by our data showing that gal-7 may promote cancer progression by increasing the invasive properties of ovarian cancer cells. While we found that recombinant gal-7 had no effect on cell motility, we found that repression of gal-7 decreased the velocity and accumulated distance of migration of OVCAR-3 cells. These data suggest that ovarian cancer cell motility was modulated by intracellular gal-7, which co-localized with the actin cytoskeleton within cortical actin. This finding is reminiscent of a previous report by Gendronneau <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], who showed that keratinocytes isolated from gal-7 KO mice had reduced motility when compared to normal keratinocytes. They had also found that gal-7 was localized in the podosomes of these cells, indicating that gal-7 is involved in organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Such a role has been well documented for galectin-1, which binds to the actin cytoskeleton and participates in actin polymerization-depolymerization by modulating the activity of small GTPase [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Alternatively, release of gal-7 in the tumor microenvironment by EOC cells may favor establishment of a local immunosuppressive response by killing immune cells. This possibility has been reported in the case of galectin-1, which is also overexpressed in EOC [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Galectin-1 is indeed released by SK-OV-3, but not OVCAR-3 cells [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Galectin-3 is also expressed in EOC, although it is mainly found inside the cells and does not vary among benign, borderline and malignant mucinous and serous tumors [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In fact, it is becoming clear that many cell types do express more than one intracellular galectin, suggesting existence of functional redundancy. For example, recombinant galectin-1, -3, -8 and -9 have all been shown to induce apoptosis in Jurkat T cells [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, in contrast to galectin-3, we found that killing of Jurkat T cells by gal-7 is independent of CD45 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). This suggests that expression of galectins by EOC may induce apoptosis of specific infiltrating immune cell populations depending on their fine carbohydrate specificities [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Such redundancy is often necessary to increase the maintenance of important gene functions and to limit losses following mutations/deletions of specific genes (functional compensation). Future <italic>in vivo</italic> investigations are required to determine how the &#x0201c;galectinome&#x0201d; of EOC carves development of local immune suppression and whether development of CRD-specific galectin inhibitors is an attractive avenue for the treatment of EOC.</p><p>Although relatively high concentrations of soluble gal-7 were required to trigger apoptosis or cell invasion <italic>in vitro</italic>, the concentrations we used for our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, however, were comparable to concentrations commonly used to study galectin-apoptosis in T cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Such range of concentrations are not unexpected since <italic>in vitro</italic> studies are usually carried out using recombinant galectins that display suboptimal biological activity [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is also important to note that extracellular galectins bind to a relatively large number of cell surface glycoprotein receptors [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which is known to concentrate galectins by forming spatial gradients that allow them to exert their biological activity following binding to their respective receptors localized on responding cells [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In fact, total galectin concentrations in tissues can reach up to 70-80 mg/kg tissue or approximately 1-2 &#x003bc;M [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Thus, miroenvironmental concentrations of gal-7 in ovarian cancer could be quite high, and may explain, at least in part, why galectins are now considered as key mediators of development of distant metastasis through induction of local and systemic immunosuppression [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>-<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It will be interesting to determine whether gal-7 is found in ascites of patients with ovarian cancer and whether levels of gal-7 correlate with disease progression, remission and/or response to treatment.</p><p>It is becoming clear that gal-7 plays a central role in cancer of epithelial origin. There are now numerous reports showing that gal-7 can modulate the progression of many types of carcinoma. This has been well established in breast cancer cells. In fact, there is increasing evidence that targeting galectins in cancer may help to reduce immunosuppression during metastatic progression of the disease [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In EOC, our findings add to a recent report by Kim <italic>et al.</italic> who showed that gal-7 was associated with a lower survival rate of Korean patients with EOC [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. While the authors reported that gal-7 expression in tissue samples was primarily detected in the nuclei and occasionally in the cytoplasm, our IHC, confocal microscopy and western blot analysis suggest that extracellular gal-7 is released outside the cells and may have a significant impact on tumor progression by inducing immunosuppression and increasing the invasive behavior of tumor cells. Thus, these functions may explain Kim's findings and ours showing that gal-7 is associated with metastasis and poor overall survival. Taken together, these studies provide proof-of-principle that targeting gal-7 may represent a valuable strategy to overcome cancer-associated immunosuppression and dissemination of metastasis in EOC, restrain tumor growth and prevent metastatic disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Cell lines and reagents</title><p>The COV-434, HACAT and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM).
