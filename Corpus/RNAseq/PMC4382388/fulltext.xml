A new method, GIREMI, predicts RNA editomes (mainly A-to-I editing) accurately and sensitively using a single RNA-Seq data set, which does not require sample-specific genome sequence data or high sequencing depth. Using GIREMI, we observed prevailing tissue-specificity of RNA editing and interesting evolutionary patterns of editing sites in human population.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Accurate identification of RNA editome is central to better understand the diversity of gene expression and related functional implications<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Recently, there has been an extraordinary growth of application of RNA-Seq to identify RNA editing sites (summarized in<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>). However, many challenges still exist, one of which being the requirement of genome sequence data in order to discriminate RNA editing sites from genomic SNPs. Even with whole-genome sequencing data, some SNPs may still escape identification possibly due to non-uniformity in sequencing coverage or other issues. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop novel methods to predict RNA editomes independent of genome sequencing. Here, we report what is, to our knowledge, the first method to identify RNA editome accurately independent of genome sequence using a single RNA-Seq data set of modest sequencing depth.</p><p id="P3">The method, GIREMI (Genome-independent Identification of RNA Editing by Mutual Information), builds upon analysis of allelic linkage between single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and further extends the predictive power with generalized linear models. In a typical RNA-Seq data set, there often exists reads (or read pairs in paired-end mode) containing multiple SNVs that may correspond to genomic SNPs, RNA editing sites or experimental errors. A pair of SNPs harbored in the same read maintains the same haplotype in the RNA as in the genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In contrast, a SNP and an RNA editing site exhibit variable allelic linkage since RNA editing occurs post-transcriptionally to either copy of the gene randomly (unless allele-specific editing exists, which is presumably rare and out of the scope of this study). Similarly, the allelic linkage in RNA-Seq reads for a pair of RNA editing sites may also appear random, although processive editing does exist<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> that may lead to allelic bias of multiple editing sites. To examine whether allelic linkage may enable a discrimination of RNA editing sites from SNPs, we calculated the mutual information (MI) associated with SNPs or RNA editing sites in RNA-Seq reads (Online Methods). Indeed, MI values associated with the two types of variants demonstrated a striking difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 1</xref>), reflecting the discriminative power of this approach. Based on this rationale, the GIREMI method calculates MI of publicly available SNPs (dbSNP) and uncharacterized RNA variants expressed in a given RNA-Seq data set, which is then utilized to predict RNA editing sites and further parameterize a generalized linear model (GLM) for enhanced performance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, Online Methods).</p><p id="P4">As a proof of concept, we first applied GIREMI to a deeply sequenced ENCODE RNASeq data set derived from the GM12878 cell line that has associated genome sequencing data<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Overall, 31,660 RNA editing sites (99.6% being the A-to-G type) were predicted by the MI step and 5,117 additional putative A-to-G editing sites were identified by GLM. Since the genome of GM12878 has been well-studied, most of the SNPs in this cell line are already included in dbSNP, which afforded an advantage in predicting RNA editing sites. Thus, to evaluate the performance of GIREMI, we assumed a fraction (10-90%) of the GM12878 SNPs were unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Strikingly, the false discovery rate (FDR, % GM12878 SNPs in predicted editing sites) was only 3% when 30% of GM12878 SNPs were assumed to be unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The FDR only increased to 7.6% if assuming 90% of SNPs were unknown, which is an extreme overestimate of the % unknown SNPs in a common human sample given the recent expansion of dbSNP. This performance did not change substantially when a different read mapping method was used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). It should be noted that the FDR defined here assumes that SNPs are the only source of error, without including other possible artifacts, e.g., due to alignment mistakes. Applied to other data sets, GIREMI also outperformed previous methods<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> in sensitivity and accuracy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P5">It is known that identification of RNA editing sites depends closely on sequencing depth<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and the prediction accuracy may deteriorate with reduced depth. To examine this relationship, we repeated the analysis with down-sampled GM12878 data and with different levels of assumed unknown SNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3c, d</xref>). As expected, the number of RNA editing sites was lower as the sequencing depth decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Remarkably, the accuracy of GIREMI was not affected much by sequencing depth, with the FDR remained low (8.8%) even when the sequencing depth was very low (&#x0003c; 30 million singleton reads or 15 million pairs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Robustness to sequencing depth is a highly desirable feature that has not been demonstrated for previous methods. Similar performance was observed for single-end data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To further evaluate its performance, we compared GIREMI-predicted editing sites to those resulted from the &#x0201c;genome-aware&#x0201d; method that utilizes SNPs identified in whole-genome sequencing data<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Note 3</xref>). In addition, we included results of another genome-independent method, the &#x0201c;multiple data sets&#x0201d; method, that calls RNA editing using RNA-Seq data from multiple samples<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. For two levels of assumed unknown SNPs (30% and 50%), GIREMI consistently showed higher number of predicted editing sites, higher accuracy (measured as 1-%SNPs among predicted editing sites), higher degree of overlap with the genome-aware method, and higher percentage of A-to-G sites (%AG) than the &#x0201c;multiple data sets&#x0201d; method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 3</xref>). Thus, the performance of GIREMI is highly superior while requiring only minimal data (one RNA-Seq data set, no genome sequence).</p><p id="P7">Recent studies identified a large number of editing sites in <italic>Alu</italic> regions with high confidence<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. In contrast, accuracy of predicted non-<italic>Alu</italic> editing sites was relatively low, especially for those in coding regions<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. GIREMI also demonstrated variable accuracy for different types of regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Notes 3 and 4</xref>). Overall, the sensitivity and accuracy of GIREMI are both high compared with existing genome-independent method in pinpointing <italic>Alu</italic> and non-coding editing sites of non-<italic>Alu</italic> regions. This observation also applies to the results for a set of human brain RNA-Seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), an application mimicking typical individual lab-based projects where a small number of samples were collected, with or without biological replicates.</p><p id="P8">Compared to non-coding sites, editing sites in coding regions are much less prevalent. Existing RNA-Seq-based methods suffer from low sensitivity and low accuracy in pinpointing non-<italic>Alu</italic> coding editing events<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. On an initial examination, the accuracy of GIREMI is also low (~28% on average) for these sites in non-repetitive regions, although still higher than that of the &#x0201c;multiple data sets&#x0201d; method (5.3% on average, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). To gain a detailed evaluation, we examined whether GIREMI could identify previously reported recoding sites<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Since most of recoding sites are highly tissue-specific, we used RNA-Seq data sets derived from a panel of primary human tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 5</xref>). Among the 47 recoding sites with adequate read coverage (&#x02265; 5) in at least one sample, 43 were correctly identified by GIREMI, yielding an overall sensitivity of 91.5% and an average per-sample sensitivity of 71.4% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Given the high sensitivity, the expected small number of non-<italic>Alu</italic> coding sites, and the likely saturation of such sites in public databases, we can leverage the rapidly expanding sets of known coding sites to improve accuracy. For the GM12878 data, the accuracy in predicting non-repetitive coding sites was 67-80% if only known sites were considered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 5</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Owing to the genome-independent nature of GIREMI, it can be applied to any RNA-Seq data set without restrictions. We first examined variation of editomes across human tissues, a fundamental question not yet addressed on the genome-wide scale. We used a panel of 38 GTEx RNA-Seq data sets obtained from 5 human subjects and 8 primary tissue types (4 brain regions, heart, skeletal muscle, thyroid, lung)<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. The samples were chosen such that each individual had data from nearly all 8 tissues types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). When clustered based on how RNA editing ratios correlate in pairwise comparisons, the samples segregated largely by tissues instead of individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Three major tissue groups were observed encompassing lung or thyroid, brain regions and muscle (heart and skeletal), respectively. Different brain regions were barely distinguishable based on their editing profiles. This tissue-dominated clustering pattern is especially striking given that the number of predicted editing sites varied greatly across samples largely due to sequencing depth variation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). This result is unlikely a by-product of the expected tissue-dominated clustering of overall gene expression, as the editing ratios are not correlated with gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Thus, our observation supports the existence of tissue-specific regulation of RNA editing. In addition, our result is consistent with a recent report of tissue-dominant clustering of editing sites in rhesus macaque<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Notably, in contrast to the previous study, our study only included shallowly sequenced RNA-Seq data (12.3-41.1 M mapped read pairs) without specific genomic data of the samples. This result again attests to the effectiveness of GIREMI.</p><p id="P10">In examining the patterns of tissue-specific editing (TSE), we observed the largest difference in RNA editing between brain and muscle-related tissues, with up to 24% editing sites being specific to brain tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). In addition, muscle also demonstrated considerably less editing and lower editing levels compared to thyroid or lung (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). The mRNA expression levels of ADAR1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>) approximately explained 77% of the variability in editing levels across tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). Similarly notable concordance was not observed for ADAR2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Overall, TSE sites are highly enriched in 3&#x02019; UTR regions compared to all editing sites (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 2.2&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>, Fisher's Exact test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>). Interestingly, higher sequence conservation was observed in 3&#x02019; UTR regions harboring TSE compared to those flanking all editing sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), supporting existence of selection pressure in TSE regions. We observed a number of distinctive genomic features of 3&#x02019; UTR TSEs and their associated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). In addition, brain-specific editing sites were often in genes related to energy, cellular metabolism and apoptosis, whereas lung or thyroid-specific editing sites were found in genes related to signal peptide processing and response to stimuli (viral or inflammatory) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 7</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We next examined the level of variability in the editome landscape across human individuals, a fundamental question that has not been addressed on a global scale. To this end, we analyzed RNA-Seq data of lymphoblastoid cells of 93 people in the 1000 Genomes project (GBR population)<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. A total of 22,715 editing sites were identified. For each editing site covered by &#x02265; 10 total reads in &#x02265; 50% of individuals, we calculated the fraction of these individuals expressing the edited nucleotide. We used this value to represent the prevalence of an editing site in the population and observed that the majority of editing sites (88%) had a prevalence of at least 50% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref>). Levels of RNA editing varied considerably across the prevalence groups, with an overall trend of enhanced editing as prevalence increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10b</xref>).</p><p id="P13">All prevalence groups consisted of editing sites enriched in 3&#x02019; UTRs relative to the general composition of the human transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Note that less intronic editing sites were observed here than in the GTEx data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>) possibly due to differences in RNA-Seq protocols. Intriguingly, the group of rare editing sites (the first bin in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>) showed a considerably higher enrichment in coding regions than other groups. In addition, rare editing sites occurred in higher conserved 3&#x02019; UTR regions than common editing sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). Although located in functionally important regions (i.e., coding and highly conserved 3&#x02019; UTRs), rare editing sites are unlikely functionally significant, given their low editing levels. Possibly, these editing sites represent random innovations of the transcriptome of few individuals that have not yet undergone long-term selection. Purifying selection may exist to prevent these sites from gaining higher editing levels or higher prevalence in the population.</p><p id="P14">In contrast, common editing sites were associated with relatively high editing levels. This observation argues against the possibility that these sites are randomly occurring transcriptome innovations. Rather, common editing sites should be associated with certain advantage such that evolution has preserved their prevalence. Since these sites are less conserved than TSEs, similarly as non-TSE sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b vs. 2d</xref>), it is unlikely that most of the common editing sites are functionally critical. An alternative hypothesis is that many common RNA editing sites are by-products of the RNA editing machinery carrying out functions to mediate other aspects of gene expression, which is under selection and led to an apparent preservation of the RNA editing sites across population (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Note 6</xref> for details).</p><p id="P15">In summary, we presented a powerful new method, GIREMI, for the identification of RNA editing independent of sample-specific genome sequences. The accuracy of this method is high even given low sequencing depth. Application of the method yielded novel insights about tissue-specific editing and evolutionary implications of RNA editing. We expect that GIREMI will be a powerful method in enabling new discoveries in RNA editing.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1" specific-use="web-only"><title>Online Methods</title><sec id="S2"><title>Mapping of RNA-seq reads</title><p id="P16">RNA-seq reads were mapped to the reference human genome (hg19) and transcriptome (Ensembl release 71) using our previously published method<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. The method was designed to enable unbiased mapping of alternative RNA alleles corresponding to RNA editing or expressed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Briefly, Bowtie<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and Blat<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> were used to align all reads to the reference genome and Bowtie was used to align all reads to the transcriptome. Results from the three parallel mapping procedures were merged into a union. Final mapped reads were required to satisfy a dual-filtering scheme such that a read (or a pair of read in paired-end data) maps uniquely with up to <italic>n</italic><sub>1</sub> mismatches (per read) and does not map to any other regions with up to <italic>n</italic><sub>2</sub> mismatches (per read) (<italic>n</italic><sub>2</sub>
<italic>&#x0003e; n</italic><sub>1</sub>). For all data sets, <italic>n</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>n</italic><sub>2</sub> values were set to be about 5% and 12% of the read length, respectively. We previously showed that this mapping method effectively reduced the mapping bias to alternative alleles<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and facilitated relatively accurate quantification of allelic ratios compared to other methods<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">All data sets from ENCODE cell lines, U87MG cells and GTEx human tissues were mapped in the same way as described above. For the 1000 Genomes data sets, we downloaded mapped reads (bam files) directly. However, we implemented an additional filtering step using Blat to remove possible ambiguous mapping (such as those due to existence of pseudogenes or homologs), similarly as in<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Preprocessing to identify and filter mismatches in RNA-seq reads</title><p id="P18">The RNA-seq reads were piled up to identify mismatches relative to the reference human genome (hg19). All duplicate reads were removed within each RNA-seq library except the one with the highest-quality score at the mismatch position. Duplicate reads were defined here as (pairs of) reads mapped to exactly the same genomic locations. For each mismatch position, a total read coverage of &#x02265; 5 was required and the variant allele was required to be present in at least 3 reads. According to previous literature<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, a number of filters were desirable to remove potential artifacts resulted from sequencing or mapping bias. We thus imposed additional procedures as described in our previous work<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> to discard the following types of mismatches: those located in simple repeats regions or homopolymer runs of &#x02265; 5nt, those associated with reads substantially biased towards one strand, those with extreme variant allele frequencies (&#x0003e; 95% or &#x0003c; 10%), and those located within 4nt of a known spliced junction. To further reduce the impact of sequencing errors, we calculated a log-likelihood ratio (<italic>LLR</italic>) to examine the likelihood of a mismatch being a sequencing error, as described in<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. We only retained mismatches passing an <italic>LLR</italic> cutoff of 2.</p><p id="P19">The same procedures as described above (read mapping and mismatch filtering) were applied for all methods included in this study, i.e., the GIREMI, genome-aware, and multiple data sets methods. In addition, known SNPs (dbSNP) were excluded from predicted editing sites by the multiple data sets method.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>GIREMI</title><p id="P20">The method GIREMI combines statistical inference of MI between pairs of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in RNA-seq reads with machine learning to predict RNA editing sites. The input to GIREMI includes a list of SNVs (mismatches) derived from an RNA-seq data set and known SNPs in public databases such as dbSNP. The output is a collection of predicted RNA editing sites and their editing levels. Except public SNP information, GIREMI carries out all analyses using one RNA-seq data set of interest and does not rely on any other genomic or RNA-seq data sets.</p><sec id="S5"><title>Mutual information (MI) of SNVs and RNA editing prediction</title><p id="P21">As the first step of GIREMI, we identify known SNPs (dbSNP) in the list of SNVs derived from the RNA-seq reads. We then extract all RNA-seq reads that harbor the known SNPs and the subset of reads (or read pairs in paired-end RNA-seq; required &#x02265; 5 such reads) that cover more than one SNP. SNP pairs located in the same (pairs of) reads were retained for MI calculation. As an example, in the GM12878 data set, a total of 5,306 SNPs (out of 37,775 SNPs covered by &#x02265; 5 RNA-seq reads) were involved in this calculation. In another less deeply sequenced RNA-seq data set (GTEx SRR595926, 31M mapped reads), 884 SNPs out of a total of 10,590 RNA-seq-covered SNPs were used for this step. Although the % of SNPs used for the calculation of MI is not high, it is adequate to generate the reference MI distribution (such as that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) for further prediction of RNA editing sites. The number of RNA editing sites suitable for MI calculation is much larger than that of SNPs. For example, 32,548 editing sites were used to generate the example distribution of MI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P22">For each SNV <italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic>, we consider all possible nucleotides A, C, G, T as the four possible states of the variable <italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic>. Thus, for a joint variable representing a pair of mismatches (<italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic>, <italic>s<sub>j</sub></italic>), a total of 16 states are possible. Although it is unlikely that all 16 states are present in one RNA-seq data set, we use this scheme because it is general and can accommodate possible existence of sequencing errors or other complexity. The probabilities of observing each state of <italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic>, <italic>s<sub>j</sub></italic> or (<italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic>, <italic>s<sub>j</sub></italic>) were calculated using the maximum likelihood method. A value of 0.01 was assumed for states that were not observed in the actual data considering existence of sequencing errors of all possible nucleotides and accounting for low sequencing depth in realistic data sets. Incorporation of this pseudo value led to an increase of MI of about 0.2 for both SNPs and editing sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), but the final editing predictions with or without this pseudo value are very similar (data not shown).

In theory, the maximum MI should be log(2) = 0.7 for SNP pairs. However, in practice, larger values were sometimes observed, due to limited read coverage at each site and the numerical difference between joint probability and marginal probability of the states. The marginal probability was estimated using all reads covering the particular SNV, whereas the joint probability was estimated using reads covering both SNVs. Thus, the number of joint reads is often smaller than that of the marginal reads and the joint probability is less accurately estimated than the marginal ones. This discordance sometimes led to MI values larger than the theoretical upper bound.</p><p id="P25">For each RNA-seq data set, the MI of SNPs is calculated independently. Thus, a data set-specific distribution of <italic>I</italic>(<italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic>, <italic>s<sub>j</sub></italic>) is derived. Subsequently, for a SNV <italic>s<sub>x</sub></italic> that is not a known SNP, an <italic>I</italic>(<italic>s<sub>x</sub></italic>) value is calculated similarly as described above by examining its relationship with other SNVs (either known SNPs or otherwise). Based on the distribution of <italic>I</italic>(<italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic>) of known SNPs, a <italic>P</italic> value is calculated for <italic>s<sub>x</sub></italic> to test the null hypothesis that <italic>I</italic>(<italic>s<sub>x</sub></italic>) is not different from the distribution of <italic>I</italic>(<italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic>) for SNPs. A <italic>P</italic> value cutoff of 0.05 was used to call RNA editing sites. Correction of <italic>P</italic> values for multiple testing was not applied due to the discovery nature of this test.

The GLM incorporates two types of features that have discriminative power for SNPs and RNA editing sites. The first feature quantifies the deviation of the allelic ratio of the unknown SNV from an expected allelic ratio reflecting the allelic expression of the respective gene. The second type of features represents the sequence preferences of the neighborhoods of RNA editing sites (mainly A-to-G). It should be noted that the GLM step only analyzes A-to-G mismatches as candidate RNA editing sites, without including other types of SNVs.</p><p id="P27">To estimate the expected allelic ratio <italic>r</italic> of a gene <italic>g</italic>, we extract all expressed heterozygous known SNPs (<italic>S</italic>) (dbSNP) in gene <italic>g</italic> (read coverage &#x02265; 5).

This assumption may cause a biased allelic ratio larger than the actual value. Nevertheless, the same directional bias exists in the allelic ratio for a specific SNV that is to be compared to <italic>&#x00072;&#x00302;</italic>. Thus, the impact of this bias will be largely canceled out. In cases where no SNP is available in gene <italic>g</italic>, an expected ratio of 0.5 is used assuming the gene has no allelic expression bias.</p><p id="P28">A heterozygous SNP is expected to have an allelic ratio that is largely consistent as the allelic ratio of the gene. In contrast, RNA editing sites may have allelic ratios that substantially deviate from that of the gene.

This feature has the discriminative power for SNPs and RNA editing sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>), but exceptions do exist. For example, it cannot identify editing sites with editing levels similar to allelic ratios of genetic SNPs in the same gene. In addition, a minor fraction of SNPs may have allelic ratios largely different from that of the entire gene if allele-specific splicing or other local RNA processing events affect the allelic expression of the SNPs<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">To increase the discriminative power, we incorporated sequence-based features into the GLM.

To this end, we generate a positional weight matrix (PWM) for the sequence neighborhood of the predicted editing sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). For an unknown SNV, a composite sequence score was calculated using its -1 and +1 nucleotides according to the PWM. It should be noted that putative editing sites predicted by the MI-based approach are mostly (&#x0003e; 97%) of the A-to-G type.

In addition, a leave-one-out scheme was applied where the genetic allelic ratio was estimated using all expressed heterozygous SNPs except one per gene. These randomly excluded SNPs were used as training data together with the putative editing sites. The training data was then separated into two random subsets of the same size. The first subset was used to parameterize the GLM model. The recall and precision of the predictive model were evaluated using the second subset. To reach a tradeoff between the recall and precision, an <italic>F</italic> measure was calculated as follows: <disp-formula id="FD5"><mml:math display="block" id="M5" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>&#x003b2;</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>&#x003b2;</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x02217;</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02217;</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>&#x003b2;</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>&#x02217;</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> In the above <italic>F</italic> measure, we set <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> to be 0.5, which puts more emphasis on precision than recall.

The biological credibility of the other types of RNA-DNA mismatches is still under debate, which is not a focus of this work.</p><p id="P33">The two steps in GIREMI demonstrate different efficacies for different types of editing sites. The MI step is most effective for editing sites in close proximity with other editing sites or SNPs (such as A-to-I editing in <italic>Alu</italic> regions that are known to cluster together). Its sensitivity is lower in predicting editing sites in isolation. In contrast, the GLM step, although contributing a relatively small number of additional sites overall as a second step of GIREMI, is an important procedure to ensure high sensitivity in identifying recoding sites.
