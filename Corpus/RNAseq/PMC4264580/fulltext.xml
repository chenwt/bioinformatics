Individual tones then stimulate mechanosensory hair cells located at different positions on an elongated frequency (tonotopic) axis. During development, immature hair cells located along the axis must determine their tonotopic position in order to generate frequency-specific characteristics. Expression profiling along the developing tonotopic axis of the chick basilar papilla (BP) identified a gradient of <italic>Bmp7</italic>. Disruption of that gradient <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in ovo</italic> induces changes in hair cell morphologies consistent with a loss of tonotopic organization and the formation of an organ with uniform frequency characteristics. Further, the effects of Bmp7 in determination of positional identity are shown to be mediated through activation of the Mapk, Tak1. These results indicate that graded, Bmp7-dependent, activation of Tak1 signaling controls the determination of frequency-specific hair cell characteristics along the tonotopic axis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Tonotopy, the fundamental organizing principal of the auditory system, refers to the spatial separation and perception of complex sounds based on their component frequencies. Tonotopic organization is present at all levels of the auditory system from the periphery through the brainstem to the cortex <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. In vertebrates with elongated auditory organs (mammals, birds and some orders of reptiles) tonotopy manifests as a gradient in frequency sensitivity in which hair cells located closest to the saccular end are stimulated by high frequency sounds whilst those located at progressively more distal positions respond to lower frequencies.</p><p id="P3">In the chicken auditory organ, the basilar papilla (BP), tonotopic gradients of cell morphology and physiology are present along the proximal-to-distal (tonotopic) axis from as early as E12<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Hair cell density is lowest at the end of the BP located closest to the sacculus (proximal region) and increases progressively in more distal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-c</xref>). The lumenal surface area of each hair cell also varies along the axis with smaller surface areas present on hair cells located more distally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-c</xref>). Similarly, the number of individual stereocilia per hair cell bundle decreases along the tonotopic axis, while the average length of stereocilia per bundle increases<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. At the molecular level, numerous proteins are expressed differentially along the BP such as the calcium binding protein Calbindin, which is more strongly expressed in proximal hair cells but decreases progressively in more distal hair cells <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Furthermore, hair cell physiology also changes along the tonotopic axis, with a gradient in the response kinetics of membrane voltage oscillations forming the basis for frequency-specific electrical tuning <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Tonotopic changes in response kinetics are achieved through interactions between voltage-gated calcium (CaV<sub>1.3</sub> ) channels and large conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup> -activated K<sup>+</sup> (BK) channels <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. The &#x003b2;-subunit (KCNMB1) of the BK channel, which mediates slower response kinetics, is expressed at higher levels in distal, low frequency, hair cells<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. In addition, as a result of alternative splicing of the nascent pre-mRNA encoding the pore forming &#x003b1;-subunit, graded variations in the structure and kinetics of the BK channel are present along the tonotopic axis of the BP<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Previous developmental studies have demonstrated that the majority of tonotopic gradients are evident in the BP by E12, suggesting that the signals specifying positional identity must be present prior to this time. Furthermore, transplantation and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies demonstrated the development of normal tonotopic identity in BPs isolated as early as E8<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. These results suggest that positional signals are intrinsic to the BP by early embryonic time points but the identity and nature of those signals have not been determined. Given that positional signals are intrinsic to the BP by early time points, we sought to identify and characterize the pathways that establish the tonotopic axis during development. Results of expression profiling identified a gradient of <italic>Bmp7</italic> within the developing chick BP at the time of hair cell formation. Modulation of this gradient results in predictable changes in hair cell morphologies that are consistent with different concentrations of Bmp7 inducing specific hair cell phenotypes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a gradient of Bmp7 acts to specify positional identity and, therefore, hair cell phenotype along the tonotopic axis of the chick BP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Tonotopicidentity in the BP is established prior to E7</title><p id="P5">Previous results demonstrated correct development of tonotopy in BPs isolated and maintained <italic>in vitro</italic> from as early as E8<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. To determine when the signaling mechanisms specifying tonotopic cues become intrinsic to the BP sensory epithelium, explants were dissected and established in culture from chick embryos between E8 and E6, the youngest age at which such explants would survive. To confirm that tonotopic cues are intrinsic within the BP at early time points, we assayed gradients in cell size and morphology, as well as Calbindin staining, as indicators of establishment of tonotopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, d</xref>). In a normal BP, hair cells are larger and more sparsely populated in the proximal, compared to the distal, region and Calbindin is expressed more highly in proximal hair cells with a progressive decrease towards the distal tip <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Results indicated development of tonotopic gradients in hair cell density, hair cell lumenal surface area and expression of Calbindin in hair cells in explants started as early as E6 and maintained for 6 days <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-g</xref>). However, outgrowth of stromal cells located at the extreme distal end of BP explants produced some epithelial traction leading to significantly decreased hair cell density in this region. As a result, the most distal end of BP explants was not analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Also, it is important to note that Calbindin is expressed strongly in distal supporting cells, which accounts for the persistence of anti-Calbindin fluorescence in distal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b, d</xref>). Therefore, Calbindin intensity measurements were restricted to the lumenal surfaces of hair cells. Whilst the nature of the cues that specify positional identity are unknown, one hypothesis would be that graded activity of a morphogen could provide instructive cues along the length of the BP<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. If this model is correct, then hair cell progenitors along the length of the BP would determine their positional identity by interpreting the relative concentration of the morphogen at a particular position along the axis.This would suggest, as is the case for the developing limb bud, that potential sources or signaling centers would reside at either the proximal or distal end of the BP<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of separation experiments in which the BP was dissected and then divided into proximal and distal halves on specific gestational days or half days between E6 and E8. Following separation, proximal and distal halves were established as separate explants and maintained <italic>in vitro</italic> for 6 days. Separation of the BP at E7 or later results in the development of tonotopically appropriate hair cell phenotypes at all positions along both halves, indicating that positional identity has been established by that development time point. However, separation at E6.5 results in a re-patterning of the distal half of the explant such that the entire tonotopic gradient (based on hair cell density and expression of Calbindin) is represented along the shortened BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h,i</xref> and Supplementary Fig 1). In contrast, while hair cells do develop in proximal half explants, no evidence of tonotopic identity is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h,i</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 1). These results suggest that tonotopic identity along the BP is determined prior to E7 and that a potential signaling center is located at its distal tip.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Graded expression of mRNAs along the BP tonotopic axis</title><p id="P6">To identify potential candidate molecules that could be instructive for tonotopic identity, differential expression of mRNAs along the tonotopic axis of the developing BP was analyzed using both Affymetrix microarrays and RNA-seq (Supplementary Data 1 and 2). Briefly, based on the results of the experiments described above, E6.5 BPs were dissected and separated into proximal and distal halves(microarray) or proximal, middle and distal thirds (RNA-seq) prior to isolation of mRNA. Microarray data were analyzed to identify transcripts that were expressed at levels at least two-fold higher in proximal versus distal halves and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was used to identify relevant developmental pathways with differential activity in different halves of the BP. The pathways represented by the highest number of differentially expressed transcripts were those associated with cytoskeleton remodeling, in particular members of the transforming growth factor(TGF)-&#x003b2;/ bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling pathway. We were interested in the high number of differentially expressed transcripts related to TGF signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), as this pathway has been shown to regulate developmental patterning in a number of tissues and several members have been suggested to act as morphogens<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Of the genes known to act within this pathway, transcripts for <italic>Bone morphogenetic protein 7</italic> (<italic>Bmp7</italic>) showed the highest fold difference between proximal and distal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 2) (2.9 fold difference in transcript expression measured by Affymetrix array and a 2-fold difference in transcript expression as measured by RNA-seq)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 2). Consistent with this observation, two Bmp-immediate response genes, <italic>Id1</italic> and <italic>Id3</italic>, were also enriched in the distal half of the BP (Supplementary Data 1,2). In addition, transcripts for several naturally-occurring antagonists of Bmp were found to be expressed at higher levels in the proximal region of the BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Finally, the higher level of expression of transcripts for<italic>Bmp7</italic> in the distal region of the BP was also consistent with the location of a signaling center at the distal tip, as was suggested from the results of the separation experiments.</p><p id="P7">To confirm these results, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was carried out on proximal, middle and distal samples from BPs collected at three different developmental time points. Results confirmed the expression of a dynamic but persistent proximal-to-distal gradient of <italic>Bmp7</italic> even in post-hatch BPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Interestingly, a marked decrease in overall levels of <italic>Bmp7</italic> expression occurs between E8 and E10 although levels of <italic>Bmp7</italic> recover to E6.5 levels by post-hatch ages. Similarly, qPCR also confirmed proximal-to-distal gradients of <italic>Chordin-like 1</italic>(<italic>Chrdl1</italic>) and <italic>Twisted gastrulation</italic> between E6.5 and E10. However, unlike <italic>Bmp7</italic>, these gradients do not persist into post-hatch ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2c,d</xref>). Finally, because the tissue used for microarray, RNA-seq and qPCR contained both sensory epithelium and underlying mesenchymal cells, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization was performed to localize <italic>Bmp7</italic> and <italic>Chrdl1</italic> at E7. Cross-sections indicate that <italic>Bmp7</italic> is expressed within the epithelium of the BP with increasing intensity at more distal positions at both E8 and E10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 2). <italic>Chrdl1</italic> is also expressed within the epithelium but in a counter-gradient to <italic>Bmp7</italic> with more intense expression in more proximal sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Bmp7 regulates identity along the tonotopic axis of the BP</title><p id="P8">To investigate a role for the gradient of <italic>Bmp7</italic> in the establishment of tonotopy, intact BP explants were established at E6.5 and maintained in control media or media containing 0.4 &#x003bc;g/mL Bmp7 for 6 DIV. As described, control BPs developed a normal tonotopic gradient <italic>in vitro</italic>. In contrast, while distal regions of BPs from Bmp7-treated explants appeared comparable to controls, a significant increase in cell density was present in the more proximal regions of the BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-c</xref>). The increase in proximal cell density was sufficient to completely eliminate the density gradient in these explants (no significant difference between distal and proximal values, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). To confirm that the change in cell density was a result of a change in positional identity, additional tonotopic markers were also examined. Average hair cell lumenal surface area in the proximal region of the BP was significantly decreased in Bmp7-treated explants consistent with the acquisition of a more distal identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b, d</xref>). As was the case for hair cell density, Bmp7-treatment had no effect on lumenal surface areas of distal hair cells.</p><p id="P9">Changes in the gradient of Calbindin expression in hair cells in response to Bmp7 were also consistent with changes in tonotopic identity(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). In particular, Calbindin-negative hair cells, which are normally restricted to the distal third of the BP were observed along the distal-half of the BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Quantification of this effect indicated a significantincrease in the extent of Calbindin-negative hair cells towards the proximal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). The expression of Calbindin in BP supporting cells also extended into the middle region in response to Bmp7 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3e</xref>) suggesting a change in supporting cell positional identity as well. To further quantify the change in Calbindin expression, the intensity of Calbindin-mediated fluorescence in hair cells was assayed in proximal and distal regions of the BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). While not as profound as the changes observed for hair cell density or lumenal surface area, a significant decrease in Calbindin expression was observed in proximal hair cells in response to Bmp7-treatment. Finally, changes in stereociliary bundle length and size in response to Bmp7 were also examined. Bmp7-treatment induced a significant increase in the length of proximal stereocilia but had no significant effect on distal stereocilia length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4 a, b</xref>). Treatment with Bmp7 also significantly reduced the number of stereocilia per bundle on proximal hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, a, c</xref>) .Overall, treatment with Bmp7 results in significant changes in multiple tonotopic characteristics all of which are consistent with induction of a more distal phenotype in the proximal end of the BP. To confirm that the effects of Bmp7 do not represent inhibition of a specific cellular pathway phenotype, such as ciliagenesis, BP explants were established at E14 and maintained for 4DIV in the presence of Bmp7. Results indicated no changes between control and Bmp7-treated explants (Supplementary Fig.3).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Inhibition of Bmp7-signaling induces proximal phenotypes</title><p id="P10">To determine whether inhibition of Bmp7 signaling leads to phenotypic changes consistent with induction of a more proximal phenotype, explants were treated with two different Bmp antagonists, Noggin and Chrdl1. Transcripts for <italic>Noggin</italic> were not detected in the embryonic BP based on Affymterix data and were detected only at very low levels in the RNAseq results. However, Noggin is a well-characterized and potent antagonist of Bmp and was therefore used as a generic antagonist of Bmp signaling. In contrast, transcripts for <italic>Chrdl1</italic> are expressed in a proximal-to-distal gradient along the BP at E6.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Explants treated with either 0.4 &#x003bc;/mL Chrdl1 or 2.5 &#x003bc;g/mLNoggin demonstrated changes to the distal end of the BP that are consistent with the induction of a more proximal phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5a</xref>). In particular, significant changes in the distal region of the BP were observed for hair cell density (decreased) and lumenal surface (increased)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). No changes were observed in the proximal region of the BP. The initially-tested concentrations of both Bmp7 and Chdl1 were relatively high because of the potential for limited penetration in an explant culture comprising both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Therefore, to determine the effective concentrations for both Bmp7 and Chrdl1, dose responses were examined for cell density and lumenal surface areas (Supplementary Fig. 4). Results indicated fairly narrow sensitivity ranges for both with 0.25 &#x003bc;g/mL of either protein eliciting no effect while a concentration of 0.325&#x003bc;g/mL or above elicited maximal effects (Supplementary Fig. 4). These results suggest that the counter-gradients of both Bmp7 and Chrdl1 may play important roles in the specification of tonotopic identity.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>A localized source of Bmp7 alters hair cells density</title><p id="P11">In the experiments described above, the concentration of Bmp7 was altered throughout the entire BP suggesting the possibility that the phenotypic changes observed could be a result of secondary or tertiary responses to altered Bmp7 signaling. To confirm that Bmp7 acts directly within the BP to alter positional phenotypes, beads soaked in Bmp7 or vehicle (BSA) were placed at the proximal end of E6.5 BP explants. Previous studies have demonstrated that Bmp7 protein released from beads diffuses over an average range of 10-20 cells within a given tissue<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. By comparison with control beads, a significant increase in hair cell density and a significant decrease in lumenal hair cell surface area were observed within a 2500 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> area located immediately adjacent to Bmp7 soaked beads (Supplementary Fig.5). These results are consistent with a direct effect of an increased concentration of Bmp7 on hair cell phenotypes within the BP.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>In ovo expression of Bmp7 alters hair cell morphologies</title><p id="P12">To confirm that changing the Bmp7 gradient is sufficient to alter positional identity along the BP, we used <italic>in ovo</italic> electroporation of the otocyst at E2.5 to drive expression of an <italic>RCAS-AcGFP-IRES-Bmp7</italic> construct in the inner ear. Visualization of expression of AcGFP confirmed expression of either the <italic>RCAS-AcGFP-IRES-Bmp7</italic>or <italic>RCAS-AcGFP</italic> control vector within the BP at E14 with a bias towards expression in the supporting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>), as has been reported for previous studies using <italic>in ovo</italic> electroporation<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. The overall number of viral-expressing cells varied between experiments, however viral-expression was consistently observed in the proximal region of the BP. Analysis of BPs electroporated with the control vector showed development of a normal tonotopic gradient including changes in hair cell density, lumenal surface area and bundle shape and size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). In contrast, expression of the <italic>Bmp7</italic> construct resulted in significant changes in proximal morphologies that were comparable with the effects of Bmp7-treatment <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6b</xref>). In particular, electroporation of the <italic>Bmp7</italic> construct induced a significant increase in hair cell density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6c</xref>), and a significant decrease in lumenal surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6d</xref>). In addition, while the precise length and number of stereocilia could not be determined by sem analysis (because of the limited sample size, n=4 for control and n=7 for <italic>Bmp7</italic>), the overall area of the bundles located on proximal hair cells decreased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>) suggesting a reduction in the number of stereocilia per bundle. Moreover, the morphology of these bundles was consistent with distal rather than proximal hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6b</xref>). No significant changes were observed in hair cells located at the distal ends of BPs transfected with <italic>RCAS-AcGFP-IRES-Bmp7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6</xref>).

To determine which Bmp pathway acts to regulate tonotopic identity, activation of canonical and non-canonical pathways within the BP was examined following Bmp7-treatment. First, explants were established as described and maintained in the presence of either Bmp4 or Bmp5, both of which strongly activate the canonical Bmp/Smad signaling pathway. In comparison to treatment with Bmp7, incubation of BP explants with either Bmp4 or Bmp5 protein had no significant effect on tonotopic morphometrics in the proximal region of the BP (Supplementary Fig.8a,b). Similarly, no changes were observed in the levels of phospho-Smad 1, pSmad 5 or pSmad 8 (pSmad 1/5/8) in response to treatment with Bmp7 (Supplementary Fig. 8c). These results suggest that the effects of Bmp7 are unlikely to be mediated through activation of the canonical Bmp/Smad pathway.</p><p id="P16">Bmp7 is also known to signal through the Map-kinase pathway, in particular by activatingTak1. To determine whether Tak1 activation plays a role in regulation of tonotopic identity, explants were established at E6.5 and maintained for 6 DIV in the presence of the Tak1 inhibitor (5<italic>Z</italic>)-7-Oxozeaenol. In addition, the down-stream targets of Tak1, Jnk and p38 were blocked using the p-Jnk inhibitor SP600125 or the p38 Map-kinase inhibitor SB202190. In contrast with Bmp7-treatment, which causes more distal-like hair cell phenotypes in the proximal BP, inhibition of Tak1, Jnk or p38 resulted in proximal hair cells developing more distal phenotypes. This was characterized by a significant reduction in hair cell density and size of lumenal surface areas in the proximal region of the BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). To determine whether the Tak1/Jnk/p38 pathway acts in the same pathway as Bmp7, explants were treated with both Bmp7 and one of the three Mapk kinase inhibitors. The presence of any one of the Mapk inhibitors rescued tonotopic development when combined with Bmp7-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7a-d</xref>). These results are consistent with Bmp7 acting through theTak1/Jnk/p38signaling pathway to regulate tonotopic identity. Finally, activation of Tak1 in response to Bmp7 was confirmed by assaying for changes in levels of phospho-Tak1 following Bmp7-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7e</xref>). E6.5 BPs treated with Bmp7 showed a rapid increase in levels of phospho-Tak1 demonstrating a direct effect of Bmp7 signaling on Tak1 activation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S12"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">The auditory environment comprises myriad complex sounds from subtle wing beats and footfalls to elaborate bird songs and concertos. In order to process and appreciate the complexity of these signals, the auditory systems of many vertebrates reduce these sounds to their component frequencies. Primary auditory sensors spatially separate individual frequencies to create a tonotopic map that is maintained at multiple levels of the auditory system<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Within these sensors, spectral separation is achieved through changes in a combination of physical, anatomical and physiological characteristics that result in a graded change in maximal frequency sensitivity along the tonotopic axis.</p><p id="P18">In order to achieve this gradient in sensitivity, developing progenitor cells arrayed along the nascent auditory sensor must determine their relative position along the axis. Similar patterning events have been shown to be required for the formation of other structures with graded morphologies such as the three primary body axes, the neural tube and the hind- and fore-limb<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> . In many of these cases, gradients of one or more morphogens act to regulate cell fate and morphology along a specific axis<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> . The results presented here show that a gradient of Bmp7 activity plays a key role in determining positional identity along the tontopic axis of the chick BP. Bmp signaling gradients play similar roles in other patterned structures, most notably in the formation of the dorsoventral axis in vertebrates and imaginal disks in Drosophila<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. In these systems, and others, a largely conserved signaling cassette that includes Bmps, secreted antagonists such as Noggin, Chordin or Chordin-like 1, membrane antagonists such as Bambi and metalloproteases such asTolloid, is expressed across the patterning axis<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>-<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. While not fully validated in this work, tonotopic gradients for <italic>Bambi</italic>, <italic>Tolloid-like1</italic>, and <italic>ADMP-like</italic> were observed within the E6 BP (Supplementary Data 1). Therefore, it seems likely that determination of tonotopic identity along the BP utilizes multiple components of this conserved signaling network.</p><p id="P19">The involvement of the Bmp patterning cassette provides an explanation for the observation of at least a partial re-patterning of the full tonotopic axis in isolated distal halves of the BP. Work from De Robertis and colleagues and others have demonstrated the existence of multiple feedback loops that communicate between dorsal and ventral signaling centers to provide self-regulation along a specific axis<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>-<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Loss of the proximal chordin-like signaling center, as would occur following separation into distal and proximal halves, could for example be compensated for by an increased expression of the Bmp antagonist Bambi in the distal half, leading to re-establishment of a gradient of Bmp signaling. Our data are also consistent with the requirement for tonotopic patterning to be scalable across species with different body mass, head size and BP length<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Conversely, there is no compensation for the loss of the distal Bmp signaling center.</p><p id="P20">In contrast with the apparent conservation of the use of the Bmp/Chordin patterning cassette, our results suggest that regulation of positional identity along the BP is not mediated through the canonical Bmp/Smad pathway. Instead, we show that Bmp7 functions through activation of the Tak1/Mapk pathway. While this is considered to be a non-canonical Bmp pathway, Tak1 is known to be a downstream effector of TGF&#x003b2;/Bmp signaling<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and acts throughout vertebrate development <sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. In particular, Tak1 has a role in vascular formation and angiogenesis, where it regulates both expression of angiogenic genes and cell migration<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>-<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>, and in the developing kidney where it is essential for maintenance and regulation of cell number within the nephron progenitor pool<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. While this study marks the first demonstration of a role for Tak1 in development of the auditory system, a recent report demonstrated broad expression of Tak1 in the mouse otocyst and cochlea<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. A crucial next step will be to determine the Tak1 targets that mediate specific aspects of hair cell positional identity.</p><p id="P21">The dynamic nature of the <italic>Bmp7</italic> gradient has intriguing implications for both BP development and regeneration. While a distal-to-proximal gradient was observed both during embryonic development of the BP and in post-hatch chicks, the relative levels of <italic>Bmp7</italic> changed. At E8 and E10, <italic>Bmp7</italic> mRNA expression levels decreased significantly by comparison with the levels present at E6.5, but by P14 levels had returned to, or even exceeded, those observed at E6.5. The basis for the decrease in <italic>Bmp7</italic> between E8 and E10 is unclear but the result of this decrease may be the relief of an active suppression of <italic>Raldh3</italic> leading to the formation of a distal-to-proximal gradient of retinoic acid (RA) at E10 (Thiede et al. co-submission). Modulation of the RA gradient alters stereocilia number and length in patterns consistent with changes in positional identity (Thiede et al., co-submission). The timing of this change correlates with previous descriptive work indicating specification of cell fates between E6.5 and E9 followed by development of stereocilia bundles beginning around E10<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The data presented here and in Thiede et al (co-submission) suggests that the gradient of <italic>Bmp7</italic> at E6.5 regulates the specification of overall positional identity while the formation of an RA gradient at E10 acts more specifically to regulate bundle morphology.</p><p id="P22">In contrast with some developmental patterning events in which a morphogen is localized to a point source at one end of a graded structure, such as the localization of Sonic hedgehog to the ventral floor plate cells of the neural tube<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>, gradients of transcripts for <italic>Bmp7</italic> and several Bmp antagonists are present along the length of the BP as early as E6.5. These results suggest that even though positional identity is not yet fully determined at this time point, as demonstrated by the separation experiments, progenitor cells along the tonotopic axis already have information regarding their location. The cues and/or signaling pathways acting upstream of Bmp7 are unknown. In the chick, since the developing BP extends primarily along the primary medio-lateral body axis, it is possible that cues originating from central structures such as the neural tube or notochord could establish initial positional identity along the developing BP. Alternatively, cues could arise from the otocyst itself either in the form of diffusible factors or as a result of temporal or migratory cues <sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. Further experiments are clearly required to address these possibilities.</p><p id="P23">Previous work has demonstrated that regenerated hair cells develop location-appropriate morphological and physiological characteristics, suggesting regenerating hair cells can determine their position along the tonotopic axis<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. The finding that a distal-to-proximal gradient of <italic>Bmp7</italic> is present in post-hatch BPs suggests a possible instructive role during regeneration. If relative expression of <italic>Bmp7</italic> acts as a place code, then expression in the location-specific supporting cells that give rise to regenerated hair cells could provide positional information.

Data was analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls Post-test (GraphPad Prism).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS584338-supplement-1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1017" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S33"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank Tom Coate and Jonathan Bird for technical assistance and Mark Warchol and Thomas Friedman for providing comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.
