We investigated the gene expression patterns in human subjects with invasive Methicillin Resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) infections to determine the gene expression of bacteriophage and other mobile genetic elements. We developed an <italic>ex vivo</italic> technique that involved direct inoculation of blood from subjects with invasive bloodstream infections into culture media to reduce any potential laboratory adaptation. We compared <italic>ex vivo</italic> to <italic>in vitro</italic> profiles from 10 human subjects to determine MRSA gene expression in blood. Using RNA sequencing, we found that there were distinct and significant differences between <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> MRSA gene expression profiles. Among the major differences between <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> gene expression were virulence/disease/defense and mobile elements. While transposons were expressed at higher levels <italic>ex vivo</italic>, lysogenic bacteriophage had significantly higher <italic>in vitro</italic> expression. Five subjects had MRSA with bacteriophage that were inhibited by the presence of blood in the media, supporting that the lysogeny state was preferred in human blood. Some of the phage produced also had reduced infectivity, further supporting that phage were inhibited by blood. By comparing the gene expression cultured in media with and without the blood of patients, we gain insights into the specific adaptations made by MRSA and its bacteriophage to life in the human bloodstream.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>RNA Seq</kwd><kwd>human microbiome</kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>prophage</kwd><kwd>mobile genetic element</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="56"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="9483"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a pathogen that is also considered normal human flora, and often takes advantage of breaks in protective skin barriers to cause disease (Chaffin et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). While <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains were primarily treatable with beta-lactam antibiotics in the past, their widespread use has resulted in the emergence of Methicillin-Resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) strains. MRSA can be acquired in hospital- or community-based settings, but many of the Community-Acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains have replaced more traditional Hospital-Acquired (HA-MRSA) strains in both environments (Shopsin et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Popovich et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Kennedy et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). CA-MRSA generally has been responsible for many invasive soft tissue infections, and has several virulence factors including Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), which are thought to contribute greatly to its pathogenesis. PVL, which is not regularly detected in Hospital Acquired (HA)-MRSA strains, have been associated with epidemics of several CA-MRSA strains in the United States (Pan et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Vandenesch et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Virulence factors are of particular interest in invasive bloodstream infections, and many are derived from mobile genetic elements, including plasmids, bacteriophage, transposons, and pathogenicity islands (Bae et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Baba et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Diep et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2008b</xref>).</p><p>There usually are bacteriophage integrated into the genomes of <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates, with most of them belong to the phage family Siphoviridae (Canchaya et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Feng et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). These phage are of intermediate size (generally around 40 to 45 kb) and often carry toxins that may contribute to pathogenesis (Brussow et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Some phage carry the immune modulator staphylokinase, which is responsible for host tissue destruction. Others encode toxins such as PVL, or superantigens involved in toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis, and food poisoning (Deghorain and Van Melderen, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). These phage likely impact staphylococcal pathogenesis through lysogenic conversions, where the virulence functions they carry are expressed during infection in humans. The expression of these phage may directly reflect their contributions to pathogenesis, but has not been thoroughly examined during human bloodstream infections.</p><p>The expression of genes involved in the pathogenicity of CA-MRSA has been mainly studied <italic>in vitro</italic> (Cui et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Lindsay et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Stevens et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Pohl et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Few studies have compared the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> gene expression of MRSA, and generally have been restricted to animal models (Diep et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2008a</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Chaffin et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), which may not fully reflect the adaptive behavior of the pathogen in humans. Other <italic>ex vivo</italic> strategies have grown a single, lab-adapted MRSA strain in the presence of healthy human donor blood to characterize virulence genes that may be overexpressed (Malachowa and Deleo, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Malachowa et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). No studies, however, have studied MRSA across human subjects with varying degrees of illnesses to understand whether the behavior of MRSA and their mobile genetic elements is reproducible across different human subjects. It is of substantial importance to understand the contributions of phage and other mobile genetic elements to MRSA pathogenesis during human infections and their potential for spread to others.</p><p>The primary tool for analysis of global patterns of gene expression in microbes is transcriptomics. While some have studied transcriptomics in MRSA utilizing quantitative PCR (Sabersheikh and Saunders, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), or microarray analysis (Witney et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Lindsay et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), RNA sequencing provides a tool for characterization of patterns of gene expression that does not require a priori information about the pathogen being studied (Wilhelm and Landry, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Thus, gene expression patterns from RNA sequencing can be used to thoroughly characterize novel MRSA strains. RNA sequencing technology has not been employed to characterize global changes in <italic>S. aureus</italic> gene expression in humans with invasive bloodstream infections. Here, we report the RNA sequencing expression profiles of MRSA strains grown in the presence of blood from 10 human subjects with invasive bloodstream infections and characterize differences observed in the expression of bacteriophage and other mobile genetic elements by comparing expression profiles with and without human blood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Human subjects and RNA enrichment</title><p>We sampled blood from 10 human subjects with invasive bloodstream MRSA infections (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Supplemental Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">1</xref>), and cultured each to further our understanding of the gene expression of MRSA in the human bloodstream. We utilized an <italic>ex vivo</italic> technique that involved direct inoculation at the bedside of blood from human subjects with invasive bloodstream infections into culture media that bypassed the need for a separate <italic>in vitro</italic> culture step; thus, the isolates from each subject were characterized directly from blood with minimal opportunity for gene expression changes that might accompany laboratory adaptation. The cohort of subjects in this study included many that were critically-ill (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), which significantly contrasts with a prior study characterizing a single lab-adapted MRSA strain cultured in the presence of blood from healthy donors (Malachowa et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). For comparison, we performed a separate isolation of each MRSA strain, and cultured each <italic>in vitro</italic> to help decipher comparatively those genes whose expression might be induced through exposure to the human bloodstream. Samples 21MRA and 23MRA were isolated from the same individual 48 h apart, and were utilized to help determine whether results would be consistent within individual subjects over time. All <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> MRSA isolates were grown to log phase (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>), and total RNA was isolated from each subject/MRSA isolate under both growth conditions. Because the <italic>ex vivo</italic> samples were cultured in the presence of blood from each human subject, we enriched to remove any RNA that may have been derived from the human host. The resulting RNA was sequenced from all 10 subjects for a total of 6,213,492 <italic>ex vivo</italic> reads (mean of 564,863 &#x000b1; 79,540 per subject) and 4,568,420 <italic>in vitro</italic> reads (mean of 415,310 &#x000b1; 10,582 per subject) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The inclusion of the enrichment step substantially reduced the presence of human RNA, as exemplified by the relatively low percentage of RNA identified that was homologous to human DNA (mean 1.22 &#x000b1; 0.55%; range from 0.17% to 6.26%). All sequence reads homologous to human DNA were removed prior to further analysis.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Study

We found that 6 of the 11 strains produced viable phage in Brain Heart Infusion broth (BHI) in the presence of mitomycin C (including strains 3MRA, 20MRA, 21MRA, 23MRA, 74MRA, and 256MRA); however, the production of phage was inhibited in all six strains by the presence of human blood in culture media (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Interestingly, there was spontaneous induction of phage in strains 3MRA and 20MRA, but the number of phage were two to three logs lower than were produced in the presence of mitomycin C. We also tested whether the reduction in phage identified in the presence of blood may be related to inhibition of phage infectivity rather than a decrease in phage production. We found that for both 3MRA and 23MRA there was a decrease in observed PFUs by 1.5 to 2 logs, indicating that infectivity was diminished in the presence of blood (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Because phage adsorption has previously been shown to be inhibited by immunoglobulins (Martin and White, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>; Nordstrom et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>), it is likely that diminished adsorption was responsible for the decrease in infectivity. The fact that infectivity was only partially inhibited (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) suggests the lack of PFUs produced in culture with blood (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) cannot be completely explained by inhibition of adsorption.

Its epidemiology has shifted, resulting in methicillin-resistant strains having similar prevalence to methicillin-sensitive strains in clinical settings. Because studies generally identify single MRSA genotypes from sterile site infections (Young et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), most MRSA infections are believed to be caused by single rather than multiple different genotypes. There was no evidence based on the MRSA culture data and susceptibility patterns of mixed infections in the 10 subjects studied. While much is known about its pathogenicity, the <italic>in vivo</italic> gene expression of MRSA and its lysogenic phage have yet to be thoroughly examined in humans. Our technique for characterizing MRSA <italic>ex vivo</italic> gene expression was unique in that it involved examining the gene expression of MRSA cultured directly from the blood of different human subjects with bloodstream infections without any separate <italic>in vitro</italic> culture steps, followed by comparisons with <italic>in vitro</italic> growth to identify differences that might be attributable to life in the human bloodstream. While not technically an <italic>in vivo</italic> technique because of the separate culture step, we identified numerous differences between <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> MRSA gene expression profiles, with the lysogenic phage providing the most notable differences. Although the group of subjects we studied was relatively heterogeneous in their underlying comorbidities, each had invasive MRSA bloodstream infections. The heterogeneity in their comorbidities and individualized medical therapies may be responsible for the variability observed in gene expression from each subject (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Because it took approximately 72 h to identify those subjects who had MRSA bloodstream infections, most of the subjects enrolled in this study had either cleared their bacteremia or were deceased by the time a diagnosis was made. This severely limited our ability to obtain further specimens to test biological replicates. Because some of the subjects were critically ill and treated with complex antibiotic combinations (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), the features of their immune responses and antibiotic regimens would be difficult to replicate <italic>in vitro</italic>, which further adds to the uniqueness of this cohort and the responses of the MRSA isolates studied. The differences in MRSA gene expression profiles observed cannot be solely attributed to antibiotics, as there were different gene expression profiles observed in subjects treated with the same antibiotic regimens.</p><p>We were highly interested in the expression of mobile genetic elements (including phage, plasmids, and transposons) associated with bacterial infections in the human bloodstream, as they may be the primary means by which new gene functions are transmitted in nature. Beta lactamases expressed on mobile elements <italic>ex vivo</italic> were significantly overexpressed compared to <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), suggesting that their expression may be part of the organism's stress response to human blood. Because most of the subjects studied were not treated with beta lactam antibiotics, the regulation of these beta lactamases likely is independent of beta lactam therapy. While beta lactamases were more highly expressed <italic>ex vivo</italic>, <italic>mecA</italic> expression was stable under each growth condition. Because the MecA penicillin binding protein is involved in the normal processing of the MRSA cell wall, its expression might not be expected to be substantially altered when cultured in media with human blood.</p><p>While there has been some prior analysis of the effect of human blood on prophage (Gaidelyte et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), our <italic>ex vivo</italic> data strongly suggest that repression of certain prophage is characteristic of MRSA invasive bloodstream infections. This was supported by the higher <italic>ex vivo</italic> expression of repressor genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), which are essential for the inhibition of the phage lytic genes. An inverse effect was noted <italic>in vitro</italic>, where the higher expression of anti-repressor genes was indicative of the expression of the phage lytic module. We were unable to place the MRSA genomes into lineage groups (Lindsay et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; McCarthy and Lindsay, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) based on the presence/absence of mobile genetic elements because the heterogeneity in gene expression and the potential for prior horizontal gene transfers (McCarthy et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>) could have led to erroneous results. There also was altered expression of site-specific recombinases in this cohort, but their potential dual roles in integration and excision complicates their interpretation (Hanssen and Ericson Sollid, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Malachowa and Deleo, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>In addition to altered phage expression in response to blood in culture media, we found that infectivity of the phage also was diminished, likely through inhibition of adsorption (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) (Martin and White, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>; Nordstrom et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>). These results suggest that the transport and adsorption of phage particles, as well as the transmission of phage-encoded genes, may be restricted during MRSA bloodstream infections in humans. We also identified certain phage that were specifically inhibited by culture in media with human blood (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), and their strong similarities to prophage found in other MRSA isolates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) suggests that they also may be inhibited by blood. Not all MRSA isolates had produced phage particles that we could detect using acceptor strain RN10950. We also utilized strain RN4220 (a restriction deficient <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain cured of three prophage) (Novick, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1967</xref>), but were unable to detect phage from the other MRSA isolates. Our study differs significantly from a prior study documenting the effects of human blood on staphylococcal phage. In that study, the authors concentrated specifically on phage that were expressed during culture in media with human blood (Gaidelyte et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), whereas our study identifies those phage that were inhibited by culture with human blood. Also, in contrast to that study, our data on these specific MRSA phage shows that infectivity was diminished in the presence of blood (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>The production of viable phage from prophage in the MRSA genomes in this study directly supported the RNA sequencing data. We observed a substantial over-expression of phage repressors <italic>ex vivo</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), which correlated directly with the inhibition of phage production in human blood (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Although most MRSA isolates in our study carried integrases, which often indicate the presence of prophage, not all strains produced viable prophage that we could detect with our acceptor strains. This suggests that some of our MRSA strains carried prophage remnants and/or cryptic prophage rather than viable prophage (Canchaya et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Casjens, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). With the exception of isolate 6MRA, most CA-MRSA strains produced viable phage, compared to only one HA-MRSA strain (3MRA). The phage we identified (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) had virulence genes such as staphylokinase (involved in tissue destruction), toxin/antitoxin systems (may be involved in defense, drug tolerance, programmed cell death, and growth control) (Nolle et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and genes for an immune escape complex (involved in immune evasion) (Goerke et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), which suggests that these phage may play several different roles in MRSA pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>While some studies have profiled <italic>S. aureus in vitro</italic> behavior (Renzoni et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Sass et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) and gene expression profiles in mouse models (Allard et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Chaffin et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), the gene expression of their bacteriophage and other mobile genetic elements have not been examined <italic>in vivo</italic>. While our <italic>ex vivo</italic> model includes a separate culture step, the blood culturing step was absolutely necessary to first identify those human subjects that had invasive bloodstream infections. The benefit of the model was that we could isolate each strain <italic>in vitro</italic>, and thus discern differences in bacteriophage and mobile genetic elements gene expression profiles between <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> that may have represented adaptation to life in the human bloodstream. The expression of mobile genetic elements was amongst the most significant differences between gene expression profiles <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, and these differences identified may have consequences for the human host. From the over-expression of beta lactamases on plasmids and transposons <italic>ex vivo</italic>, to the repression of prophage expression and adsorption during culture in media with human blood, differences in the expression of mobile genetic elements were characteristic of the MRSA <italic>ex vivo</italic> response. As we continue to study the behavior of human pathogens, <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies such as this provide further insights into the gene expression patterns in pathogens and their viruses as they adapt to life in the human host.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s5"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Human subject involvement in this study was approved by the University of California, San Diego Administrative Panel on Human Subjects in Medical Research.

Samples 21MRA and 23MRA were taken from the same subject approximately 48 h apart for a total of 11 different samples from 10 subjects. From each subject, 8&#x02013;10 mL of blood was inoculated directly at bedside into 30 ml of media in BD Bactec Plus aerobic culture vials (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD) and incubated for approximately 4&#x02013;8 h until positive by fluorescent detection using the Bactec FX system (Zadroga et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Positive cultures were gram stained, grown on sheep blood agar plates, and subjected to a coagulase test for a presumptive identification of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Identification and susceptibility testing was performed using the BD Phoenix system (Stefaniuk et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) to confirm the presence of MRSA in the bloodstream of each subject. Susceptibilities were based on MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) breakpoints using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (CLSI, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Each isolate was assayed for susceptibility to antibiotics cefazolin, clindamycin, daptomycin, linezolid, oxacillin, rifampin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin. Clindamycin susceptibility was verified by D-test (Woods, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). A minimum of 3 mL of each positive sample in the standard aerobic culture vial was immediately processed in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> arm of this study. For <italic>the in vitro</italic> growth conditions, each identified MRSA strain was grown on blood agar plates, and reconstituted in tryptic soy broth at an OD600 of 0.1. One milliliter of this suspension was diluted in 7 ml of sterile normal saline and inoculated into the BD Bactec Plus aerobic culture vials and incubated for approximately 3&#x02013;6 h until positive by fluorescent detection using the Bactec FX system. One milliliter of this suspension was immediately processed in the <italic>in vitro</italic> arm of this study.</p></sec><sec><title>MRSA growth conditions</title><p>OD<sub>600</sub> values for each isolate grown in the BD Bactec Plus aerobic vials was determined at the time of fluorescence detection (approximately 3.5 to 4.5 h, depending on the isolate). To determine the growth phase at the time of fluorescence detection, MRSA isolates were grown for 16 h in BD Bactec Plus aerobic broth and reconstituted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1. Cultures were then incubated at 35&#x000b0;C in BD Bactec Plus aerobic broth with gentle agitation and OD<sub>600</sub> values for each isolate was determined at 15 min intervals over a 24 h period to construct growth curves. CFU/mL for each isolate under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions were determined by plating 100 &#x003bc;L of serial dilutions onto BHI agar plates and incubated at 35&#x000b0;C for 16 h. Because the presence of the blood prohibited us from using direct comparisons of OD<sub>600</sub> values between the <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures, we determined the CFU/mL counts from each subject <italic>ex vivo</italic> to estimate the growth phase at the time of fluorescence detection by plating 100 &#x003bc;L of serial dilutions on BHI agar plates. All <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures were found to be in early to mid log phase at the time of detection. Two volumes of RNA protect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was added directly to the cultures, and they were pelleted and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until RNA extraction.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction, enrichment, and sequencing</title><p>RNA from both the <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> samples were processed identically from all subjects and MRSA isolates. Total RNA was extracted using the Mirvana kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), with the inclusion of a bead-beating step for 20 min with Lysing-Matrix B (MP Bio, Santa Ana, CA). Total RNA then was enriched for microbial RNA using MicrobEnrich (Life Technologies), and further enriched for mRNA using MicrobExpress (Life Technologies) and MegaClear (Life Technologies), which are designed to remove ribosomal RNAs. Enriched RNA then was prepared for sequencing through the construction of cDNA libraries using the Ion Total RNA-Seq kit (Life Technologies), and subjected to successive rounds of Ampure bead purification (Beckman-Coulter, Brea, CA) to remove small cDNAs. Libraries were quantified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer HS DNA Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and then were sequenced on a 314 chips using an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (Rothberg et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), producing an average of 559,129 reads per subject of mean length 106 nucleotides.

Each transcriptome was screened for contaminating human nucleic acids using BLASTN analysis (E-score &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) against the human reference database available at <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/</ext-link>.

RPKM (reads per kilobase per million) values were determined based on the read mappings, and values were normalized for each subject and growth condition. A heatmap demonstrating the distribution of gene expression based on normalized RPKM values was generated using CLC Genomics Workbench 4.65. Virtually identical heatmaps also were generated when reads were mapped against genomes of other MRSA strains including COL, JH1, Mu50, TCH1516, and Newman. RPKM values also were used as input for principal coordinates analysis, and were performed based on binary Sorensen distances using Qiime (Caporaso et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of gene expression from different subsystems in MRSA were determined by blastX analysis of the SEED database using MG-Rast (E-score &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) (Meyer et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Mobile genetic element and virulence gene expression was determined based on the proportion of each selected mobile element or virulence gene to the total mobile genetic element or virulence gene RPKM values. Subsystems such as mobile genetic elements and virulence genes were determined based on homologies to genes designated to those functions in the SEED database (Meyer et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Statistical significance was determined by comparing the means for all subjects for all subsystems between the <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> subject groups by two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests using Microsoft Excel 2007 (Microsoft Corp., Redman, WA). Analysis of the expression differences between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> groups for individual genes also were determined by comparisons of means. The data for each individual gene were compared between MG-Rast and the normalized RPKM values obtained from CLC Genomics Workbench 4.65 to verify that they produced similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Prophage stimulation and sequencing</title><p>Each MRSA strain was grown in BHI broth (Becton, Dickinson, MD, USA) for approximately 3 h at 37&#x000b0;C with shaking at 200 rpm to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5. The average number of cells was similar between each MRSA strain (1.84 &#x000b1; 0.45 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> Colony Forming Units (CFU)/mL). Each strain then was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm, pellets re-suspended in 500 &#x003bc;L of BHI broth or human blood (Novick, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1963</xref>), and mitomycin C added to a final concentration of 2 &#x003bc;g/mL. The human blood used was drawn into heparin tubes (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD) from healthy donors. MRSA cultures without the addition of mitomycin C were used as experimental controls and were without evidence of any prophage production, with the exception of isolates 3MRA and 20MRA. Each was left for 16 h at 32&#x000b0;C with shaking at 50 rpm. To determine the number of phage produced, cultures were centrifuged for 5 min at 14, 000 rpm to remove cellular debris, and filtered through 0.2 &#x003bc;m pore membrane filters (25 mm, Whatman GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Supernatants were cultured for the presence of any residual bacteria, and no bacteria could be cultured from any. We tested the supernatants for the presence of viable phage using the double layer method (Novick, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). Briefly, <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain RN10950 (<italic>S. aureus</italic> Newman strain with all four prophage deleted) (Bae et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) was grown for 4 h at 37&#x000b0;C with shaking at 200 rpm to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.0. Then, 100 &#x003bc;L of <italic>S. aureus</italic> RN10950 and 100 &#x003bc;L of the phage supernatants were added to 3 mL of phage top agar and poured onto phage bottom agar plates (Novick, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). Plates were incubated at 32&#x000b0;C for 16 h and viral plaques were enumerated and reported as Plaque Forming Units (PFU)/mL.</p><p>To determine if blood may inhibit phage infectivity, phage 3MRA and 23MRA were added to 1 mL of BHI or fresh human blood and incubated at 32&#x000b0;C with shaking at 50 rpm to maintain the conditions used in induction experiments. Aliquots were collected at 0, 4, and 16 h to determine the infectivity of phage. Blood cells were removed prior to plating phage by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min and filtered through 0.45 &#x003bc;m filters. The phage in BHI also was centrifuged and filtered for consistency. <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain RN10950 was grown for 4 h at 37&#x000b0;C with shaking at 200 rpm to an OD600 of 1.0. Then, 100 &#x003bc;L of RN10950 and 100 &#x003bc;L of BHI or blood containing the seeded phage were serially diluted and added to 3 mL of phage top agar and poured onto phage bottom agar plates. Plates were incubated at 32&#x000b0;C for 16 h and viral plaques were enumerated and reported as PFU/mL. All experiments were performed in triplicate.</p><p>Phage were isolated as previously described (Santiago-Rodriguez et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Briefly, viral plaques were retrieved using a sterile pipette and placed in 500 &#x003bc;L of 1&#x000d7; PBS. The plug was dislodged using a sterile pipette and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and further propagated by adding 100 &#x003bc;L of the phage supernatant and 100 &#x003bc;L (OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.0) of <italic>S. aureus</italic> RN10950 to 3 mL of top agar. The mixture was poured onto phage bottom agar plates and incubated at 32&#x000b0;C for 24 h. The top agar was collected and centrifuged at 7500 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and filtered sequentially through 0.45 &#x003bc;m filters and 0.22 &#x003bc;m filters. The propagation step was repeated until complete lysis was observed. Supernatants then were purified on a cesium chloride gradient according to previously described protocols for isolation of viruses (Pride et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Only the fraction with a density corresponding to most known bacteriophage (Murphy et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) was retained, further purified on Amicon YM-100 protein purification columns (Millipore, Inc., Bellerica, MA), treated with DNase I, and subjected to lysis and DNA purification using the Qiagen UltraSens virus kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Resulting DNA was fragmented to roughly 200 to 400 bp using a Bioruptor (Diagenode, Denville, NJ), and utilized as input to create libraries using the Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit according to manufacturer's instructions. Libraries then were sequenced using a 314 chip on an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) (Rothberg et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) producing an average read length of approximately 216 bp for each sample. Sequence reads were trimmed according to modified Phred scores of 0.5 using CLC Genomics Workbench 4.65 (CLC bio USA, Cambridge, MA). Any low complexity reads (where &#x0003e;25% of the length were due to homopolymer tracts), reads with substantial length variation (&#x0003c;50 nucleotides or &#x0003e;300 nucleotides), or reads with ambiguous characters also were removed prior to further analysis. Remaining reads were assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench 4.65 based on 98% identity with a minimum of 50% read overlap, which are more stringent than criteria developed to discriminate between highly related viruses (Breitbart et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The consensus sequence for each assembled phage was constructed according to majority rule. Viral contigs were analyzed using FGenesV (Softberry Inc, Mount Kisco, NY) for ORF prediction, and individual ORFs analyzed using BLASTP analysis against the NCBI non-redundant database (Escore &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>). Alignments of phage genomes were performed with progressiveMauve using the default settings (Darling et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Sequences of each <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> phage are available in Genbank under accession numbers KJ452291 and KJ452292. The reverse complements of these phage genome sequences were utilized in the genome alignments.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>Conceived and designed experiments: DTP and MBJ.
