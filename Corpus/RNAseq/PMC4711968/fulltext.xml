These methods are now being implemented both in molecular diagnostic settings and in basic research laboratories and hold great promise for discovering the genetic bases of rare and complex diseases [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, even if next-generation sequencing has greatly improved the detection of nucleotide changes in the genome of each individual, the biological and clinical interpretation of most variants remains challenging, representing one of the major hurdles in current medical genetics [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Several reasons account for the difficulty in distinguishing which variants may cause or contribute to disease [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]: (i) the number of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) detected in each genome is very high, (ii) many disorders are genetically heterogeneous and often caused by rare variants, (iii) access to clinical and family data, such as pedigrees, is frequently limited, (iv) <italic>in silico</italic> tools aiming at identifying deleterious changes are still imperfect, and (v) biological samples from variant carriers are rarely available for functional analysis. There is obviously a great need for overcoming these limitations, and considerable efforts are now deployed for developing strategies allowing prioritization of variants for functional testing [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In general, scrupulous attention is given to exonic SNVs mapping to protein coding regions, especially to those producing missense changes. Indeed, one of the most widely used strategies for narrowing down the number of variants susceptible of causing disease is to use a combination of <italic>in silico</italic> tools that focus on protein features (such as PolyPhen-2, SIFT and Mutation Assessor, among others) [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Yet, such protein-centric view of the exome landscape merely represents a fraction of the &#x0201c;expression code&#x0201d; underlying each gene sequence. Current knowledge clearly indicates that, besides their protein coding potential, exonic sequences can play an important role in RNA splicing (reviewed in [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). Notably, (i) the first and the last 3 exonic positions are an integral part of 3&#x02019; and 5&#x02019;splice site (3&#x02019;ss and 5&#x02019;ss) consensus sequences, and (ii) exons may also contain splicing regulatory elements (ESRs), such as exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) and exonic splicing silencers (ESSs). ESEs and ESSs usually correspond to 6&#x02013;8 nucleotide stretches that serve as landing pads for splicing activator or splicing repressor proteins, respectively, thereby influencing the recruitment and activity of the splicing machinery. Whereas 3&#x02019;ss and 5&#x02019;ss consensus sequences have been extensively characterized leading to the development of <italic>in silico</italic> tools that reliably predict alterations in splice site strength (such as MaxEntScan, SpliceSiteFinder-like and Human Splicing Finder, among others), ESRs are still poorly understood and generally regarded as difficult to predict by using bioinformatics approaches [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Lately, three new <italic>in silico</italic> approaches were described as promising tools to predict variant-induced ESR alterations. The first approach relies on ESRseq scores established through experimental assessment of the ESR properties of all possible 6-nucleotide motifs [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Calculation of total ESRseq score changes (&#x00394;tESRseq), taking into account overlapping hexamers and variant-induced changes, was then implemented by our group as a tool to predict the impact on splicing produced by exonic variants [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The second approach is based on Z<sub>EI</sub> scores derived from a RESCUE-type analysis that computed the relative distribution of hexamer motifs in exons and introns [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. According to this study, the value of total HZ<sub>EI</sub> score changes (&#x00394;HZ<sub>EI</sub>, also corresponding to overlapping hexamers) can be applied for predicting the impact on splicing of any exonic variant. The third and last approach relies on &#x00394;&#x003a8; values (&#x003a8;, percent spliced in) that were bioinformatically established upon compilation of RNAseq data obtained from different tissues, and integration of a large set of pre-established sequence features [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The &#x00394;&#x003a8;-based approach was developed to predict splicing aberrations induced by any sequence change, either intronic or exonic, including variants affecting splice sites or splicing regulatory signals.</p><p>Today, it is estimated that ~15% of all point mutations causing human inherited disorders disrupt splice-site consensus sequences, particularly at intronic positions [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Yet, it is now speculated, based on <italic>in silico</italic> data, that disease-causing aberrant RNA splicing may be more widespread than currently appreciated, with up to 25% of exonic disease-associated variants being expected to disturb ESRs [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Here, we decided to use the exon 10 of the <italic>MLH1</italic> gene as a paradigm to experimentally evaluate these assumptions. <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 was selected as model system for 3 main reasons: (i) <italic>MLH1</italic> is the major gene implicated in Lynch syndrome, one of the most frequent forms of hereditary cancer worldwide, formerly known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), (ii) this gene exhibits a large mutational spectrum, with at least 30% of variants being currently classified as variants of unknown significance and for which large national and international efforts persist in bringing clarification [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and (iii) alterations of potential ESRs were already reported for 3 SNVs in this exon [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>We retrieved all SNVs identified in <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 and analyzed their impact on splicing by resorting to both minigene-based assays and analysis of patient&#x02019;s RNA when available. Moreover, we used our experimental data to perform a comparative analysis of the 3 newly developed <italic>in silico</italic> tools aiming at predicting variant-induced ESR alterations. Our results revealed an unexpected high number of splicing mutations in <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10, most of which affecting potential ESRs, thus corroborating our initial hypotheses. Moreover, we confirmed the predictive power of &#x00394;tESRseq- and &#x00394;HZ<sub>EI</sub>- based approaches, but not that of &#x00394;&#x003a8;, for pinpointing this type of mutations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Identification of an unexpected high proportion of splicing mutations in the exon 10 of <italic>MLH1</italic></title><p>We have recently shown that a high number of variants (15 out of 36, i.e. 42%) identified in the exon 7 of the <italic>BRCA2</italic> gene have a negative impact on splicing [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], a finding strongly suggesting that either <italic>BRCA2</italic> exon 7 is exceptionally sensitive to exonic splicing mutations, or that this type of mutations is more frequent than currently estimated. To test these hypotheses, we decided to study the impact on splicing of SNVs identified in another gene, more specifically in <italic>MLH1</italic>, a gene implicated in Lynch syndrome. Our approach was to use the exon 10 of <italic>MLH1</italic> as a model system. We began by interrogating National and International public databases in order to retrieve all single substitutions reported in this exon (<xref rid="pgen.1005756.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005756.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). As a result, we found a total of 22 SNVs, most of which identified in cancer patients suspected of Lynch syndrome, including 15 missense, 3 nonsense and 4 synonymous variants. Only 9 of these SNVs are currently classified as clearly pathogenic, and 1 as clearly not pathogenic (<xref rid="pgen.1005756.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). To assess the impact of all 22 variants on <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 splicing, we performed an <italic>ex vivo</italic> splicing assay with pSPL3m-M1e10-derived minigenes (<xref rid="pgen.1005756.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). As shown on Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005756.g001" ref-type="fig">1C</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005756.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>, the wild-type pSPL3m-M1e10 minigene predominantly generated transcripts containing exon 10 (79% exon inclusion), and a minority of transcripts without exon 10. These results are in agreement with those previously reported by using the same minigene system [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and indicate that wild-type pSPL3m-M1e10 mimics, at least in part, the alternative splicing pattern of endogenous <italic>MLH1</italic> transcripts [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] (~35% to 67% exon 10 inclusion in normal blood samples, according to a study from Charbonnier and collaborators [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). Importantly, the minigene assay results revealed that 17 out of the 22 SNVs (77%) altered the splicing pattern of exon 10 relative to wild-type (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005756.g001" ref-type="fig">1C</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005756.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). More precisely, 13 variants increased exon skipping, 4 variants increased exon inclusion, and only 5 variants showed no effect on splicing. Of note, 8 of the 13 exon-skipping mutations (5 missense, 1 synonymous, and 2 nonsense) are currently classified as pathogenic (<xref rid="pgen.1005756.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The 13 variants increasing exon 10 skipping can be separated into three categories according to the severity of the splicing defect observed in the pSPL3m-M1e10 minigene assay: a first category consisting of 6 variants causing near-total exon skipping (7% to 9% exon inclusion: c.793C&#x0003e;A, c.882C&#x0003e;T, c.883A&#x0003e;C, c.883A&#x0003e;G, c.884G&#x0003e;A and c.884G&#x0003e;C; <xref rid="pgen.1005756.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005756.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Fig</xref>), a second category consisting of five variants inducing moderate skipping (26% to 67% exon inclusion: c.793C&#x0003e;T, c.794G&#x0003e;A, c.845C&#x0003e;G, c.851T&#x0003e;A and c.882C&#x0003e;G, <xref rid="pgen.1005756.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) and a third category consisting of 2 variants (c.840T&#x0003e;A and c.842C&#x0003e;T) that led not only to increased exon 10 skipping (51% and 18% exon inclusion, respectively, <xref rid="pgen.1005756.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) but also to deletion of the last 48 nucleotides of the exon in a small fraction of the minigene transcripts (<xref rid="pgen.1005756.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>, right panel). A bioionformatics analysis using splice site-dedicated algorithms revealed that both variants, c.840T&#x0003e;A and c.842C&#x0003e;T, create a 5&#x02019;splice site at exonic position +46 (<italic>MLH1</italic> c.836, <xref rid="pgen.1005756.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig</xref>), which explains the 48-nucleotide deletion at the end of the exon but not the predominant exclusion of the entire exon.</p><table-wrap id="pgen.1005756.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005756.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title><italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 variants analyzed in this study.</title><p><italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 spans nucleotide positions c.791 to c.884.

Our results indicate that, in contrast to pSPL3m-M1e10 and as expected, wild-type pCAS2-M1e10 exclusively generated transcripts containing exon 10. We also observed that 5 out of 6 variants from the first category exhibited a behavior similar to the one observed with the pSPL3m minigenes, i.e. near-total exon 10 skipping; the exception being c.882C&#x0003e;T that induced partial, though strong, exon 10 skipping in the pCAS2 system. Four out of 5 variants from the second category showed splicing defects less severe than the ones observed with pSPL3m-M1e10 and, in one case, c.851T&#x0003e;A, no splicing anomaly was detected. One should note that the level of exon skipping induced by this last variant was borderline noticeable in the pSPL3m-derived minigene (<xref rid="pgen.1005756.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005756.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). As for the third category group, we observed that the splicing defects detected in the pSPL3m minigene were faithfully reproduced in pCAS2 for one of the variants (c.842C&#x0003e;T, which predominantly yielded exon-skipped products) but not for the other (c.840T&#x0003e;A). The fact that, in the pCAS2 system, c.840T&#x0003e;A predominantly produced transcripts containing exon 10 deleted of its last 48 nucleotides and almost no exon-skipped products (<xref rid="pgen.1005756.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>) suggests that the type and severity of the splicing defect caused by this variant depends on surrounding nucleotide context.</p><p>We surmise, given their position at the termini of the exon, that 7 out of the 17 splicing mutations detected in exon 10 directly affect the definition of the reference splice sites, either at the level of the 3&#x02019;splice site (YAG&#x02502;<underline>G</underline>, first exonic position underlined) or of the 5&#x02019;splice site (<underline>CAG</underline>&#x02502;GURAGU, 3 last exonic positions underlined) [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Accordingly, the effects produced by these 7 variants (c.791A&#x0003e;G, c.882C&#x0003e;G, c.882C&#x0003e;T, c.883A&#x0003e;C, c.883A&#x0003e;G, c.884G&#x0003e;A and c.884G&#x0003e;C) could have been predicted by algorithms commonly used to predict the strength of splice sites, such as Splice Site Finder, MaxEntScan, and Human Splice Finder (HSF-ss). As shown on <xref rid="pgen.1005756.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>, <italic>in silico</italic> data derived from these programs strongly suggest that c.791A&#x0003e;G improves exon inclusion by directly increasing the strength of the 3&#x02019;splice site, and that the variants at the last three positions of the exon (c.882 to c.884), induce exon skipping by decreasing, to different extents, the strength of the 5&#x02019;splice site. Moreover, according to this bioinformatics analysis, especially with MaxEntScan (MES), one could have correctly predicted that the splicing defect produced by c.882C&#x0003e;G is less severe than the one induced by c.882C&#x0003e;T. Our data further indicates that a decrease in 5&#x02019;ss MES score of &#x02265;19% predicts very drastic exon 10 skipping.</p><p>Because the 10 remaining splicing mutations detected in <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 are located outside the positions directly defining the splice sites, we strongly suspect that they interfere with exon recognition by altering ESRs. This type of splicing mutations includes variants that map within the first two thirds of exon 10 and are responsible for inducing either exon skipping (c.793C&#x0003e;A, c.793C&#x0003e;T, c.794G&#x0003e;A c.840T&#x0003e;A, c.842C&#x0003e;T, c.845C&#x0003e;G and c.851T&#x0003e;A) or exon inclusion (c.814T&#x0003e;G, c.815T&#x0003e;C and c.855C&#x0003e;T).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Detection of potential splicing regulatory elements in the exon 10 of <italic>MLH1</italic></title><p>To better understand how <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 splicing is regulated and how certain SNVs disturb this process, we decided to functionally characterize different regions of the exon in the context of pcDNA-Dup. This three-exon minigene contains a middle exon particularly sensitive to alterations of splicing regulatory elements [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For this purpose, four partially overlapping segments covering the entire exon 10 of <italic>MLH1</italic> (R1 to R4, ~30 bp-long each) were individually inserted into the middle exon of this construct and then tested in the context of an <italic>ex vivo</italic> splicing assay (<xref rid="pgen.1005756.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="pgen.1005756.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, our results revealed that region R1 (<italic>MLH1</italic> c.791-819) strongly contributed to the recognition of the middle exon. Regions R2 (c.809-c.840), R3 (c.828-c.859) and R4 (c.856-c.884) had a positive effect on exon inclusion as well, although more moderate for R2 and R3 (in comparison to R1), and weak for R4. Next, we tested all <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 splicing mutations suspected of altering splicing regulatory elements (n = 10, <xref rid="pgen.1005756.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Importantly, we found that 8 out of these 10 variations altered the splicing efficiency of the middle exon relative to wild-type (<xref rid="pgen.1005756.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Variants c.793C&#x0003e;A and c.793C&#x0003e;T (both tested in the context of the R1 segment) induced exon skipping, with c.793C&#x0003e;A having an effect stronger than c.793C&#x0003e;T and thus faithfully recapitulating the defects initially detected in pSPL3m-M1e10 and pCAS2-M1e10 minigene assays. The impact on splicing of variants c.814T&#x0003e;G and c.815T&#x0003e;C was also reproduced in the context of pcDNA-Dup as both variants led to an increase in middle exon inclusion (R2 segment). Finally, variants c.840T&#x0003e;A, c.842C&#x0003e;T, c.845C&#x0003e;G and c.851T&#x0003e;A induced middle exon skipping (R3 segment), with c.842C&#x0003e;T having the more pronounced effect, reminiscent of the effects observed in the pSPL3m-M1e10 and pCAS2-M1e10 assays. Results obtained with c.793C&#x0003e;T and c.842C&#x0003e;T agree with those previously reported by using the pcDNA-Dup system [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In contrast, we found that the splicing alterations induced by c.794G&#x0003e;A and c.855C&#x0003e;T in the context of pSPL3m-M1e10 minigene could not be reproduced in the pcDNA-Dup assay. As shown on <xref rid="pgen.1005756.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>, c.794G&#x0003e;A did not induce middle exon skipping (R1 segment), and c.855C&#x0003e;T did not lead to an increase in exon inclusion (R3 segment), on the contrary, it slightly increased middle exon skipping. We hypothesize that the effect on splicing of these particular variants depends on surrounding nucleotide context. In conclusion, these experiments point to an apparent asymmetry in the distribution of ESRs in <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10, with a potential ESE-enrichment at the 5&#x02019; portion, corresponding to about the first 2/3 of the exon, and/or an ESS-enrichment towards the 3&#x02019;end. Moreover, the evidence of portability, i.e. that the splicing defects caused by most of the analyzed SNVs can be reproduced in a completely heterologous system, further supports the hypothesis that these variants modify <italic>bona fide</italic> splicing regulatory elements.</p><fig id="pgen.1005756.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005756.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Characterization of <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 variants affecting potential ESRs by using an ESR-dependent minigene assay.</title><p>(A) Strategy for mapping potential splicing regulatory regions in <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10.

Because it remained to be determined if these tools could be applied to new cases and how they compare to each other, we next decided to evaluate their performance by using the output of the pSPL3m-M1e10 minigene assay as a new dataset. We started by separating the fifteen <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 SNVs located at distance from the splice sites into three groups based on the minigene results (<xref rid="pgen.1005756.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). The first group included mutations that increased exon 10 skipping (n = 7), the second group included variations with no effect on exon 10 splicing (n = 5) and the third group included those that increased exon 10 inclusion (n = 3). Then, score differences (&#x00394;tESRseq, &#x00394;HZ<sub>EI</sub>, and &#x00394;&#x003a8;) were calculated for each variant and plotted in a parallel fashion in order to easily confront the discriminating power of the three bioinformatics approaches (<xref rid="pgen.1005756.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Visual inspection of the plots revealed a striking distribution of &#x00394;tESRseq clearly distinguishing the 3 groups of variants. More specifically, most variants with no effect on exon 10 splicing seemed to display &#x00394;tESRseq values higher than those increasing exon skipping and lower than those increasing exon inclusion. This feature was not so clearly noticeable for &#x00394;HZ<sub>EI</sub> or &#x00394;&#x003a8;. A statistical analysis further confirmed that &#x00394;tESRseq values were overall concordant with the separation of variants in 3 groups according to minigene data (ANOVA test, p-value of 0.03), whereas &#x00394;HZ<sub>EI</sub> and &#x00394;&#x003a8; were not (ANOVA test, p-values of 0.15 and 0.59, respectively) (<xref rid="pgen.1005756.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005756.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen.1005756.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005756.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Comparison of pSPL3m-M1e10 minigene data with results obtained from new ESR-dedicated bioinformatics tools.</title><p>Top, middle and bottom panels refer to results obtained with &#x00394;tESRseq-, &#x00394;HZ<sub>EI-</sub> and &#x00394;&#x003a8;-based bioinformatics approaches, respectively, as described under Materials and Methods. <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 variants located within the sequences that define the reference splice sites were eliminated from this analysis.

These data are concordant with previous studies describing exon 10 as an alternative exon that is naturally partially skipped, either alone or in combination with exon 9 and/or exon 11 [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We also observed that, as compared to controls, the sample derived from patient P<sub>793CT.1</sub> showed a lower amount of full-length transcripts (FL), and a higher amount of transcripts lacking exon 10 (&#x00394;10), indicative of aberrant splicing. Sequencing of the FL products revealed the presence of WT (c.793C) exon 10 only (<xref rid="pgen.1005756.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, right panel), which suggests that in this sample the exon 10-skipped products mostly derive from the mutant allele (c.793T), and that the variant-associated splicing defect is very severe. Importantly, the observation that c.793C&#x0003e;T is associated with a drastic splicing defect in endogenous <italic>MLH1</italic> transcripts agrees with the data obtained in the minigene assays (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005756.g001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005756.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005756.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>), especially in the context of pSPL3m-M1e10 c.793C&#x0003e;T, which showed a very high level of exon skipping.

Our findings, shown on <xref rid="pgen.1005756.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>, indicate that the FL transcripts expressed from the mutant allele were in fact present in the blood cells of patient P<sub>793CT.1</sub> but at very low level as compared to the WT allele (~10%). Given the results of our minigene assays, and RT-PCR analysis of patient&#x02019;s RNA, we conclude that this allelic imbalance is mostly due to c.793C&#x0003e;T-induced exon 10 skipping. Moreover, if one assumes that, in the blood cells of Patient P<sub>793CT.1</sub>, both alleles are transcribed in equal amounts, then one can deduce that the pSPL3m-M1e10 assay closely reflects the effects detected <italic>in vivo</italic> in patient&#x02019;s peripheral blood, at least for this variant.</p><fig id="pgen.1005756.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005756.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Detection of aberrant splicing in the blood cells of a patient carrying <italic>MLH1</italic> c.793C&#x0003e;T variant.</title><p>(A) Comparative RT-PCR analysis of fresh blood RNA samples obtained from 3 healthy control individuals (C1, C2 and C3) and from a patient carrying the heterozygous variant <italic>MLH1</italic> c.793C&#x0003e;T (P<sub>793CT.1</sub>).

Our hypothesis was that exonic splicing mutations were also underestimated in other exons and genes. We thus decided to analyze the impact on splicing of all SNVs identified in the exon 10 of <italic>MLH1</italic> (n = 22), a gene implicated in Lynch syndrome. Before this study, only 5 SNVs in <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 had been reported as causing aberrant splicing; more specifically, they were all shown to increase exon 10 skipping [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our work not only confirmed those initial findings but, importantly, uncovered 12 new splicing mutations (8 exon skipping-, and 4 exon inclusion-mutations), bringing the number of <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 splicing mutations to a total of 17. Hence, our results revealed a striking high proportion of splicing mutations in <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 (77%), largely exceeding the fraction of splicing mutations detected in <italic>BRCA2</italic> exon 7 (42%) [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, we found that the majority of <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 splicing mutations (~60%) map outside the reference splice-site consensus sequences, indicating an important contribution of variant-induced ESR alterations in this exon.</p><p>Importantly, among the 12 new splicing mutations in <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10, we identified 4 SNVs causing increased exon inclusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SNVs having a positive impact on <italic>MLH1</italic> splicing. Besides full-length transcripts, <italic>MLH1</italic> is known to normally produce a fraction of transcripts lacking exon 10, such as &#x00394;10, &#x00394;9/10, &#x00394;10/11 and &#x00394;9/10/11 [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], with &#x00394;9/10 being one of the most frequently reported alternative <italic>MLH1</italic> isoforms [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It is possible that the 4 variants that increased exon 10 inclusion in our minigene assays also disturb <italic>MLH1</italic> physiological alternative splicing leading to a higher production of FL transcripts and lower amount of &#x00394;10, &#x00394;9/10 and &#x00394;9/10/11. Because the role of alternative <italic>MLH1</italic> isoforms is still unknown [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], it is difficult to predict the biological and clinical consequences of these splicing alterations. Of note, a few cases of variant-induced exon inclusion have already been described in other genes. Particularly, previous studies have shown that mutations that increase exon inclusion can have a significant clinical impact. For instance, they can behave as protective factors, as is the case of <italic>SMN2</italic> c.859G&#x0003e;C (p.Gly287Arg), a variant that attenuates the severity of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) by increasing inclusion of <italic>SMN2</italic> exon 7 [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Moreover, mutations inducing exon inclusion can also be harmful, as is the case for the majority of mutations identified in the exon 10 of the <italic>Microtubule Associated Protein Tau</italic> gene (<italic>MAPT</italic>) (reviewed in [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]). It has been shown that dysregulation of <italic>MAPT</italic> exon 10 splicing disrupts normal tau isoform ratio and leads to neurodegeneration and dementia: increased <italic>MAPT</italic> exon 10 skipping causes Pick disease, whereas increased inclusion typically causes FTDP-17 (frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17).</p><p>Given the challenging need in medical genetics for stratifying exonic variants for functional analyses, we decided to use the experimental data generated in this study to evaluate the predictive power of <italic>in silico</italic> tools at discerning splicing mutations. We found that the impact on splicing of the seven <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 variants mapping within the splice-site consensus sequences (potential splice site-mutations) were correctly predicted by splice site-dedicated <italic>in silico</italic> tools (SSF, MES and HSF-ss). These findings confirm and extend previous studies that highlighted the good reliability of these algorithms for predicting exon skipping-mutations [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], further pinpointing their interest as filtering tools in variant stratification strategies. As for the variants located outside the reference splice sites, our minigene data revealed 10 ESR-mutations and 5 variants with no impact on splicing. We took advantage of these results and selected four additional experimental datasets previously described in other genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] to evaluate the discriminating power of 3 bioinformatics approaches recently described as suitable for predicting variant-induced ESR alterations [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our findings revealed that the &#x00394;tESRseq and &#x00394;HZ<sub>EI</sub> ESR-dedicated tools show the best performance in identifying ESR-mutations, outperforming the previous bioinformatics method EX-SKIP, whereas &#x00394;&#x003a8; did not show compelling predictive power. Our results further indicate that both &#x00394;tESRseq- and &#x00394;HZ<sub>EI-</sub> based approaches can predict the severity of the variant-induced splicing defects, underlining the quantitative character of these methods. It is possible that the &#x00394;tESRseq- and &#x00394;HZ<sub>EI-</sub>based approaches produced somewhat similar results because they both rely on the appreciation of hexamer sequences as ESRs. Interestingly, a correlation between ESRseq and Z<sub>EI</sub> scores has already been reported [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] suggesting that most ESRs are indeed defined by 6-nucleotide stretches and that ESE sequences are more frequently represented in exons than in introns. Contrary to our initial expectations, &#x00394;&#x003a8; displayed the weakest predictive power out of the 3 new <italic>in silico</italic> tools dedicated to identifying ESR alterations. This was unexpected as this method had been validated by using a large set of previously published splicing data, such as data on a plethora of <italic>MLH1</italic> nucleotide variants [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Close inspection of the validation set used on that study revealed a large excess of intronic variants relative to exonic changes, and also a considerable under-representation of known ESR-mutations relative to the total number of variants included in the dataset. Most of the positive predictions reported for &#x00394;&#x003a8; [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] thus correspond to intronic mutations directly affecting splice sites. This may explain why we detected an excess of true negative calls relative to true positive calls when using &#x00394;&#x003a8;-values for predicting ESR-mutations in the five datasets analyzed in this study, and suggests that the &#x00394;&#x003a8;-based method may be overall suitable for predicting mutations directly modifying splice sites but not entirely reliable for predicting those affecting ESRs. In sum, our findings suggest that both &#x00394;tESRseq- and &#x00394;HZ<sub>EI-</sub>, based approaches can be used to stratify exonic variants for functional testing, and that this strategy may help identifying disease-causing variants. We cannot exclude that &#x00394;&#x003a8;-values may be useful in particular conditions and, conversely, that the &#x00394;tESRseq- and &#x00394;HZ<sub>EI-</sub>, based approaches may not be suitable for the analysis of certain exons or genes.</p><p>In the case of <italic>MLH1</italic>, it is clear that severe exon 10 skipping causes Lynch syndrome (reviewed in [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]). Skipping of <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 leads to a shifted reading frame, resulting in a premature stop codon in exon 11 (MLH1 p.His264Leufs*2) and probable degradation of the aberrant transcripts by NMD. Variants inducing total exon 10 skipping cause a drastic loss in FL MLH1 protein and are therefore considered deleterious. In contrast, the clinical significance of variants inducing partial exon 10 skipping is still unknown. First, it is unclear if the amount of FL transcripts produced in the presence of such variants is enough to fulfill <italic>MLH1</italic> function. Second, it is possible that remaining FL <italic>MLH1</italic> transcripts carrying missense variants lead to production of nonfunctional proteins. Additional analyses are thus necessary to determine the biological and clinical significance of partial exon skipping-variants, including protein assays, assessment of patient clinical history and family data. Given that exon 10 codes for part of an important domain of the MLH1 protein (interaction with MUTS&#x003b1;) [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], we suspect that SNVs increasing exon 10 inclusion can either have a protective impact if co-occurring with variants showing the opposite effect, or a deleterious effect if introducing a missense change that severely impairs protein function. Thus, in the absence of further information, <italic>MLH1</italic> missense SNVs inducing exon 10 inclusion, as well as those not affecting splicing, should be considered as variants of unknown significance (VUS). In contrast, the clinical classification of synonymous substitutions not affecting RNA splicing can eventually evolve from VUS to likely not pathogenic depending on expert panel assessment [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, our results revealed an unexpected high number of splicing mutations in the exon 10 of <italic>MLH1</italic>, most of which affecting potential ESRs, and confirmed the predictive power of &#x00394;tESRseq- and &#x00394;HZ<sub>EI</sub>-based approaches for pinpointing this type of mutations, at least in <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10, <italic>BRCA2</italic> exon 7, <italic>BRCA1</italic> exon 6, <italic>CFTR</italic> exon 12 and <italic>NF1</italic> exon 37. In principle, the bioinformatics methods described in our study are amenable to automation and, as such, have the potential to be used as filtering tools for identifying disease-causing candidates among the large number of variants detected by high-throughput DNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Retrieval of <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 variants</title><p>We collected all SNVs reported in the exon 10 of <italic>MLH1</italic>, until January 2013, by interrogating the following public databases: UMD-MLH1 (Universal Mutation Database-MLH1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.umd.be/MLH1/">http://www.umd.be/MLH1/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pgen.1005756.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], LOVD (Leiden Open Variation Database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chromium.liacs.nl/LOVD2/colon_cancer/variants.php?select_db=MLH1">http://chromium.liacs.nl/LOVD2/colon_cancer/variants.php?select_db=MLH1</ext-link>), dbSNP (the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/</ext-link>), and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (the European protein sequence database, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://swissvar.expasy.org/cgi-bin/swissvar/result?global_textfield=MLH1">http://swissvar.expasy.org/cgi-bin/swissvar/result?global_textfield=MLH1</ext-link>) (<xref rid="pgen.1005756.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005756.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Nomenclature</title><p>Nucleotide numbering is based on the cDNA sequence of <italic>MLH1</italic> (NCBI accession number NM_000249.3), c.1 denoting the first nucleotide of the translation initiation codon, as recommended by the Human Genome Variation Society.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Splicing minigene reporter assays</title><p>In order to evaluate the impact on splicing of each <italic>MLH1</italic> exon 10 variant, we performed functional assays based on the comparative analysis of the splicing pattern of wild-type and mutant MLH1 reporter minigenes.
