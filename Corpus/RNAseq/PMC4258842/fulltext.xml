id="P1">The transcription factor FOXM1 binds to sequence-specific motifs on DNA (C/TAAACA) through its DNA binding domain (DBD), and activates proliferation- and differentiation-associated genes. Aberrant overexpression of FOXM1 is a key feature in oncogenesis and progression of many human cancers. Here &#x02014; from a high-throughput screen applied to a library of 54,211 small molecules &#x02014; we identify novel small molecule inhibitors of FOXM1 that block DNA binding. One of the identified compounds: FDI-6 (NCGC00099374) is characterized in depth and is shown to bind directly to FOXM1 protein, to displace FOXM1 from genomic targets in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and induce concomitant transcriptional down-regulation. Global transcript profiling of MCF-7 cells by RNA-seq shows that FDI-6 specifically down regulates FOXM1-activated genes with FOXM1 occupancy confirmed by ChIP-seq. This small molecule mediated effect is selective for FOXM1-controlled genes with no effect on genes regulated by homologous forkhead family factors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">Evidence is accumulating to implicate deregulation of transcription factor networks as a major pathogenic event in many human cancers<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. In healthy cells, transcription factors control the spatial and temporal conversion of DNA-encoded information into functional RNAs and proteins, thereby directing complex signaling pathways crucial to cellular function<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In cancer, mutations in upstream regulators, aberrant gene amplification, and further perturbations resulting from such changes may destabilize proper function of the transcription factor network and drive disease<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. There is a need for tools to intervene directly with transcription factors to dissect how the complex feedback and regulatory mechanisms work in a healthy context, and to evaluate the potential for exploiting these targets therapeutically. Small molecule intervention is a particularly attractive avenue to address both of these points<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. First, ligands can be designed with favorable pharmacokinetic properties or modified to provide spatio-temporal delivery. Second, ligands tailored to specific domains or interfaces that minimize off-target effects may then be employed as tools to further interrogate the target&#x02019;s biological function. Unfortunately, transcription factors outside the nuclear receptor family lack substrate binding pockets, are often characterized by hydrophobic surfaces with few druggable regions and have historically proven difficult targets<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Past efforts to perturb transcriptional pathways have therefore focused on known protein-protein interfaces or particular recognition elements on DNA. Notable examples include distamycin-inspired polyamides, which recognize the DNA minor groove in a sequence-specific manner and have been successfully been applied to disrupt assembly of general transcription machinery at those loci<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Peptidomimetics, like the stapled alpha-helix BCL-2 domains (SAHBs) have generated protease resistant, cell-permeable tools to antagonize protein dimerization and induce selective activation of apoptotic pathways in cancer cells<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Such a strategy might be applied to disrupt transcription factor interactions with promoter DNA. Additionally, a recent publication reports a novel small molecule that directly binds to the oncogenic transcription factor ETV1, and inhibits its transcriptional activity<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The transcription factor FOXM1 regulates a network of proliferation-associated genes critical to mitotic spindle assembly<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, chromosome segregation<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, and G2/M transition<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, with depletion leading to cell cycle arrest. Importantly, aberrant up-regulation of FOXM1 has been shown to be a key driver of cancer progression and has been proposed as an initiating factor of oncogenesis<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, FOXM1 overexpression has been implicated in the development of chemotherapeutic resistance in human breast cancer<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, high protein levels correlate with poor clinical outcome<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and the endogenous level of FOXM1 has been suggested as a general diagnostic biomarker for cancer progression<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Thus, inhibition of FOXM1 activity is an attractive goal for cancer therapy. FOXM1 functions as a gene-specific transcriptional activator by binding to DNA consensus sequences through a highly conserved and well-characterized DNA binding domain (DBD)<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. While such an interface has been recognized as an enticing target, the absence of small molecules known to bind FOXM1 makes structure-based rational design of drug candidates challenging<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Previously, others have shown that the natural product thiostrepton inhibits the transcriptional activity of FOXM1<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. We demonstrated that the ligand makes direct contact with FOXM1 and inhibits DNA binding in cells<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. However, thiostrepton is a promiscuous molecule with potent off-target effects most notably inhibition of the 20S proteasome<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and arrest of mitochondrial protein synthesis<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Thus thiostrepton cannot be used to elucidate the primary effects caused by the inhibition of FOXM1 binding to DNA<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. We designed and exploited a robust, biophysical high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of FOXM1 that block DNA binding. We discovered an inhibitor that blocks FOXM1 binding to DNA in human cancer cells and suppresses the transcription of genes under FOXM1 control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>FOXM1 DNA binding domain associates with consensus motif</title><p id="P5">To interrogate binding of FOXM1 to its consensus DNA duplex, we designed a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In this system association or dissociation of fluorophore-labeled DNA duplex to FOXM1 protein can be monitored as a function of linear and perpendicular polarization<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. We generated a 16 bp dsDNA probe containing repeats of the known FOXM1 recognition motif (T/CAAACA) and a single 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) label ligated to the 5&#x02032;end of the forward strand. Recombinant FOXM1 DNA binding domain (DBD), a truncated fusion product containing only the winged helix domain (aa 222&#x02013;360), was titrated with dsDNA probe and examined by FP, which demonstrated that FOXM1 DBD associates with the DNA probe in a dose dependent manner with K<sub>D</sub> = 224&#x000b1;30 nM (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). This FOXM1 DBD construct has been previously identified as the minimal component of the canonical FOXM1-DNA binding mode<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Notably, the dissociation constant for this truncated form of the protein for its 16 bp DNA consensus target is in good agreement with that of the full-length protein as determined by FP (K<sub>D</sub> = 300&#x000b1;64 nM, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) or by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Thus, we employed FOXM1 DBD to discover novel inhibitors of DNA binding.</p><p id="P6">Titration of a pre-bound complex of FOXM1 DBD and labeled dsDNA probe with increasing amounts of unlabeled dsDNA probe demonstrated the reversibility and specificity of the association (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). As expected, the IC<sub>50</sub> of this displacement (57&#x000b1;5 nM) was near the concentration of the labeled probe (50 nM), indicating that the 5&#x02032;-carboxyfluorescein tag did not affect protein binding. Furthermore, thiostrepton, a previously identified inhibitor of FOXM1 DNA binding, disrupted the FOXM1 DBD-DNA interaction in gel shift assays with IC<sub>50</sub> = 45.0&#x000b1;16.4 &#x003bc;M (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), in good agreement with previously reported values using full length FOXM1, IC<sub>50</sub> = 42.6&#x000b1;1.4 &#x003bc;M<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Development of screening assay for inhibitors of FOXM1&#x02014;DNA</title><p id="P7">To identify inhibitors of FOXM1 DNA binding, we developed a high throughput screen based on the perturbation of FOXM1 DBD&#x02014;DNA complex measured by FP<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Minor adjustments were made to the assay as presented above (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) to provide suitability for a high-throughput screening (HTS) protocol in 1536-well plate format. The assay buffer was supplemented with 0.01% Tween-20 and 0.1 mg mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> bovine serum albumin to facilitate robotic dispensing, stabilize the FOXM1 DBD protein and minimize hydrophobic aggregation of material on plastic. An apparent K<sub>D</sub> value of 158 nM was calculated for binding of FOXM1 DBD to the 16-bp DNA in 384-well plate format, showing good agreement with previous values from the initial FP runs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>). The concentration of 400 nM FOXM1 DBD was chosen for subsequent experiments, which resulted in average window of 135 mP units between bound and unbound signals in 1536-well plate format (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3B</xref>). Pipetting was simplified into two robotic dispense steps: 3 &#x003bc;L 1.3X FOXM1 DBD + 1 &#x003bc;L 4X DNA probe. In calibration runs with the high throughput format, the signal-to-background ratio was approximately 3.2 and the Z&#x02032; factor was 0.77. The Z&#x02032; factor quantifies the statistical significance of the difference between positive and negative controls. A value above 0.5 indicates that more than 12 standard deviations separate the bound and unbound controls; therefore, 0.77 is well within the norm for a robust assay.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Identification of small molecule inhibitors of FOXM1&#x02014;DNA</title><p id="P8">A collection of small molecules was screened at five concentrations ranging from 0.46 &#x003bc;M to a maximum of 115 &#x003bc;M.

FOXM1 DBD was first dispensed into wells and compounds (23 nL at each concentration) were transferred with a Kalypsys 1536-pin tool.

In contrast, genes that lack FOXM1 occupancy in the promoter should not be differentially expressed as a result of such a ligand, but may respond to downstream effects caused by changes in FOXM1-responsive genes. The identification of several established FOXM1 targets here supports <bold>FDI-6</bold> as a FOXM1 inhibitor. To further characterize the entire population of differentially expressed genes, we examined their correlation with FOXM1 promoter occupancy. Using the publicly available ENCODE FOXM1 ChIP-seq dataset in MCF-7 cells, we determined the abundance of verified FOXM1 protein binding sites within the up- and down-regulated sets of differentially expressed genes (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, top panel). This analysis revealed a highly significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>) 19-fold enrichment of FOXM1 binding sites exclusively in the down-regulated set. In contrast, the up-regulated differentially expressed genes were not significantly enriched (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.005) for promoter FOXM1 binding sites over the background of genes not differentially expressed.

We reanalyzed the RNAseq signature of <bold>FDI-6</bold> for enrichments in ChIP-seq binding peaks of all related forkhead factors for which available ENCODE datasets exist: FOXA1, FOXA2 and FOXP2 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, middle three panels). Remarkably, despite the greater than 60% conservation among residues comprising the DBDs of FOX family transcription factors and the similarity of their consensus sequence motifs<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>, genes differentially expressed after <bold>FDI-6</bold> treatment did not show enrichment over background for promoter occupancy of any other FOX transcription factors. This finding supports the specificity of the ligand for FOXM1 DBD over similar forkhead DBDs. Likewise, we show that there is no enrichment for sites of GATA1 occupancy (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, bottom panel). This latter comparison shows that the effect of the molecule is not associated with a general suppression of transcriptional activity, but is specific for the FOXM1 transcriptional program.</p><p id="P19">To further characterize the effects of <bold>FDI-6</bold> on the FOXM1 transcriptional program, we sorted sets of differentially expressed genes into groups based on their response profiles during the three treatment times. Our reasoning being that genes directly affected by FOXM1 occupancy would respond relatively quickly and consistently to displacement of FOXM1. This methodology, called time point cluster analysis, identified a set of 208 genes that are immediately down-regulated after <bold>FDI-6</bold> treatment (Cluster 5, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, cluster assignment of each gene is provided in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary file</xref>). Inhibition of FOXM1-DNA should immediately down-regulate FOXM1-activated genes; thus, we expect that Cluster 5 should correlate best with promoter FOXM1 occupancy. Indeed, Cluster 5 is enriched 17-fold (<italic>P</italic>=5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;82</sup>) over the background for genes with promoter FOXM1 binding sites (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Importantly, no other clusters exhibited significant enrichment (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.005) of genes with FOXM1 binding sites. Furthermore, each of the FOXM1 target genes discussed above is present within this cluster. This finding supports the notion that <bold>FDI-6</bold> induces a specific response of FOXM1 inhibition and that additional transcriptional responses represent downstream secondary effects of down-regulated primary FOXM1 targets or of non-specific ligand stress.</p><p id="P20">We remarked above that a number of the representative genes down-regulated by <bold>FDI-6</bold> were similarly decreased following siRNA knockdown of FOXM1<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. We can explore this association across the entire transcriptome, as a highly specific compound should induce a similar differentially expressed gene signature to siRNA knockdown. Using an existing microarray profile of FOXM1 knockdown in BT-20 breast cancer cells (GEO accession: GSE2222) for comparison, we observe a significant (<italic>P</italic>=6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) overlap with the <bold>FDI-6</bold> gene signature (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). This reveals a tendency for genes down-regulated by siRNA FOXM1 to be similarly down-regulated by the compound. In contrast, there is no significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) correlation between the genes up-regulated by the two treatments. Furthermore, the trend is even more pronounced within the subset of genes in Cluster 5, which are 3.7-fold (<italic>P</italic>=2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) enriched for genes down-regulated by siRNA FOXM1. Lastly, it is a notable distinction that the small molecule acts directly on the DNA binding activity of FOXM1 and the phenotype arises after only 3 h treatment, in contrast to the 48 h incubation time needed to degrade FOXM1 protein by RNA interference. Taken together, these series of analyses show that <bold>FDI-6</bold> specifically inhibits FOXM1 association with consensus sequence DNA targets and prevents downstream transcriptional activation of these targets in cells, without inhibiting the related forkhead factors or perturbing FOXM1 protein level.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S10"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P21">We have identified small molecule inhibitors that disrupt FOXM1-DNA interaction using an assay based on the fluorescence polarization response of a labeled consensus oligonucleotide bound to recombinant FOXM1 DBD protein. From a library of 54,211 structurally diverse ligands we identified six FDI compounds that were cross-validated in orthogonal binding assays. Notably, three of these compounds exhibit a common pharmacophore, suggesting a common structural mechanism. We further characterized the lead inhibitor NCGC00099374 (<bold>FDI-6</bold>) to show that it acts by targeting FOXM1 protein and broadly represses transcription of FOXM1-activated genes by displacing FOXM1 from chromatin. This activity is reflected throughout the transcriptome and is recapitulated by a gene ontology summary, which indicates that entire pathways known to be controlled by FOXM1 transactivation&#x02014;mitosis, nuclear division, and cell cycle processes&#x02014;are significantly inhibited by <bold>FDI-6</bold>. Taken together, our data support a direct mechanism of action whereby <bold>FDI-6</bold> blocks the binding of FOXM1 to target DNA, preventing the normal activation of FOXM1 target genes. We cannot absolutely rule out the possibility of a contribution from some unknown off-target affect(s) of FDI-6. However, it is a significant indication of the small molecule&#x02019;s specificity that despite the conserved DBD and a 71% overlap of ChIP-seq peaks for FOXM1 and FOXA1<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>, genes repressed by <bold>FDI-6</bold> are exclusively targets of FOXM1 and not of FOXA1 or related forkhead factors.</p><p id="P22">An inhibitor with the ability to globally disrupt association of FOXM1 with DNA consensus sites in cells provides a valuable tool to probe FOXM1 occupancy. Previously, the ability to interrogate or intervene with the direct consequences of transcription factor binding has been limited. We previously reported that thiostrepton, a natural product antibiotic, binds directly to FOXM1 in cells and down-regulates target gene expression.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> However, the use of thiostrepton is confounded by its inhibition of the 20S proteasome. Thiostrepton also induces significant toxicity (GI<sub>50</sub> = 2.7 &#x003bc;M) well below the concentration needed to affect FOXM1 inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> = 45.0&#x000b1;16.4 &#x003bc;M). These peripheral activities of thiostrepton introduce some uncertainty about its dominant mechanism of action in cells and thus cannot be used to unambiguously probe FOXM1. In contrast, the novel inhibitor <bold>FDI-6</bold> is inactive against the proteasome and concordance between its biophysical IC<sub>50</sub> and cellular GI<sub>50</sub> values (22.5&#x000b1;12.3 &#x003bc;M and 18.0&#x000b1;3.0 &#x003bc;M, respectively) suggests it does not suffer from the off target effects of thiostrepton. The characteristics of smaller molecular size, greater aqueous solubility, and a scaffold amenable to future optimization are further advantages to the novel molecule.</p><p id="P23">We have also provided evidence for <bold>FDI-6</bold> mediated down-regulation of established FOXM1-controlled genes.
