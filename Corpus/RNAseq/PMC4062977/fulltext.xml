To establish a map of pluripotent epiblast (EPI) versus primitive endoderm (PrE) lineage segregation within the inner cell mass (ICM) of the mouse blastocyst, we characterised the gene expression profiles of individual ICM cells. Clustering analysis of the transcriptomes of 66 cells demonstrated that initially they are non-distinguishable. Early in the segregation, lineage-specific marker expression exhibited no apparent correlation, and a hierarchical relationship was established only in the late blastocyst. Fgf4 exhibited a bimodal expression at the earliest stage analysed, and in its absence, the differentiation of PrE and EPI was halted, indicating that Fgf4 drives, and is required for, ICM lineage segregation. These data lead us to propose a model where stochastic cell-to-cell expression heterogeneity followed by signal reinforcement underlies ICM lineage segregation by antagonistically separating equivalent cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>blastocyst</kwd><kwd>single-cell gene expression profile</kwd><kwd>inner cell mass</kwd><kwd>epiblast</kwd><kwd>primitive endoderm</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Mammalian preimplantation development gives rise to three lineages in the blastocyst<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>; the embryonic epiblast (EPI) and two extraembryonic tissues, the primitive endoderm (PrE) and trophectoderm (TE). Lineage segregation between EPI and PrE occurs within the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst and involves two successive phases. First, at the morula stage (E2.5; 8-16 cells), the EPI-specific transcription factor Nanog and PrE-specific Gata6<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> become evident and are expressed by all ICM cells. This overlapping expression persists until E3.5 (64 cells) when two distinct cell populations emerge as PrE precursors activate a sequence of transcription factors (Gata6, Sox17, Gata4 and Sox7)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, and EPI precursors co-express pluripotency-associated factors (e.g. Nanog and Sox2). As EPI and PrE markers establish mutually exclusive expression, they become arranged in a salt-and-pepper distribution<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Even though biased to a specific lineage, ICM cells exhibit a plasticity preceding their sorting to respective positions when the PrE begins to epithelialize at E4.5 (&#x0003e;150 cells)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">In the mouse this segregation of EPI and PrE lineages is regulated by FGF/MAPK signaling<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Modulation of FGF/MAPK signaling shifts the balance of EPI and PrE cells: excess of Fgf4 converts all ICM cells to adopt a PrE identity<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, whereas when FGF signaling is blocked<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, all ICM cells become Nanog-positive. How the heterogeneity in FGF signaling is established remains an open question. Two, apparently disparate, models have been proposed; a random or cleavage-history-dependent mechanism. Two-to-three &#x02018;waves&#x02019; of asymmetric cell divisions (8-to-16-cell, 16-to-32-cell and 32-to-64-cell) generate the ICM cells. Consequently, it has been proposed<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> that cells internalized during the first wave exhibit a greater bias towards EPI, whereas cells internalized later are biased to PrE<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. This notion was challenged by another study that showed an apparently random generation of EPI and PrE precursors, irrespectively of internalization timing<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Importantly, an absolute correlation between lineage and cleavage pattern has not been evident from any study.</p><p id="P4">Since the emergence of lineage precursors within the ICM is preceded by stochastic gene expression variability<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, we reasoned that single-cell gene expression profiling would be requisite for understanding the mechanisms driving lineage segregation. Recent technical advances enable quantitative gene expression profiling at the single-cell level using qPCR<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, microarrays<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, or RNAseq<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. It is now widely recognized that cell-to-cell expression variation and multi-lineage gene activation exist early on during lineage commitment<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Recent single-cell expression studies demonstrated that the expression of key factors is independently regulated in the transition from self-renewal to lineage-committed states in hematopoiesis<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, and that early stochastic gene expression is followed by the establishment of a hierarchy during cellular reprogramming<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Although the changes in expression during blastocyst lineage specification began to be characterized at the single-cell level using defined cohorts of genes<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, a comprehensive and unbiased view is still missing.

Having formulated a method for collecting live single cells from ICMs recovered by immunosurgery<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), we established a robust protocol for the amplification of mRNAs from them. Embryos were staged according to the average total number of cells in littermates. Reflecting the quality of the sample preparations, the mRNA isolation protocol produced a representative amplification output for the detection of a control &#x02018;spike&#x02019; RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), a uniform level of expression for housekeeping genes (for example, <italic>Gapdh</italic>) and bimodal distribution of EPI and PrE lineage-specific gene expression at E4.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). For the ensuing microarray analyses, we selected 66 single-cell samples that provided a linear output for the detection of &#x02018;spike-in&#x02019; RNAs with as little as 20 copies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>; Methods), implying that mRNAs expressed with more than 20 copies could be analysed quantitatively.</p><p id="P6">The data obtained from qPCR analysis of a total of 137 single cells ranging from E3.25 to E4.5 revealed distinct behaviors in gene expression dynamics as the two ICM lineages arise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). At least two distinct mechanisms can give rise to bimodal lineage-specific gene expression. In the first, bimodal gene expression is achieved from an initial state whereby all ICM cells express certain genes, followed by resolution into mutually-exclusive lineage-specific patterns, presumably through lineage-specific gene repression. This was the case for <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Gata6</italic>, in agreement with the findings of Guo et al. (2010)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Alternatively, we noted cases where initially negligible level of gene expression evolves into lineage-specific gene activation and mutually-exclusive expression. This was the case for <italic>Gata4</italic>. Notably, the expression of <italic>Fgf4</italic> gene was detected only in some cells at E3.25, therefore presaging the segregation of EPI or PrE progenitors at E3.5.</p><p id="P7">Among the 154 single-cell samples (see Methods for details), cRNAs derived from the highest quality 66 individual ICM cells (as assessed by expression of spike RNA) were hybridized to the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays. Overall, 10,958 distinct mRNAs were detected above background in these samples. The single-cell data established a transcriptome map of lineage segregation between EPI and PrE in the mouse blastocyst. To visualise the main features of this map, we used principal component (PC) projections of individual cells based on the expression of the 100 most variable genes in all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). In this map, PC1 approximately corresponded to the stage of development (time), whereas PC2 aligned with the lineage difference (EPI or PrE). These data reveal that the EPI and PrE lineages become progressively segregated within a cohort of initially equivalent ICM cells during E3.25-E4.5 blastocyst stages.</p><p id="P8">Unsupervised clustering of the data obtained from single ICM cells at E3.5 and E4.5 (22 and 8 cells, respectively) using the expression of the 100 most variable genes identified two stable clusters, which we conclude corresponded to EPI and PrE lineages based on the expression of markers for each lineage. Thus, these data collectively provide the most comprehensive unbiased list of markers for EPI or PrE lineage at E3.5 and E4.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). An unsupervised clustering stability analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) demonstrated that ICM cells in E3.5 embryos showed strong evidence for falling into two clusters, while those at E3.25 did not reproducibly segregate into clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). These data therefore reveal that at E3.25 ICM cells are not readily distinguishable in terms of their gene expression profile. Consequently, the transcriptome data do not favour what would be predicted from a model of predetermination<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, in which distinct &#x02018;waves&#x02019; of cell divisions generate distinctly identifiable types of inner cells; however, the data also do not exclude the possibility that more subtle differences &#x02013; e.g. in single messages, or in other molecules - between ICM cells could underlie their eventual cell fate specification (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Progressive establishment of correlation</title><p id="P9">To begin to unravel the general principles of lineage emergence and segregation within the early mouse embryo, we validated several lineage markers newly identified in the microarray analysis of 66 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) using qPCR for a total of 137 single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Genes analysed included: <italic>Cldn4</italic> and <italic>Enox1</italic> for EPI, and Aldh18a1, Amn, Col4a1, Col4a2, Cubn, Foxq1, Lamb1, P4ha2, Serpinh1 and <italic>Tom1l1</italic> for PrE. Among them, the PrE-specific expression of <italic>Amn</italic>, <italic>Cubn</italic>, <italic>Col4</italic> is in agreement with immunofluorescence staining in Gerbe et al. (2008)<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, and that of <italic>Lamb1</italic> with Artus et al. (2011)<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Immunostaining of Serpinh1 and P4ha2 also confirmed their specific expression in PrE at E4.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Differentially expressed lineage-specific markers exhibited stochastic expression that appeared uncorrelated between genes, early in the lineage segregation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We identified several lineage markers that allow characterisation of the stage of PrE differentiation, because these genes were progressively activated during lineage specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). These marker genes were defined in two steps (see Methods for details); after screening the microarray data for lineage-specific genes that were progressively upregulated from E3.25 to E3.5, and to E4.5, the identified candidate genes were verified by qPCR of additional single-cell cDNA samples. This allowed identification of 7 PrE differentiation stage markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) whose gene expression is progressively upregulated during the PrE lineage differentiation. It should be noted that the comparable EPI markers were more difficult to identify, because E3.25 ICM cells more closely resemble the E3.5 EPI than the PrE cohort, and upregulation of the expression of EPI markers is generally limited during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Using these 7 PrE differentiation stage markers, we examined potentially hierarchical relationships of the activation in the lineage markers by asking whether the genes could be ordered so that within each individual cell, expression of a gene is only seen if the preceding gene is activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>; see Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S4</xref> for detailed methods). Remarkably, an approximate hierarchy in gene activation was observed at the E3.5 to E4.5 transition, while evidence for hierarchy was much weaker at E3.25 to E3.5 (<italic>p</italic> = 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-16</sup>, <italic>t</italic>-test), suggesting that the activation of lineage-specific marker gene expression establishes a hierarchical relationship only at the late blastocyst stage.</p><p id="P12">We also wished to evaluate variability in the expression of the lineage markers at the protein level. To do so, we performed a quantitative analysis of protein expression of a newly identified PrE marker, Serpinh1 (also known as heat shock protein 47, Hsp47)<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, in relation to the lineage markers, Gata6 and Nanog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Serpinh1 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm of PrE cells in E4.5 blastocysts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S2a</xref>), in agreement with its reported function as a chaperone for collagen synthesis. To evaluate any potential variability in protein expression during EPI versus PrE segregation, E3.5 blastocysts (having a total of 70-90 cells) were immunostained simultaneously for Serpinh1, Gata6 and Nanog, as well as DNA and cell membrane for z-axis normalisation and cell/nucleus segmentation. This allowed us to perform quantitative measurements of the levels of protein expression for 56 individual ICM cells derived from 4 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Video S1</xref>; see Methods for details). While positive or negative correlation of protein expression levels is evident between Nanog and Gata6, Nanog and Serpinh1, and Gata6 and Serpinh1, high variability in their expression levels at E3.5 does not allow separation of the two cell populations, in contrast to E4.5 ICM cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). This is consistent with our findings made at the RNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), and favours a model in which EPI and PrE lineages stochastically emerge within a cohort of initially equivalent ICM cells, rather than being predetermined by two distinct division histories<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cell position influences gene expression</title><p id="P13">Positional information has been proposed to play a prominent role in the patterning of early embryos<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. However, there are currently limited data<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> to suggest that a cell's position within the ICM influences its overall gene expression. To address this question and determine whether gene expression differences within the ICM reflect the position of individual cells, we established a method to identify, selectively isolate and expression profile cells located on the surface of the ICM adjacent to the blastocyst cavity versus those located deeper within the ICM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Expression profiling and comparison of these two populations revealed that cells facing the blastocyst cavity more closely resembled the PrE lineage from E3.5 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>). These data therefore suggest that positional information may play an instructive role influencing the differential gene expression observed within the ICM at E3.5.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Fgf4 is required for EPI versus PrE segregation</title><p id="P14">Next, we wished to identify the symmetry breaking signals driving lineage segregation within ICM cells. To do this we sought to characterize the genes that segregate into two distinct ICM populations at the earliest stage, corresponding to E3.5 in our analysis. <italic>Fgf4</italic> was identified as one of such genes exhibiting the greatest differential expression between EPI and PrE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). To comprehensively characterise the involvement of Fgf signalling in the EPI versus PrE lineage segregation, the expression of all Fgf ligands, receptors and downstream cytoplasmic signalling components in the developing blastocyst were analysed using the 66 single-cell ICM transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). Several Fgf ligands (<italic>Fgf3, 4</italic> and <italic>13</italic>) and all Fgf receptors (<italic>Fgfr1 &#x02013; 4</italic>) were found to be differentially expressed within the ICM, thus possibly contributing to the EPI versus PrE lineage segregation. By contrast, cytoplasmic signalling components exhibited no differential expression, suggesting that any differential regulation would predominantly be at the post-transcriptional level. The overlapping expression of ligands and receptors suggests the presence of redundant functions within Fgf signalling pathway components. A statistically significant correlation (positive or negative) in gene expression levels is discernible at the single cell level for <italic>Fgf4</italic> against <italic>Fgfr2</italic> (in agreement with Guo et al.

Among those genes expressed in the blastocyst, <italic>Fgf4</italic> and <italic>Fgfr2</italic> exhibit differential expression the earliest (E3.25), followed by <italic>Fgfr1</italic>. The higher variability, and bimodality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>), in the expression of <italic>Fgf4</italic> than of <italic>Fgfr2</italic> at E3.25 suggests that <italic>Fgf4</italic> may be the driver for the observed differential gene expression and EPI versus PrE lineage segregation.</p><p id="P15">We recently demonstrated that Fgf4 is required for the establishment of a salt-and-pepper distribution of EPI/PrE lineage precursors at E3.5, as well as the specification of PrE within the ICM<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. To comprehensively characterize the impact of loss of Fgf4 on EPI versus PrE lineage segregation we performed single-cell gene expression analyses on the ICMs of <italic>Fgf4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mutant embryos. The expression profiles of individual ICM cells derived from <italic>Fgf4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> blastocysts at E3.25-E4.5 were overlaid on the lineage map established using the wild-type single-cell expression profiles (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The samples&#x02019; coordinates allowed us to characterize the differentiation status of <italic>Fgf4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> ICM cells.

It should be noted that although E4.5 <italic>Fgf4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> ICM cells are positioned relatively close to EPI cells in the 2-dimensional PCA projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>), their expression profiles are significantly distinct from E3.5 and E4.5 WT EPI cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>), indicating that <italic>Fgf4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> ICM cells are not simply differentiating into the EPI lineage. Similarly, although E3.5 <italic>Fgf4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells appear to overlap with E3.25 WT cells, a more detailed analysis of their expression profiles indicates that they represent a distinct population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Moreover, E3.25 <italic>Fgf4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> ICM cells appear to be distributed differently from WT cells, suggesting that there might be a distinct role for Fgf signalling at an early stage.

These data suggest the requirement of Fgf signalling in establishing the gene regulatory network for EPI versus PrE lineage segregation.

The statistical cell sub-population analysis used in this study provides evidence against a consistent, widespread gene expression pattern reflecting predetermination or lineage commitment at E3.25, although our analysis would not detect a difference that is restricted to a small number of genes or non-mRNA molecules. E3.25 ICM cells, however, do not exhibit a &#x0201c;uniform&#x0201d; gene expression status, perhaps reminiscent of the ground state of ES cells<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, but instead are a mixture of cells with stochastic gene expression variability.

Consequently, it would be conceivable to separate early blastocysts with cell-to-cell gene expression variability into two phases. In the first phase, expression of individual genes exhibits stochastic variability, possibly independent from one another. While in the second phase, a correlation of gene expressions gradually emerges, likely due to the activation of lineage-specific signalling cascades (e.g. Fgf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). The second phase may correspond to the blastocyst stage in which a &#x0201c;salt-and-pepper&#x0201d; pattern of expression<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> can be defined by the onset of <italic>Gata4</italic> expression, and restriction of Gata6 to Gata4-positive PrE lineage &#x0201c;precursors&#x0201d;, or cells with a propensity to contribute to the emergent PrE.

Taken together, we propose that an initial phase of stochastic gene expression followed by signal reinforcement may drive lineage segregation by antagonistically separating a cohort of initially equivalent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Thus the inherent molecular heterogeneity, and subsequent salt-and-pepper pattern of lineage precursors, within the ICM may form the foundation for segregating distinct EPI and PrE lineages within an initially equivalent population of cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S7" specific-use="web-only"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S8"><title>Embryo collection and staging</title><p id="P21">BL/6&#x000d7;C3H F1 mice, or heterozygous mice with ablation of <italic>Fgf4</italic> allele<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, were bred naturally and embryos were recovered at E3.25, E3.5 or E4.5 by flushing oviducts or uteri.

(<bold>a</bold>) In many non-mammalian species, localized determinants play a key role in embryonic patterning. (<bold>b</bold>) In the ICM of the mouse blastocyst, EPI and PrE lineages are progressively segregated within a cohort of initially equivalent cells. Cell-to-cell variability generated by stochastic onset of gene expression (genes A, B, C represent the lineage marker for blue cells, whereas D, E, F for green cells) is progressively enhanced by signalling activities and feedbacks as well as cell-cell interactions, and forms salt and pepper pattern, with emerging two populations. This process eventually leads to establishing two distinct cell lineages (blue or green cells) with specific gene regulatory networks in the context of positional information. In the absence of Fgf4, reinforcement by the signalling cascade may fail and lineage segregation is halted without differentiation into either of the two lineages.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms-530041-f0007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
