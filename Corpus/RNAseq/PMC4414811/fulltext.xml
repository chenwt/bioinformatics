Here, we use a nuclease-deficient (d)Cas9 histone demethylase fusion to functionally characterize previously described and novel enhancer elements for their roles in the embryonic stem cell state. Further, we distinguish the mechanism of action of dCas9-LSD1 at enhancers from previous dCas9-effectors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Enhancers control development and cellular function, and intensive efforts are ongoing to elucidate cell fate-specific enhancer activity<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Indeed, a large number of genomic regions identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of human disease fall within enhancer regions<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Thus, there is a pressing need for technologies to functionally annotate cell type-specific enhancer elements that control cellular function.</p><p id="P3">Engineered derivatives of CRISPR systems have enabled RNA-guided gene regulation through targeting of nuclease-deficient (d)Cas9-coupled transcriptional regulators to promoter regions<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and applicability of this approach in high-throughput contexts has been demonstrated<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Although a dCas9-KRAB repressor has previously been used to interfere with enhancer function, the study suggested steric rather than effector-mediated interference<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. While targeted steric hindrance or nuclease-based disruption of an enhancer is possible, such approaches require in-depth knowledge of the enhancer, may be inefficient and could have potential side effects such as perturbation of chromatin folding or DNA damage stress responses.</p><p id="P4">The histone demethylase LSD1 has been previously implicated in repression of enhancers<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and TALE-LSD1 can target histone modifications that correlate with active enhancers<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Although changes in gene expression were detected<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, the TALE-LSD1 approach only allows for low-throughput approaches and it remains unclear whether the expression changes were a result of decommissioning an enhancer, or due to an indirect effect on gene expression.</p><p id="P5">We generated mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) expressing versions of <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> (Nm) dCas9 fused with LSD1, a non-effector BirA affinity tag (BAT), or a KRAB repressor (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 1-2</xref></bold>) and used a viral delivery system for sgRNAs. We first targeted the well-characterized cis-regulatory region of <italic>Oct4</italic><sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref></bold>), a factor critical for the ESC state<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. <italic>Oct4</italic> expression is regulated by a proximal enhancer (OPE) active in epiblast cells, and a distal enhancer (ODE) active in mESCs and cells of the inner cell mass<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Targeting of LSD1 to the ODE resulted in loss of <italic>Oct4</italic> expression and appearance of OCT4-negative colonies accompanied by phenotypic changes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref></bold>) compared to control dCas9-BAT cells targeted to the same enhancer. No effects were observed when the OPE, the <italic>Oct4</italic> proximal promoter (OPP) or a control locus was targeted in dCas9-LSD1 or dCas9-BAT cells. In contrast, targeting dCas9-KRAB to the OPP led to downregulation of <italic>Oct4</italic>, demonstrating that dCas9-KRAB is not enhancer specific (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref></bold>). dCas9-effector-dependent and sgRNA position-specific changes in ESC morphology correlate with loss of OCT4 and SOX2 pluripotency factor expression (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref></bold>) and genome-wide transcriptomic changes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 1</xref></bold>), indicating a more profound change in the cellular state after interfering with ODE activity. Importantly, cluster analysis revealed high similarity between gene expression profiles from dCas9-KRAB OPP-sgRNA, dCas9-KRAB ODE-sgRNA and dCas9-LSD1 ODE-sgRNA cells compared to other dCas9-effector/sgRNA combinations. We conclude that the dCas9-LSD1 system can be used to delineate enhancers specifically, unlike the dCas9-KRAB system that more broadly affects the cellular state when targeted to promoters and enhancers.</p><p id="P6">We next targeted eight candidate enhancers in dCas9-LSD1 ESCs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 4-6 and Supplementary Table 2</xref></bold>) and four showed both morphological changes and loss of ESC-associated alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref></bold>). These four enhancers are thus critical for the appropriate expression of genes required for the ESC state. Absence of differentiation phenotypes upon enhancer targeting could occur if the enhancer is dispensable for maintenance of the pluripotent state. Alternatively, some sgRNAs might be non-functional or chromatin state could counteract dCas9-LSD1 function. Importantly, no control-sgRNAs (<italic>FoxN1, N-Myc</italic> or <italic>Oct6</italic>) led to changes in morphology or AP activity, indicating sgRNA-specific changes in cellular state.</p><p id="P7">For follow-up, we focused on the putative enhancer with the highest differential score, Enh1. Test of Enh1 in a reporter assay confirmed its ability to enhance expression at comparable levels to an <italic>Oct4</italic> DE sequence (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>). This previously unannotated ESC-specific enhancer is positioned ~10kb upstream of the transcription factor <italic>Tbx3</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>), a gene previously implicated in the maintenance of pluripotency<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. We therefore hypothesized that Enh1 may function in the ESC network by regulating <italic>Tbx3</italic> expression. Indeed, we detected a relative reduction of <italic>Tbx3</italic> mRNA and protein expression upon targeting Enh1 with dCas9-LSD1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref></bold>). This loss of <italic>Tbx3</italic> could be similarly obtained when dCas9-KRAB was used to target Enh1 or the <italic>Tbx3</italic> proximal promoter (TPP) but was not observed in control cells. Change in colony morphology and increase of differentiation-associated markers were detected in a dCas9-effector and sgRNA dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 3</xref>) concordant with the destabilization of the ESC state. Of note, none of the transcriptomic changes among any of the control conditions exceed 2-fold. While this finding does not rule out minor off-target effects, these data support a compelling level of specificity of our system.</p><p id="P8">Next we sought to dissect the mechanism by which targeting of Enh1, hereafter referred to as <italic>Tbx3</italic> distal enhancer (TDE), results in <italic>Tbx3</italic> downregulation by examining a time point prior to changes in cell morphology but when differential <italic>Tbx3</italic> expression levels were detected (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref></bold>). Conducting chromosome conformation capture (3C) we observed a localized peak in interaction frequency between the TDE and the <italic>Tbx3</italic> promoter in dCas9-BAT ESCs with a control-sgRNA supporting the presence of an enhancer-promoter loop (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref></bold>). Comparable interaction frequencies were observed for dCas9-LSD1 and dCas9-BAT with TDE-sgRNA, indicating that the looping interaction between the <italic>Tbx3</italic> promoter and enhancer is not disrupted by dCas9-effector targeting <italic>per se</italic>.</p><p id="P9">Investigating local histone modifications in the presence of either dCas9-KRAB or dCas9-LSD1, we observed relative loss of LSD1 substrate H3K4Me2 around the enhancer-sgRNA target site in dCas9-LSD1 cells (6 to 8 fold) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref></bold>). H3K27Ac, indicative of active enhancers<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, was dramatically lost at the enhancer (33 to 54-fold) upon LSD1 targeting compared to other tested conditions consistent with prior studies of enhancer inactivation by LSD1<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref></bold>). Changes in H3 occupancy were not detected (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref></bold>). Interestingly, although repressive marks have been previously associated with KRAB-mediated repression<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, we could not detect concomitant increases in repressive marks, H3K27Me3 or H3K9Me3, at the enhancer after targeting of any of our constructs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>). To further understand the differences between the LSD1 and KRAB effects we surveyed chromatin state at the <italic>Tbx3</italic> promoter. At the promoter we detected a loss of H3K27Ac, and an increase of H3K27Me3 (~57-fold) and H3K9Me3 (~13-fold) when the TDE was targeted with the KRAB effector but not with LSD1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref></bold>). Taken together these data offer strong evidence that LSD1-induced enhancer deactivation results in <italic>Tbx3</italic> downregulation while KRAB mediated <italic>Tbx3</italic> downregulation is due to promoter silencing. We therefore caution that the dCas9-KRAB effector, besides having potential side effects such as heterochromatin spreading<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, is silencing promoter activity rather than decommissioning the target enhancer.</p><p id="P10">Next, we showed that the LSD1-specific inhibitor trans-2-phenylcyclopropyl-amine hydrochloride (TCP), previously shown to overcome strong differentiation cues in mESCs such as loss of <italic>Oct4</italic> expression<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, inhibited the loss of <italic>Tbx3</italic> mRNA and protein expression in dCas9-LSD1 cells but not in dCas9-KRAB cells after TDE targeting (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref></bold>). We conclude that the loss of <italic>Tbx3</italic> expression is directly dependent on the enzymatic activity of LSD1 and that KRAB can repress <italic>Tbx3</italic> independently.</p><p id="P11">We conclude that the dCas9-LSD1 fusion protein allows for an effector dependent definition of functional, native enhancer elements that help to maintain a given cellular state. Accordingly, dCas9-LSD1 provides a rapid and powerful approach to understanding distal cis-regulatory regions such as enhancers without major disruption of the local genomic architecture. While we used the Nm dCas9, we expect that similar systems could be built on orthogonal CRISPR/Cas9 systems including the widely used <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> dCas9. Further, the use of chromatin modifiers with differential functionality and orthogonal dCas9 systems promises to enable even more complex epigenome engineering. This level of genome control has previously not been achieved with other RNA-guided regulatory technologies such as RNAi. Combined with rapid advances in cell type-specific annotation of regulatory elements and GWAS, this technology will be instrumental in dissecting the contribution of distal cis-regulatory elements to development and disease.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1" specific-use="web-only"><title>ONLINE METHODS</title><sec id="S2"><title>Effector and sgRNA plasmids</title><p id="P12">A human codon optimized, nuclease inactive version of Nm Cas9 was gene synthesized with two SV40 nuclear localization signals and a triple FLAG tag (Genscript Technologies) and cloned in frame with either a BirA affinity tag, a KRAB-repressor, or LSD1 (for amino acid sequences see Figure S1).

We then rescored the candidate peaks by way of a 300-nucleotide moving window, advancing 10 nucleotides for sequential windows as described<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. An enrichment score, depth for H3K27Ac as compared to the null, was associated to each window and the maximum enrichment score across the windows was associated to the peaks. Any peaks with scores below a 2-fold enrichment relative to the null were filtered out. Low quality peaks, with scores below the 60% quantile, were also filtered out. Each remaining peak was then trimmed based on the read depth associated to 50-nucleotide moving windows. Ends were trimmed until a window score exceeding 20% of scale for the peak at hand was located. Each high quality peak for one stage, EpiLC or ESC, was then compared to the other by scoring the trimmed region for the alternate stage. After adding a pseudocount of 10 to the score for each stage, those peaks exhibiting at least two-fold enrichment were considered to be stage-specific.</p><p id="P24">For each cell type, any stage-specific peak with the nearest gene transcription start site more than 5000 bases away was identified as a potential distal enhancer. Peaks for which the nearest transcription start site was associated to a transcription factor were selected. To determine the strongest enhancer candidates for the ESC state, the list was further filtered to include only those peaks whose closest transcription factor exhibited at least a 4-fold enrichment in TPM for the ESC state relative to the EpiLC state, after adding a pseudocount of 5 TPM for each stage. The resulting list contained 24 candidates (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref></bold>).

PCR analysis was performed in triplicate with each primer paired with the anchor for each 3C template.

Primer efficiencies were normalized by dividing the average value of each 3C template by the average value of the BAC 3C control template. 3C template generation efficiencies were normalized by calculating interaction frequencies through a control genomic region using gene desert primer pairs. 3C templates were normalized to each other by calculating the log ratio of the average interaction frequencies for each 3C template through the gene desert region. Final normalized interaction frequencies were calculated by multiplying the average BAC normalized interaction frequencies with the determined normalization factor for each 3C template. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS666544-supplement-1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e717" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank T.
