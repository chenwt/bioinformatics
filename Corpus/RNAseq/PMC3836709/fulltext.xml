Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by mutations that decrease the epigenetic repression of <italic>DUX4</italic> in somatic tissues and result in mis-expression of this transcription factor in skeletal muscle. DUX4 binds sites in the human genome that contain a double-homeobox sequence motif, including sites in unique regions of the genome as well as many sites in repetitive elements. Using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq on myoblasts transduced with <italic>DUX4</italic> we show that DUX4 binds and activates transcription of mammalian apparent LTR-retrotransposons (MaLRs), endogenous retrovirus (ERVL and ERVK) elements, and pericentromeric satellite HSATII sequences. Some DUX4-activated MaLR and ERV elements create novel promoters for genes, long non-coding RNAs, and antisense transcripts. Many of these novel transcripts are expressed in FSHD muscle cells but not control cells, and thus might contribute to FSHD pathology. For example, <italic>HEY1</italic>, a repressor of myogenesis, is activated by DUX4 through a MaLR promoter. DUX4-bound motifs, including those in repetitive elements, show evolutionary conservation and some repeat-initiated transcripts are expressed in healthy testis, the normal expression site of <italic>DUX4</italic>, but more rarely in other somatic tissues. Testis expression patterns are known to have evolved rapidly in mammals, but the mechanisms behind this rapid change have not yet been identified: our results suggest that mobilization of MaLR and ERV elements during mammalian evolution altered germline gene expression patterns through transcriptional activation by DUX4. Our findings demonstrate a role for DUX4 and repetitive elements in mammalian germline evolution and in FSHD muscular dystrophy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Transposable elements (TEs) are found in most genomes, and many TEs create extra copies of themselves in new genomic locations by a process called retrotransposition. TEs are often thought of as genomic parasites that must be suppressed, because retrotransposition can cause great harm to their host organism. However, during evolution, the functions encoded by TEs have sometimes been co-opted to the advantage of the host genome as novel genes or as gene regulatory regions. We studied a human transcription factor called <italic>DUX4</italic> that is normally expressed in testis and repressed in muscle. Sometimes muscle repression fails, causing the disease facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). We find that DUX4 binds many TE types and can activate their transcription. Some activated TEs have been co-opted as novel promoters for human genes. DUX4's activation of these genes via TEs might be important in the biology of normal testis and may contribute to the FSHD disease process. Our findings raise the possibility that DUX4 and TEs co-evolved, as TEs may have hijacked DUX4 to aid their retrotransposition while DUX4 may have utilized TEs to modify its transcriptional network in the evolving germline.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by NIAMS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niams.nih.gov">www.niams.nih.gov</ext-link>) R01AR045203, NINDS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov">www.ninds.nih.gov</ext-link>) P01NS069539, NIGMS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nigms.nih.gov">www.nigms.nih.gov</ext-link>) R01GM57070 and Friends of FSH Research (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fshfriends.org">www.fshfriends.org</ext-link>).

Our prior work showed, using microarrays and ChIP-seq, that mis-expression of <italic>DUX4</italic> in human skeletal muscle activates the expression of many genes normally expressed in the germline and that DUX4 binds a double-homeobox motif at &#x0223c;60,000 sites in the mappable genome <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Geng1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Although many DUX4 binding sites overlap non-repetitive regulatory elements of its activated genes, more than half of the ChIP-seq peaks overlap repeat elements of the MaLR class <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Geng1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>MaLRs, or mammalian apparent LTR-retrotransposons, are distantly related to endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), and comprise &#x0223c;3.7% of the human genome with &#x0223c;350,000 copies of various subclasses of MaLR elements <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Smit1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003947-Bannert1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Like ERVs, MaLRs are selfish elements that spread in the genome by a copy-paste mechanism called retrotransposition (transcription, reverse transcription and reintegration). ERVs and MaLRs have a pair of long-terminal repeats (LTRs) that act as strong promoters and that flank one or more open reading frames (ORFs). Post-insertion deletions mediated by homology between the two LTRs of an ERV or MaLR element often leave single (or &#x0201c;solo&#x0201d;) LTR elements in the genome. The internal ORFs of conventional ERVs encode the gag, pro, pol, and sometimes env proteins needed for replication and re-integration, whereas the single MaLR ORF encodes a protein with an &#x0223c;90-aa stretch of homology to the ERVL gag protein, suggesting that MaLRs derived from ERVL-like retrotransposons <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Jurka1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The homology to the ERVL gag protein and the absence of the other proteins necessary for ERV replication suggest that MaLRs might rely on concomitantly expressed ERVs to provide these other proteins. Most human ERV and MaLR elements inserted into the primate genome before the divergence of Old and New World monkeys and are generally thought to be no longer capable of retrotransposition (unlike in rodents, where ERVs and MaLRs are still active). However, reports of very rare polymorphic ERV and MaLR insertions in humans suggest that occasional transposition events still occur in the human population <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Retrotransposition provides a way to spread regulatory sequences to large numbers of new genomic locations in short evolutionary time. Some families of repetitive elements appear to have been involved in large-scale rewiring of transcriptional networks <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Feschotte2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Cowley1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and a number of cellular transcription factors have been shown to bind repetitive elements <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003947-Kunarso1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Repeats, especially LTRs, can be co-opted (or &#x0201c;exapted&#x0201d;) to act as promoters for genes of the host genome <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Faulkner1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. For example, when placentation evolved during early mammalian divergence, a large number of genes acquired expression in endometrial cells via upstream insertion of the eutherian-specific MER20 transposon <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In another example, binding of the OCT4 and NANOG transcription factors to various primate-specific repeats explains many of the differences observed between the transcriptional networks of human and mouse ES cells <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Kunarso1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. To date, no such repeat-mediated rewiring of the male germ cell transcriptional network has been reported, yet testis expression patterns are known have evolved rapidly in mammals <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Brawand1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>To determine whether DUX4 binding to repetitive elements can affect transcriptional networks, we analyzed ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets in skeletal muscle cells that ectopically express <italic>DUX4</italic>, as well as RNA-seq data from FSHD patient and control muscle cells. We find that repetitive elements are bound and activated by DUX4, including primate-specific MaLR and ERV LTRs, and that some full-length repeat elements are transcribed in response to DUX4. In addition, some DUX4-bound LTRs form novel first exons of annotated genes, long-noncoding (lnc) RNAs, and antisense RNAs. Together, our findings demonstrate that DUX4's transcriptional network is mediated in part through binding to repetitive elements, including some primate-specific retroelements that could contribute to lineage-specific patterns of gene expression <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Brawand1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>DUX4 binds LTR elements, especially of the MaLR family</title><p>In previously published work, we observed that many of the &#x0223c;60,000 DUX4 binding sites identified by ChIP-seq following expression of <italic>DUX4</italic> in human myoblasts overlap MaLR LTR elements <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Geng1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Using a more recent version of the human genome assembly (hg19) and including the X and Y chromosomes, we identified 63,795 DUX4 binding-sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003947.s014">Table S1</xref>). Overall, &#x0223c;2/3 of sites are in a repetitive element, more than expected given that &#x0223c;45% of the human genome is recognizable as repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003947-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Lander1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Furthermore, &#x0223c;1/3 of DUX4 binding sites are in a MaLR element, &#x0223c;10-fold more than would be expected if binding sites were dispersed randomly throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003947-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Because DUX4 binds an AT-rich sequence motif, its binding sites might show repeat enrichment based simply on GC content; however, when we randomly sampled genomic locations with similar AT-content to the DUX4 binding site (see Methods), we find that only &#x0223c;49% overlapped repeats of any class, and only &#x0223c;3% overlapped MaLR elements. In order to determine which subclasses of MaLRs are responsible for the enrichment, and to explore which other repetitive elements might also bind DUX4, we systematically analyzed ChIP-seq data using two complementary approaches.</p><fig id="pgen-1003947-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1003947.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Many repeat types are enriched among DUX4 binding sites.</title><p>(A) &#x0223c;2/3 of DUX4 binding-sites are in repetitive elements, compared to &#x0223c;45% of the human genome.

(C) A peak-based method of estimating repeat enrichment uses uniquely-mapped reads, so is blind to recently active repeats; however, it ignores background reads so provides a more sensitive enrichment measure than the read-based estimate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003947-g001">Figures 1D, 1E</xref>). 32 repeat types (red) are enriched &#x02265;2-fold with &#x02265;100 peaks (arbitrary thresholds) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003947-t001">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003947.s015">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003947.s016">S3</xref>); 21 (orange) are rarer in the genome (10&#x02013;99 peaks) but enriched &#x02265;4-fold.

(D) The read-based enrichment estimation method examines highly similar repeats as well as uniquely-mappable sequences, but gives a &#x0201c;dampened&#x0201d; enrichment measure due to background reads in ChIP-seq samples (see Methods). 25 repeat types (dark blue) are enriched &#x02265;2-fold, with &#x02265;1000 reads (arbitrary thresholds); 3 (light blue) are rarer among ChIP-seq reads (100&#x02013;999 reads) but enriched &#x02265;4-fold.

Additional repeats (gray datapoints, upper-right quadrant) appear enriched by both methods, but are rare in the genome so do not exceed our arbitrary peak/read thresholds.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1003947.g001"/></fig><p>An analysis of repetitive element content among DUX4 ChIP-seq peaks shows that enrichment is heavily biased towards LTR elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003947-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003947-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003947.s015">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003947.s016">S3</xref>), particularly those of the MaLR class: of 32 enriched repeat types (using arbitrary thresholds of &#x02265;2-fold enrichment and &#x02265;100 DUX4-bound instances), 30 are in the LTR class, and of those, 23/30 are MaLRs. Many subtypes of MaLR-LTRs contribute to the MaLR family-wide enrichment, including the LTRs of THE1 elements (A, B, C and D subfamilies) that were active early in the primate lineage <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Smit1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and MLT1 subtypes that were active before mammalian radiation. Outside of the MaLR family, other LTR subtypes also show enrichment, including primate-specific ERVL-LTRs (MLT2A1 and MLT2A2) and hominoid-specific ERVK-LTRs (MER11B and MER11C) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1003947-t001">Table 1</xref>). Some non-LTR repeats are also enriched among DUX4 binding sites, including the HSAT5 and HSATII satellite repeats and some simple repeats like the (CAAT)n tetranucleotide repeat, although with fewer mappable DUX4 binding sites (&#x0003c;100 DUX4-bound instances).

First, we asked whether full-length repetitive elements are activated. 100,864 regions of the human genome assembly are annotated as internal regions of ERV or MaLR elements, or fragments thereof, and many of these repetitive elements are old enough to have acquired sequence changes that allow unique mapping of short sequence reads.

These activated internal MaLR/ERV regions tend to be flanked on one or both sides by a DUX4-bound LTR, where transcription seems to initiate. Repeats whose internal regions are activated tend to be younger than repeats that do not show obvious activation, considering only repeats flanked by at least one DUX4-bound LTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003947.s003">Figure S2</xref>).

To examine the possibility that this ORF might be preserved as a domesticated protein, we collected its sequence from other primate genomes. We found that although the ORF is also maintained in chimpanzee and gorilla, it is interrupted by stop codons and/or frameshifts in orangutan, macaque, baboon, and marmoset. The lack of conservation among primates suggests that the ORF does not confer selective advantage. 17 other internal regions contain one or more ORFs exceeding 200 amino acids (arbitrary threshold) and encode fragments of various THE1 internal ORFs as well as fragments of some ERV gag and pol ORFs, although none encode full-length proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>DUX4-bound repetitive elements form alternative promoters for human genes</title><p>Repetitive elements, especially LTRs, can be co-opted as alternative promoters for mammalian genes <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Faulkner1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and can rewire transcriptional networks during evolution <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Feschotte2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Cowley1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Kunarso1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.

For example, KAP1 controls endogenous retroviral elements by recruiting chromatin-modifying factors <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Matsui1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Rowe2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>; it is targeted to murine leukemia virus LTRs in a sequence-specific fashion by the KRAB-zinc finger protein ZFP809 <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. To explain KAP1's more general role in ERV silencing, it is assumed that other sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins exist to target it to other ERV classes. The large number of diverse zinc finger proteins present in the mouse and human genomes may fill this role <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, but the sequence-specificity of DUX4 for LTRs might also allow it to recruit repressive factors to repetitive elements in a cell-type specific context.</p><p>Similar to retroelements, the pericentromeric satellite HSATII is bound and activated by DUX4. HSATII is a pericentromeric satellite sequence, repeated in large tandem arrays close to a subset of human centromeres. Its consensus sequence is 170 bp long <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Jurka1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and comprises &#x0223c;6 imperfect tandem copies of a smaller &#x0223c;25&#x02013;28 bp repeat unit (data not shown). Pericentromeric regions show evidence of transcriptional activity during specific stages of male meiosis <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Khalil1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, and transcription of satellite sequences at early developmental stages appears be an important prerequisite for later establishment of repressive heterochromatin <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. The activation of both interspersed repetitive elements and HSATII by DUX4 and its expression in germ cells of the testis could suggest a role in establishing repressive heterochromatin at both dispersed transposons and in tandemly repeated sequences near centromeres. Transcription of repetitive elements and satellite sequences in other, less appropriate biological contexts would likely be harmful, perhaps giving a strong evolutionary advantage to the location of the <italic>DUX4</italic> retrogene within a high copy-number macrosatellite that can be tightly repressed by similar epigenetic means.</p><p>
<italic>DUX4</italic> is normally expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues, but its variegated de-repression in muscle cells causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Snider2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Lemmers1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1003947-Richards1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

The repeat-initiated transcripts we describe here could also contribute to FSHD pathogenesis. For example, the <italic>HEY1</italic> gene (induced by DUX4-mediated activation of an upstream THE1B element) can inhibit myogenesis by repressing myogenin and Mef2C <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Buas1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, and its activation might contribute to the muscle deficiencies seen in FSHD. In addition, expression of satellite transcripts can cause genomic instability <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003947-BouzinbaSegard1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>; DUX4-mediated activation of HSATII might similarly affect FSHD muscle cells. DUX4-induced expression of ERV and MaLR-encoded proteins or protein fragments could also have functional consequences in testis or FSHD muscle cells. Notably, some ERV-encoded env proteins contain a peptide with immunosuppressive properties <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Cianciolo1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, perhaps contributing to the suppression of innate immunity we observe upon <italic>DUX4</italic> over-expression in myoblasts <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Geng1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Conversely, ERV-encoded protein fragments could be antigenic, and might elicit an immune response and some of the inflammation seen in FSHD muscle <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Molnar1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Frisullo1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>.</p><p>Our findings may also have clinical implications for cancer biology. The DUX4 target HSATII is expressed in a number of cancers <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Ting1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, and it has been shown that mouse cells lacking the genome caretaker gene <italic>Brca1</italic> aberrantly transcribe satellite sequences leading to genome instability <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. A large number of other DUX4 targets are known &#x0201c;cancer testis antigens&#x0201d; (CTAs): genes normally expressed only in testis but de-repressed in some cancers, eliciting an immune response <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Geng1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Furthermore, in Hodgkin's lymphoma cells, a THE1B-MaLR element provides an alternative promoter for the <italic>CSF1R</italic> proto-oncogene and de-repression of THE1B elements is widespread <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Lamprecht1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>.

We mapped each ChIP-seq read to the human reference assembly (hg19) using BWA <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. We eliminated multiply-mapping reads (retaining reads with mapq &#x0003e;15) and determined peak locations <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Geng1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. We identified a position weight matrix (PWM) describing a motif that is strongly enriched among DUX4 peaks, using only the &#x0223c;24,000 peaks that do not overlap a repetitive element <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Geng1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. We determined a score threshold for this PWM of 9.75, above which &#x0003e;97% of ChIP-seq peaks contain at least one motif.</p><p>For further analysis of DUX4 binding sites we refined peak locations by identifying the single 17-mer subsequence with highest score to the DUX4 PWM, rather than using the entire peak region (ChIP-seq resolution is limited by fragment size of &#x0223c;200 bp), making the simplifying assumption that each peak contains a single DUX4-binding site. We then determined whether each peak's best-scoring subsequence overlaps a repetitive element. To estimate peak-level enrichment for each repeat type, we divided the proportion of all peaks that overlap each repeat type (observed) by the proportion of base-pairs in the sequenced genome within that repeat type (expected). We previously found that DUX4 binding sites are distributed relatively uniformly across different types of genomic regions (promoters, intergenic regions, introns, etc.) <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Geng1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, so it is not necessary to adjust our &#x0201c;expected&#x0201d; proportions for the different prevalence of various repeats in these region types.</p><p>The DUX4 binding motif includes an average of 5.03 G or C residues among its 17 bases. In order to create an AT-matched set of genomic locations, we randomly selected 17-bp regions from the human genome, eliminating any that overlap assembly gaps, retaining those whose sequence contains 4&#x02013;6 G or C residues, and downsampling the final set to contain 63,795 sites to match the dataset of DUX4 binding sites. We then determined whether these randomly selected 17-mers overlapped repetitive elements, and counted the types of repeats found among overlapping elements. We performed this sampling 10 times, and use the mean fraction of sites overlapping repeats to calculate enrichment measures shown in the columns of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003947.s015">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003947.s016">S3</xref> labeled &#x0201c;peak-based ChIP-seq enrichment estimate, compared to randomly sampled AT-matched regions&#x0201d;.</p><p>In order to determine whether DUX4-bound repeats also tend to be bound by other regulatory factors, we obtained ENCODE ChIP-seq peak locations for 161 regulatory factors via the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics &#x0201c;wgEncodeAwgTfbsUniform&#x0201d; tables. For each factor, we chose a single representative ENCODE dataset, and determined the number of peaks that overlap DUX4 ChIP-seq peaks assigned as bound repeats (see above). Using the entire peak regions (several hundred base-pairs wide) for both DUX4 and the other TFs (rather than binding sites defined at higher resolution) allows us to ask the biologically relevant question of whether TFs bind in the vicinity of DUX4, rather than asking whether binding sites are exactly overlapping.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Estimation of repeat enrichment among ChIP-seq reads</title><p>In our standard ChIP-seq analysis (above), we ignored sequencing reads that map to multiple genomic locations to ensure that called peaks likely represent true binding sites.

<xref rid="pgen.1003947-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. This method examines repeat enrichment among individual sequencing reads, comparing counts of reads matching each repeat type in a ChIP-seq sample to counts in a negative control sample.</p><p>In more detail, we first filtered ChIP-seq read datasets to remove low quality sequences, and reads that match our lentivirus-<italic>DUX4</italic> constructs, the packaging constructs used during lentivirus preparation, or Illumina adapter sequences.

We then used BWA to map filtered reads to the repeat-based reference genomes, without filtering results for uniquely mapping sequences. We used the samtools idxstats program <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref> to determine the proportion of filtered reads mapping to each repeat type.

We used the same read-based method as we did for the ChIP-seq reads (see above) on our RNA-seq reads. Although this method uses the BWA read-mapping tool and will therefore fail to map spliced reads, it does not suffer from a limitation of tophat that it suppresses mappings for reads mapping to many genomic locations.</p><p>Second, we considered individual genomic locations (repeat instances, genes, lncRNAs, <italic>etc.</italic>) using tophat and DESeq, a method that limits our ability to examine highly similar multicopy sequences. We mapped reads to the genome using tophat <xref rid="pgen.1003947-Trapnell1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>, allowing up to 20 map locations for multiply-mapping reads (no map location is reported for reads that map to &#x0003e;20 locations).

We also repeated these analyses after filtering tophat output to retain only reads that map uniquely to the genome - results were very similar to those we obtained using all map locations (data not shown).</p><p>We encountered a minor technical issue: the RNA-seq read dataset for one sample, the untreated 54-1 negative control, has very low levels of contaminating reads from a lentivirus-<italic>DUX4</italic> treated sample.

The most likely explanation is that a small amount of RNA from another sample contaminated the untreated 54-1 cell RNA sample before sequencing. Although this issue only affects genes expressed to very high levels, it causes a technical problem for the DESeq statistical analysis method we used, because contaminating reads for genes expressed to high levels make dispersal estimation difficult (data not shown).

We scanned repeat consensus sequences with a PWM representing DUX4's binding preferences. In all panels, the dashed gray vertical line represents an ad hoc PWM score threshold of 9.75: most ChIP-seq peaks exceed this threshold. (A) For each repeat type, we plot read-based ChIP-seq enrichment estimate (y-axis) against best PWM score in the consensus (x-axis). We show only repeats with &#x02265;1000 mapped reads, because enrichment estimates derived from fewer reads are less biologically significant and more error-prone. Orange and red datapoints show repeats enriched (&#x02265;2-fold) among DUX4 binding sites by either the peak-based (&#x02265;100 peaks) or the read-based method (&#x02265;1000 reads); most contain a good DUX4 motif in their consensus sequence. To explore exceptions, we investigated three repeat types: MLT1A (red square, and panel B); THE1A (red triangle, and panel C);and HAL1 (black diamond, and panel D). (B, C, D) Distribution of best PWM scores for every genomic instance of each repeat type, demonstrating that consensus motif scores may not represent genomic instances well. Blue vertical lines show best consensus motif scores. Text below each title shows how many genomic instances of the repeat contain &#x02265;1 motif scoring &#x02265;9.75. (B) MLT1A repeats are enriched among DUX4 binding sites. Although their consensus has no good motif, a reasonable proportion of genomic repeat instances do, explaining DUX4 binding. (C) Some repeats, like THE1As, have a good motif in their consensus and are enriched for DUX4 binding; many genomic instances contain a motif identical to that of the consensus sequence. (D) Other repeats, like HAL1s, have a good motif in their consensus but only in a few genomic instances, explaining the lack of DUX4 binding. Such discrepancies between consensus PWM scores and repeat instances can occur because repeat instances acquire post-insertion mutations, and/or because of inaccuracy in the consensus.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1003947.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1003947.s003"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Activated internal repeats are younger than those that do not show activation.
