How such fluctuations are linked to changes in chromatin status is not well understood. Here we examine the correlated genome-wide transcription and chromatin states across the yeast metabolic cycle at unprecedented temporal resolution, revealing a &#x0201c;just-in-time supply chain&#x0201d; by which components from specific cellular processes such as ribosome biogenesis become available in a highly coordinated manner. We identify distinct chromatin and splicing patterns associated with different gene categories and determine the relative timing of chromatin modifications to maximal transcription. There is unexpected variation in the chromatin modification and expression relationship, with histone acetylation peaks occurring with varying timing and &#x0201c;sharpness&#x0201d; relative to RNA expression both within and between cycle phases. Chromatin modifier occupancy reveals subtly distinct spatial and temporal patterns compared to the modifications themselves.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Chromatin plays fundamental roles in DNA-related processes, including transcription, replication, recombination and repair<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. For example, most histone acetylations and certain methylations (eg. H3K4me3, H3K36me3) are correlated with active transcription while deacetylation and other methylations are correlated with repression<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. The pervasiveness of biological dynamics suggests that temporal interrogation of chromatin function is warranted. Compensatory and homeostatic effects almost certainly limit understanding of chromatin functions from steady-state studies<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The discovery of histone &#x0201c;readers&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;writers&#x0201d; further suggests the dynamics of chromatin<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, as do studies of bulk acetylation upon depletion of acetyl-CoA using a temperature-sensitive mutant<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Examination of chromatin state and RNA expression level at single genes upon activation reveals many dynamic changes, such as the sequential appearance of H2BK123ub and H3K4me3 at <italic>GAL1</italic> during galactose induction<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Genome-wide ChIP-seq studies reveal temporally dynamic chromatin patterns in circadian rhythm, heart development, yeast meiosis and other dynamic processes. These patterns have been correlated with transcription factor binding and RNA expression<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and support a generally dynamic role for chromatin in gene regulation. However, no prior studies have sufficient temporal resolution to dissect the specific roles of individual histone modifications during distinct steps in transcription in vivo, and the scope of genes regulated in these paradigms on a fast time scale has been limited.</p><p id="P3">Here we exploit a uniquely informative dynamical system, the yeast metabolic cycle (YMC), to examine regulation of &#x0003e;3,000 genes in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic><sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Under continuous glucose-limited conditions, yeast exhibits a ~4-5 hour respiratory cycle with &#x0003e;3,000 transcripts and dozens of metabolites oscillating at the same pace<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Although nearly all cycling genes share the same period of oscillation, the YMC can be broadly divided into three phases based on the defining expression profile: OX (oxidative), RB (reductive-building) and RC (reductive-charging). The overall logic of the YMC is well-defined: growth genes, such as ribosomal and amino acid biosynthesis genes are activated in OX; mitochondria and cell cycle genes are expressed in RB; and genes responding to starvation, stress and survival are elevated in RC. These divergent expression profiles imply that the dynamic interaction between chromatin modifications and transcription across distinct biological processes can be queried in a single system. Additionally, acetyl-CoA, a most dynamically oscillating metabolite, is a critical metabolic signal driving the YMC via histone (and perhaps other proteins) acetylation<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Studies on acetyl-CoA, S-adenosylmethionine and other metabolites directly involved in histone modification indicate that chromatin could play key roles in coordinating metabolism and gene expression<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Given such prevalent orchestration of expression and metabolites in the YMC, investigating the dynamic patterns of chromatin state could be useful for gaining a systems-level understanding of the YMC and beyond, such as how cells respond to a wide variety of nutrient and other biological stimuli through chromatin modifications. Discoveries made in the YMC could also extend our understanding of other cycling systems, such as circadian clocks.</p><p id="P4">We set out to do time-course ChIP-seq of histone modifications and modifiers in the YMC. We reveal the genome-wide landscape of 7 histone modifications across the YMC and compare it to a high-resolution RNA-seq profile and dynamic localization of 3 critical chromatin modifiers, Gcn5p, Esa1p and Set1p. High sampling frequency allowed definition of clear-cut sub-phases of gene expression in each phase, such as the sequential activation of ribosome biogenesis (ribi) and ribosomal protein (RP) genes during the growth phase. We also defined 7 distinct chromatin patterns associated with genes of different functional classes, revealing the diversity of histone modification pathways during transcription. We also observed that binding of certain chromatin modifiers does not always correlate with the appearance of the corresponding histone modifications, suggesting sophisticated temporal regulation. Inspired by the pervasiveness of the changes on the H3 and H4 N-termini during the YMC, we evaluated mutants in H3 and H4 modifiable lysines and showed that only certain multi-lysine mutants abolish the YMC, implying high system redundancy. Together, these data provide a comprehensive and high temporal resolution view of the dynamics of transcription and chromatin states. As such, they reveal how transcription and chromatin modifications are coordinated for different classes of genes during distinct phases of the life of a yeast cell.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Gene expression patterns in the YMC</title><p id="P5">Microarray-based transcriptome analysis revealed three superclusters of genes defined by expression pattern in the YMC<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Because of the short duration of the OX growth phase (~0.5 h), the previous sampling strategy used, (evenly-spaced every ~25 min and spread over 3 cycles) may have missed important transient regulatory events. To improve temporal resolution, we collected 16 samples across one cycle for RNA-seq by increasing the density of time points taken in the OX phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The same three superclusters of genes were observed in excellent agreement with the prior data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We also identified an additional ~500 genes with a clear expression peak in the OX phase from the &#x0201c;non-periodic&#x0201d; genes defined previously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated enrichment of ribosome biogenesis genes. Many showed hints of periodic expression in the microarray dataset but evaded detection by the periodicity algorithm due to less frequent sampling.</p><p id="P6">Thanks to high temporal resolution, we resolved several temporal subclusters associated with distinct biological functions within previously defined OX, RB and RC super-clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-d</xref>). OX phase genes were subdivided into OX1, defining an earlier and more transient peak of expression compared to OX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). OX1 contained genes associated with ribosome biogenesis (ribi) and rRNA processing. Ribosomal subunit (RP), amino acid metabolism (aa) and cytoplasmic translation genes were enriched in OX2, and peaked ~5 min later. The subtle differences between ribi and RP genes were confirmed by reverse transcription followed by quantitative real-time PCRs (RT-qPCRs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). This observation suggested precise temporal control of the energetically-demanding process of ribosome biogenesis. Ribosomal assembly factors and RNA processing factors were expressed just before ribosomal proteins and translational factors, providing a possible example of &#x0201c;just-in-time&#x0201d; orchestration of a critical process in the YMC leading to increased translational capacity. Three temporal subclusters of RB and RC genes were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). Cell cycle and mitochondrial genes were readily distinguished although the two processes both occur under similar metabolic states. Collectively, the RNA-seq results not only recapitulated known gene expression patterns, but also displayed elaborate and fine-grained temporal control of coordinated sequential processes.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Accumulation of pre-mRNAs in the OX phase</title><p id="P7">Besides the temporal compartmentalization of gene expression, RNA-seq analysis also revealed an unexpected pattern in intron sequence accumulation. As discussed previously, RP genes are activated in OX, peaking at t5. Surprisingly, we observed a dynamic intron signal in several intron-containing RP genes consistently peaking at t4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Several other intron-containing OX genes showed similar patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We evaluated RNA-seq reads across exon and intron regions separately for all intron-containing genes. Intron, exon and full-length signals were displayed in a heat map, identifying 6 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Among them, only intron1 showed temporal enrichment of intron signals in the OX phase. 89 of the 103 genes in intron1 are RP genes. Both the intron signals and the ratio of intron/exon signals peaked at t4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P9">During RNA splicing, intron 5&#x02019; ends are cleaved and join to the branchpoint in the intron, forming a lariat. To distinguish intron accumulation as lariats or pre-mRNA, we examined exon exon and intron-exon junctional reads of the 89 RP genes. As expected, exon-exon junctional reads were highest at t5, consistent with the timing of exon signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). However, 5&#x02019; intron junctional reads, representing the pre-mRNA form, peaked at t4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Additionally, we examined individual RP genes and discovered that the majority of the RP genes exhibited the same pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b-d</xref>). RT-qPCR of 4 RP genes showed that the peaks of introns were consistently ahead of the peaks of exon signals by a mean time of 7.3 min (p value = 0.0286) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Interestingly, t4 marks a strikingly reproducible inflection point in the O<sub>2</sub> curve of unknown functional importance occuring near mid-OX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). These data suggested exquisite temporal control of RP gene splicing &#x02013; RP genes appear to be transcribed at t4, but the corresponding mature spliced RP gene transcripts do not emerge until 5-7 min later at t5. Moreover, prior studies demonstrated accumulation of RP pre-mRNAs under stress conditions in yeast<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. This delay in RP gene mRNA splicing in the YMC suggests that yeast might suffer a certain level of amino acid or other stresses during early OX (i.e., t4). Alternatively, RP mRNAs may be spliced only on cue, following proper assembly of the ribosome biogenesis machinery. These may lead to a transient pause in O<sub>2</sub> consumption and the transient accumulation of RP pre-mRNAs precisely at this time point. Casein Kinase 2 complex (CK2) is required for RP gene pre-mRNA accumulation<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>; we observed peak expression of CK2 components at t4, t5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Dynamics of histone modifications across YMC</title><p id="P11">Given the transcriptome dynamics and close dependence of transcription on chromatin modification, we next investigated chromatin states across the YMC. A similar set of 16 samples across one cycle were collected for ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and 7 histone modifications were assessed, including H3K4me3, H3K36me3, H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K56ac, H4K5ac, H4K16ac, and H3 as control. Most of these are associated with active transcription<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. H3K56ac also functions in DNA replication and repair<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and H4K16ac is involved in silencing maintenance and lifespan<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. The two time series were computationally aligned by performing ChIP-seq for H3K9ac on both set of samples used for RNA and ChIP-seq (Online Methods).</p><p id="P12"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref> shows the spatial and temporal signals at the <italic>RMT2</italic> locus, encoding an arginine methyltransferase for ribosomal protein Rpl12<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Its expression peaked in mid-OX phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Mapping of ChIP-seq signals across <italic>RMT2</italic> revealed a typical spatial pattern<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> where H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H4K5ac and H3K4me3 signals peaked in the 5&#x02019; end whereas the H3K36me3 signal was located in the coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Although all positively correlated with transcription, the kinetics and relative timing were quite distinct at this locus. The H3K9ac signal was most dynamic, with a transient peak at t4. H3K14ac and H4K5ac signals also increased in OX with temporally broader peaks than H3K9ac. Instead, the H3K4me3 signal was much more stable than these acetylation marks, with clear-cut peaks across all 16 time points. It started to increase only in late OX at a modest level and peaked in early RB, well after acetylation peaks. No other modifications were obviously dynamic at <italic>RMT2</italic>.</p><p id="P13">Expanding examination to broader regions revealed another unexpected difference between modifications. Most H3K9ac peaks were observed in OX, despite the presence of nearby RB and RC genes, consistent with previous study showing that H3K9ac appeared preferentially at OX growth genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). RC/stress response genes were less dependent on H3K9ac<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Instead, H3K14ac, H4K5ac and H3K4me3 peaks were found at most genes indiscriminately. Strikingly, H3K9ac peaks seemingly appeared and disappeared completely coupled with transcription of neighboring genes while H3K14ac, H4K5ac and H3K4me3 only displayed an adjustment of amplitude. The data suggests that H3K9ac is a very active modification that regulates mainly OX growth genes, possibly by directly sensing metabolic stimuli. Others, like H3K14ac, H4K5ac and H3K4me3, have a more general role in transcription regulation. For more examples see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Fig. 4</xref>.</p><p id="P14">Next, we sought to determine average genome-wide chromatin patterns for various gene classes. First, we averaged the spatial signals of these modifications relative to the transcription start site (TSS) across the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Gene-specific signals were calculated based on the their localization. A heat map was used to display the genome-wide interactive temporal patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Generally, acetylation signals were more dynamic and less noisy than methylation signals, consistent with acetylation shifts reflecting the immediate chromatin response under continuous glucose-limitation. Fourteen clusters were defined, suggesting complex dynamic relationships among these modifications across the YMC.</p><p id="P15">Intriguingly, H3K56ac exhibited very dynamic but noticeably different temporal patterns compared to other histone modifications. By comparing the results to previous work<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, we clearly observed cell cycle-related dynamics of H3K56ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). H3K56ac was strongly elevated in early S phase; similarly, YMC signals peaked at t8, the middle of RB phase, corresponding to S-phase entry. Correspondingly, DNA replication genes (RNA_RB1) were also expressed highest at t8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The expression level of H3K56 acetyltransferase <italic>RTT109</italic>, peaked at t8 whereas RNA levels of H3K56 deacetylase <italic>HST3</italic>, began to increase after t8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). These data corroborated known involvement of H3K56ac in DNA replication in RB and supported the relationship between cell cycle and YMC.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Temporal association between transcription and chromatin</title><p id="P16">An important function for histone modifications is transcriptional regulation<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. With this in mind, we examined the genome-wide temporal relationships between each chromatin modification and transcription. Given the correlation analysis (Online methods) and previous studies<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, we focused on five modifications most clearly linked to transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). We discovered 7 clusters of cycling genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Are there different histone modification pathways associated with transcription of different gene clusters? To tackle this, we estimated relative timing of each modification peak relative to its corresponding RNA peak and examined GO enrichment on all clusters.</p><p id="P17">In clusters RNA_H1 and 2, the H3K9ac peak notably appeared just minutes before gene expression peak (9, 6.8 minutes in cluster 1, 2) whereas the H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 peaked 10-30 minutes after the peak of RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>). Surprisingly, H3K14ac and H4K5ac signals appeared concomitantly with peak gene expression in RNA_H 2 (6.2 minutes of H3K14ac and 10.8 minutes of H4K5ac), but in RNA_H 1 they were advanced by one hour relative to RNA (48 minutes for H3K14ac and 75 minutes for H4K5ac). Aa genes were enriched in RNA_H 1, whereas RNA_H 2 contained mostly ribi and RP genes. Combined with the RNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), we could define three distinct chromatin-transcriptional &#x0201c;programs&#x0201d; among OX growth genes. Ribosome biogenesis (ribi) and ribosomal protein (RP) genes shared the same chromatin pattern, distinct from that of aa genes. However, peak mRNA levels of RP genes and amino acid genes appeared later and lasted longer than those of the ribi genes. As discussed earlier, regulated splicing of RP genes might cause a delay of the peak level of mature RP mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Among the RB clusters, RNA_H 3 contained primarily cell cycle genes and exhibited similar chromatin patterns to OX clusters relative to RNA dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). In contrast, the genes encoding mitochondrial proteins (RNA_H 4) behaved quite differently. Although they had a similar peak expression time, timing of the modification signals was out of phase. H3K14ac and H4K5ac increased in late RC and H3K9ac increased in late RC through OX. A motif sequence recognized by RNA-binding protein Puf3 was found in the 3&#x02019; untranslated regions (3&#x02019; UTR) of nearly all mitochondrial ribosomal genes<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. This discrepancy between RNA level and chromatin states was consistent with the hypothesis that this gene class may be subject to post-transcriptional rather than transcriptional regulation.</p><p id="P19">The quantification of the relative timing of chromatin signals summarized different histone modification programs during transcription in yeast. In general, acetylation marks appear first, followed by RNA and then methylation marks, consistent with an overall initiation role for acetylation and an elongation role for methylation. Intriguingly, the fine-grained timing of different histone acetylation modifications could be a key factor to distinguish different transcription initiation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). In RNA_H 1, H4K5ac appeared at first, followed by H3K9ac and then RNA. This general sequence suggests that H4K5ac functions at an early stage of transcription initiation in these sets of genes, perhaps to &#x0201c;pre-set&#x0201d; their activation, while H3K9ac, which peaks much more sharply, may play a critical role in triggering phase transitions, and may regulate a later initiation step or a transition to elongation. In RNA_H 2, H4K5ac and H3K9ac peaked together immediately before RNA peak, suggesting dispensability of a presetting stage during transcription of these genes.</p><p id="P20">The distinct patterns between chromatin and gene expression raised the question whether specific transcription factors (TFs) are associated with these clusters. TF motif analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) revealed that binding sites for TFs involved in amino acid metabolism, like Gcn4p, Bas1p, Cbf1p, Leu3p, were enriched in RNA_H 1, whereas in RNA_H 2 we observed enrichment primarily of TF motifs related to RP gene expression, such as Stb3p, Sfp1p, Rap1p, Pbf1p, Pbf2p, Dot6p, Tod6p. RNA_H 3 contained several common cell-cycle related TF motifs including those for Xbp1p, Mbp1p, Fkh1/2p, Swi4p. Many TF motifs associated with stress response were enriched in RNA_H 6, a typical RC cluster, such as Gis1p, Msn2/4p, Adr1p, Crz1p. Collectively, these results revealed a complex, dynamic and interactive regulatory network of chromatin states, TF binding sites, and post-transcriptional regulation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Landscape of chromatin-modifying enzyme occupancy in the YMC</title><p id="P21">To further understand the dynamic patterns of histone modifications, we analyzed genome-wide occupancy of several chromatin-modifying enzymes in the YMC, specifically Gcn5p, Esa1p and Set1p<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Gcn5p is the major histone H3 tail acetyltransferase and Esa1p acetylates H4 tails, although other HATs also acetylate H3 and H4. Set1p is the catalytic subunit of COMPASS complex H3K4 methyltransferase.</p><p id="P22">To simultaneously evaluate all three enzymes, we constructed a doubly-tagged GCN5-FLAG, SET1-3HA strain employing an anti-native Esa1p antibody. This allowed ChIP-seq of Gcn5p, Esa1p and Set1p in one set of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). First, we examined spatiotemporal patterns of these enzymes by displaying ChIP-seq signals at sample regions; temporal patterns were quite distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). All three enzymes were recruited to RP gene <italic>RPS27A (YKL156W)</italic> in OX but with subtly distinct kinetics. Gcn5p occupancy was detected only at t5, corresponding to t4 in the 16 time point ChIP-seq of histone modifications. However, Esa1p and Set1p signals preceded this peak, spanning mostly t2, t3, although Set1p occupancy lasted much longer, extending through early RB. Only Gcn5p and Set1p signals were detected at <italic>GPM1</italic>(RC) and <italic>SDH1</italic>(RB) loci, in a manner correlated with RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Interestingly, the signal of Set1p appeared 1-2 time points (5~20 minutes) before Gcn5p signal at <italic>GPM1</italic>, similar to <italic>RPS27A</italic>.</p><p id="P23">Given the complex spatiotemporal relationships between the three enzymes, we sought to assess the interactive patterns and their relationship to corresponding histone modifications and gene expression from a genome-wide perspective. We found 2369 Gcn5p peaks, 2225 Esa1 peaks and 2279 Set1p peaks, including 1874, 1810 and 1629 with neighboring annotated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Among these, ~1750 genes were bound by at least two modifiers and 1035 genes were bound by all three modifiers, suggesting that these enzymes were not necessary for expression of every cycling gene. Spatial analysis showed that Gcn5p and Esa1p were localized 200-300 bp upstream of the TSS while Set1p was localized within the transcribed regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c,d,e</xref>). This supported the well-accepted hypothesis that Gcn5p and Esa1p function in transcriptional initiation whereas Set1p is associated with elongation<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, the locations of the modifiers did not overlap completely with corresponding histone modifications. Although Gcn5p and Esa1p located upstream of the TSS, H3K9ac and H4K5ac were shifted downstream. This suggested that Gcn5p and Esa1p can &#x0201c;reach across&#x0201d; the TSS to act on the downstream nucleosome. The Set1p signal was slightly shifted downstream of the H3K4me3 peak, presumably because Set1p also produces mono- and di-methylation on H3K4 during transcriptional elongation.</p><p id="P24">Next, we assessed temporal patterns of chromatin-modifiers, focusing on annotated genes associated with all three modifiers. We defined 4 superclusters of temporal patterns by K-means clustering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). The results suggested that all three modifiers are functional in all three phases and recruitment of modifiers is roughly in phase with corresponding gene expression.</p><p id="P25">However, chromatin modifiers, chromatin states and gene expression were not simply correlated. Here we focused on cell growth genes, including ribi, RP and aa genes<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Ribi and RP genes individually exhibited one pattern while aa genes showed three distinct patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Since RP genes showed the cleanest signal, we examined relative timing within this group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). As described above, H3K9ac and H4K5ac appeared with the RNA peak whereas H3K4me3 exhibited a delay. Surprisingly, Set1p was recruited ~10 minutes prior to the binding of Gcn5p, and remained bound until dissociation of Gcn5p. This pattern was consistent at <italic>RPS27A</italic>, <italic>GPM1</italic> (described above) and many other loci. The relative timing of histone modifications and modifiers at ribosome and aa genes were further confirmed by ChIP-qPCR in similar YMC experiment using Gcn5-3FLAG, 6HA-Set1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Fig. 6d,e</xref>). The temporal discrepancy between modifiers and modifications suggested that Set1p is recruited prior to transcription in a state that is non-functional, at least for tri-methylation, until binding of Gcn5p occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>), whereas Esa1p is also recruited early but is immediately active.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Histone mutant analysis</title><p id="P26">Given the complex patterns of histone modifications and modifiers in YMC, we investigated the criticality of individual lysine residue modifications. Gcn5p mediates entry into the growth phase, as a mutant lacking it does not exhibit metabolic cycles<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. To broaden our understanding of histone modifications in the YMC, we examined the dO<sub>2</sub> oscillation phenotype of all histone H3 and H4 lysine mutants corresponding to residues at which acetylation or methylation have been reported. All single lysine to alanine or arginine mutants, including H3K4, H3K9, H3K14, H3K18, H3K23, H3K27, H3K36, H3K56, H3K79, H4K5, H4K8, H4K12, H4K16, exhibited normal cycles, suggesting that no single lysine modification on H3 or H4 is critical for the YMC (data not shown). Next, we combined lysine to arginine mutations in H3 or H4 tails, including H3K(9,14)R, H3K(9,14,18)R, H3K(9,14,18,23)R, H3K(9,14,18,23,27)R, H4K(5,8)R, H4K(5,8,12)R.

Strikingly, H3K(9,14,18,23,27)R, and H4K(5,8,12)R mutants abolished dO<sub>2</sub> oscillation. These results supported the hypothesis that PTMs such as acetylation on the H3 and H4 tails are required for normal cycling and support a role for acetyl-CoA in establishing the YMC<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, although there is no essential role in the YMC for any individual lysine residue.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">In this study, we described the dynamic landscape of transcription and chromatin modifications across distinct metabolic states in yeast.

YMC transcriptional profiling revealed several examples of staged biosynthesis consistent with a &#x0201c;just in time&#x0201d; program. Ribi transcripts appeared just before those encoding RP and aa (OX phase) genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), supporting a &#x0201c;just in time supply chain&#x0201d; that maximizes efficiency of ribosome biogenesis and translation. The short pulse of ribi genes may also play a critical role in helping them achieve an efficient ramp-down of protein synthesis at the end of OX. The observation of transient RP gene pre-mRNA accumulation suggested the possibility of elaborate control of splicing in regulation of ribosome biogenesis. Alternatively, this staging may reflect the fact that ribi genes can be much larger and therefore take longer to translate than RP proteins, which are universally short. The translation of the longest ribi gene might require 3-4 minutes more than the longest RP gene, consistent with the relative timing of ribi and RP expression. It is likely that the sequential activation of ribi and RP leads to concurrent synthesis of all ribosome biogenesis proteins. Likewise, cell cycle-related genes and mitochondrial genes, the two major groups that had an elevated RNA level in the RB phase, also exhibited subtle timing disparities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), perhaps indicating two distinct YMC subpopulations &#x02013; one that will enter the CDC, and one which will not<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.

H3K9ac, H3K14ac and H4K5ac all appeared coincident with the peak of gene expression of ribosomal genes. However, H3K14ac and H4K5ac were shifted earlier at aa (OX phase_aa2) genes (1 hour before the RNA peak). We hypothesized that H3K14ac and H4K5ac function in &#x0201c;pre-setting&#x0201d; the promoters, perhaps by chromatin remodeling. However, RP genes did not show evidence of this pre-activation phase from the perspective of chromatin states, perhaps because they are permanently pre-activated.

Our findings on dynamics of chromatin modifications and temporal associations between epigenome and transcriptome suggest an active metabolism-epigenome-transcriptome loop in YMC.

The ribosomal protein (RP gene) list is from the website, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ribosome.med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp/rpg.cgi?mode=orglist&#x00026;org=Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae">http://ribosome.med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp/rpg.cgi?mode=orglist&#x00026;org=Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae</ext-link>. Amino acid metabolism genes are from the GO term &#x0201c;cellular amino acid metabolic process&#x0201d; of the SGD annotation file. ChIP values were normalized according to the total number of aligned reads. Time point 13 of H3K14ac and H4K5ac, time point 1 of H4K16ac and time point 5/7 of H3K36me3 show certain level of fluctuation. We tried to delete these samples or average these samples with neighboring samples and observed no significant differences in the downstream analysis. Based on the continuity of time course experiments, we smoothed these samples by averaging the signals with neighboring samples for visualization. K-means clustering and heatmaps were performed in R as described above. Hierarchical clustering was performed by dChiP package<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Data Pre-processing</title><p id="P45">For each sample, we normalized the observed value by the total number of aligned reads. For each modification, we then standardized the 16 observed values (log<sub>2</sub> of read counts plus 1) within each gene. We were primarily interested in the trend of change over time, rather than the relative magnitude of expression among genes. So we standardized the 16 values within each gene, i.e. we subtract the mean from the 16 values and then divide by their standard deviation. Then we pooled the data for all RNA-seq and ChIP-seq datasets together to get a data matrix, in which each row is a gene and each column is a time point.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Notations</title><p id="P46">For a given marker, we denote the matrixes as Y = [Y<sub>gj</sub>] as processed gene expression levels, where g = 1,...,N is the gene index, and j = 1,...,16 is the time point index. We denote tj as observation times.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Correlation between chromatin modifications and gene expression</title><p id="P47">A gene-specific correlation coefficient was calculated between 16-time-point gene expression values and each histone modification value. A 2-time-point shift was allowed to achieve the maximum correlation value. Basically, we calculated gene-specific correlation coefficient with time point shift of -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 and took the maximum correlation value as the output correlation coefficient. We note that some modifications are shifted forward or backward relative to RNA level and this could help get the accurate correlation value. A density distribution of correlation values was plotted across the whole genome or across subsets of interest (OX, RB, RC). We observed a positive correlation in the distribution of H3K4me3, H3K36me3, H3K9ac, H3K14ac and H4K5ac with RNA level (data not shown). Interestingly, the OX phase genes always showed the best correlation with expression, while RB phase genes showed a relatively poor correlation. We also noticed that H4K16ac and total H3 exhibit a slight negative correlation and H3K56ac shows no obvious correlation (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Curve fitting</title><p id="P48">For each gene, we observed gene expression levels at 16 time points. To convert these discrete data into a continuous profile or function, we fit every set of 16 points into a smooth curve using a penalized B-spline<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. We denote function f<sub>g</sub>(t) as fitted continuous profile from data [Y<sub>g</sub>1, ..., Y<sub>g</sub>16] and [t<sub>1</sub>, ..., t<sub>16</sub>]. f<sub>g</sub>(t) is a linear combination of B-spline basis functions (a definition of B-spline basis can be found in Eilers and Marx, 1996). Estimation of the coefficient of each basis function is obtained by a penalized optimization problem.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Time alignment (Batch effect removal)</title><p id="P49">We assume the dynamics of gene expression levels changes according to a biologically specified clock or time system.

To minimize batch to batch variations, the histone modification H3K9ac, which is the most periodic, was independently measured in both batches.
