Exosomes have been found to contain various RNA species including miRNA, mRNA and long non-protein coding RNAs. A number of cancer cells produce elevated levels of exosomes. Because exosomes have been isolated from most body fluids they may provide a source for non-invasive cancer diagnostics. Transcriptome profiling that uses deep-sequencing technologies (RNA-Seq) offers enormous amount of data that can be used for biomarkers discovery, however, in case of exosomes this approach was applied only for the analysis of small RNAs. In this study, we utilized RNA-Seq technology to analyze RNAs present in microvesicles secreted by human breast cancer cell lines.</p><p>Exosomes were isolated from the media conditioned by two human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436. Exosomal RNA was profiled using the Ion Torrent semiconductor chip-based technology. Exosomes were found to contain various classes of RNA with the major class represented by fragmented ribosomal RNA (rRNA), in particular 28S and 18S rRNA subunits. Analysis of exosomal RNA content revealed that it reflects RNA content of the donor cells. Although exosomes produced by the two cancer cell lines shared most of the RNA species, there was a number of non-coding transcripts unique to MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells. This suggests that RNA analysis might distinguish exosomes produced by low metastatic breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-436) from that produced by highly metastatic breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). The analysis of gene ontologies (GOs) associated with the most abundant transcripts present in exosomes revealed significant enrichment in genes encoding proteins involved in translation and rRNA and ncRNA processing. These GO terms indicate most expressed genes for both, cellular and exosomal RNA.</p><p>For the first time, using RNA-seq, we examined the transcriptomes of exosomes secreted by human breast cancer cells. We found that most abundant exosomal RNA species are the fragments of 28S and 18S rRNA subunits. This limits the number of reads from other RNAs. To increase the number of detectable transcripts and improve the accuracy of their expression level the protocols allowing depletion of fragmented rRNA should be utilized in the future RNA-seq analyses on exosomes. Present data revealed that exosomal transcripts are representative of their cells of origin and thus could form basis for detection of tumor specific markers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Exosomes</kwd><kwd>Microvesicles</kwd><kwd>Next generation sequencing</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Biomarkers</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>Bioinformatics Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This article was funded by the Bioinformatics Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore.

The term &#x0201c;exosomes&#x0201d; was introduced in 1987 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-13">Johnstone et al. (1987)</xref> to describe the &#x0201c;trash&#x0201d; vesicles released by differentiating reticulocytes to dispose unwanted membrane proteins which are known to diminish during maturation of reticulocytes to erythrocytes. Later exosomes have been implicated in more complex functions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-32">Raposo et al. (1996)</xref> have demonstrated that exosomes derived from B lymphocytes activate T lymphocytes, suggesting a role for exosomes in antigen presentation <italic>in vivo</italic>. In early studies, secreted microvesicles were named based on their cellular origins, e.g., archaeosomes, argosomes, dexosomes, epididymosomes, prostasomes, oncosomes, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-33">Raposo &#x00026; Stoorvogel, 2013</xref>). More lately it became apparent that vesicles released by the same cell type are heterogeneous and can be classified into at least three classes based on their mode of biogenesis: (1) exosomes (30&#x02013;130 nm in diameter), which originate from multivesicular endosome (MVE); (2) microvesicles (100&#x02013;1000 nm in diameter), which are shed from the plasma membrane; (3) apoptotic bodies (1&#x02013;4 &#x000b5;m in diameter), which are released from fragmented apoptotic cells during late stages of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-33">Raposo &#x00026; Stoorvogel, 2013</xref>). Various purification procedures including sequential centrifugation protocols have been proposed to separate these vesicles for further analysis. Biochemical and proteomic analyses showed that exosomes contain specific protein set reflecting their intracellular site of formation. Exosomes from different cell types contain endosome-associated proteins, e.g., tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, CD81, CD82), annexins, Rab GTPases and flotillin. Exosomes are also enriched in proteins involved in MVE formation (Tsg101 and Alix), chaperones (Hsc73 and Hsc90) and cytoskeletal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-31">Raimondo et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, exosomes contain proteins that are specific to the cells from which they are derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-7">Choi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-35">Sandvig &#x00026; Llorente, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The research in the exosome field has exploded rapidly after the discovery that these microvesicles transport a large number of mRNA and miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-41">Valadi et al., 2007</xref>) and that exosomal mRNAs could be translated into proteins by recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-34">Ratajczak et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-41">Valadi et al., 2007</xref>) and exosomal miRNAs are able to modulate gene expression in recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-22">Mittelbrunn et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, certain mRNAs and miRNAs were identified as highly enriched in exosomes compared to that of the host cells indicating the existence of selective sorting mechanism controlling incorporation of RNA into exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-37">Skog et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-41">Valadi et al., 2007</xref>). Previously, we demonstrated that exosomal RNAs share specific sequence motifs that may potentially function as <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements for targeting to exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">Batagov, Kuznetsov &#x00026; Kurochkin, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Given the fact that exosomes carry complex biological information consisting of proteins, lipids and RNAs, it is not surprising to find that they have been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-38">Skokos et al. (2001)</xref> reported, for example, that mast cells communicate with other cells of the immune system via exosomes promoting mitogenic activity in B and T lymphocytes. A number of studies have demonstrated the role of exosomes in the development of the nervous system, synaptic activity, neuronal regeneration, neuron-glia communication and protection against injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-16">Lai &#x00026; Breakefield, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, exosomes can be involved in the pathogenesis of cancer and degenerative diseases. The fact that tumor cells release a large amount of exosomes was initially demonstrated in ovarian cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-39">Taylor, Homesley &#x00026; Doellgast, 1983</xref>). Exosomes were shown to be secreted by various tumor cells including those derived from breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-15">King, Michael &#x00026; Gleadle, 2012</xref>), colorectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-36">Silva et al., 2012</xref>), brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-10">Graner et al., 2009</xref>), ovarian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-8">Escrevente et al., 2011</xref>), prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-21">Mitchell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-25">Nilsson et al., 2009</xref>), lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-30">Rabinowits et al., 2009</xref>), and bladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-42">Welton et al., 2010</xref>) cancer. A significantly higher amount of exosomes was found in plasma from lung cancer patients compared to that of control individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-30">Rabinowits et al., 2009</xref>). In colorectal cancer patients, the amount of plasma circulating exosomes was constitutively higher than in normal healthy individuals showing the direct correlation between exosomes quantity and malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-36">Silva et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Manipulating tumor cells to decrease the release of exosomes followed by their injection into immunocompetent mice led to a significantly slower tumor growth compared to that of unperturbed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4">Bobrie et al., 2012</xref>). It has been shown that exosomes which are released from tumor cells are able to transfer a variety of molecules, including cancer-specific, to other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1">Al-Nedawi, Meehan &#x00026; Rak, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-24">Muralidharan-Chari et al., 2009</xref>) to manipulate their environment, making it more favorable for tumor growth and invasion. Glioblastoma-derived exosomes were found to be enriched in angiogenic proteins that allowed them to stimulate angiogenesis in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-37">Skog et al., 2008</xref>). Melanoma exosomes were shown to be instrumental in melanoma cell dissemination via alterations in the angiogenic microenvironment. Hood et al. demonstrated that metastatic factors responsible for the recruitment of melanoma cells to sentinel lymph nodes are upregulated by melanoma exosomes themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-24">Muralidharan-Chari et al., 2009</xref>). Exosomes shed by human MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells and U87 glioma cells were capable of conferring the transformed characteristics of cancer cells onto normal fibroblasts and epithelial cells in part due to transferring tissue transglutaminase and fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-11">Hood, San &#x00026; Wickline, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Because of their small size exosomes have an ability to penetrate intercellular contacts to reach distant parts of the body with the help of the blood stream and other body fluids. Exosomes have been purified from human plasma, serum, bronchoalveolar fluid, urine, tumoral effusions, epididymal fluid, amniotic fluid and breast milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-33">Raposo &#x00026; Stoorvogel, 2013</xref>). Since exosomes possess characteristic protein and RNA signatures of their host cells, analysis of exosomes in various body fluids can be potentially utilized for non-invasive diagnostics of cancer and other disorders. For example, aggressive human gliomas often express a truncated and oncogenic form of the epidermal growth factor receptor, known as EGFRvIII. The tumour-specific EGFRvIII was detected in serum microvesicles from glioblastoma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-37">Skog et al., 2008</xref>). High stability of exosomal RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-37">Skog et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-41">Valadi et al., 2007</xref>) and ease of RNA detection by highly sensitive PCR makes detection of exosomal RNA an attractive approach for the discovery of biomarkers. Indeed, mRNA variants and miRNAs characteristic of gliomas could be detected in serum microvesicles of glioblastoma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-37">Skog et al., 2008</xref>). Expression profiles of serum microvesicle mRNA by microarrays correctly separated individuals with glioblastoma from normal controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-26">Noerholm et al., 2012</xref>). Of all RNA species, secreted miRNAs were most frequently utilized toward discovery of body fluid-based biomarkers perhaps because miRNA expression profiles are more informative than mRNA expression profiles in a number of diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-9">Grady &#x00026; Tewari, 2010</xref>). In one study, analysis of plasma- and serum-derived microvesicles revealed 12 miRNAs differently expressed in prostate cancer patients compared to that of healthy controls and 11 miRNAs upregulated in patients with metastases compared to that of patients without metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-5">Bryant et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, exosomes released by breast cancer cells can be separated into different classes depending on their miRNAs content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-28">Palma et al., 2012</xref>). Cells undergoing malignant transformation produced exosomes containing selective miRNAs, whose release is increased by malignant transformation, in contrast to cells that are not affected by malignancy, whose exosomes are packed with neutral miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-28">Palma et al., 2012</xref>). The changes in exosomal miRNA cargo could provide a signature of the presence of malignant cells in the body.</p><p>The majority of reported to date exosomal miRNA and mRNA profiles have been generated using microarray approaches that suffer from several limitations. Microarrays are biased for investigation of already discovered transcripts. In addition, there is potential for cross-hybridization of RNAs that are highly related in sequence. Recently developed next generation RNA sequencing technology (RNA-Seq) allows detection of all RNA subtypes as well as of unannotated transcripts and has a high sensitivity toward identification of low-abundance RNAs. In case of exosomes, this approach was applied only for the analysis of small (20&#x02013;70 nt) RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3">Bellingham, Coleman &#x00026; Hill, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-27">Nolte-&#x02019;t Hoen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we utilized the RNA-Seq approach to characterize the transcriptomes of exosomes secreted by two metastatic human breast cancer cell lines. We describe optimized computational workflow to analyze data generated by the Ion Torrent semiconductor chip-based technology. We have identified and profiled RNA species present in exosomes and host cells and discuss the utility of exosomal RNA as potential breast cancer-specific biomarkers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-436 (ATCC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HTB-130&#x02122;) and MDA-MB-231 (ATCC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HTB-26&#x02122;) were maintained at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO2 and cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS. 48 h prior to exosome collection, cells were washed 3 times with PBS and the medium was changed to serum-free CCM5 medium (Thermo Scientific).</p></sec><sec><title>Exosome extraction</title><p>Exosomes were isolated and purified from the media of MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-231 cell cultures using sequential centrifugation protocol.

The low quality reads were removed by read trimming and read filtering. Read trimming included removal of adapter sequences, removal of the 3&#x02032; ends with low quality scores and trimming based on High-Residual Ionogram Values. Filtering of entire reads included removal of short reads, adapter dimers, reads lacking sequencing key, reads with off-scale signal and polyclonal reads.

Further filtering included the removal of the low quality reads which fall below the mapping quality score of 10 (-q 10) using SAMtools. For the coverage search, the BAM file generated by Tophat2 was converted to BED format with option (-split) using BEDtools. The BED file was converted again to BAM format using BEDtools. We then developed python script (using pysam as part of the scripts) to calculate the number of reads and read coverage in exons and protein-coding sequence (CDS) regions consecutively.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA abundance calculation</title><p>RNA abundance was estimated with the help of Partek Genomics Suite software (Partek Inc., St. Lous, MO) using Reference Sequence Gene (RefSeq Gene) and GENCODE annotation built version 14 of those not overlapped with RefSeq Gene from UCSC genome browser.

Because microarrays are based on hybridization, they have high background owing to cross-hybridization, they have a limited dynamic range of detection and they rely upon known structures of genes. Development of RNA-Seq technology permitted comprehensive analysis of whole transcriptomes with the single nucleotide resolution allowing quantification of most RNA molecules expressed in the cell or tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-23">Mortazavi et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we used the Ion Torrent platform to interrogate transcriptomes of exosomes released from two metastatic breast cancer cell lines. At the time of conducting our analysis this technology produced relatively low number of reads, yet we selected it as it provided the longest reads than any other sequencing platform. This feature of the Ion Torrent technology was essential as we dealt with RNA isolated from exosomes whose nature and composition are still not well established. RNA-seq data analysis is complicated by the intricacy of dealing with large datasets, reads quality control, alignment procedure etc. Different workflows and several algorithms have been proposed to map reads to the reference genome and to perform data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-6">Chen, Wang &#x00026; Shi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-23">Mortazavi et al., 2008</xref>). Comparison of expression levels across different samples and experiments is often difficult and requires complicated normalization methods and these are still under active development. The situation is even more complex in case of exosomal transcriptomes that differ significantly from cellular transcriptomes.To address this issue, we developed in this study customized bioinformatics workflow and demonstrated its utility for analysis of exosomal RNA. Because the Ion Torrent platform produces reads with different length the dedicated algorithm for their alignment to the genome called TMAP was recommended. We found out, however, that this tool does not allow satisfactory mapping of reads that contain splice-junctions or span introns. Therefore, we choose alternative aligning tool TopHat2 (with Bowtie2) which could handle reads of varying length and identify splice-junctions based on known splice-junctions as well as allowed the discovery of new splice-junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-14">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-17">Langmead &#x00026; Salzberg, 2012</xref>).</p><p>We observed a large proportion of reads mapped to rRNA regions in exosomal samples. This was surprising given the fact that intact 18S and 28S rRNA peaks were almost undetectable in exosomal RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>). This observation suggested that the majority of exosomal rRNA is fragmented. Exosomal rRNA fragments could be mapped over entire length of rRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-3">Fig. S3</xref>). Fragmented 28S and 18S rRNA were major rRNA species present in exosomes. The reads mapped to 28S and 18S rRNA were distributed almost equally in exosomal and cellular RNA samples. What is the possible reason for generation of exosomal rRNA fragments? RNases present in cell culture conditioned medium are unlikely to contribute to rRNA fragmentation since exosomal membranes provide protection against RNase attack. Indeed, treatment of the exosomal preparations with RNase A did not lead to significant difference between treated and control samples in RNA size distribution (data not shown). In the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-37">Skog et al. (2008)</xref> RNase treatment of the glioblastoma exosomes led to a very insignificant (less than 7%) decrease in RNA suggesting that exosomal RNA is inaccessible for RNase from outside the vesicles. A possibility exists that the rRNA fragments are generated after secretion by RNases originated from the host cells and incorporated into exosome vesicles. Alternatively, rRNA fragments could be generated inside cells prior to their release to exosomes. Another class of RNA, tRNA is represented in exosomes mainly by its fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-27">Nolte-&#x02019;t Hoen et al., 2012</xref>). The most abundant tRNA hits in exosomal RNA are all located at the 5&#x02032; end of mature tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-27">Nolte-&#x02019;t Hoen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Regardless the biogenesis of rRNA fragments, it is advisable to perform rRNA depletion step even in the absence of visible rRNA peaks on RNA profiles. This procedure would allow obtaining much higher sequencing depth for other RNA species. Our attempt to deplete fragmented rRNA with the popular RiboMinus&#x02122;Eukaryote Kit failed because of the design of the probes. Because the probes size is short, many fragments of rRNA are not targeted. The use of larger number of longer probes is expected to produce a more efficient way of pulling-down fragmented rRNA. This technical aspect of working with exosomal RNA samples should be certainly considered in the future studies.</p><p>As a result of large rRNA presence in exosomal samples we observed only 2% of mapped reads to known transcripts using RefSeq and GENECODE gene models. Moreover, with RPKM value &#x0003e;1 we observed a large amount of misannotation due to poor coverage of the reads over transcripts. Therefore, we suggested another approach, namely filtering genes based on reads coverage over protein coding sequence for mRNA or exons for non-coding RNA. This procedure allowed us to achieve more than 90% coverage for protein-coding and non-coding regions which we considered as highly reliable for functional classification. This approach was helpful to reveal highly expressed genes in exosomes which could be potentially used as noninvasive breast cancer markers.</p><p>We report that exosomes are carrying mRNAs that are highly expressed in the host breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-9">Fig. 9</xref>). Thus exosomal transcriptomes are representative of their cells of origin and should provide a platform for detection of tumor specific markers. GO analysis revealed that main biological and molecular functions of both cellular and exosomal transcripts are enriched in proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, translational elongation, ribosomal subunit assembly and rRNA processing. What could be the significance of these functions in exosomal transcriptome? Exosome-associated mRNAs were shown to be translated into proteins by recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-34">Ratajczak et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-41">Valadi et al., 2007</xref>). We hypothesize that upon arrival to the recipient cells exosomal mRNAs are translated into proteins supporting ribosomal functions to ensure efficient translation of other exosomal mRNAs within a cellular compartment where exosome content is released. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-41">Valadi et al. (2007)</xref> also described presence of mRNAs for many ribosomal proteins in exosomes secreted by mouse mast cell line. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-10">Graner et al. (2009)</xref> demonstrated the presence of elongation and translation factors in exosomes derived from brain tumor.</p><p>In conclusion, here we demonstrated for the first time that fragmented rRNA is a major species of exosomal RNA. Proposed here custom bioinformatics workflow allowed us to reliably detect other, non-ribosomal RNAs under conditions of limited read numbers. Classification and quantification of the RNA-Seq data revealed that exosomal transcripts are representative of their cells of origin and thus could form basis for detection of tumor specific markers. This information can also be used for getting insights in the molecular underpinnings of biological effects produced by these microvesicles. Finding that exosomes bear mRNAs encoding the necessary components to build-on-site ribosomes provides a valuable insight into biological function of these vesicles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplemental-information"><title>Supplemental Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.201/supp-1</object-id><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Comparison of mapping quality between the alignment tools TopHat2.0.6 and TMAP 0.3.7</title><p>FTL gene (chromosome position chr19:49,468,467-49,470,296) is selected as an example of alignment comparison.
