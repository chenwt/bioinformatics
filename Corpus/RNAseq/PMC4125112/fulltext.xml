While HD has been described mainly as a neurological disease, multiple epidemiological studies have shown that HD patients exhibit a high incidence of cardiovascular events leading to heart failure, and that this is the second highest cause of death. Given that huntingtin is ubiquitously expressed, cardiomyocytes may be at risk of an HD-related dysfunction. In mice, the forced expression of an expanded polyQ repeat under the control of a cardiac specific promoter led to severe heart failure followed by reduced lifespan. However the mechanism leading to cardiac dysfunction in the clinical and pre-clinical HD settings remains unknown. To unravel this mechanism, we employed the R6/2 transgenic and <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 knock-in mouse models of HD. We found that pre-symptomatic animals developed connexin-43 relocation and a significant deregulation of hypertrophic markers and <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcripts. In the symptomatic animals, pronounced functional changes were visualised by cardiac MRI revealing a contractile dysfunction, which might be a part of dilatated cardiomyopathy (DCM). This was accompanied by the re-expression of foetal genes, apoptotic cardiomyocyte loss and a moderate degree of interstitial fibrosis. To our surprise, we could identify neither mutant HTT aggregates in cardiac tissue nor a HD-specific transcriptional dysregulation, even at the end stage of disease. We postulate that the HD-related cardiomyopathy is caused by altered central autonomic pathways although the pathogenic effects of mutant HTT acting intrinsically in the heart may also be a contributing factor.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder for which the mutation results in an extra-long tract of glutamines that causes the huntingtin protein to aggregate. It is characterized by neurological symptoms and brain pathology that is associated with nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates and with transcriptional dysregulation. Despite the fact that HD has been recognized principally as a neurological disease, there are multiple epidemiological studies showing that HD patients exhibit a high rate of cardiovascular events leading to heart failure. To unravel the cause of cardiac dysfunction in HD models, we employed a wide range of molecular and physiological methods using two well established genetic mouse models of this disease. We found that pre-symptomatic animals developed aberrant gap junction channel expression and a significant deregulation of hypertrophic markers that may predispose them to arrhythmia and an overall change in cardiac function. These changes were accompanied by the re-expression of foetal genes, apoptotic cardiomyocyte loss and a moderate degree of interstitial fibrosis in the symptomatic animals. Surprisingly, we could identify neither mutant HTT aggregates in cardiac tissue nor a HD-specific transcriptional dysregulation. Therefore, we conclude that the HD-related cardiomyopathy could be driven by altered central autonomic pathways.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the CHDI Foundation, a not-for-profit biomedical research organization exclusively dedicated to discovering and developing therapeutics that slow the progression of Huntington's disease.

It is characterized by neurological symptoms and brain pathology, particularly neurodegeneration in the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Bates1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In mammals, HTT is expressed in many tissues and organs <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Strong1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Its subcellular localization is very dynamic and it has been found to colocalize with organelles such as the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and endosomes <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Imarisio1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. HTT is predicted to form an elongated superhelical solenoid structure due to a large number of HEAT motifs suggesting that it plays a scaffolding role for protein complex formation <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. More than 200 HTT interaction partners have been identified; these can be classified based on their function and include proteins that are involved in gene transcription, intracellular signalling, trafficking, endocytosis, and metabolism <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Harjes1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The process of mutant HTT self-aggregation is an early event in HD progression which may lead to the pathological features of HD. Insoluble polyQ aggregates, a hallmark of HD pathology, are detectable at the presymptomatic stage in HD <italic>post mortem</italic> brain <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Gutekunst1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and can be found in both the brain as well as in many non-central nervous system tissues in HD mouse models <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Sathasivam1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Moffitt1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. There is growing evidence to indicate that peripheral pathologies such as weight loss and skeletal muscle atrophy may not be a consequence of neurological dysfunction or neurodegeneration and might make a significant contribution to the disease presentation and progression <xref rid="pgen.1004550-vanderBurg1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Therefore it is important to identify the peripheral abnormalities that may contribute to disease progression and might present targets for new treatment strategies.</p><p>To date, our knowledge of heart pathology in HD is very limited. However, multiple epidemiological studies have shown that heart disease is the second cause of death in patients with HD and the following frequencies have been reported: 12.2% <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Sorensen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 19% <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Chiu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and 24.4% <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Lanska1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Moreover, clinical studies have revealed that HD patients have enhanced cardiovagal activity <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Andrich1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, reduced cortical and subcortical blood flow <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Hasselbalch1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and a reduced heart rate <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Melik1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. A further study showed a significant decrease in the parasympathetic heart rate variability values during &#x02018;head-up tilt&#x02019; indicating a decreased vagal modulation of heart rate in HD patients. These findings might suggest an over-stimulation of sympathetic activity and might be linked to an increased risk for syncopes and an increased overall cardiovascular risk <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Bar1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>The accumulation of intracellular pre-amyloid oligomers and higher assemblies has been observed in a number of human heart failure samples of various etiologies <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Sanbe1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In a model of desmin-related cardiomyopathy produced by the cardiomyocyte-specific transgene expression of mutant &#x003b1;B-crystallin (CryAB<sup>R120G</sup>), aggregates were observed within cardiomyocytes leading to altered cardiomyocyte functions, perturbations in mitochondrial-sarcomere architecture, and deficits in mitochondrial function, which resulted in apoptosis and heart failure <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Maloyan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Moreover, a pro-amyloid potency of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is often linked to isolated atrial amyloidosis and is presumed to be associated with congestive heart failure <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Millucci1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Recently, an artificial transgenic mouse model expressing either a mutant polyQ peptide of 83 glutamines (PQ83) or a control peptide of 19 glutamines (PQ19) under the control of the &#x003b1;-myosin heavy chain promoter (MyHC) to drive cardiomyocyte-specific expression has been reported <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Pattison1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. PQ83 hearts developed cardiac dysfunction and dilation with a concomitant increase in the formation of insoluble aggregates in cardiomyocytes, and the mice invariably died before reaching eight months of age. The PQ83-induced heart failure was due to cardiomyocyte loss and, although apoptotic indices were unchanged in the PQ83 hearts, ultrastructural analysis revealed increased autophagic and lysosomal content indicative of increased autophagy. PQ83 hearts also showed evidence of necrotic death including inflammatory cell content and sarcolemmal permeability <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Pattison1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In this study, we have investigated the molecular and pathological features of the cardiac dysfunction that develops with disease progression in mouse models of HD and found that this occurs in the absence of mutant HTT deposits in the heart.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To test the hypothesis that mutant HTT leads to heart failure through compensatory remodelling as a consequence of cellular dysfunction, we used two well-established HD mouse models. R6/2 mice are transgenic for a mutated N-terminal exon 1 HTT fragment <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Mangiarini1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, while the <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 mice have an expanded CAG repeat knocked-in to the mouse huntingtin gene (<italic>Htt</italic>) <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Woodman1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, which is partially mis-spliced with the result that these mice express mutant versions of both an exon 1 HTT and a full length HTT protein <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Sathasivam2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. For R6/2 mice, we studied cardiac function at all stages of disease: presymptomatic (4 weeks), symptomatic (8 weeks and 12 weeks) and end-stage (15 weeks). <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 homozygotes were compared to wild type (WT) at 8 months of age (presymptomatic) and 22 months (end-stage disease).</p><p>We began by quantifying the change in heart weight with disease progression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004550.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). Given that both mouse models exhibit a decrease in body weight with disease progression, we opted to normalise heart weight to tibia length, a parameter that remains relatively constant between WT and HD mice during the course of disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004550.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). There was a significant increase in the heart weight to tibia index at 4 weeks of age in R6/2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004550-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) which reverted to a reduction by 15 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004550-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). In contrast the <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 knock-in model showed an elevation of heart weight to tibia index at both 8 and 22 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004550-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). It has previously been reported that symptomatic R6/2 mice have abnormal cardiac function as measured by MRI at 12 weeks of age <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Therefore, we employed cardiac MRI to evaluate and compare the morphology and function of hearts from 22 month old <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 mice. We found that the stroke volume (SV) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) were significantly decreased, whereas the left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) showed a decremental trend which was not statistically significant. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004550-g001">Fig. 1B and C</xref>). Consequently, cardiac output (CO) was also reduced, while ejection fraction (EF), due to its mathematical dependency on LVEDV and SV, remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004550-g001">Fig. 1B and C</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-1004550-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004550.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Morphometric and MRI analysis of HD mouse model hearts.</title><p>(A) Heart weight to tibia length index (B) Comparison of the left ventricle end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricle end-systolic volume (LVESV), ejection fraction (EF) cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) between WT and <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 mice at 22 months of age.

We performed a longitudinal study in the R6/2 mouse model from 6 weeks of age (presymptomatic) to 12 weeks (symptomatic), whereas ECG parameters were only measured at 22 months of age for the <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 mouse model. Heart rate was found to be significantly reduced at 10 weeks of age in R6/2 mice and at end stage disease in <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004550-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) which might suggest that symptomatic HD mice develop a moderate type of bradyarrhythmia that could progress to a cardiac arrest. The most common cause of bradyarrhythmia is heart block, detected through the elongation of the PR interval duration. However, surprisingly, the PR intervals were not significantly elongated in either HD model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004550-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), although we did notice significantly elongated RR intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004550-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Also, we did not detect a progressive heart block manifesting in skipped beats with vanishing RR intervals. However, we did detect a significant elongation of PQ intervals in the <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 while only trend towards elongation in R6/2 mice was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004550-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Finally, we did not find any significant elongation of the time of ventricular depolarisation based on increased QRS intervals in either HD model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004550-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). In contrast, the QT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004550-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>), ST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004550-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>) and QTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004550-g002">Fig. 2H</xref>) intervals were already significantly elongated in the R6/2 mice by 10 weeks of age as well as in the end stage <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 mice, which might be indicative of a long QT syndrome.

Although the heart mass was increased at the end stage in <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 mice, this was not true for R6/2 mice, which could be either explained by a self limitation of the mutant HTT effects themselves or by activation of compensatory hypertrophic pathways. The magnitude of these physiological changes was accompanied in both HD models by reactivation of a foetal gene programme, including the up-regulation of <italic>Anp</italic>, <italic>Bnp</italic>, <italic>Fhl1</italic> and <italic>Fhl2</italic> and a reduction in the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;- isoforms of the myosin heavy chain, all typical markers of an induced cardiomyopathy. Although, a similar type of cardiomyopathy accompanied with muscle wasting was observed when FOXO3 was over-expressed <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Schips1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, our RNAseq data suggested that the level of <italic>Foxo3</italic> was not increased in the HD murine hearts.</p><p>At the pathological level, the HD-related cardiomyopathy was accompanied by a moderate degree of interstitial fibrosis in both HD mouse models. We also found that <italic>S100a4</italic> transcripts (a marker for fibrosis on several organs) were significantly elevated in both R6/2 and <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 mice. Interestingly, <italic>S100a4</italic> mRNA has been up-regulated in the hypertrophic myocardium of the Dahl-rat hypertensive heart disease model and further activated during the transition to heart failure <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Tamaki1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Therefore, its' up-regulation might be indicative of hypertrophic stimuli in the hearts of both HD mouse models. Deposits of fibrotic tissues are a consequence of cardiomyocyte death and we found that cardiomyocyte loss is likely due to increased apoptosis in both HD mouse models, which was apparent as early as 4 weeks of age in R6/2 mice. It should be noted that these findings are in contrast to the artificial cardiac specific polyQ&#x02013;overexpression model <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Pattison1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, in which cardiomyocyte death was found to be caused by necrosis.</p><p>It is well established that psychiatric and neurological diseases are positively linked to cardiovascular disease and that CNS abnormalities have a great impact on the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Pereira1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. In this study, we found that cardiac arrhythmias and pathology are features of HD mouse models. ECG telemetry in conscious mice showed that both symptomatic R6/2 and <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 mice suffer from bradyarrhythmia. The reduction in heart rate and alterations in other ECG intervals were indicative of cardiac contractile abnormalities and were comparable to the previous findings in the spinal muscular atrophy mouse model <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Heier1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Although there have been only a limited number of studies performed in HD patients, these were consistent with the HD mouse models in that relative heart rate was 10% lower in pre-symptomatic and early-symptomatic patients than in control subjects, likely due to a 10.6% lower diastolic pressure in early-symptomatic patients <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Kobal1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Similar findings were published recently for the R6/1 mouse model of HD, which had unstable RR intervals that were reversed following atropine treatment, suggesting parasympathetic nervous activation. The mice developed brady- and tachyarrhythmias, including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and cardiac sudden death <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Kiriazis1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. However, in contrast to our data, R6/1 mice had a higher heart rate than WT littermates in young but not older R6/1 mice <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Kiriazis1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p><p>The cardiac contractile dysfunction might be explained by the Cx43 dislocation from the end plate towards the lateral membrane, and we show for the first time, that this can be observed as early as 4 weeks of age in the R6/2 mice and 8 months of age in <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 mice, while its protein levels remained unchanged. The ventricular myocytes are extensively coupled by gap junctions to meet physiological demands. In general, many heart diseases caused by different aetiologies are associated with changes in the expression of connexins or their remodelling. Thus, alterations in the structure or function of gap junctions have been linked to conduction disturbances and arrhythmogenesis in many heart diseases <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Saffitz1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1004550-Dupont1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Moreover, the altered architecture of ganglionic plexuses based on immunohistochemical labelling with tyrosine hydroxylase and lower levels of <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA in HD murine hearts might also significantly contribute to contractile dysfunction in HD mouse models. These changes are likely to be driven by profound autonomic nervous dysfunction associated with widespread pathology of the central nervous system in HD.</p><p>In the brains of the R6/2 and <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 mouse models, the accumulation of toxic mutant HTT aggregates <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Woodman1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Li3" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> and transcriptional dysregulation <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Cha1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> are early pathogenic events. To our surprise, and although we have been able to detect HTT aggregates in many peripheral tissues in both of these models <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Sathasivam1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Moffitt1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Sathasivam3" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, we were not able to detect mutant HTT aggregates in the heart lysates in either model by the sensitive seprion ligand ELISA <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Sathasivam3" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Similarly, we failed to identify aggregates by immunohistochemistry in murine HD hearts using a broad spectrum of specific antibodies. These results are in stark contrast to the pathological deposition of polyQ aggregates that occurred in the model in which a polyQ peptide was overexpressed in cardiac tissue <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Pattison1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Consistent with the absence of aggregated HTT in nuclei, we were unable to identify a HD-specific signature of transcriptional dysregulation by RNAseq analysis.</p><p>In summary, mutant HTT results in the rapid development of pathological features that would be expected to lead to cardiac contractile dysfunction e.g. gap junction and ganglionic plexus remodelling and lower levels of <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA. In addition HD mouse models develop severe cardiac systolic and diastolic impairments likely due to ongoing cardiac remodelling represented by the re-expression of foetal genes and cardiomyocyte loss accompanied by a moderate level of interstitial fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004550-g012">Fig. 12</xref>). The increased heart rate variability, together with ganglionic plexus remodelling and the previously published pathological features in relevant brain regions in both mouse models <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Woodman1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Kiriazis1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> would be consistent with a cardiac autonomic dysfunction. In HD patient brains, a recent meta-analysis of morphometric MRI found degenerative changes in the amygdala and insular cortex, even in the prodromal form on the disease <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Dogan1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Therefore, we postulate that HD related cardiomyopathy is likely driven indirectly by CNS dysfunction although it is not possible to rule out that intrinsic effects could contribute through a mechanism that has yet to be identified. At present it is not known whether cardiac dysfunction has clinical relevance for HD patients. There have been a number of functional studies, which have generally been performed on very small numbers of patients and have often been contradictory. Our finding, that cardiac dysfunction occurs in a genetically precise knock-in HD mouse model, suggests that there is an urgent need to perform well-designed unequivocal clinical studies to resolve this issue. It is important because of the potential liability for therapeutic intervention.</p><fig id="pgen-1004550-g012" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004550.g012</object-id><label>Figure 12</label><caption><title>Model depicting the mechanism by which mutant huntingtin causes cardiac dysfunction in murine HD hearts.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1004550.g012"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All experimental procedures performed on mice were conducted under a project licence from the Home Office and approved by the King's College London Ethical Review Process Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Mouse maintenance and breeding</title><p>Hemizygous R6/2 mice were bred by backcrossing R6/2 males to (CBA x C57BL/6) F1 females (B6CBAF1/OlaHsd, Harlan Olac, Bicester, UK). <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 homozygous mice on a (CBA x C57BL/6) F1 background were obtained by intercrossing <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 heterozygous CBA/Ca and C57BL/6J congenic lines as described previously <xref rid="pgen.1004550-Woodman1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.
