Inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAP) exert critical control on the terminal segment of apoptosis leading to apoptosis evasion. In this study, we uncover a unique role for BIRC3, as an IAP that is critical in GBM in response to therapy. Using the TCGA dataset of 524 unique samples, we identify BIRC3 is the only IAP whose differential expression is associated with long-term survival in GBM patients. Using patient tissue samples we further show that BIRC3 expression increases with recurrence. When extrapolated to a preclinical model of a human GBM cell line, we find an increase in BIRC3 expression in response to irradiation (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. More importantly, we mechanistically implicate STAT3 and PI3K signaling pathways as drivers of RT-induced up-regulation of BIRC3 expression. Lastly, we demonstrate that both <italic>in-vivo</italic> and <italic>in-vitro</italic> BIRC3 up-regulation results in apoptosis evasion and therapeutic resistance in GBM. Collectively, our study identifies a novel translational and targetable role for BIRC3 expression as a predictor of aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance to TMZ and RT mediated by STAT3 and PI3K signaling in GBM.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Therapeutic resistance is a hallmark of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) making disease recurrence inevitable. Despite advances in the multimodal strategies of surgical resection, radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy with Temozolomide (TMZ), the median survival for newly diagnosed patients hovers around 14 months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Moreover, the prognosis is markedly dismal for patients with recurrent GBM, where median survival of 3&#x02013;9 months with standard chemotherapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and 6-month progression-free survival rates of 15&#x02013;16%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> are often realized. Evasion from apoptosis is central to cancers in general<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, and GBM is no exception. Genome-wide analysis of GBM reveals pervasive aberrations in multiple apoptotic pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. For instance several critical anti-apoptotic signaling pathways such as the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGFR), Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase [PI3K], and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT3) are highly activated in GBM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Furthermore, aberrancies of the anti-apoptosis BCL-2 family<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, mutations in apoptosis-related tumor suppressor proteins such as TP53<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, and increase expression of Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> collectively skew the apoptotic balance in GBM towards cell survival mechanisms, which all lead to therapeutic failure. Given the central role of anti-apoptosis signaling, strategies that define and target anti-apoptosis mechanisms could potentially ameliorate therapeutic resistance in GBM.</p><p>IAPs are characterized by the presence of baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, highly up-regulated in GBMs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, and known to promote cellular survival in cancers through regulation of apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Therefore, IAPs are emerging as attractive pharmacologic targets for ameliorating therapeutic resistance in cancers. Besides cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, IAPs also play a role in immunity and inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The human IAP family is composed of eight members: Neuronal IAP (NAIP), cellular IAP1 (c-IAP1) [BIRC2], cellular IAP2 (c-IAP2) [BIRC3], X-chromosome linked IAP (XIAP) [BIRC4], survivin [BIRC5], Apollon/Bruce [BIRC6)], Melanoma IAP (ML-IAP), and IAP-like Protein 2 (ILP-2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Only BIRC2, BIRC3, and BIRC4 regulate caspase activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. BIRC4 directly inhibits caspases 3,7 and 9<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, whereas the BIRC2 and BIRC3 proteins indirectly regulate caspase activation through E3 ligase activity, TNF-signaling and NFkB signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>The central role of IAPs within the terminal segment of apoptosis has profound therapeutic and prognostic implications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Since IAPs interact at the level of caspases, IAPs could serve as the definitive convergence point for signaling pathways that promote apoptosis evasion. Therefore, identifying and targeting critical IAPs that contribute to apoptotic evasion in GBM is a very rationale strategy. Higher expressions of IAP&#x02019;s have been documented in malignant gliomas and often correlated with poor prognosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. There is also preclinical evidence that targeting IAPs with small molecule inhibitors can reverse therapeutic resistance in GBM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. However, no studies to date have characterized the mechanistic impact of IAPs on therapeutic resistance and also on long-term survival in GBM. We therefore sought to understand the role of IAP expression on survival in a large cohort of GBM patients. We were interested in the role of IAP in the current standard GBM therapy of TMZ and RT. Detailed understanding of such mechanisms could permit optimized synergy between IAP targeting and standard therapy. Such a targeting strategy of downstream convergence signaling nodes could potentially overcome the current shortcomings of targeted GBM therapies that focus on upstream pathways.</p><p>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides a unique opportunity to examine GBM on a larger scale both clinically and molecularly since TCGA contains expression data from over 527 unique GBM samples<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Using TCGA data in this study, we identified BIRC3 as a critical determinant of survival in GBM patients. BIRC3 was the only IAP among several IAPs whose differential expression was significantly related to the 5-year survival in patients with GBM. Lower expression levels of BIRC3 were associated with a markedly favorable outcome. Given the above observations, we sought to further delineate the unique mechanistic role of BIRC3 in GBM therapeutic resistance in this study. For the first time, we demonstrate that BIRC3 expression increases secondary to acquisition of TMZ and RT resistance. In addition, BIRC3 emerges as a novel driver of therapeutic resistance in GBM. Furthermore, for the first time, we mechanistically implicate BIRC expression as a downstream signaling node for STAT3 and PI3K in response to GBM therapy. BIRC3 therefore emerges as a rational target with translational implications.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mice</title><p>6&#x02013;8 weeks female NCRNU athymic mice were ordered from Taconic Biosciences.

This dataset has both molecular and clinical information. When we examined the association of IAP expression on overall survival (OS) of GBM, BIRC3 was the only IAP whose differential expression was related to the 5-year OS in GBM. Patients with down-regulated expressions of BIRC3 demonstrated a statistically significantly enhanced OS compared to patients with higher BIRC3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) Of note, differential expressions of BIRC5 (survivin) and BIRC4 (XIAP) had no impact on 5-year OS in GBM patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b&#x02013;d</xref>) despite prior reports of a prognostic role based on tissue expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Thus, the TCGA data interrogation showed that BIRC3 is significantly associated with long-term OS of GBM patients (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). To validate this finding in an independent data set, we investigated the effect of BIRC3 expression using another public GBM dataset, GSE16011, with 153 unique GBM samples. In this dataset, both the probe sets for BIRC3 confirmed the finding in the TCGA dataset (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.025 &#x00026; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.022), (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2a</xref> - the result of only one probe set was shown here). Differential expressions of BIRC2, BIRC5 (survivin) and BIRC4 (XIAP) had no significant impact on OS in GBM patients in the GSE dataset as well using their respective probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2b&#x02013;d</xref>). We also compared BIRC3 gene expression in newly diagnosed versus recurrent GBMs using the TCGA. Since the TCGA microarray set has data consisting solely of newly diagnosed patients, we instead employed the RNAseq expression data set that contains recurrent GBMs. Although the number of recurrent GBMs in was much smaller, BIRC3 was expressed at significantly higher level (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0072, group- median difference =1.5&#x02009;log<sub>2</sub> units) in recurrent GBM patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) than that of newly diagnosed GBM patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;156), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>. This finding raised the possibility that prior GBM therapy might up-regulate BIRC3 expression.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>TMZ Resistance and RT Promote Up-regulation of BIRC3 Gene Expression in GBM</title><p>Given the prognostic impact of BIRC3 within the TCGA dataset, we sought to examine its expression and association with GBM therapy using patient GBM tissue samples. In order to do so, we examined BIRC3 gene expression levels by RT-PCR in a subset of patients treated with RT +/&#x02212; TMZ versus newly diagnosed non-treated GBM patients. Indeed, we observed a significantly higher expression of BIRC3 levels in previously treated GBMs patients compared to newly diagnosed GBM patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Thus, it appeared that BIRC3 expression increases with disease recurrence following standard GBM therapy.</p><p>To further determine the effects of GBM therapy (TMZ &#x00026; RT) on BIRC3 expression, we examined human GBM cells that were rendered resistant to TMZ through step-wise exposures with two fold increases in TMZ concentration as well as GBM cell lines exposed to RT (see Materials and Methods). When U87 human GBM cell lines were rendered resistant to TMZ, we noted significant increases in BIRC3 expression as confirmed by RT-PCR, which correlated with acquisition of TMZ resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). Next, in order to determine if RT treatment was also associated with BIRC3 expression up-regulation, we irradiated U87 GBM cells with 2&#x02013;8&#x02009;Gy. We noted a dose-dependent increase in BIRC3 expression with irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Next we performed Western-blot which confirmed an increase in BIRC3 protein levels following TMZ and irradiation treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that BIRC3 expression is induced as a consequence of standard GBM therapy and might serve as a prognostic marker for therapeutic resistance in GBM.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Pharmacologic Inhibition of PI3K Signaling Blocks RT-induced Up-regulation of BIRC3 Expression in GBM</title><p>Since BIRC3 expression increased in response to standard therapy for GBM (TMZ/RT), we wanted to determine if this process was driven by other established upstream molecular pathway surrogates for therapeutic resistance in GBM. PI3K is highly activated in GBM and plays a major role in therapeutic resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In addition, there is strong evidence that PI3K mediates apoptosis resistance in lung tumors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> and in endothelial cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> through up-regulation of BIRC3. We therefore hypothesized that inhibition of PI3K could attenuate RT-induced up-regulation of BIRC3 in GBM cells. Indeed, pretreatment of U87 human GBM cell lines with a PI3K pan-inhibitor, LY294002 prior to irradiation with 4&#x02009;Gy resulted in dose-dependent blockade of irradiation-induced up-regulation of BIRC3 (c-IAP2) expression by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). Western-blot confirmed reduction in BIRC3 and phospho-AKT protein levels when irradiated GBM cells were treated LY294002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). LY294002 is a pan-inhibitor of PI3K and therefore blocks all isoforms of PI3K.</p><p>To further characterize the role of PI3K, we evaluated several isoform-specific inhibitors. The alpha-isoform inhibitor, PIK-75, successfully attenuated irradiation-induced up-regulation of BIRC3 (c-IAP2) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). In contrast, inhibition of the beta-isoform with TGX 221, delta-isoform with IC87114, and gamma-isoform with AS605240 did not have any effect on irradiation-induced up-regulation of BIRC3 (c-IAP2) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d&#x02013;f</xref>). These results suggest that PI3K signaling during irradiation contributes to BIRC3 (c-IAP2) up-regulation, which is reversed with PI3K inhibition. More specifically, the alpha isoform of PI3K appears to mediate this phenomenon. Therefore, BIRC3 serves as a downstream convergence node to PI3K signaling in response to RT in GBM.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Inhibition of STAT3 Signaling Blocks RT-induced Up-regulation of BIRC3 Expression in GBM</title><p>STAT3 is another upstream signaling pathway that is implicated in therapeutic resistance in cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, and is highly activated in GBM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Furthermore, there is strong mechanistic evidence that STAT3 mediates apoptosis resistance in intestinal cells through transcriptional activation of BIRC3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. We therefore hypothesized that inhibition of STAT3 could attenuate RT-induced up-regulation of BIRC3. Using a selective STAT3 homodimerization inhibitor S3I-1757<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, we observed a dose-dependent blockade of irradiation-induced up-regulation of BIRC3 expression by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Similar observations were made using siRNA where pretreatment with STAT3 targeting siRNA significantly blocked irradiation-induced up-regulation of BIRC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). STAT3-targeting siRNA produced similar levels of inhibition as 200&#x02009;&#x003bc;M of S3I-1757. On the other hand, control non-targeting siRNA had no significant effect on irradiation-induced up-regulation of BIRC3. Western blot for phospo-STAT3 confirmed decreased activation of STAT3 with inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). These results suggest that STAT3 signaling during irradiation contributes to BIRC3 up-regulation, which is reversed with STAT3 inhibition. Therefore, BIRC3 serves as a downstream convergence node to STAT3 signaling in response to RT in GBM.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>BIRC3 Expression Contributes to TMZ and RT Resistance in U251 Human GBM Cell Lines</title><p>In an effort to further understand the BIRC3 phenotype and its effects on TMZ and RT treatment sensitivity, we generated U251 human GBM (U251 HG) cells with stable over-expression of BIRC3 confirmed by Western Blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). We then examined the relative cell viability as well as colony formation following either TMZ treatment or irradiation. When compared to control U251 HG cells, the BIRC3 over-expression U251 HG cells significantly enhanced viability to TMZ concentrations from 200&#x02009;&#x003bc;M to 800&#x02009;&#x003bc;M with more than 60% viability when compared to parental U251 HG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Caspase cleavage was markedly diminished in BIRC3 over-expressing U251 HG cells, suggesting less apoptosis activity compared to control U251 in response to TMZ exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). A similar trend was noted with colony formation where a statistically significant fraction of BIRC3 over-expressing U251 HG cells demonstrated an enhanced ability to form colonies compared to control U251 cells when exposed to either TMZ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), or RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009; 0.05). Interestingly, when both control U251 and BIRC3 over-expressing U251 HG cells were pretreated with a P1(3)K-alpha inhibitor (PIK-75) prior to exposure to varying concentrations of TMZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) or RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>; P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), there was a significant inhibition of colony formation even for the over-expression construct. This was somewhat surprising since that would imply that PIK-75 inhibited exogenous BIRC3 as well. PIK-75 effect was not pronounced in the absence of BIRC3 over expression probably due to very low levels of endogenous BIRC3 in U251 HG cells at baseline. It is therefore likely that PI3K blockade might oversensitive GBM cells in the presence of BIRC3 up-regulation. Taken together, the TMZ and RT data suggest that the BIRC3 phenotype contributes to therapeutic resistance in human GBM cells. Furthermore, PI3K-alpha inhibition can block BIRC3-mediated therapeutic resistance to RT and TMZ treatment in GBM.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>BIRC3 expression inhibits apoptosis in TMZ-treated human xenografts</title><p>In an effort to ascertain if our <italic>in vitro</italic> data on BIRC3 phenotype had any <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance, we established subcutaneous xenograft tumor models of both control U251 and BIRC3 over-expression U251 HG cells. For all animals, we implanted the control U251 HG cells in the right flank while the BIRC3 over-expression U251 HG cells were implanted in the left flank. Animals were treated daily with oral TMZ at 50&#x02009;mg/kg BW for 5 days after 2 weeks of tumor implantation and then subjected to non-invasive <italic>in vivo</italic> apoptosis imaging for detection of caspase-mediated apoptosis as measured by fluorescence. In response to TMZ treatment, we noted a significant resistance to caspase-mediated apoptosis in BIRC3 over-expression U251 HG cells compared to control U251 HG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a&#x02013;c</xref>). This finding suggests that BIRC3 over-expression suppresses caspase activation in GBM. We further examined xenograft tissue by immunohistochemistry for caspase 3 staining. Immunohistochemistry results corroborated our <italic>in vivo</italic> apoptosis fluorescence imaging findings. We noted a marked decrease in caspase 3 activation and necrosis in BIRC3-overexpressing U251 GBM xenografts in response to TMZ treatment compared to wild-type U251 GBM xenografts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a&#x02013;d</xref>). When wild-type U251 GBM xenografts were treated with TMZ, we observed large central areas of necrosis with marked increased in caspase 3 staining of cells adjacent to the necrosis/cell death zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,c</xref>). On the contrary, we did not observe any distinct regions of central necrosis with associated caspase activation, when BIRC3-overexpressing U251 GBM xenografts were treated with TMZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b,d</xref>). These tissue IHC results confirm a potential role of BIRC3 expression in TMZ apoptosis resistance in GBM. However, when we examined tumor growth over our 5-day course treatment with TMZ, we did not observe any significant statistical difference in tumor size between control U251 GBM xenografts and BIRC3-overexpressing U251 GBM xenografts. It could relate to the fact that apoptosis and proliferation are distinct pathways and BIRC3 is predominantly within the apoptosis pathway. In addition, xenografts were sacrificed after the 5<sup>th</sup> TMZ which is a short treatment course. Collectively, our <italic>in-vivo</italic> fluorescence and IHC data suggest that BIRC3 drives apoptosis evasion in GBM.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>TMZ treatment and RT are the currently established standard of care paradigm for every newly diagnosed GBM patient pending no contraindications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. However, the combination of TMZ treatment and RT for GBM has significant limitations with respect to durable clinical response. Hence recurrence is always a rule for the disease. Most recently, several molecular predicators of favorable treatment response have been identified for high-grade gliomas. The most notable include 1p19q co-deletional status<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, IDH1 mutation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Tumors with 1p19q co-deletional status demonstrate favorable response to RT/TMZ and even for TMZ monotherapy. The absence of the MGMT promoter methylation in GBM is an established surrogate for TMZ resistance. In the absence of promoter methylation, MGMT enzyme transcription is uninterrupted thereby resulting in repair of TMZ-induced DNA alkylating events. Nonetheless, even patients with positive MGMT methylation status will invariably fail TMZ treatment, suggesting that there are potentially alternate mechanisms for TMZ drug resistance independent of methylation status.</p><p>In the present study, we focused on downstream apoptosis evasion substrates with special emphasis on IAPs. We have identified a novel mechanism of TMZ drug resistance resulting in apoptosis evasion in GBM. In particular, we identified BIRC3 - an IAP - as a robust prognosticating surrogate for TMZ and RT treatment resistance in GBM as noted with patient samples. Our work for the first time shows that TMZ and RT treatment induce BIRC3 gene expression up-regulation. This resulting up-regulation of BIRC3 confers onto human GBM cells as well as human GBM xenografts an apoptotic evasion phenotype. We further present new evidence that PI3K and STAT3 signaling contribute to up-regulation of BIRC3 gene up-regulation in GBM in response to RT. BIRC3 therefore emerges as a convergence point of apoptosis evasion in GBM mediated by the afore-mentioned pathways. More importantly, BIRC3 affords both prognostic as well therapeutic translational potential for GBM patients. Our findings therefore have several significant implications.</p><p>Primarily, the large TCGA data set provided an opportunity to fully assess the impact of several previously studied IAPs on the 5-year survival of GBM patients. BIRC3 was the only IAP that emerged as a statistically significant bona fide prognosticator in terms of differential expression. Patients with lower-folds expression of BIRC3 had a significantly improved overall 5-year survival compared to those with higher-fold expression. These findings were further validated using the GSE011 public dataset of 153 unique GBM samples with survival data. On the other hand, differential expression of Survivin (BIRC5) and XIAP (BIRC4) did not influence survival in GBM patients in the TCGA dataset. Survivin or XIAP resulted in an unfavorable outcome irrespective of differential expression folds. This is partly consistent with previous studies reporting expression of Survivin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and XIAP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> in gliomas, which inversely correlated with an unfavorable outcome. However, the key implication of our findings is that BIRC3 is the only IAP whereby lower-folds expression could have a positive impact on long-term outcomes in GBM patients. Therefore, strategies that lead to down-regulation of BIRC3 expression or block BIRC3 activity could have a significant impact in the treatment of GBM in terms of durable response.</p><p>Secondly, the current standard therapy of TMZ treatment and RT for GBM results in up-regulation of BIRC3 as we have demonstrated herein. This phenomenon occurs almost immediately upon initiation of therapy, which suggests concurrent BIRC3-specific inhibition could be exploited for enhanced benefit. When GBM cells are rendered resistant to TMZ, there is marked up-regulation of BIRC3 expression. This is in agreement with a recent study, which showed that Survivin (BIRC5) expression was significantly increased in recurrent GBM compared with newly diagnosed tumors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Similarly when GBM cells are genetically modified to over-express BIRC3, there is marked resistance to TMZ treatment thereby establishing an effect and causality relationship. This observation represents a novel alternate mechanism of TMZ drug resistance in GBM. With respect to radiotherapy, BIRC3 up-regulation effect was noted for even doses as lower as 2&#x02009;Gy. Previous studies combining either an XIAP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> or a pan-IAP inhibitor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> with <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> irradiation resulted in enhanced sensitization to irradiation. Irradiation appears to modulate XIAP (BIRC4) protein levels through MDM2 expressions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Hence in response to irradiation, MDM2 up-regulation results in translation increases in XIAP protein levels. Furthermore, there is recent evidence that XIAP is a potential stabilizer of BIRC3 in GBM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Taken together, it would appear that RT treatment results in synergistic up-regulation and stabilization of BIRC3 expression. Our study uniquely characterizes the impact of TMZ and RT treatment on BIRC3 expression. Further studies are warranted to provide a better understanding of the temporal modulation of BIRC3 expression in response to TMZ and RT treatment. Such information could allow for optimized synergistic targeting of BIRC concurrent with the administration of TMZ and RT.</p><p>Thirdly, our studies have uncovered a new association between PI3K and STAT3 signaling with induction of BIRC3 up-regulation secondary to RT in GBM. Since PI3K and STAT3 are upstream to BIRC3, it is highly likely that apoptotic evasion signaling from either pathways converge on BIRC3. Furthermore, there is strong evidence in the literature that BIRC3 interacts with the tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)/Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NFkB) signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. In GBMs, there is mechanistic evidence that the p65 component of NFkB transcriptionally contributes to up-regulation of BIRC3 expression in the presence of TNF-alpha ligand<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Hence BIRC3 appears to be a central point of therapeutic resistance in GBM. Interestingly, no studies to date have thoroughly examined mechanisms by which either PI3K or STAT3 pathways could result in BIRC3 up-regulation in GBM. We have demonstrated in the present study that blocking either STAT3 or PI3K pharmacological or genetically is sufficient to attenuate RT-induced up-regulation of BIRC3. We further demonstrate that PI3K effects are mediated mainly via its alpha-isoform and also that inhibition of this isoform is synergistic. The major implication here is that BIRC3 targeting could circumvent some of the current limitations with single-pathway targeting in GBM. Since BIRC3 is emerging as a convergence signaling point for apoptosis evasion, the limitations of pathway redundancies could be less of a problem. It is unclear if both PI3K and STAT3 pathways up-regulate BIRC3 expression independently or interdependently in GBM. However, there is recent evidence from proteomics analysis that PI3K and STAT3 pathways behave in interdependent manner in GBM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Further studies are necessary to fully understand the molecular underpinnings of PI3K or STAT3 pathways signaling with respect to BIRC3. We have hereby established a new signaling node for BIRC3 in GBM as a convergence node for apoptosis evasion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, the BIRC3 phenotype results in a GBM that is refractory to highly cytotoxic TMZ and RT doses. In that regard, BIRC3 serves as a marker of aggressiveness in patient samples. More importantly it is a very translational target for synergy with cytotoxic GBM therapy. Smac mimetic non-specific inhibitors of BIRC proteins have been successfully employed in conjunction with cytotoxic strategies to promote therapeutic response in GBM cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Since therapeutic resistance remains the main major obstacle for GBM, our studies provide clinical rationale for designing small molecules as well as genetic strategies that selectively inhibit BIRC3.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Wang, D. <italic>et al.</italic> BIRC3 is a novel driver of therapeutic resistance in Glioblastoma. <italic>Sci.
