Despite decades of research, little is understood about why <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> is so virulent. Bacterial outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are involved in various virulence processes, including protein secretion, host cell attachment, and intracellular survival. Many pathogenic bacteria require metals for intracellular survival and OMPs often play important roles in metal uptake. Previous studies identified three <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> OMPs that play roles in iron acquisition. In this study, we examined two previously uncharacterized proteins, FTT0267 (named <italic>fmvA</italic>, for <underline><italic>F</italic></underline><italic>rancisella</italic>
<underline>m</underline>etal and <underline>v</underline>irulence) and FTT0602c (<italic>fmvB</italic>), which are homologs of the previously studied <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> iron acquisition genes and are predicted OMPs. To study the potential roles of FmvA and FmvB in metal acquisition and virulence, we first examined <italic>fmvA</italic> and f<italic>mvB</italic> expression following pulmonary infection of mice, finding that <italic>fmvB</italic> was upregulated up to 5-fold during <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> infection of mice. Despite sequence homology to previously-characterized iron-acquisition genes, FmvA and FmvB do not appear to be involved iron uptake, as neither <italic>fmvA</italic> nor <italic>fmvB</italic> were upregulated in iron-limiting media and neither &#x00394;<italic>fmvA</italic> nor &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> exhibited growth defects in iron limitation. However, when other metals were examined in this study, magnesium-limitation significantly induced <italic>fmvB</italic> expression, &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> was found to express significantly higher levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in magnesium-limiting medium, and increased numbers of surface protrusions were observed on &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> in magnesium-limiting medium, compared to wild-type <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> grown in magnesium-limiting medium. RNA sequencing analysis of &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> revealed the potential mechanism for increased LPS expression, as LPS synthesis genes <italic>kdtA</italic> and <italic>wbtA</italic> were significantly upregulated in &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic>, compared with wild-type <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic>. To provide further evidence for the potential role of FmvB in magnesium uptake, we demonstrated that FmvB was outer membrane-localized. Finally, &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> was found to be attenuated in mice and cytokine analyses revealed that &#x00394;<italic>fmvB-</italic>infected mice produced lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-10, compared with mice infected with wild-type <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic>. Taken together, although the function of FmvA remains unknown, FmvB appears to play a role in magnesium uptake and <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> virulence. These results may provide new insights into the importance of magnesium for intracellular pathogens.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI093351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huntley</surname><given-names>Jason F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grant R01 AI093351 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the National Institutes of Health (NIAID-NIH) to J.F.H.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="36"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> is an intracellular Gram-negative bacterium and the etiological agent of lethal disease tularemia. <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> is a zoonotic pathogen that can be transmitted from infected animals to humans via multiple routes (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. skin contact, ingestion, inhalation of aerosols) and tick transmission has been well-documented [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> has three subspecies: <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> subsp. <italic>tularensis</italic>, <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> subsp. <italic>holarctica</italic>, and <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> subsp. <italic>mediasiatica</italic>. Of these, only subsp. <italic>tularensis</italic> and subsp. <italic>holarctica</italic> cause human disease [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Subspecies <italic>tularensis</italic>, also known as Type A, is the most virulent and is found exclusively in North America [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Type A strains are extremely infectious, with fewer than 25 organisms capable of causing severe disease and death in humans [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> subsp. <italic>holarctica</italic>, also known as Type B, causes similar clinical disease in humans but has a higher infectious dose (&#x0003c;10<sup>3</sup> CFU) and lower mortality rates than Type A strains [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> has been classified as a Tier 1 Select Agent, indicating that it poses a severe threat to human and animal health and has the greatest risk of being developed into a bioweapon [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although an attenuated Type B strain was developed and tested as a potential live vaccine strain (LVS), it is not FDA-approved due to safety and efficacy concerns [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, studies to identify <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> virulence factors and develop safe and effective vaccines are urgently needed. Given that <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> can infect a wide variety of cell types [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> also can serve as a model pathogen to help understand bacterial virulence and intracellular survival strategies for other pathogens.</p><p>Acquisition of metals is important for pathogenic bacteria to survive inside the host [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Cations are coenzymes for many bacterial metabolic processes, are required to maintain bacterial membrane integrity, and protect against damage from molecules such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To protect against bacterial infections, the host is a metal-limiting environment [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For example, host iron is primarily sequestered in transferrin (TF), lactoferrin (LF), ferritin, and heme [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) iron is the predominant and most stable form of iron, but its solubility is extremely low at pH 7 (10<sup>&#x02212;17</sup> M), while bacteria generally need 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M Fe<sup>3+</sup> to achieve optimal growth [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Many pathogenic bacteria possess multiple mechanisms to import metals from the host during infection. Bacterial metal transporters typically have low affinity and specificity and thus are constitutively expressed to import a variety of metals [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For example, the Trk K<sup>+</sup> transporter in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> has low affinity and is constitutively expressed. Bacteria also express high-affinity metal transporters which are inducible and only activated during metal scarcity. The Kdp K<sup>+</sup> transporter in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> is an inducible and high-affinity ATP-dependent transporter [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Finally, many pathogenic bacteria encode siderophores which facilitate uptake of iron inside the host, which has been demonstrated to be an iron-limiting environment [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> genome contains 5 homologous genes, FTT0025c, FTT0267, FTT0602c, FTT0918, and FTT0919, that share 40&#x02013;50% sequence identity [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Of these, FTT0025c (FslE) and FTT0918 (FupA) have been shown to be involved in iron acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, despite a high degree of homology between the genomes of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> Type A and Type B strains, their iron acquisition systems appear to function distinctly. For example, in the Type A strain SchuS4, FTT0025c (FslE) is required for siderophore-dependent ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) iron uptake [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and FTT0918 (FupA) is required for ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) iron uptake [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In contrast, in the Type B strain LVS, the FupAB protein (FTL0439; the result of a recombination event between <italic>fupA</italic> and <italic>fupB</italic> that has been correlated with LVS attenuation [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]) is required for siderophore-dependent Fe<sup>3+</sup> and siderophore-independent Fe<sup>2+</sup> uptake [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Studies in macrophages and mice have demonstrated that SchuS4 FTT0918 (FupA) and LVS FTL0439 (FupAB) play important roles in virulence [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but deletion of SchuS4 FTT0919 (FupB) does not seem to affect iron acquisition or virulence [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Despite these previous studies, no work has been performed to characterize the roles of FTT0267 and FTT0602 in iron acquisition or virulence.</p><p>Based on sequence homology to FslE, FupA, and FupB, we hypothesized that FTT0267 (designated herein as FmvA, for <underline><italic>F</italic></underline><italic>rancisella</italic>
<underline>m</underline>etal and <underline>v</underline>irulence gene <underline>A</underline>) and FTT0602 (designated herein as FmvB) may be involved in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> metal uptake and virulence. In this study, we demonstrated that both <italic>fmvA</italic> and <italic>fmvB</italic> were upregulated during <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> SchuS4 infections of mice, indicating that these genes may play important roles in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> virulence. However, neither <italic>fmvA</italic> nor <italic>fmvB</italic> were upregulated in iron-limiting medium and &#x00394;<italic>fmvA</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> did not exhibit growth defects when grown in iron-limiting medium, indicating that FmvA and FmvB do not play roles in iron acquisition. Interestingly, careful examination of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> growth in the absence of other cations revealed that <italic>fmvB</italic> was significantly upregulated in magnesium limitation, suggesting that FmvB might be involved in magnesium uptake. Further, bioinformatic prediction programs indicated that FmvB likely forms a beta barrel in the outer membrane and <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> membrane localization studies confirmed that FmvB is outer membrane-localized. Because of the known importance of magnesium to neutralize LPS negative charges in the outer membrane, we next examined LPS expression in <italic>&#x00394;fmvB</italic>, finding that <italic>&#x00394;fmvB</italic> expressed 50% more LPS than wild-type <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic>. Finally, we found that &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> was significantly attenuated in a mouse pulmonary infection model.

Splicing-overlap extension (SOE) PCR was used to fuse together the three PCR amplicons in the following order: upstream flanking region, FRT-Pfn-<italic>kan</italic>-FRT, downstream flanking region. The resulting amplicon and suicide plasmid pTP163 [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] were digested with <italic>Apa</italic>I (New England Biolabs) and then ligated together using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). The resulting gene deletion (knockout) constructs were sequence-verified to ensure that no mutations had been introduced into either the upstream or downstream flanking regions. Knockout constructs were transformed into <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> S17.1 and conjugation was performed with <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> LVS on sMHA plates without antibiotics. The transconjugants initially were recovered on modified chocolate agar (CHOC) supplemented with 200 mg/L hygromycin (hyg) and 100 mg/L polymyxin B (pxb). CHOC was prepared by mixing Mueller-Hinton medium with 1% (wt/vol) tryptone, 0.5% (wt/vol) NaCl, and 1.6% (wt/vol) agar. After autoclave sterilization, the solution was cooled to 50&#x000b0;C and further supplemented with 1% (wt/vol) bovine hemoglobin (Neogen) and 1% (vol/vol) IsoVitaleX. Colonies from CHOC-hyg-pxb plates were then passaged on sMHA supplemented with 10 mg/L kanamycin (kan) to select for colonies that integrated the pTP163 suicide plasmid (including the kan resistance cassette) and subsequently passaged on sMHA supplemented with 10 mg/L kan and 8% (wt/vol) sucrose to select for clones that released the knockout construct containing both the target gene and the <italic>sacB</italic> sucrose sensitivity marker. Finally, sucrose- and kan- resistant colonies were replica plated onto sMHA containing either 200 mg/L hyg or 10 mg/L kan to confirm kan resistance (loss of gene of interest) and hyg sensitivity (loss of pTP163 suicide plasmid).

Using TMBB-Hunt, FmvA had a beta barrel score of 10.63 and FmvB had a beta barrel score of 7.45, indicating that both proteins are likely beta barrels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160977.t001">Table 1</xref>). Finally, in conjunction with the above noted beta barrel predictions, FmvA and FmvB beta barrel topologies were modeled using the PRED-TMBB program and visualized by TMRPres2D (Fig A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160977.s001">S1 File</xref>). PRED-TMBB modeling indicated that FmvA contains 16 beta strands and 8 extracellular loops, including 3 loops which are &#x0003e; 20 amino acids in length. In contrast, PRED-TMBB modeling indicated that FmvB contains 21 beta strands and 10 extracellular loops, including 6 loops which are &#x0003e; 20 amino acids in length. The large extracellular loops in both FmvA and FmvB (Fig A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160977.s001">S1 File</xref>) indicate that these proteins may play a role in transport processes, as outer membrane transport proteins in other bacteria are known to contain large extracellular loops [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Three-dimensional structural predictions of FmvA and FmvB were generated using TMBpro (Fig A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160977.s001">S1 File</xref>). For FmvA, 8 beta strands were predicted and for FmvB 9 beta strands were predicted. However, for both proteins, TMBpro predicted long N-terminal unstructured regions (Fig A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160977.s001">S1 File</xref>) that likely contributed to fewer predicted beta strands than were predicted by either PROFtmb or PRED-TMBB. Taken together, 6 out of 7 bioinformatics programs indicated that FmvA is a beta barrel protein and 6 out of 7 bioinformatics programs indicated that FmvB is an outer membrane-localized beta barrel protein.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0160977.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0160977.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>FmvA and FmvB are predicted outer membrane beta barrel proteins.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0160977.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0160977.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protein</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PSORTb localization and score<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn001"><sup>a</sup></xref></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PROFtmb score (&#x003b2; strands)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn002"><sup>b</sup></xref></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BOMP score<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn003"><sup>c</sup></xref></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TMBB-DB score<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn004"><sup>d</sup></xref></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TMB-Hunt score<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn005"><sup>e</sup></xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FmvA</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Un 0.11</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.5 (14 &#x003b2; strands)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.63</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FmvB</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">OM 9.49</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.4 (18 &#x003b2; strands)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.994</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.45</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t001fn001"><p><sup>a</sup> PSORTb version 3.0.2 bacterial protein subcellular localization prediction program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.psort.org/psortb/">http://www.psort.org/psortb/</ext-link>).

Despite the previously-reported role of FslE in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> iron acquisition and virulence, <italic>in vivo fslE</italic> gene expression had not been previously examined. Of the five paralogs examined, <italic>fslE</italic> was the most upregulated paralog in all tissues examined, including 7.6- to 69.2-fold upregulation in the lung, 1.6- to 7.5-fold upregulation in the liver, and 6.0- to 74.2-fold upregulation in the spleen, depending on the day post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g002">Fig 2</xref>). These results are interesting because, although previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies noted that <italic>fslE</italic> was upregulated approximately 2-fold in iron-limiting conditions [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and played an important role in SchuS4 iron acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the dynamic <italic>in vivo</italic> upregulation of <italic>fslE</italic> demonstrates that iron uptake is critical for <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> survival and replication inside the host and suggests that <italic>fslE</italic> may respond to factors other than iron in the complex mammalian environment. By comparison, <italic>fupA</italic> expression was relatively unchanged (-2.4- to 2.4-fold change) in lungs, livers, and spleens of infected mice at all time points examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g002">Fig 2</xref>), indicating that <italic>fupA</italic> may be constitutively expressed in SchuS4.

However, FTL1420 and FTL1432, linked to a glycoprotein capsule-like complex loci in LVS, were found to be downregulated 1.39- to 1.36-fold in &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160977.t002">Table 2</xref>). As recently reviewed [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], although a majority of evidence indicates that the <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> capsule is composed of O-antigen and many LPS synthesis genes are required for capsule production, there also have been reports of a glycoprotein capsule-like complex, possibly linked to FTL1420 and FTL1432. Regardless of this controversy, the roles of <italic>kdtA</italic> and <italic>wbtA</italic> in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> LPS synthesis are well-established. The upregulation of various <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> genes encoding hypothetical inner membrane proteins, stress response proteins, or metal uptake/sensing proteins in &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160977.t002">Table 2</xref>) would be interesting to speculate on, but at this time, little is known about these proteins. Only <italic>fslB</italic> (FTL1883) and <italic>fslD</italic> (FTL1835), which are in the <italic>fslE</italic> operon and are predicted inner membrane proteins (data not shown), have been examined at a cursory level in a previous publication [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Of the various genes down-regulated in &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic>, <italic>lpxE</italic> (lipid A 1&#x02019; phosphatase) is most interesting because reduced expression of <italic>lpxE</italic> would be predicted to result in hyper-phosphorylation of LPS in &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> and potentially would increase immunogenicity of &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic>. However, <italic>lpxE</italic> down-regulation was marginal (1.4-fold; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160977.t002">Table 2</xref>) and we do not know if decreased <italic>lpxE</italic> expression in &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> contributed to the observed attenuated of &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> in mice (see next section on <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec005">mouse infections</xref>). In addition, hypothetical outer membrane lipoprotein VacJ (FTL0765) was found to be downregulated 1.46-fold in &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160977.t002">Table 2</xref>). Little is known about <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> VacJ, although a previous study noted that two VacJ homologs, including FTL0765, exist in LVS [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> VacJ is a surface exposed lipoprotein that has been shown to be required for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> to invade host cells, possibly through a membrane rupturing mechanism [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Interestingly, <italic>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae</italic>, a pulmonary pathogen of swine, encodes a VacJ homolog that has been shown to play a role in membrane integrity, serum resistance, and biofilm formation [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. When tested, we did not observe any host cell invasion (described below) or membrane integrity defects for &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> (Fig G in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160977.s001">S1 File</xref> and Table C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160977.s001">S1 File</xref>). However, future studies may be warranted to examine the role of VacJ in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> virulence. Finally, hypothetical outer membrane lipoproteins FTL1372 and FTL0765 also were found to be down-regulated 1.76- and 1.46-fold, respectively, in &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160977.t002">Table 2</xref>).

Because of the complex nature of iron uptake by <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic>, including functional compensation among the three previously-characterized paralogs [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], our studies required the use of single and double-gene deletion mutants, growth studies in several different iron-limiting media, and transcriptional analyses to confirm that <italic>fmvA</italic> and <italic>fmvB</italic> were not involved in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> iron uptake. Overall, our findings highlighted the limitations of using sequence homology to predict protein function. Similar limitations in predicting protein function have been noted by other groups, including a report that despite 41% amino acid identity to the <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic> heme receptor HumA, the <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> protein ZnuD actually imports zinc [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Other studies have reported that bacterial metal transporters can indiscriminately bind and transport a wide array of cations [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Particularly relevant to this study, the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> CorA magnesium transport proteins also have been shown to transport cations such as manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>), copper (Co<sup>2+</sup>), and nickel (Ni<sup>2+</sup>) [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. As such, we next examined the possibility that FmvA or FmvB could transport cations other than iron, including magnesium or calcium. Using a variety of approaches, we demonstrated that FmvB was outer membrane localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g004">Fig 4</xref>), responsive to magnesium (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. <italic>fmvB</italic> expression increased in low magnesium; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g003">Fig 3</xref>), and plays a role in LPS maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g005">Fig 5</xref>). We were not able to demonstrate that FmvB was required for growth in magnesium limitation (Figs E and F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160977.s001">S1 File</xref>), but given the above noted functional redundancy of iron import proteins and the upregulation of at least four putative metal importers in &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> (e.g. FTL1199, FTL1833, FTL0859, and FTL1835; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160977.t002">Table 2</xref>), it is possible that other proteins compensated for the loss of FmvB. Despite our best attempts to characterize both FmvA and FmvB, we still do not know the function of FmvA and only can speculate about the function of FmvB. Importantly, our data do suggest that as an outer membrane-localized protein that is magnesium responsive, FmvB may import magnesium and may interact with LPS assembly proteins to &#x02018;load&#x02019; magnesium between adjacent LPS molecules, which is required to negate negative charges and maintain LPS integrity.</p><p>Studies to directly test if FmvB is involved in magnesium uptake likely would require the use of radiolabeled magnesium [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], a siderophore-mediated uptake assay [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and/or purified recombinant proteins [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. At this time, we do not know if the <italic>Francisella</italic> siderophore [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] is involved in magnesium uptake. In addition, despite our previous studies expressing and purifying recombinant <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> OMPs from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we were unable to express and purify sufficient amounts of recombinant FmvB for these types of studies (data not shown). Another possibility includes feeding mice a low magnesium diet [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and then infecting those mice with &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> but potential functional redundancy (noted above) likely would complicate these experiments. Finally, it is worth noting that magnesium studies are particularly challenging because magnesium is required for many processes associated with bacterial growth and virulence. First, relative to other cations, magnesium is stored at high concentrations (0.5 to 1 mM) in the bacterial cytoplasm [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Second, our speculation that other proteins may import magnesium in the absence of FmvB is supported by the fact that <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar <italic>Typhimurium</italic> encodes at least three known magnesium transporters [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Finally, as noted above, high levels of magnesium are required to maintain LPS integrity in the outer membrane [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Taken together, our studies linking <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> FmvB and magnesium have revealed an entirely new area of research in the <italic>Francisella</italic> field and provide additional information to the bacterial pathogenesis and magnesium transport fields.</p><p>This study demonstrated the power of constantly-improving bioinformatic prediction programs to predict the localization and secondary structure of FmvA and FmvB. Whereas PSORTb has been reported to be the most precise bacterial subcellular localization (SCL) prediction program available [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], we also used a series of six beta barrel prediction programs to analyze FmvA and FmvB, given that beta-barrel proteins are found exclusively in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Taken together, six of seven prediction programs (PSORTb and the six beta barrel prediction programs) indicated that FmvA and FmvB were outer membrane beta barrel proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160977.t001">Table 1</xref> and Fig A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160977.s001">S1 File</xref>). To confirm these predictions, we used spheroplasting, osmotic lysis, and sucrose density gradient centrifugation to prove that FmvB was outer membrane (OM)-localized. OM-localization studies only were performed for FmvB, due to the upregulation of <italic>fmvB</italic> in magnesium-limiting medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g003">Fig 3</xref>), increased LPS expression in &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g005">Fig 5</xref>), and delayed time-to-death of &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic>-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g007">Fig 7</xref> and Fig H in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160977.s001">S1 File</xref>). In addition, OM-localization of FmvB only was possible following the addition of a 6x histidine fusion tag to the C-terminal end of FmvB using a genetic complementation construct. We attempted multiple approaches to generate polyclonal monospecific antibodies against FmvB, including the use of recombinant protein immunization, protein-specific peptide immunization, and immunization regimens with combinations of recombinant proteins and peptides. However, all of our attempts to generate FmvB-specific antisera failed, likely due to the high degree of amino acid sequence identity among the five paralogs. At this time, we do not know the subcellular localization of FmvA but, given the strength of the bioinformatic predictions, we are fairly confident that FmvA is an outer membrane beta barrel.</p><p>Because metals are tightly-sequestered by the host [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], pathogenic bacteria encode sophisticated mechanisms to capture or extract metals <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Whereas most metal studies have focused on iron uptake by various pathogenic bacteria, it is now well-appreciated that metals such as magnesium and calcium also are important for bacterial virulence, can serve as coenzymes for many bacterial processes, protect against free radical damage, are important to maintain membrane integrity, and can act as second message molecules [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As noted throughout this study, <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> iron-uptake systems have been well characterized and are known to be required for <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> growth and virulence [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. As such, we initially aimed to test the hypothesis that <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> upregulates known iron-acquisition genes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using similar logic, we speculated that FmvA and FmvB, because of their homology to known iron-acquisition genes, also would be upregulated <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that <italic>in vivo</italic> upregulation would correlate with iron/metal uptake and/or virulence. These hypotheses were based on other studies that used <italic>in vivo</italic> transcriptional analyses to identify novel virulence factors in other pathogenic bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Indeed, our <italic>in vivo</italic> transcriptional analysis demonstrated that <italic>fslE</italic>, one of the major <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> iron acquisition genes [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], was dramatically upregulated in SchuS4-infected mice (up to 74-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g002">Fig 2</xref>), highlighting that iron is extremely limiting <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, our analysis of <italic>fslE</italic> expression in various metal-depleted conditions found that <italic>fslE</italic> was upregulated not only in response to iron limitation, but also to calcium and magnesium limitation (up to 40-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Thus, although we did not examine all possible metal-depleting conditions, our data indicate that <italic>fslE</italic> does not specifically respond to iron-limitation but, instead, may broadly respond to or be regulated by many different metal-limiting conditions. Despite our discovery of this non-specific metal responsive mechanism in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic>, it is unlikely that <italic>in vivo</italic> upregulation of <italic>fslE</italic> correlates with <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> virulence, as previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>fslE</italic> is not required for LVS or SchuS4 virulence [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The second test of our <italic>in vivo</italic> upregulation hypothesis was applied to <italic>fupA</italic>, which previously was shown to be required for <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> iron acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and virulence [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. SchuS4 <italic>fupA</italic> expression was virtually unchanged <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and LVS <italic>fupAB</italic> expression was unchanged in various metal limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g003">Fig 3</xref>), suggesting that SchuS4 <italic>fupA</italic> and LVS <italic>fupAB</italic> are constitutively expressed and that not all <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> virulence factors are upregulated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, our hypotheses were not necessarily true for <italic>fmvA</italic> or <italic>fmvB</italic>. For <italic>fmvA</italic>, gene expression was virtually unchanged <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g002">Fig 2</xref>) or in metal-depleted media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g003">Fig 3</xref>) and &#x00394;<italic>fmvA</italic> did not result in substantial attenuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g007">Fig 7</xref>). As noted above, we did not examine all possible metal-depleting conditions, so it remains possible that FmvA may be involved in the uptake of metals not tested here. For <italic>fmvB</italic>, gene expression was significantly upregulated both <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and in magnesium-depleted media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g003">Fig 3</xref>) and we found that &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> was significantly attenuated in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g007">Fig 7</xref> and Fig H in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160977.s001">S1 File</xref>). Thus, of the paralogs examined in this study, only FmvB satisfies the criteria of being upregulated <italic>in vivo</italic>, likely playing a role in metal uptake, and playing a role in virulence. Other investigators have faced similar hurdles when using transcriptional analyses to identify <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> virulence genes. For example, DNA microarray analysis of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> SchuS4 from primary mouse bone marrow derived macrophages revealed 152 upregulated genes. Of those, the investigators generated 10 isogenic mutants, infected macrophages with individual mutants, and found that only 3 of 10 were attenuated [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. In summary, additional studies are needed to further test this hypothesis and fully understand the importance of <italic>in vivo</italic> upregulated genes and <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> virulence.</p><p>Due to our findings that FmvB was outer membrane-localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g004">Fig 4</xref>) and upregulated in magnesium limitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g003">Fig 3</xref>), we suspected that LPS expression might be altered in <italic>&#x00394;fmvB</italic> given that magnesium is required to neutralize LPS negative charges and many bacteria are known to alter their LPS in magnesium limitation [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Indeed, both immunoblot and flow cytometry analyses demonstrated that &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> expressed 50% more LPS than wild-type <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> in magnesium-limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g005">Fig 5</xref>). At this time, it is difficult to definitively explain why &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> expresses more LPS than wild-type. However, our RNAseq analysis revealed that two LPS synthesis genes, <italic>kdtA</italic> and <italic>wbtA</italic> were increased approximately 50% in &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160977.t002">Table 2</xref>). <italic>kdtA</italic> encodes a putative core oligosaccharide KDO transferase and <italic>wbtA</italic> has been associated with O-antigen and capsule production in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Conversely, RNAseq analysis also indicated that three LPS/capsule-associated genes were downregulated approximately 40% in &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0160977.t002">Table 2</xref>), including <italic>lpxE</italic> (lipid 1&#x02019; phosphatase; [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]), FTL1420 (carbohydrate kinase family protein), and FTL1432 (D-ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase; [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]). Finally, it remains possible that the gene expression changes noted above are not solely due to loss of <italic>fmvB</italic> but may have been confounded by low magnesium levels in the growth medium. However, wild-type LVS also was grown in low magnesium and analyzed by RNAseq analysis, so we have discounted this possibility.</p><p>Because flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that increased LPS was surface localized, we examined &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> bacterial morphology by electron microscopy (EM), finding that &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> bacteria possessed increased numbers of protrusions, compared with wild-type <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g006">Fig 6</xref>). At this time, we do not know the relevance or function of these protrusions but it is possible that these are outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Similar surface protrusions/outer membrane vesicles have been reported in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> and it is well known that Gram-negative bacteria produce outer membrane vesicles for multiple biological processes, including for virulence factor secretion or for quorum sensing [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0160977.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Based on our EM data, we speculated that &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> may be partially deficient in releasing OMVs from the bacterial surface. If FmvB does play a role in OMV release, this could explain why more LPS was retained on &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> bacteria. Reduced OMV release also may help explain the observed attenuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g007">Fig 7</xref>) and reduced cytokine stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g008">Fig 8</xref>) of &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> in mice. However, additional studies are needed to confirm the role of FmvB in OMVs and increased LPS on the bacterial surface.</p><p>We observed significant attenuation of &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> in pulmonary mouse infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g007">Fig 7</xref> and Fig H in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160977.s001">S1 File</xref>) and reduced levels of GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-10 in the spleens of &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic>-infected mice on day 5 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g009">Fig 9</xref>), indicating that FmvB is involved in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> virulence. In addition, &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> was deficient for bacterial dissemination to and replication in spleens on day 5 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160977.g008">Fig 8</xref>). It is possible that significantly reduced bacterial burdens in mouse spleens on day 5 correlated with the delayed time-to-death observed for &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic>. It also is possible that significantly reduced levels of GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-10 in the spleens of &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic>-infected mice on day 5 post-infection correlated with the observed delayed time-to-death. IL-3 has been previously shown to induce sepsis in mice [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and it is well-documented that <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic>-infected animals eventually die from a cytokine storm [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. GM-CSF also has been implicated in cytokine-induced sepsis and death [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Taken together, our findings indicate that &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> attenuation could be due to the reduced ability of &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> to stimulate IL-3 and GM-CSF or delayed IL-3 and GM-CSF production by &#x00394;<italic>fmvB-</italic>infected mice. We also found that &#x00394;<italic>fmvB-</italic>infected mice produced significantly lower levels of IL-10, compared with wild-type infected mice, however these findings are difficult to interpret at this time. Although IL-10 generally has been considered to be an immunosuppressive cytokine [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], IL-10 also has been demonstrated to play important immune regulatory functions during <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> infection [<xref rid="pone.0160977.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Given the reduced levels of GM-CSF and IL-3 in &#x00394;<italic>fmvB-</italic>infected mice, lower levels of IL-10 may be needed to reduce the cytokine storm severity.</p><p>In conclusion, despite the amino acid identity of FmvA and FmvB to the previously-studied <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> iron acquisition genes FslE, FupA, and FupB, neither FmvA nor FmvB are involved in iron acquisition. Through a series of gene expression analyses in metal-depleted media, outer membrane localization studies, and LPS expression analyses, our results indicate that FmvB may play a role in magnesium transport and LPS maintenance. Additionally, &#x00394;<italic>fmvB</italic> was observed to possess increased numbers of surface protrusions, compared with wild-type <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic>, suggesting that FmvB may play a role in OMV release.
