However, some long <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> introns contain a cryptic site, called a recursive splice site (RS-site), that enables a multi-step process of intron removal termed recursive splicing<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The extent to which recursive splicing occurs in other species and its mechanistic basis remain unclear. Here we identify highly conserved RS-sites in genes expressed in the mammalian brain that encode proteins functioning in neuronal development. Moreover, the RS-sites are found in some of the longest introns across vertebrates. We find that vertebrate recursive splicing requires initial definition of a &#x0201c;RS-exon&#x0201d; that follows the RS-site. The RS-exon is then excluded from the dominant mRNA isoform due to competition with a reconstituted 5&#x02032; splice site formed at the RS-site after the first splicing step. Conversely, the RS-exon is included when preceded by cryptic exons or promoters that are prevalent in long introns, but which fail to reconstitute an efficient 5&#x02032; splice site. Most RS-exons contain a premature stop codon such that their inclusion may decrease mRNA stability. Thus, by establishing a binary splicing switch, RS-sites demarcate different mRNA isoforms emerging from long genes by coupling inclusion of cryptic elements with RS-exons.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Recursive splicing has been validated within the long introns (&#x0003e;24 kb) of three <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genes<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The RS-sites in these introns contain a 3&#x02032; splice site followed by a sequence that reconstitutes a 5&#x02032; splice site after the first part of the intron is spliced, thereby allowing subsequent splicing of the second part of the intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). While one mammalian sequence was proposed to function as an RS-site when pre-spliced to an upstream exon in a splicing reporter<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, recursive splicing has not been observed in endogenous vertebrate genes. This is despite &#x0003e;8000 human protein-coding genes containing introns &#x0003e;24 kb, and many vertebrate genes containing motifs similar to the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> RS-sites<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Long genes exhibit elevated expression in the nervous system, as evident by analysis of human tissues or differentiating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b-d</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, and are enriched in GO terms associated with the nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). We therefore produced 1.5 billion paired-end total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reads from four post-mortem brains to search for new splicing events in human long genes. Importantly, RNA abundance decreases linearly from the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; end of long introns to create &#x0201c;saw-tooth&#x0201d; patterns in total RNA-seq data<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and these can be used to infer locations of major splicing events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figs. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">3</xref>). We also performed crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) of the RNA-binding protein &#x0201c;fused in sarcoma&#x0201d; (FUS) in human brain. FUS binds across entire pre-mRNAs with limited sequence specificity<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, permitting an independent examination of the saw-tooth patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3a-g</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Cryptic splice sites can be identified from novel splice-junction reads in RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2c-e</xref>). We hypothesized that if some of these were major splicing events, they should cause significant deviations from the expected linear decrease of reads across long introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c-d</xref>). Analysis of our RNA-seq data identified 40163 unique, unannotated cryptic splice sites in introns &#x0003e;1 kb that contained either 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; splice site motifs, 419 of which conformed to the RS-site motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We evaluated deviations from the expected saw-tooth pattern by establishing an analysis that computed the fit of linear regression slopes of each intron as a single unit or as two units separated at newly detected intra-intronic junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figs. 2a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">3</xref>). Since intron size is a critical determinant of our ability to reliably detect unexpected saw-tooth patterns, we restricted analysis to genes with at least one intron &#x0003e;150 kb. This identified 19 unique cryptic splice sites in the long introns of 14 genes that significantly improved the goodness-of-fit of the regression model in both RNA-seq and FUS iCLIP datasets. Of these, 9 had the RS-site motif whilst the remainder had a 3&#x02032; splice site motif (p&#x0003c;0.01 in both datasets, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The genes containing these 9 RS-sites mostly function in cell adhesion and axon guidance and are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The 9 RS-sites occurred at transition points of intronic linear regression slopes in all four individuals and all brain regions profiled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figs. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">4</xref>). RT-PCR from a separate human brain confirmed splicing to 8 RS-sites at identical PCR cycle number as the mature mRNA, suggesting equal abundance, while no PCR products were observed when reverse primers were shifted upstream of RS-sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5a-g</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Notably, an alternative 5&#x02032; splice site is present downstream of each RS-site that could lead to inclusion of alternative exons (hereafter &#x0201c;RS-exons&#x0201d;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). However, RS-exons were not detectable in mRNA transcripts at comparable PCR cycle numbers used to detect RS-site junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5a-g</xref>), arguing that RS-sites are being used for recursive splicing and not RS-exon inclusion. Despite RS-exon skipping, mammalian conservation of both the RS-sites and alternative 5&#x02032; splice sites following the RS-exons is comparable to that of canonical 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5i</xref>). Indeed, mouse Fus iCLIP regression patterns directly match conserved RS-sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6a-h</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Splicing of most vertebrate exons requires exon definition<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, where both splice sites flanking an exon are recognized in unison via interactions between U2AF proteins, SR proteins and U1/U2 snRNPs<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM">Supplementary Information</xref>). We speculated that RS-exons co-evolved with RS-sites to enable exon definition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Accordingly, we masked the 5&#x02032; splice site following the <italic>CADM1</italic> and <italic>ANK3</italic> RS-exons in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells using an antisense oligonucleotide (AON-A1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). This dramatically reduced RS-site usage in both genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). We subsequently replicated this observation <italic>in vivo</italic> at the conserved RS-site/RS-exon of the zebrafish <italic>cadm2a</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5h</xref>). The reduced RS-site usage also led to a ~6-fold increase in abundance of the intronic region upstream of both human RS-sites, indicating a change in the saw-tooth pattern consistent with splicing of intron as a whole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). Interestingly, the reduced RS-site usage caused a ~2-fold reduction in zebrafish <italic>cadm2a</italic> total mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>), an effect not seen for the human <italic>CADM1</italic> and <italic>ANK3</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM">Supplementary Information</xref>). Despite RS-exons usually being skipped, our findings demonstrate that RS-exon definition is crucial for the initial step of vertebrate recursive splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4i</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Since recursive splicing requires initial definition of an RS-exon, we questioned whether some annotated alternative exons might function as RS-exons. We found 99 candidate annotated RS-exons with RS-site sequences located precisely at their starts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). Splice-junction reads from brain RNA-seq data were present at the start of 16 of these exons despite evidence for exon skipping. These included exons in the <italic>CADM2</italic> and <italic>NTM</italic> genes that significantly improved the goodness-of-fit of linear regression in RNA-seq and iCLIP datasets across their &#x0003e;150 kb introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We confirmed RS-site mediated exon-skipping in both genes by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7b,f</xref>). Thus, the first intron in <italic>CADM2</italic> gene contains two RS-sites; the first followed by an unannotated RS-exon, and the second by an annotated RS-exon.</p><p id="P10">To further validate the exon definition mechanism, we established a splicing reporter containing the second <italic>CADM2</italic> RS-site, the annotated RS-exon and its 5&#x02032; splice site, and the surrounding constitutive exons, each flanked by their nearest ~100 nt of <italic>CADM2</italic> intronic sequence (P1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Despite the &#x0003e;500 kb long intron being reduced to ~0.5 kb, the reporter replicated findings of endogenous genes; 79% of mRNA isoforms skipped the RS-exon whilst RS-site usage was readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>). As expected given the need for exon definition to recognise RS-sites, mutating the 5&#x02032; splice site following the RS-exon greatly reduced RS-site usage, and the intron remained a single unit in most splicing intermediates (P1-m1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Next, to examine why RS-exons are excluded from the mRNA, we mutated the <italic>CADM2</italic> reporter&#x02019;s RS-site to prevent formation of reconstituted 5&#x02032; splice site after the first splicing event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Strikingly, this resulted in complete inclusion of the RS-exon, implying competition exists between the two 5&#x02032; splice sites at either end of the RS-exon (P1-m2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-b</xref>). To compare with endogenous genes, we designed AON-A2 to mask the section of RS-sites that contributes to the reconstituted 5&#x02032; splice site in the human <italic>CADM1, ANK3</italic> or zebrafish <italic>cadm2a</italic> genes (AON-A2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Agreeing with the splicing reporter, AON-A2 dramatically increased RS-exon inclusion in all human and zebrafish experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8b</xref>). Collectively, this demonstrates that the RS-exon is skipped due to a splice site competition that leads to use of the reconstituted 5&#x02032; splice site instead of the 5&#x02032; splice site of the RS-exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM">Supplementary Information</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We noticed that RS-exons typically contain one or more in-frame stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5i</xref>), inclusion of which should prevent translation of full-length protein and target transcripts with preceding start codons to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. We induced inclusion of the RS-exons in <italic>CADM1</italic> and <italic>ANK3</italic> by masking the 5&#x02032; splice site of their RS-sites with AON-A2, and then inhibited NMD by blocking translation with cycloheximide. This increased the proportion of isoforms containing the RS-exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), confirming that RS-exon inclusion can target transcripts for NMD and thus has potential to regulate transcript stability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM">Supplementary Information</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Having identified the mechanisms underlying vertebrate recursive splicing, we next explored the functions of RS-sites. Although <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> RS-sites have been proposed to maintain splicing integrity of long introns<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, the assayed human and zebrafish long introns remained accurately spliced after recursive splicing inhibition with AON-A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8c</xref>). We therefore explored an additional hypothesis that RS-sites regulate inclusion of RS-exons under specific contexts. We identified minor isoforms in the <italic>CADM2</italic> and <italic>NTM</italic> genes that use a different promoter, and were therefore not detected by our initial RT-PCR reactions. Their detection required 10 more amplification cycles compared to the dominant isoform, confirming that they are minor isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Figs. 7c-d, 7g</xref>). Surprisingly, RS-exons are completely included in these minor isoforms that have an alternative exon or promoter preceding the RS-site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7c-g</xref>). Similarly, the RS-exon is also detected in expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of minor <italic>OPCML</italic> isoforms that contain alternative exons preceding the RS-site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). A related splicing mechanism that coordinates alternative promoters with downstream alternative splicing was been observed in the human <italic>EPB41</italic> and <italic>EPB41L3</italic> genes, although this involves a reconstituted 3&#x02032; splice site to make it distinct from recursive splicing<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">To understand how preceding exons can dictate inclusion of RS-exons in a binary manner, we compared the computationally predicted strengths of the three relevant 5&#x02032; splice sites in <italic>CADM2</italic><sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>; the 5&#x02032; splice sites reconstituted from the RS-site after its splicing to the preceding exon of either the dominant or minor isoforms, and the 5&#x02032; splice site of the RS-exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). We used the last three nucleotides of the preceding exon and the six nucleotides from the RS-site to calculate the scores of the reconstituted 5&#x02032; splice sites<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. We found that the reconstituted 5&#x02032; splice site had a high score when the first exon is derived from the dominant promoter (10.6), a low score when derived from the minor promoter (5.1), whilst the 5&#x02032; splice site of the RS-exon had an intermediate score (7.0). This indicates that strength of the reconstituted 5&#x02032; splice site likely dictates whether the RS-exon is included or skipped. Indeed, 5&#x02032; splice sites reconstituted from the preceding exon of the dominant isoform in all 9 high-confidence RS-sites had equal or higher splice site scores than the 5&#x02032; splice sites of their corresponding RS-exons, in agreement with observed RS-exon skipping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To evaluate experimentally, we mutated the 5&#x02032; splice site of the <italic>CADM2</italic> RS-exon in our splicing reporter such that its score was higher (12.2) than the reconstituted 5&#x02032; splice site of the dominant isoform (10.6, P1-m3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). This mutation favored RS-exon inclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). We then replaced the preceding exon of the dominant isoform with the one from the minor isoform. This led to complete inclusion of the RS-exon, re-capitulating behavior of the endogenous gene (P2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d,f</xref>). Finally, swapping the last three nucleotides of the preceding exon in the minor isoform to the sequence of dominant isoform led to RS-exon skipping, consistent with the higher score of the reconstituted 5&#x02032; splice site (10.6, P2-m1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d,f</xref>). These results reveal that the binary splicing switch is a consequence of the relative strengths of competing 5&#x02032; splice sites present after the RS-exon is spliced to the preceding exon.</p><p id="P16">Introns containing the high-confidence RS-sites are amongst the longest introns in all vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9b</xref>). This includes <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis,</italic> which has the shortest known vertebrate genome and otherwise contains very short introns<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Further, 8/9 of our high confidence RS-sites are located in the long first intron of the gene. We confirmed that long introns generally have an increased incidence of cryptic exons and noisy splicing<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> by observing an increased incidence of cryptic junctions in our RNA-seq data in long first introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9c</xref>). Since the majority of the 435 putative RS-sites identified in our study are present in the longest human genes (419 intronic loci, 16 annotated RS-exons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>), RS-sites are thus well positioned to couple inclusion of cryptic exons with RS-exons. As most RS-exons contain a premature stop codon, this may also allow quality control of the novel mRNA isoforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM">Supplementary Information</xref>).</p><p id="P17">In summary, recursive splicing of long vertebrate genes involves two steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>). First the RS-exon is defined, which requires its own 5&#x02032; splice site. Following splicing of the RS-exon to the preceding exon, a new 5&#x02032; splice site is reconstituted from the RS-site that competes with the 5&#x02032; splice site of the RS-exon. The strength of the reconstituted 5&#x02032; splice site determines whether the RS-exon is skipped via recursive splicing or included. Notably, the upstream exons of dominant isoforms reconstitute a strong 5&#x02032; splice site that leads to recursive splicing, whereas other alternative exons, which commonly emerge in long introns to produce minor isoforms, generally end in sequences that lead to RS-exon inclusion.

Following evaluation of different sized windows, we ultimately divided introns in to 5 kb bins. For both the RNA-seq and <italic>FUS</italic> iCLIP data, we then computed the number of read pairs mapping to each bin using samtools v0.19. We then ran a regression analysis with the number of mapped reads in each bin as a dependent variable. As a test, we first used this to examine genes containing multiple introns &#x0003e;50 kb. This showed that slopes of fitted regression lines were comparable for different long introns of the same gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2a-b</xref>). Since the slope depends on transcriptional elongation rate, this observation agrees with the finding that transcription rate is relatively constant across individual genes<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. We therefore assumed a constant (unconstrained) slope across each entire gene. Reducing the 5 kb bin size or the intron length cut-off reduced the reliability in the method, implying individual units of &#x0003e;50 kb are most appropriate for this computational analysis. Accordingly, when splitting introns into two separate parts based on novel junctions, we focused on &#x0003e;150 kb introns to adequately account for this size limit.</p><p id="P24">Next, for our baseline model, we coded the positions of all potential exons located in the &#x0003e;150 kb intron long gene introns (based on Ensembl annotations) using binary dummy variables and let the fitted read count data reset to an arbitrary value at each putative exon. We then considered for each intron a set of augmented models that include the same covariates at the baseline model (constant slope, dummy variable for potential exons) in addition to an additional dummy variable for each of the novel junctions identified by the split read analysis. We used a standard F test P-value to compare the fit between the baseline model and the augmented one in order to quantify the improvement of the goodness-of-fit provided by each additional potential RS-sites.

Analysis was performed using both RNA-seq and <italic>FUS</italic> datasets. Identified GURAG exons were matched to these results to determine candidate exons which show high levels of inclusion. These were subsequently followed up through evaluation of junction counts between these exons and both upstream and downstream exons within RNA-seq data, and additionally junctions between the upstream and downstream exons in which the GURAG exon would be skipped. Limited evidence for recursive splicing was considered a double-significance in linear regression analysis, but junction counts indicating that the skipped product dominates.</p><p id="P37">Second, we asked whether these GURAG exons made regular contact with upstream exons with which they are not expected to junction (based on known gene isoforms). This could imply that the junction is used, but the GURAG exon is not included, leading to absence of isoform annotation. To identify known or novel junctions between the 99 GURAG alternative exons and upstream exons, we evaluated all junctions in RNA-seq data that were made between the identified 99 cassette exons and any annotated upstream exon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1 (Worksheet 5)</xref>). Each junction was then enumerated and classified as &#x0201c;known&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;novel&#x0201d; using the knowngene UCSC annotations. If a junction was not present in this annotation database and subsequently classed as novel, then this was considered limited evidence for recursive splicing. Examples were subsequently considered high confidence if splicing patterns inferred from the aforementioned analysis of total RNA-seq read density patterns suggested frequent use of the novel junction.
