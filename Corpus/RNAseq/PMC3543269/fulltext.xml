Recent studies examining multiple histone modifications have found numerous chromatin states with distinct profiles of chromatin marks and functional enrichments. There are data showing coordinate regulation between DNAme and H3K27me3, which are both involved in the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic gene silencing, but the data are conflicting. Multiple studies have presented evidence to support the theory that PRC2 and DNAme cooperate to achieve silencing, or alternatively that H3K27me3 and DNAme act antagonistically. Here we examine the effect loss of either PRC2 or DNA methyltransferase activity has on the placement of the reciprocal mark in mouse ES cells. We find that DNAme is acting globally to antagonize the placement of H3K27me3, in accordance with recently published results. At least 471,011 domains in the mouse genome acquire H3K27me3 when DNAme is diminished. Of these 466,563 have been shown to be fully methylated in wildtype ES cells, indicating the effects of DNAme on H3K27me3 are direct. In a reciprocal experiment, we examine the effect loss of PRC2 has on the placement of DNAme. In contrast to the global antagonism DNAme has on the placement of H3K27me3, loss of H3K27me3 has a modest effect on DNAme, with only 4% of genes undergoing changes in DNAme, including 861 showing increases and 552 showing losses of overall DNAme. We anticipate that integrating genomic datasets where the effect of loss of a particular epigenetic mark has on the placement of other marks will help elucidate the rules governing epigenetic regulation and what role coordinate regulation of epigenetic marks plays in development and disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), CA120870, and the Cornell Center for Vertebrate Genomics.

The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, a complex of DNA wrapped around an octamer of core histone proteins. Post-translational modification of DNA and histones, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ribosylation, glycosylation and ubiquitination separates chromatin into functional domains. Considerable evidence suggests that posttranslational modifications to DNA and histones define a &#x02018;chromatin state&#x02019; that dictates a distinct cellular state and thus a particular transcriptional program (Reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Cedar1">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Probst1">[3]</xref>).</p><p>Genome-wide maps of chromatin state have been made for numerous modifications in a variety of cell types. The resulting maps show that modifications often exist in specific combinations corresponding to unique functional genomic features. For example, trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and lysine 27 (H3K27me3) exists at the promoters of a subset of genes in ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Bernstein1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Mikkelsen1">[5]</xref>. Such &#x02018;bivalent&#x02019; genes tend to be associated with developmental functions and are repressed in ES cells, but poised for activation upon differentiation. A more recent study examined nine histone modifications in nine human cell types and found 15 chromatin states with distinct profiles of chromatin marks and functional enrichments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Ernst1">[6]</xref>. Epigenetic modifications may also be antagonistic. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> the histone H2 variant H2A.Z and DNA methylation (DNAme) are mutually antagonistic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Zilberman1">[7]</xref>. DNA methylation is associated with repression while H2A.Z promotes transcriptional competence. Mutation of the PIE1 subunit of the Swr1 complex that deposits H2A.Z leads to genome-wide hypermethylation, while mutation of the MET1 DNA methyltransferase engenders opposite changes in DNA methylation and H2A.Z deposition. In addition to the examples described, coordinate regulation of epigenetic modifications has been demonstrated in a number of studies, consistent with the hypothesis of a histone code <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Kirmizis1">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Sugimura1">[11]</xref>.</p><p>DNA methylation and H3K27me3 are both involved in the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic gene silencing. There are data showing coordinate regulation between the marks. Some evidence points toward a cooperative relationship. For example, the polycomb group protein EZH2 has been shown to positively regulate DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Vire1">[12]</xref>. In these studies, EZH2 was observed to interact with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and was required for DNA methylation of EZH2-target promoters. Alternatively, several lines of evidence suggest the coordination between DNAme and H3K27me3 may be antagonistic. A proteomic analysis has shown the PRC2 components EED and SUZ12 are excluded from methylated DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Bartke1">[13]</xref>, and in neural stem cells <italic>Dnmt<sup>3a</sup></italic> deficiency leads to increased H3K27me3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Wu1">[14]</xref>. Also, our lab has previously shown that at the imprinted locus <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> DNAme and H3K27me3 are mutually exclusive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Lindroth1">[15]</xref>. Finally, additional studies suggest that an important relationship between DNAme and H3K27me3 is disrupted in cancer cells. Polycomb group targets are more likely to have cancer-specific promoter DNA hypermethylation than non-targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Schlesinger1">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-GalYam1">[18]</xref>. However, embryonic carcinoma cells lack DNA hypermethylation at PRC targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Ohm1">[19]</xref>, and knockdown of EZH2 in cancer cells may lead to hypomethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-McGarvey1">[20]</xref>. Thus the evidence of interaction is conflicting, but it is clear that the relationship between these marks is important in both normal and cancerous cells.</p><p>Here, we attempt to address the relationship between DNAme and H3K27me3 by undertaking a genome-wide analysis to examine the effect loss of one mark has upon the placement of the other. We use mouse embryonic stem cells with defective PRC2 activity to examine the effect on the placement of DNAme, and use cells with defective DNA methyltransferase activity to identify regions with altered levels of H3K27me3. Finally, we perform RNAseq analysis in both cell types to try to associate gene expression changes with changes in the placement of either mark. We show that PRC2 activity is required for proper placement of DNAme at a number of developmentally important genes. We also demonstrate that DNAme is globally repressing the placement of H3K27me3. Our expression studies show that the coordinate regulation between these marks does not appear to have a direct effect on gene expression in the undifferentiated cells, but we show that the indirect effects on gene expression of loss of PRC2 or DNA methyltransferase have a remarkable similarity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Changes in DNAme in H3K27me3-deficient ES Cells</title><p>In order to investigate changes in DNAme that occur as a consequence of loss of H3K27me3 we globally assayed DNAme using Methyl DNA immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to a promoter microarray (MeDIP) in ES cells derived from <italic>Eed<sup>17Rn5&#x02013;3354SB</sup></italic> (<italic>Eed<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>)</italic> mutant mice. EED is one of the three components of the PRC2 complex and is required for normal H3K27 trimethylation. EED binds to histone tails carrying trimethyl-lysine residues and activates the methyltransferase activity of PRC2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Margueron1">[21]</xref>. Without EED, H3K27me3 is undetectable, while there is no difference in H3K9me3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Montgomery1">[22]</xref>. We performed three independent MeDIP experiments and identified 2,296 regions with significant changes in DNAme as a consequence of loss of H3K27me3. Pairwise Pearson correlations showed good correlation of peak intensities between the three arrays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053880.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

Of the 1,413 genes with changes in DNAme 861 showed increased DNAme and 552 showed decreased DNAme. Peaks were validated by sequencing &#x0003e;15 independent clones of PCR-amplified bisulfite-treated DNA and testing for changes in DNA methylation using a Fisher&#x02019;s exact test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053880-g001">Figure 1A&#x02013;C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053880.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

We see that changes in DNAme are distributed across the promoter with the greatest level of enrichment at between 1 and 2 kb upstream of the TSS. Gene ontology analysis of genes with changes in DNAme showed that genes with decreased DNAme in <italic>Eed<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells tended to be involved in chromatin organization while genes with increased DNAme were either involved in sensory perception or were developmentally important genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053880-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Genes with decreased DNAme also tended to be enriched for high-CpG-content (HCP) promoters and bivalent chromatin marks, while genes with increased DNAme tended to be genes with low- (LCP) or intermediate-CpG-content promoters (ICP) that lacked H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in wildtype ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053880-g001">Figure 1H,I</xref>). It is interesting to note that the lack of H3K27me3 in the promoter of genes with increased DNAme may indicate that H3K27me3 is regulating the placement of DNAme in an indirect manner. Hierarchical clustering of annotated mouse transcripts on the basis of DNAme patterns produced three main groups. One cluster had all of the genes with depleted DNAme, while the transcripts with increased DNAme were divided into two groups (clusters 1 &#x00026; 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053880-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). The first cluster had peaks of increased DNAme upstream of the TSS, while the second had increased DNAme across the entire promoter. These two clusters also corresponded to GO annotation and promoter CpG content in wildtype ES cells. Genes with increased DNAme across the promoter were genes with functions in sensory perception and pheromone receptor activity, had ICP and LCP promoters and lacked H3K4/K27 methylation, while genes with increased DNAme upstream of the promoter were developmental genes with HCP promoters and were enriched for bivalent chromatin marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053880-g001">Figure 1G&#x02013;I</xref>).</p><p>We performed RNAseq on wildtype and <italic>Eed</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> ES cells to determine if PRC2-dependent changes in DNAme led to expression level changes.

However, we note that it is possible this coordination might poise genes for properly controlled expression after differentiation. Our work thus far demonstrates that the patterns of changes in DNAme that occur as a consequence of loss of PRC2 activity correlate with a particular epigenetic state in wildtype ES cells and with specific gene functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>DNAme Globally Antagonizes the Placement of H3K27me3</title><p>As a reciprocal experiment we investigated the effect loss of DNAme had on the placement of H3K27me3 by performing ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 on cells with severely depleted DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity. DNMT triple-knockout cells (<italic>Dnmt<sup>TKO</sup></italic>) lack genes for producing the two <italic>de novo</italic> DNMTs, DNMT3a and DNMT3b, and have the transcript of the maintenance DNMT, <italic>Dnmt1,</italic> depleted by stable expression of a shRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Meissner1">[25]</xref>. The methylation level of these cells is 1.3% of that seen in wild type cells. We performed ChIP-seq on two biological replicates each for wildtype and <italic>Dnmt<sup>TKO</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053880-g002">Figure 2A, B</xref>). A comparison with published datasets shows our ChIP-seq results are comparable to previously published H3K27me3 levels in both wildtype and <italic>Dnmt<sup>TKO</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0053880.s005">Figure S5</xref>). The first replicate generated 605,487 peaks of increased H3K27me3 in <italic>Dnmt<sup>TKO</sup></italic> cells, covering 887,929,154 bp. The second replicate had 563,216 peaks covering 870,300,855 bp. On average, our ChIP-seq showed that H3K27me3 is increased on 32.4% of the mouse genome in the absence of DNA methylation. Intersection of the two replicates yielded 471,011 peaks covering 474,802,970 bp. We designed qPCR primers to ten peaks common to both replicates and tested six biological replicates each of wildtype and <italic>Dnmt<sup>TKO</sup></italic> cells to validate the ChIP-seq results. All ten peaks confirmed the significantly increased H3K27me3 levels as assayed by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053880-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Since we couldn&#x02019;t identify a single false positive peak by qPCR, we validated an additional five peaks that were significant in one of our two replicates. All five of these peaks were also significantly enriched by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053880-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). If we examine the union of the two replicates, we get 756,847 peaks covering 1,218,250,739 bp, or &#x0223c;45% of the mouse genome with increased H3K27me3 in the absence of DNA methylation. Finally, we tested eleven sets of primers that covered regions that didn&#x02019;t have a peak in either biological replicate. Interestingly, six of the eleven sets of primers showed significantly increased levels of H3K27me3 in <italic>Dnmt<sup>TKO</sup></italic> cells. This suggests our ChIP-seq results may in fact be underestimating the portion of the genome with increased H3K27me3 in the absence of DNA methylation. We suspect peak calling programs have difficulty calling peaks when there are such high levels of enrichment across the genome. We confirmed the increase of H3K27me3 in <italic>Dnmt<sup>TKO</sup></italic> by western blot and saw a nearly 3-fold increase in H3K27me3 in <italic>Dnmt<sup>TKO</sup></italic> cells relative to wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053880-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). This effect was also present in v6.5 cells treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine.

Our data along with that of others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Mathieu1">[36]</xref> would suggest an additional role for DNA methylation in mammals may be to inhibit the inappropriate placement of histone modifications, specifically H3K27me3.</p><p>During the analysis of our data Brinkman et al. reported ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 in <italic>Dnmt<sup>TKO</sup></italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Brinkman1">[27]</xref>. In their paper they report that total loss of DNAme is associated with alteration of H3K27me3 across the genome. They specifically reported broad local enrichments of H3K27me3 at megabase scale. Our data are consistent with their reported results. The authors hypothesize that the accumulation of H3K27me3 is due to a compensatory repressive effect instigated by the loss of DNA methylation. We propose that DNAme may be globally repressing the deposition of H3K27me3 by impairing an affinity that PRC2 has for unmethylated CpGs. Indeed, it has been shown that large GC-rich elements depleted of activating transcription factor motifs mediate PRC2 recruitment in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Mendenhall1">[37]</xref> and that methylation of DNA impairs binding of PRC2 in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Wu1">[14]</xref>. It is possible that the presence of DNA methylation across most of the mammalian genome is inhibiting an inherent affinity that PRC2 has for CpG-rich sequences. Further experiments will be needed to clarify how DNAme is acting to inhibit H3K27me3.</p><p>In addition to global antagonism of H3K27me3 by DNAme, we also show that H3K27me3 is required for proper placement of DNA methylation. When PRC2 activity is lost we see both increases and decreases in DNA methylation within the promoters of primarily developmentally important genes. Our original intent in examining DNAme and H3K27me3 was to determine if mutual antagonism between the two marks that we have previously shown at the <italic>Rasgrf1</italic> imprinted locus is a general rule operating genome wide. We identified 439 genes that had increases of DNAme upon loss of PRC2 activity, as well as increases of H3K27me3 upon loss of DNA methyltransferase activity. This set of genes does not appear to be enriched for genes with expression changes in either <italic>Dnmt<sup>TKO</sup></italic> or <italic>Eed<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells (data not shown), suggesting that coordinate regulation between DNAme and H3K27me3 is not directly controlling gene expression within undifferentiated ES cells.</p><p>Since many genes undergoing DNAme changes upon loss of H3K27me3 have high CpG-content promoters, contain bivalent epigenetic marks, and are linked to developmental GO terms, we hypothesized that exclusion of DNAme by H3K27me3 might be required to create chromatin states permissive for subsequent expression upon differentiation. This would explain why these genes show no changes in expression in the mutant ES cell lines. Unfortunately, although <italic>Eed<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> is dispensable for the maintenance of pluripotent stem cells, it is required for the differentiation and/or maintenance of multipotent progenitors, limiting our ability to differentiate <italic>Eed<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Chamberlain1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-MorinKensicki1">[38]</xref>. To explore this possibility, we compared the list of genes with altered DNAme caused by loss of H3K27me3, to published datasets describing gene expression differences in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) or MEFs relative to ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Meissner2">[39]</xref>. Although genes undergoing DNAme changes upon loss of H3K27me3 were not activated in either NPCs or MEFs (data not shown), this does not preclude the possibility that coordinated regulation of PRC2 and DNAme controls gene expression in other differentiated cell types.</p><p>Recently, it has been demonstrated that within the gene bodies of HCC1954 cells there is mutual antagonism between H3K27me3 and DNAme in an allele specific manner, and that disruption of this mutual antagonism leads to misexpression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Hon1">[40]</xref>. We are not able to complete a similar analysis because our MeDIP experiments do not provide information about allele-specific methylation or data across the gene body. It is possible that by comparing our ChIP-seq dataset with a more complete analysis of DNAme in <italic>Eed<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells derived from polymorphic strains that we may be able to identify important examples of mutual antagonism between DNAme and H3K27me3.</p><p>Finally, We looked at the expression changes that occur upon loss of either PRC2 or DNA methyltransferase activity and find an interesting overlap in regulation at a number of developmentally important genes and similar effects on gene expression upon loss of either mark. We do not find, however, that the genes that are regulated by crosstalk between these two epigenetic marks correlate with genes that have expression changes in either cell type, so it appears that the crosstalk between the marks is not directly controlling gene expression, at least in undifferentiated ES cells. Future studies examining the effect loss of one epigenetic mark has on the placement of other marks will be important to understand how coordinate regulation of epigenetic modifications effects gene regulation. It is possible that using a similar approach to examine additional marks coordinately regulated with H3K27me3, such as H3K4me3, or with DNAme, such as H3K9me3, will give important insights into gene regulation. Additionally, as high-throughput sequencing technologies continue to increase read number and read length, comprehensive methylome analysis will become more common, giving a greater ability to intersect ChIP-seq datasets with methylome data genome-wide with basepair resolution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>V6.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0053880-Rideout1">[41]</xref>, <italic>Eed<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>
