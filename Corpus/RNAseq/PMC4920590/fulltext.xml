In this study, we show that in addition to L-Tryptophan, GPR142 signaling is also activated by L-Phenylalanine but not by other naturally occurring amino acids. Furthermore, we show that Tryptophan and a synthetic GPR142 agonist increase insulin and incretin hormones and improve glucose disposal in mice in a GPR142-dependent manner. In contrast, Phenylalanine improves in vivo glucose disposal independently of GPR142. Noteworthy, refeeding-induced elevations in insulin and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide are blunted in <italic>Gpr142</italic> null mice. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate GPR142 is a Tryptophan receptor critically required for insulin and incretin hormone regulation and suggest GPR142 agonists may be effective therapies that leverage amino acid sensing pathways for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004312</institution-id><institution>Eli Lilly and Company</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>Eli Lilly &#x00026; Co. provided support in the form of salaries for authors (HVL, AME, XF, LSB, XW, JW, ICGV, TM) and funding for research materials, but did not have any additional role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

A clinically validated pathway for T2D therapy is modulation of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which acts on GLP-1 receptor in pancreatic islets to promote glucose-dependent insulin secretion, thus reducing glucose without causing hypoglycemia. Existing drugs targeting this pathway include Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors that stabilize endogenous GLP-1 by inhibiting the key enzyme catalyzing its proteolytic inactivation [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist peptides that are resistant to DPP-4 cleavage [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, mechanisms that can enhance the secretion of GLP-1from its endogenous source&#x02013;enteroendocrine L cells&#x02013;are also hypothesized to have the potential for robust efficacy in T2D patients without increasing hypoglycemic risk.</p><p>Food-derived macronutrients play major roles in regulating postprandial hormonal production from both pancreatic islets and the gut. The effects of various fat derivatives, such as fatty acids and other lipid species, on secretion of insulin and GLP-1 are, at least in part, mediated by several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)[<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Discovering synthetic agonists for these GPCRs have been the focus of extensive efforts aimed at finding new treatments for T2D. The best known example is TAK-875, a selective agonist for Free Fatty Acid Receptor 1 (FFAR1, GPR40) that is highly expressed in pancreatic islets. TAK-875 activates G&#x003b1;q signaling downstream of FFAR1 to stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion in preclinical models [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and was shown to improve glycemic control in humans in a phase III study [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], though further development of this molecule was terminated due to safety concerns. In addition, agonists of FFAR1 and other G&#x003b1;q-coupled GPCRs in enteroendocrine cells can also stimulate the release of gut hormones, including GLP-1, in preclinical models [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, targeting islet/gut G&#x003b1;q-coupled GPCRs with insulin and GLP-1 secretagogue effects continues to represent an attractive strategy for novel oral T2D treatment.</p><p>Dietary polypeptides and amino acids have long been known to stimulate insulin and incretin hormone secretion and regulate postprandial glycemia in animals and in humans [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Despite reports implicating several cell surface proteins in these effects [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], identification of the full repertoire of receptors responsible for sensing of dietary proteins and their derivatives is incomplete. Furthermore, whether these receptors might serve as targets for drug discovery for the treatment of T2D is currently unclear. GPR142 is a G&#x003b1;q-coupled receptor [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157298.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] purported to be selectively activated by L-Tryptophan (L-Trp) [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], yet its biology, including ligand specificity and physiological role in nutrient sensing, remains obscure. <italic>GPR142</italic> mRNA was found to be highly expressed in pancreatic islets in both humans and mice [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157298.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which is consistent with reports of its synthetic agonists stimulating insulin secretion and improving in vivo glucose disposal in mice and primates [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The function of GPR142 in other tissues has not been studied but two reports suggested enrichment of <italic>Gpr142</italic> mRNA expression in murine gastric ghrelin cells [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and intestinal glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)-positive K cells [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], respectively. However, the potential connections between the ability of this receptor to sense dietary amino acids, regulate gut hormones secretion, and control glucose metabolism are all unknown.</p><p>In this study, we examined GPR142 signaling activity in the presence of various amino acids using a cell-based assay measuring accumulation of D-myo-inositol 1-phosphate (IP-1), a downstream metabolite of D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP-3) that is formed upon G&#x003b1;q activation [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We found that the receptor is selectively activated by aromatic amino acids L-Trp and L-Phenylalanine (L-Phe). We further showed that L-Trp and a synthetic GPR142 agonist stimulate the secretion of insulin, the incretin hormones GIP and GLP-1, and improve glucose disposal in mice. The effects on insulin, GIP, and glycemia were absent in <italic>Gpr142</italic> knockout mice. In addition, we showed that GPR142 is a critical modulator of refeeding-induced insulin and GIP release. Interestingly, although L-Phe also reduces glycemia in vivo, its effect remains intact in <italic>Gpr142</italic> knockout mice, suggesting distinct sensing mechanisms for this amino acid. This is the first report to our knowledge demonstrating both the physiological and the pharmacological function of GPR142 in islet and gut hormone secretion and regulation of glucose homeostasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cellular assays</title><p>HEK293 cells obtained from ATCC were used to generate cell lines stably expressing human <italic>GPR142</italic> or mouse <italic>Gpr142</italic> by transfecting cells with pcDNA3.1 expression vectors containing each cDNA.

The tissues with highest <italic>Gpr142</italic> mRNA levels were pancreatic islets, total pancreas, and the proximal gastrointestinal tract&#x02014;stomach, duodenum, and jejunum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157298.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Analysis of human tissues also showed an enrichment of <italic>GPR142</italic> mRNA in pancreatic islets and total pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157298.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), with all other tissues tested showing levels of the mRNA &#x0003e;15-fold lower than that in islets. We also assessed regulation of islet mRNA expression in the diabetic state. <italic>Gpr142</italic>mRNA was slightly elevated in islets isolated from young db/db mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157298.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), whereas no significant difference in mRNA levels was observed between human primary islets from non-diabetic controls and type 2 diabetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157298.g001">Fig 1G</xref>) with high variability in expression level among different donors being noted. It is intriguing that <italic>Gpr142</italic>expression was elevated in islets from db/db mice but not in type 2 diabetic human subjects. Since the db/db mice used in this study were fairly young before the onset of severe diabetes, it is possible they represent an earlier stage in disease progression and have less advanced &#x003b2; cell failure compared to diabetic human donors, which might explain the difference in GPR142 expression observed.</p><p>Since GPR142 is highly enriched in pancreatic islets, we then studied if GPR142 regulates insulin secretion. We utilized islets from wild type (WT) control mice and <italic>Gpr142</italic>knockout (KO) mice that were confirmed to have receptor expression below the limit of detection by quantitative PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157298.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).

Importantly, this response was significantly blunted in KO islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157298.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), indicating that GPR142 is a key mediator of the insulin secretagogue activity of L-Trp. L-Trp also robustly stimulated insulin secretion in human primary islets at concentrations similar to those in murine islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157298.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).

In this study, we demonstrate that activation of the islet-enriched putative amino acid receptor GPR142 is not limited to L-Trp but also observed for L-Phe, which is a novel finding. Using <italic>Gpr142</italic>-deficient mice, we show that L-Trp requires GPR142 for its actions whereas additional as-yet-unidentified pathways contribute to the glucose-lowering effect of L-Phe. This is the first report to our knowledge identifying a GPCR as the Tryptophan receptor responsible for mediating this amino acid&#x02019;s effects in vivo on gut/islet hormone secretion and glucose homeostasis. The requirement of GPR142 in Tryptophan action appears to be more critical for GIP and insulin secretion than for GLP-1, as L-Trp could still stimulate GLP-1 in <italic>Gpr142</italic>null mice. GLP-1-producing L cells are present at highest density in the lower small intestine and colon, while GIP-producing K cells are restricted to the upper small intestine [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Along with the observation that <italic>Gpr142</italic>is expressed at higher levels in the upper small intestine than in distal segments, it is conceivable that an additional L-Trp sensing mechanism may exist in the ileal and colonic L cells to regulate GLP-1 in <italic>Gpr142</italic>-deficient mice.</p><p>L-Phe had a weaker effect on ex vivo insulin secretion than L-Trp in murine pancreatic islets. This is consistent with the difference in their potencies on mouse GPR142, since L-Phe is 4 to 5-fold less potent than L-Trp in the HEK293 cell-based IP-1 assay. However, in vivo L-Phe is a robust insulin secretagogue similar to L-Trp, possibly reflecting the aggregate effect of direct activation of GPR142 in pancreatic islets and an indirect effect through incretin hormones on insulin secretion via activating the receptor expressed in the gut. In <italic>Gpr142</italic>-deficient mice, the glucose-lowering effect of L-Phe is still intact, revealing the presence of alternate sensing pathways for this amino acid. A candidate receptor is Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), which can be activated by L-amino acids in conjunction with extracellular calcium [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Cinacalcet, an allosteric CaSR agonist, was reported to lower glucose in rats [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, L-Phe regulation of gut hormones was inhibited by a CaSR antagonist in vitro [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Worthy of investigation is the physiological role of CaSR as an L-Phe sensor in the regulation of glucose metabolism in vivo, although the pleiotropic effects of CaSR antagonists and severe phenotypes of the whole-body knockout [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] may present technical challenges.</p><p>We show that GPR142 is critically required for GIP and insulin secretion stimulated by refeeding. Given the relatively low content of total protein (~20% w/w), Trp and Phe (total ~1% w/w) in normal rodent chow, intuitively it seemed surprising that <italic>Gpr142</italic>deficiency had such a significant impact on GIP and insulin after refeeding (40&#x02013;50% lower than controls). It is important to note that in the fasting/refeeding experimental setting, animals consumed a very large meal in a short period of time (~35 mg/gram body weight in 30 minutes). Thus the amount of Trp/Phe ingested in the meal (~350 mg/kg body weight) approaches the doses for these amino acids used in pharmacological studies and can be expected to have a major contribution to postprandial hormone secretion. Other macronutrient components of the diet&#x02013;carbohydrates and fats&#x02013;presumably can induce incretin and insulin secretion normally in the absence of GPR142, since these hormones in the knockout mice still showed a significant rise after refeeding compared to fasted levels. It is intriguing that postprandial glycemia was not significantly different from control mice despite lower insulin levels in <italic>Gpr142</italic>-deficient mice. Emerging cell type-specific RNAseq data from pancreatic islets suggest GPR142 is not only expressed in &#x003b2; cells but also present in non-&#x003b2; endocrine cells [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and therefore suggest a possible role in regulation of other islet hormones. Additionally, as GIP can increase glucagon secretion in some contexts [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] while GLP-1 suppresses glucagon [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], GPR142 may also have indirect effects on glucagon secretion via its action on incretin hormones. We did not detect significant differences in glucagon levels in peripheral plasma between <italic>Gpr142</italic>knockout and control mice (data not shown), but cannot rule out a possible role of glucagon in maintaining refed glycemia since peripheral glucagonemia may not reflect its portal concentrations which determines its actions on hepatic glucose output. Additional in vitro islet glucagon secretion studies as well as in vivo measurement of portal glucagon levels may be needed to ascertain a possible role of GPR142 in the regulation of glucagon.</p><p>In the absence of an exogenous amino acid challenge, metabolic abnormalities of <italic>Gpr142</italic>-deficient mice are modest, even when subjected to high-fat diet (60 kcal% fat) feeding to induce obesity and metabolic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157298.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). These include a non-significant trend in increased body weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157298.s005">S5A Fig</xref>), a ~20 mg/dL increase in fasting glycemia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157298.s005">S5B Fig</xref>) without any significant change in insulin levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157298.s005">S5C&#x02013;S5F Fig</xref>), and a 50% increase in plasma non-HDL-cholesterol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157298.s008">S3 Table</xref>). The mildness of the metabolic dysfunction in <italic>Gpr142</italic>-deficient mice is not unexpected as multiple pathways likely exist that provide redundancies for optimal protein and amino acid sensing at the whole body level. Furthermore, the phenotype of genetic deficiency for a GPCR does not necessarily predict the efficacy that may be achieved by pharmacological agonists of the same GPCR. Indeed, FFAR1 is an example for which the knockout mice are normoglycemic even when challenged on an insulin resistant background [<xref rid="pone.0157298.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157298.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], while pharmacological agonists show robust glucose-lowering efficacy.</p><p>Finally, we show that a synthetic GPR142 agonist recapitulates the effects of L-Trp on insulin, GIP, and GLP-1, and improves glucose disposal in vivo. This is the first report of GPR142 agonists having a secretagogue effect on incretin hormones, in addition to that on insulin. The insulin secretagogue activities of L-Trp and the synthetic GPR142 agonist were similar in cultured murine islets and human islets, suggesting the glycemic efficacy of the mechanism observed in animals is likely to translate to man. In conclusion, GPR142 agonists may represent a novel therapeutic approach that leverages amino acid sensing pathways in both the gastrointestinal tract and pancreatic islets for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157298.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Plasma hormone levels after L-Tryptophan oral dosing in mice.</title><p>L-Trp was dosed p.o. at 150 or 500 mg/kg to overnight fasted 8-week-old normal C57 male mice at T = 0.
