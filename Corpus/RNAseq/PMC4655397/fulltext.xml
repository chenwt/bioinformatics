Here, we aimed to explore the innate immune system and detoxification mechanism of the deep sea mussel <italic>Bathymodiolus platifrons</italic> collected from a methane seep in the South China Sea. We sequenced the transcriptome of the mussels&#x02019; gill, foot and mantle tissues and generated a transcriptomic database containing 96,683 transcript sequences. Based on GO and KEGG annotations, we reported transcripts that were related to the innate immune system, heavy metal detoxification and sulfide metabolic genes. Our in-depth analysis on the isoforms of peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) that have different cellular location and potentially differential selectivity towards peptidoglycan (PGN) from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were differentially expressed in different tissues. We also reported a potentially novel form of metallothionein and the production of phytochelatin in <italic>B. platifrons</italic>, which has not been reported in any of its coastal relative <italic>Mytilus</italic> mussel species. Overall, the present study provided new insights into heavy metal and sulfide metabolism in <italic>B. platifrons</italic> and can be served as the basis for future molecular studies on host-symbiont interactions in cold seep mussels.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>In deep sea hydrothermal vent and hydrocarbon seep ecosystems, chemosynthetic microbes are the primary producers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Symbiosis between vent or seep macro-faunal such as mussels, snails, shrimp, tubeworms and crabs and chemosynthetic microbes is a common adaptive mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In these symbiotic systems, the microbial biomass serves as either the major or the sole food source of the host<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Vent and seep effluents are also known to enrich in heavy metal, sulfide and different hydrocarbon species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Hence, in addition to acquisition of chemosynthetic microbes as symbionts, both vent and seep macro-fauna have to adapt to a highly toxic chemical environment. Among different deep sea macro-fauna, Bathymodiolid mussels represent one of the highly specialized animals to vent and seep ecosystems. These deep sea mussels are evolved with the mechanisms to acquire special nutritional advantage from chemosynthetic bacteria and to tolerate a range of highly toxic chemicals. These adaptive features have enabled Bathymodiolid mussels to flourish and dominate hydrothermal vents, cold methane/sulfide-hydrocarbon seeps, and other sites of organic enrichment (e.g., sunken wood and whale bones) in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>Bathymodiolid mussels are capable of acquiring chemoautotrophic bacteria as their major nutritional food source<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Instead of a vertical transmission of microbial symbionts, Bathymodiolid mussels actively acquire thiotrophic and/or methanotrophic gamma-proteobacteria starting from juvenile stage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. These bacterial symbionts are maintained in bacteriocytes, a type of hemocytes with specialized cellular compartment for the storage of symbiotic bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Bacteriocytes may be absorbed via phagocytosis occasionally for nutritional purposes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. To date, it remains unclear how Bathymodiolid <italic>mussels</italic> distinguish pathogens from symbionts and how symbionts avoid triggering adverse immune responses from the host.</p><p>Bathymodiolid mussels have also been reported to accumulate high concentration of heavy metals, and tolerate high levels of toxic hydrocarbons and sulfide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. However, majority of the studies concerning heavy metal accumulation and sulfide detoxification focused on vent mussels. For instance, Metallothionein genes from several vent dwelling <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> species have been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. A recent high-throughput sequencing analysis of the vent mussel <italic>Bathymodiolus azoricus</italic> has revealed an extensive collection of innate immune transcripts in the gill<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. However, the metabolism potential of the vent mussel in term of heavy metal and sulfide detoxification were not explored.</p><p>The objective of this study was to generate a comprehensive transcriptome database for the methane seep mussel <italic>Bathymodiolus platifrons</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). To gain an insight into the adaptive features of the seep mussel, we focused on genes related to immune function and detoxification. We perform in-depth analysis on these functional genes and analyzed their gene expression pattern in the gill, mantle and foot. This work extended our understanding on the mechanisms of detoxification and introduced new perspective on the mechanism of symbiont acquisition in Bathymodiolid mussels.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>De novo</italic> assembly and functional annotation of <italic>B. platifrons</italic> transcriptome</title><p>The mitochondrial COI and NADH4 gene sequences of the specimen had highest similarity (99% and 100%, respectively) to the respective <italic>B. platifrons</italic> sequences from Okinawa Trough, Hatoma Knoll<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. We produced five Gbp clean data (approximately 55 million clean reads) from each of the three tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>). Over 98% clean Illumina reads in all three tissues exceeded Q20, indicating high quality of the sequencing data. The raw sequencing data have been submitted to the Short Read Archive (SRA) of NCBI under accession number SRP035485. The final transcriptome generated from Trinity <italic>de novo</italic> assembling contained 96,683 transcript sequences. The length of the transcripts ranged from 200 to 24,272&#x02009;bp, with an average length of 673&#x02009;bp and N50 value of 983&#x02009;bp. The statistics for the data output and <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. The length distribution of all transcripts is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1</xref>. In total, 40,935 (42.3%) transcripts had at least one significant hit in the NCBI non-redundant (nr), Swiss-Prot, COG and KEGG protein database. The functional annotation results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. The COG and KEGG functional categories for the annotated transcripts are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>, respectively. There were 14,656 (39.5%) nr-annotated transcripts assigned to major Gene Ontology (GO) categories, i.e. &#x02018;Biological Process&#x02019;, &#x02018;Cellular Component&#x02019;, and &#x02018;Molecular Function&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>).

All the 458 core proteins have at least one match in the current <italic>B. platifrons</italic> transcriptome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental data file 1</xref>). The average percentage of identity of alignment was 70% (S.D. 12.7%).

There were 1,402 bacterial transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>, indicated by an asterisk). Approximately 0.2%, 0.09% and 0.12% of the clean Illumina reads from the gill, foot and mantle, respectively, were mapped to these bacterial transcripts. The LCA assignment algorithm assigned 225 bacterial transcripts to Methylococcaceae and 367 to Bradyrhizobiaceae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>). In general, transcripts assigned to Methylococcaceae were highly expressed in the gill while those assigned to Bradyrhizobiaceae were highly expressed in the foot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental data file 2</xref>). Among those 225 bacterial transcripts to Methylococcaceae, metabolic functional genes that play essential role in methane oxidation, sulfur reduction and nitrite/nitrate reduction were recovered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Function of dominant transcripts</title><p>Close to half of the dominant transcripts (top 5% transcripts in term of total expression level) have no match to proteins in any public database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3B</xref>).

As quantification accuracy is positively correlated with sequence coverage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, only 7,304 transcripts that have at least 750 clean reads (equivalent to 5&#x02009;ppm total mapped reads) mapped to all three examined tissues in summation were considered in the differential expression analysis. In each pairwise comparison, differentially expressed transcripts was defined as log2(ratio) values greater than 2 SD from the mean. The mean, SD and cutoff log2(ratio) values for differentially expressed transcripts in each pairwise comparison were listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>. We focused on transcripts that shown distinctively higher expression level in one of the examined tissues when compared with the other two. We found that transcripts that were dominantly expressed in gill [transcripts highly expressed in the gill in both gill-to-mantle (G-to-M) and gill-to-foot (G-to-F) comparisons] are enriched with genes involved in immune system (<italic>GO:0002376-immune system process</italic>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, the GO term is highlighted in red color). Both foot (transcripts highly expressed in the foot in G-to-F and foot-to-mantle (F-to-M) comparisons) and mantle dominant transcripts (transcripts highly expressed in the mantle in both G-to-M and F-to-M comparisons) were enriched with genes with developmental functions/regulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). In accord to the biomineralization function of mantle in bivalves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, the term <italic>ion transport</italic> (GO:0006811) was found to be enriched in the mantle dominant transcript list. More detail analyses on mantle dominant transcripts were reported in Sun <italic>et al.</italic> (Submitted).</p><p>As we were aiming at generating a database for <italic>B. platifrons</italic>, we did not have replications on our RNAseq data. Hence, we verified the tissue dominant pattern of gene expression detected from RNAseq using qRT-PCR. Different from the RNAseq data, the qRT-PCR experiments were conducted with 3 biological replicates (i.e. 3 individuals) and 2 experimental repeats per biological replicate. We randomly selected 10 transcripts for qRT-PCR quantification from each of the above tissue dominant transcript list. In general, the qRT-PCR results were in good agreement to the result of RNAseq quantification, as indicated by positive linear correlations and rather high Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (R<sup>2</sup> for Gill-to-Foot: 0.9582; R<sup>2</sup> for Gill-to-Mantle: 0.9697; R<sup>2</sup> for Foot-to-Mantle: 0.8532; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>). This result indicated the high reliability of our RNAseq-based comparison of tissue dominant gene expression patterns. Annotation information and the relative expression level as calculated from RNAseq and qRT-PCR results were provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S4</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Phytochelatin synthase and dominant expression of metallothioneins</title><p>Phytochelatin, the oligomer of glutathione is one of the major molecules directly involved in metal ion detoxification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. We detected one transcript (Unigene479_All) best matched to glutathione gamma-glutamylcysteinyltransferase 3, or phytochelatin synthase (PSC) from the Pacific Oyster <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic>. Unigene479_All did not show substantial variation in the three examined tissue. Alignment of <italic>B. platifrons</italic> PCS protein sequence with the orthologs from mollusks (<italic>C. gigas</italic>, <italic>Aplysia californica</italic>), urochordate (<italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>), nematode (<italic>C. elegans</italic>), and plant (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) revealed that the N-terminal PC synthase domain in <italic>B. platifrons</italic> PCS (pfam domain no. PF05023, HMM prediction evalue 4.1<sup>e&#x02212;79</sup>) is highly conserved, but the C-terminal region is highly variable (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). This result is consistent with the alignment result of PCSs from plant, yeast and nematode<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Searching through the current transcriptome assembly, we found that the enzymes involved in major reactions in biosynthesis of phytochelatin were detected but did not show drastic expressional variation (not exceeding a two-fold difference) in the three examine tissues (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). Nonetheless, our data suggested that the mussel is able to produce PC in all examined tissues. PCS sequences were also recovered in <italic>B. azoricus</italic> transcriptome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>), as revealed by Blastp search of Unigene479 against the DeepSeaVent database, the customized protein database derived from <italic>B. azoricus</italic> gill transcriptome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. <italic>B. platifrons</italic> PCS clustered with PCS from <italic>C. gigas</italic> and <italic>Aplysia californica</italic> in the phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>), suggesting that the PCS in both <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> mussel transcriptomes are unlikely to be originated from parasitic organisms.</p><p>We then examined metallothionein (MT), a well-studied metal chelating protein. All three MT transcripts (Unigene42054, CL8066.Contig1, CL8066.Contig2) were predominantly expressed in all the three examined <italic>B. platifrons</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S5</xref>). Former studies on the MT from <italic>B. azoricus</italic> and <italic>B. thermophiles</italic> reported two MT variants, MT-10 and MT-20<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Our phylogenetic analysis suggested that, while Unigene42054 is homologous to the MT-20 cluster, CL8066.Contig1 and CL8066.Contig2 are clearly non-homologous to either <italic>Mytilidae</italic> or vertebrate MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). In fact, while CL8066.Contig1_All were poorly aligned to <italic>Daphnia pulex</italic> MT (bitscore 33.5, Evalue 1.8), CL8066.Contig2_All has no significant match in nr (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S5</xref>). However, the metallothionein-like proteins encoded by these two transcripts contain seven Cys-Xaa-Cys motifs (indicated by pale red boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>), suggesting their potential role in metal ion binding. On the other hand, <italic>B. platifrons</italic> MT-20 (product of Unigene42054) contains nine of Cys-Xaa-Cys motifs (indicated by pale red boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>) that are conserved within Mytilidae. Comparing to the MT-20 from <italic>B. thermophilus</italic> and <italic>B. azoricus, however, B. platifrons</italic> MT-20 as well as <italic>M. edilus</italic> MT-20 has one less Cys-Xaa-Cys motif at the 55<sup>th</sup>&#x02013;57<sup>th</sup> residue (indicated by pale green box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sulfur metabolism</title><p>We detected four transcripts of sulfite reductase (three alpha and one beta component), which catalyzes the oxidation of sulfide to sulfite, and two of sulfite oxidase, which catalyzes the oxidation of sulfite to sulfate, in the current <italic>B. platifrons</italic> transcriptome. Both sulfite oxidase transcripts were predominantly expressed in gill (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Based on the nr annotation, three of the sulfite reductase transcripts (Unigene8776_All, Unigene19303_All and Unigene58781_All) were from eukaryotic source while the remaining one transcripts (Unigene46612_All) was from methane-oxidizing bacteria. We also detected three transcripts annotated as sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR), a membrane bound mitochondrial protein catalyzing the formation of polysulfide from sulfide using a quinone molecule<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Two of the SQR transcripts shown a relative higher expression in gill, followed by foot and then mantle.

The list included pattern recognizing proteins peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP), Toll-like receptor and bactericidal permeability increasing protein (BPI), downstream transcription factor Lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor (LITAF), inflammatory cytokines interleukin-17 (IL-17) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), antimicrobial peptides big defensing (BD) and macin. Certain transcripts of PGRP, BPI, TLR, IL-17, BD and macin exhibited distinctive tissue expression pattern (at least three fold differences) in either one of the three pairwise comparisons (gill-to-foot, gill-to-mantle, foot-to-mantle)) (highlighted by colored box in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S6</xref>). To further investigate the potential molecular mechanisms of the host-symbiont interaction, in the following paragraphs, we focused on the PGRP, one of the crucial microbial associated molecule pattern recognition proteins, for sequence homology analysis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Differential expression of peptidoglycan recognition protein isoforms</title><p>In the current <italic>B. platifrons</italic> transcriptome, 11 transcripts were matched to PGRP sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S6</xref>). Two of the 11 transcripts were grouped under the cluster CL8290 and eight under CL2060. All the PGRPs encoded by the transcripts in CL2060 were predicted to contain an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a propeptide and then by the amidase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>). This result indicated the differences in cellular localization of different PGRPs isoforms. It is unknown at this stage if the PGPR encoded by Unigene3808 is secretory or not as Unigene3808 is a 3&#x02032; partial sequence. Based on sequence homology, however, this transcript was likely to be derived from the same gene as the contigs from CL2060 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Multiple sequence alignment with insect and vertebrate PGRPs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S8</xref>) revealed that all the amino acid residues essential for zinc binding (black arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and amidase activity (purple arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> were conserved in all the 11 PGRP transcripts. Several insect based studies revealed two variable residues (indicated by red asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A,B</xref>) that might affect peptidoglycan (PGN) binding selectivity towards Lysine-type (Lys-type) and diaminopimelic acid-type (Dap-type) PGNs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. We found that these two transcript variants also exist among <italic>B. platifrons</italic> PGRPs. For the PGRPs encoded by transcripts from CL8290 and CL2060, the two residues corresponding to the two variable residues in insect PGRPs were Gly/Arg-Trp. For PGRP encoded by Unigene3808_All, the two corresponding residues were Gln-Phe. These suggested that PGRPs encoded by transcripts from CL8290 and CL2060 might favor the binding of the Dap-type PGNs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> while that from Unigene3808_All might favor binding of Lys-type PGNs (indicated by red asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Differential expression analysis based on our RNAseq data revealed that Unigene3808 had highest expression level in the foot while transcripts from CL8290 and CL2060 shown higher expression in the gill and mantle. Such differential expression pattern of these PGRP transcripts were confirmed by qRT-PCR assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>) using primers specifically recognizing PGRP isoforms with Gly-Trp, Arg-Trp or Gln-Phe residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate that isoforms of PGRP may have differential selectivity towards different types of PGNs, and with different abundance in different tissues.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our primary objective was to produce a comprehensive transcriptome database for each examined tissue for the methane seep dwelling <italic>B. platifrons</italic>. Hence, we pooled the total RNA of each tissue from three individuals during the cDNA library preparation step to maximize the sequencing coverage with the same amount of output. Because there were no replicates, our differential gene expression comparisons among the three tissues only targeted genes that were remarkably different. As quantification accuracy is positively correlated with sequence coverage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, transcripts with low coverage (with less than 5&#x02009;ppm total mapped reads) were filtered out. Similar filtering approach (10&#x02009;ppm total mapped reads as cutoff) was adopted in a coral transcriptomic study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Our qRT-PCR assays results of 30 differential expressed transcripts shown good agreement with the RNAseq results, indicating that our approach on differential tissue expression analysis was valid.</p><p>In the current study, we unexpectedly recovered 1,402 microbial transcripts in our <italic>B. platifrons</italic> transcriptome assembly, in which up to 16% of these transcripts were likely to be originated from the methanotroph symbiont. Bacterial genes from the bacterial family Methylococcaceae were also detected in a transcriptomic study of <italic>B. azoricus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In prokaryotes, mRNA is mature upon transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> and only a small fraction of mRNAs is polyadenylated at any given time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Instead of stabilizing the RNA molecules, polyadenylation of RNA promotes degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Hence, the microbial transcripts in <italic>B. platifrons</italic> transcriptome may represent a fraction of predominant bacterial mRNA that have high turnover rate. While the discovery of transcripts related to methane oxidation was not surprising, the gill specific expression of denitrification genes was unexpected. This may indicate that the methanotrophic endosymbionts might be actively catalyzing the production of ammonium via denitrification. A previous study has reported Bathymodiolid mussels to actively assimilate ammonium and free amino acids but not nitrate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The authors of that study estimated that, in the presence of methane, the acquisition rate of ammonium correlated with the carbon fixation rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Our transcriptomic data suggested that, in addition to acquiring host ammonia waste, the methanotrophic symbiont may also be able to produce ammonia as their nitrogen source. On the other hand, substantial number of foot dominant bacterial transcripts was assigned to the nitrogen-fixing bacterial family Bradyrhizobiaceae. To date, no reports have described endo- or ectosymbiosis in the foot of any <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> mussel. Dang <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> recovered diverse nifH and nifH-like gene sequences from the surface sediments of the methane seep in the Okhotsk Sea In addition, Rhizobia have been isolated from organic rich sapropel layers in the Mediterranean seabed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. These studies suggested the presence of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the sediment of the methane seep and these nitrogen-fixing bacteria might be attached to the surface of the foot tissue of the mussel during sediment digging. Nonetheless, the presence of Bradyrhizobiaceae bacteria in the foot has to be validated by 16&#x02009;s amplicon pyrosequencing.</p><p>In the present study, we found that a number of pattern recognition proteins such as PGRP, BPI, Toll-like receptors were highly expressed in the gill compared to the foot and mantle. Yet, our RNAseq data showed that different isoforms of the same gene the expression of immune system genes can exhibit highly variable expression pattern. For instance, while all <italic>B. platifrons</italic> PGRP isoforms contain amidase domain, they may have different binding affinity toward Gram-positive bacterial (Lys-type) and Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacilli (Dap-type) PGNs. Our RNAseq data indicated that the Dap-type PGNs binding PGRPs have a much higher expression level in the gill compared to the foot. The Lys-type PGNs binding PGRP, on the other hand, exhibited a slightly higher expression level in the foot compared to the gill. It is worth noting that the selectivity of PGRPs to Lys-type and Dap-type PGNs may not be absolute<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. At this stage, we cannot confirm if different PGRPs isoforms in <italic>B. platifrons</italic> really exhibit selectivity toward different types of PGN. Nevertheless, we speculate that the expression patterns of different PGRP isoforms were related to the gram-negative methanotrophic symtbiont in the gill of <italic>B. platifrons</italic>. In insects, the PGRP-LB has been shown to be a key factor in suppressing virulent bacteria. It has been suggested that the outermembrane protein OmpA of the endosymbiotic bacteria <italic>Sodalis glossinidus</italic> can interact with the Tse-Tse fly PGRP-LB (one of the long PGRP splice variants). Binding of OmpA to PGRP-LB lead to suppression of the immunodeficiency (Imd) pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> and thereby the insect host immune response. Given that 1) PGRP-LB is required in insect-symbiont interaction, 2) the C-terminal sequence of major outer membrane protein (MopB) of the methanotrophic bacteria <italic>Methylococcus capsulatus</italic> shows significant identity to the OmpA family<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, and 3) these PGRPs were dominantly expressed in the gill, we propose that <italic>B. platifrons</italic> PGRPs is a good candidate gene for studying the mechanism of immunotolerance of the <italic>Bathymodiolus</italic> mussel host to the methane-oxidizing bacteria.</p><p>The endemism of <italic>B. platiftrons</italic> in both hydrothermal vent and methane seeps in the Pacific Ocean<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> suggested that this Bathymodiolids species has the metabolic capacity to metabolize a range of toxic chemical substances in these habitats. Distinctively high heavy metal concentration is one of the signposts of hydrothermal vent and methane seep habitats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. High concentration of heavy metal ions promotes the production of reactive oxygen species, which could be hazardous to cellular metabolic reactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Hemostasis of heavy metal ions is therefore of crucial importance in maintaining a stable intracellular chemical environment. Up-regulation of MTs, a class of ubiquitously expressing low molecular weight cysteine-rich metal ion binding proteins implicated in heavy metal homeostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, has been documented in various bivalves after exposure to heavy metals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. The dominant expression of MT in <italic>B. platifrons</italic> indicated high heavy metal level in the seep environment. A group of MT-like proteins, which contains seven Cys-Xaa-Cys motifs but did not show any conservation (except the Cys-Xaa-Cys motifs) to any known MTs, was recovered from the current <italic>B. platifrons</italic> transcriptome. Further <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments are needed to determine the affinity of this MT-like protein toward different metal ions.</p><p>One of the surprising finding in term of heavy metal detoxification was the discovery of glutathione (GSH) gamma-glutamylcysteinyltransferase, or phytochelatin synthase (PCS). Phytochelatin(PC) contains repeats of &#x003c5;-GluCys dipeptide followed by a terminal Gly. In the presence of metal ion, PCS catalyzed the transpeptidation of the &#x003c5;-GluCys moiety of GSH onto a second GSH molecule to form repeats of PC, or a &#x003c5;-GluCys dipeptide-metal complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic> study using PC from plants demonstrated that PC preferably chelates Cd, but can also form complex with Ag and Cu<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. PCS has been mainly characterized in plant, yeast and parasitic nematodes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Hence, we did suspect that the recovery of PCS in <italic>B. platifrons</italic> transcriptome might have been due to the contamination by small parasitic organisms such as nematodes. These small organisms were hard to be seen and removed during sampling. Recently, however, PCS has been reported in several molluscan species, including the Pacific Oyster <italic>C. gigas</italic> genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. More importantly, sequence alignment as well as phylogenetic analysis suggested that the PCS in <italic>B. platifrons</italic> transcriptome clustered with the PCS from <italic>C. gigas</italic>. In fact, PCS was also expressed in the gill of <italic>B. azoricus</italic> (as indicated by the result of reciprocal blast search, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6</xref>). This suggested that <italic>B. azoricus</italic> also has the potential to produce PC. This result further supported that the PCS sequence in <italic>B. platifrons</italic> transcriptome was not from a contamination source. There is so far no report of PCS gene or production of PC in any member of Mytilidae. This may imply that either PCS gene is specific to Bathymodiolid mussels among Mytilidae or previous high-throughput studies on coastal member of Mytilidae (such as <italic>Mytilus</italic> spps.) have missed out PCS gene expression, owing to limitations on sequencing or annotation. Detection of PC in <italic>B. platifrons</italic> tissues by analytical chemistry method is required to validate if the mussel is really producing PC <italic>in vivo</italic>. It will also be essential to examine if PC biosynthesis increase in response to heavy metal administration.</p><p>Hydrogen sulfide is another major component in vent and seep effluent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The compound is highly inhibitive to aerobic respiration. While the blood of tubeworm and another bivalve were capable of buffering the acidifying effect of hydrogen sulfide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>, the blood of Bathymodiolid mussels did not show such buffering characteristics, implying that there is no sulfide-binding protein in its blood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Instead, it was suggested that sulfide oxidase activity in both the symbiont-containing gill tissue and peripheral lining of other symbiont-free tissues serves as &#x0201c;peripheral defense&#x0201d; line to oxidize any sulfide that enters the cells to sulfite<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. In the current study, we found that, except sulfite oxidase, the expression of mitochondrial enzymes that participate in sulfide oxidation or sulfide detoxification did not show drastic differential expression among the three examined tissues. This finding is in accordance with the existence of a peripheral defense line against sulfide in both symbiont-containing and symbiont-free tissues. Comparing to sulfite reductase, transcripts of SQR showed a much higher expression value (rpkm). SQR catalyzes the formation of polysulfide from sulfide. SQR in lugworms and other marine invertebrates that inhabit high sulfide environments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref> avoid elevation of intracellular sulfide concentrations. Abundant expression of SQR in <italic>B. platifrons</italic> suggested that the mussel may mainly remove sulfide by the mean of SQR catalyzing polysulfide formation.</p><p>High levels of thiotaurine has been found in the tissues of vent and seep invertebrates, leading to the hypothesis that the unusual amino acid is involved in the detoxification of sulfide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. In the thiotrophic symbiont harboring <italic>B. septemdierum</italic>, the expression level of the taurine transporter TAUT was higher in the gill compared to the foot and mantle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. This result has led Kioto <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref> to propose that the mussel gill epithelial cells supply sulfur to the thiotrophic symbionts with thiotaurine and hypotaurine by TAUT. In <italic>B. platifrons</italic> from Sagami Bay, however, although the mussel did not contain thiotrophic symbionts, TAUT expression also increased in response to a continuous exposure to sulfide (at 1 atm)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>, further suggesting that the involvement of TAUT in sulfide detoxification. In the current study, however, the expression level of TAUT was higher in the mantle than in the gill. Such inconsistent finding might be due to a lower sulfide level in the methane seep environment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We presented a transcriptomic database for the cold seep mussel <italic>B. platifrons</italic>. We highlighted a repertoire of genes involved in the innate immune system, heavy metal binding and sulfide detoxification. The expression patterns of these genes in in the gill, foot and mantle were also reported. In particular, we reported a potentially novel metal binding MT-like protein and the possibility of PC production in <italic>B. platifrons</italic>. Our in-depth analysis of PGRP, BD and macin demonstrated that different isoforms of the same genes may exhibit a very different tissue expression pattern. These expressional differences may be related to functional variation among isoforms. Overall, we believe that our transcriptomic data will serve as an important reference for future research on adaptation Bathymodiolid<italic>s</italic>and host-symbiont interaction of Bathymodiolid mussels.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Sample collection and preparation for Illumina sequencing</title><p>Mussel samples were collected on June 19, 2013 using the manned submersible Jiaolong.

Upon arrival at the sea surface, the gill, the foot and the mantle tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) from three specimens of <italic>B. platifrons</italic> were dissected and stored individually in RNAlater (Life Technologies, USA).

Around 1&#x02009;g of gill, 4&#x02009;g of adductor foot muscle and 4&#x02009;g of mantle tissues from each mussel were used for RNA extraction.
