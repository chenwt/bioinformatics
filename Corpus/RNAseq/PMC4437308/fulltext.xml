However, a direct link between NANOG and SCCs remains to be established. Here, we show that inducible overexpression of NANOG in mouse skin epithelia favours the malignant conversion of skin papillomas induced by chemical carcinogenesis, leading to increased SCC formation. Gene expression analyses in pre-malignant skin indicate that NANOG induces genes associated to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Some of these genes are directly activated by NANOG, including EMT-associated genes <italic>Zeb1, Zeb2</italic>, <italic>Twist1, Prrx1</italic> and <italic>miR-21</italic>. Finally, endogenous NANOG binds to the promoters of theses genes in human SCC cells and, moreover, NANOG induces EMT features in primary keratinocytes. These results provide <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for the oncogenic role of NANOG in squamous cell carcinomas.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>NANOG is a homeodomain containing transcription factor that together with OCT4 and SOX2 constitute the core regulators of pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.

In this study, (1) we use an epithelial inducible transgenic mouse model to analyze the effect of NANOG in the generation of SCCs, and (2) we identify NANOG as a cell autonomous activator of EMT in epithelial cells.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>NANOG promotes proliferation in the epidermis</title><p>We have previously reported that NANOG is expressed in the basal layer of stratified epithelia in normal mice, including the skin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.

To address the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of NANOG in oncogenesis, we have used a tissue specific doxycycline-inducible <italic>Nanog</italic> transgenic mouse model. This model is similar to a previously described <italic>Oct4</italic>-inducible mouse model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, in which a cassette containing a doxycycline-responsive element controlling <italic>Nanog</italic> expression is inserted downstream of the collagen 1a1 locus (<italic>Col1a1::tetO-Nanog</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. This transgenic mouse model was crossed with another available mouse model (<italic>K5-rtTA)</italic>, which has the bovine keratin 5 (K5) promoter directing the expression of the reverse tetracycline transactivator gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The combination of these transgenes (<italic>K5-rtTA;Col1a1::tetO-Nanog</italic>) provides a Tet-ON tool that allows the inducible expression of <italic>Nanog</italic> in the basal layer of the skin, which includes the stem cell compartments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p><p>We first examined whether transgenic <italic>Nanog</italic> was specifically expressed in the basal layer of stratified epithelium. We treated adult <italic>K5-rtTA</italic><sup><italic>tg/.</italic></sup>;<italic>Col1a1</italic><sup><italic>tetO-Nanog</italic>/&#x02009;+&#x02009;</sup>(abbreviated as TG) and their control littermates lacking the rtTA transactivator <italic>Col1a1</italic><sup><italic>tetO-Nanog</italic>/&#x02009;+&#x02009;</sup>(abbreviated as CTR) with doxycycline (DOX) in the drinking water (2&#x02009;mg/ml) for a period of 48&#x02009;hours. We observed <italic>Nanog</italic> overexpression selectively in tissues containing stratified epithelia, such as, forestomach, tongue, skin, and esophagus. As a negative control, we could not detect overexpression of transgenic <italic>Nanog</italic> in small intestine (non-stratified epithelial tissue) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p>We also performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) of NANOG to determine its expression in the basal layer of the skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Consistent with our previous study, NANOG was detected by IHC in CTR mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Also, as intended, after 48&#x02009;hr treatment with DOX, TG mice showed stronger NANOG staining in the basal layer of the skin compared to the CTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Of note, NANOG overexpression did not produce detectable histological alterations in the tail skin after 48&#x02009;hr of DOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>) or after continuous DOX administration during 9 months (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, at the levels of NANOG overexpression achieved with the <italic>K5</italic>-<italic>rtTA</italic> system, NANOG alone is not sufficient to alter the homeostasis of the skin.</p><p>To investigate the effect of NANOG in the context of mitogenic and inflammatory stimulation, we topically treated the tail skin of CTR and TG mice with 12-<italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). Four applications of TPA at 48&#x02009;hr intervals resulted in augmented epidermal thickness compared to CTR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D,E</xref>). This hyperplasia was accompanied by a clear increase in proliferating keratinocytes (detected by Ki67 staining) in the basal and suprabasal layers of TG mice compared to CTR ones, as well as a decrease of the differentiation marker LORICRIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1F</xref>). The mitogenic activity of NANOG in the epidermis is in agreement with our previous observations upon whole-body NANOG induction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and also with the recent finding that NANOG is activated by the TPA-target PKC&#x003b5;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. We conclude that NANOG has the capacity to augment epidermal proliferation and to impair differentiation under conditions of mitogenic stimulation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>NANOG promotes squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) formation</title><p>Recent reports have shown that NANOG is overexpressed in human and mouse SCCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. To address whether high levels of NANOG can contribute to tumorigenesis, we induced skin tumors using the classical two-stage chemical carcinogenesis protocol based on the mutagen 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and the promoter TPA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. We used CTR and TG mice in a C57BL/6 background, which is known to be resistant to carcinoma formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, and administered DOX throughout the entire protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). There were no significant differences in the kinetics of papilloma formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>), or in the total number and size of papillomas at the end of the experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2A and B</xref>). Interestingly, at around 20 weeks of treatment, tumors resembling SCCs started to appear exclusively in the TG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). In many cases (~40%), TG mice had to be sacrificed before the finalization of the observation period because carcinomas were larger than 1.5&#x02009;cm (humane endpoint) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>). All tumors were characterized at the end of the protocol or at the humane endpoint. As expected for the C57BL/6 background, all CTR tumors were benign papillomas. In contrast, a remarkable fraction of tumors (&#x0003e;15%) from the TG mice had progressed to SCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D,E</xref>). We confirmed NANOG overexpression in the TG papillomas and carcinomas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2D and E</xref>). We also noticed that the endogenous <italic>Nanog</italic> gene was upregulated in TG papillomas and carcinomas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2D</xref>), suggesting that transgenic <italic>Nanog</italic> may upregulate the expression of the endogenous <italic>Nanog</italic> allele. Interestingly, some <italic>Nanog-</italic>SCCs presented areas with spindle histology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>) and in one case we have detected metastasis to a lymph node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>). The protein and mRNA levels of NANOG were similarly high in the metastasis and the SCC from the same animal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2F and G</xref>).</p><p>To further explore the association between NANOG and skin tumorigenesis, we analyzed NANOG protein and mRNA levels in different cell lines previously obtained from DMBA/TPA-induced tumors. Spindle SCC-derived cell lines (CarB, CarC and MSC11A5) and non-spindle SCC-derived cell line (MSC11B9) expressed higher levels of NANOG, compared to cell lines derived from papillomas (PB) or transformed keratinocytes (PDV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p><p>Together, these results demonstrate that NANOG can promote malignant progression to skin squamous cell carcinoma.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>NANOG induces EMT targets in skin papillomas</title><p>To obtain mechanistic insight on how NANOG promotes skin tumorigenesis, we performed RNA-seq of CTR (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) and TG (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) papillomas. This analysis revealed a small number of differentially-expressed genes upregulated by transgenic <italic>Nanog</italic> expression (97 genes; see <bold>Table S1</bold>). We noted the presence of a high number of genes (up to 13 genes) previously associated to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<bold>Table S1</bold>). This was confirmed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of a number of published EMT signatures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We validated by qRT-PCR the upregulation of EMT drivers, such as <italic>Zeb1</italic>, <italic>Zeb2</italic>, <italic>Twist</italic> and <italic>Prrx1</italic>, and EMT mediators, such as <italic>Wnt5a</italic>, <italic>Vcan</italic>, <italic>Ncadh</italic> and <italic>Mmp2</italic> both in <italic>Nanog-</italic>papillomas and in <italic>Nanog-</italic>SCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Of note, downregulation of E-cadherin was also observed by qRT-PCR and IHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>), as well as upregulation of the mesenchymal marker VIMENTIN in <italic>Nanog</italic>-SCCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>).</p><p>Based on the above findings, we asked whether NANOG had the ability to initiate an EMT program in primary keratinocytes. For this, we extracted keratinocytes from CTR and TG neonates and induced <italic>Nanog</italic> expression by <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment with DOX for 48&#x02009;hr (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>). Interestingly, NANOG was able to upregulate a subset of EMT mediators in primary keratinocytes as soon as 48&#x02009;hr after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRs) have been also implicated as important regulators of EMT and malignancy, being particularly important miR-21, as inducer of EMT, and the miR-200 and miR-34 families, as negative regulators of EMT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. We examined the expression of these miRNAs in normal skin, papillomas and carcinomas. Interestingly, by qRT-PCR and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH), we found that miR-21 was significantly upregulated in the back skin, papillomas and SCCs after induction of <italic>Nanog</italic> for 30 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2G</xref>). In contrast, miRNAs from the miR-200 and miR-34 families were essentially unchanged between CTR and TG samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3C</xref>). It has been reported that NANOG requires phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) for efficient upregulation of <italic>miR-21</italic> in head and neck SCC cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In this regard, we found that NANOG-overexpressing papillomas also express high levels of pSTAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3F</xref>), thereby lending support to the above-mentioned link between NANOG and pSTAT3 in SCCs. The biological effects of miR-21 go beyond EMT and include the activation of oncogenic signaling pathways, as reflected by an increase in the phosphorylated forms of AKT (pAKT) and ERK (pERK)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.
