Using strand-specific RNA sequencing, we show that the up-regulated transcript is in fact a small RNA encoded on the opposite strand to the annotated Rv2660c. The transcript originates within a prophage and is expressed only in strains that carry PhiRv2. The small RNA contains both host and phage sequences and provides a useful biomarker to monitor bacterial starvation during infection and/or non-replicating persistence. Using different approaches we do not find any evidence of Rv2660c at the level of mRNA or protein. Further efforts to understand the mechanism by which Rv2660c improves efficacy of the H56 vaccine are likely to provide insights into the pathology and immunology of tuberculosis.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the British Medical Research Council (programme number U117581288) and the European Union FP7 program (SysteMTb HEALTH-F4-2010-241587) and the US National Institutes of Health (RO1 HL106804).

The total length of 173 nucleotides established by RACE is in good agreement with the largest prominent transcript identified by Northern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080047-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The blot also revealed a series of smaller transcripts with a particularly prominent one around 120 nucleotides in stationary phase. Since we identified only one TSS and no apparent terminators for ncRv12659, we assume that the smaller transcripts and possibly also the main transcript are a result of post-transcriptional processing of a longer primary transcript.</p><fig id="pone-0080047-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0080047.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Mapping of ncRv12659 in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv.</title><p>A.

In order to distinguish expression of the PhiRv2-derived ncRv12659 RNA from the 3&#x02032; tRNA signal in the absence of PhiRv2, we used two amplicons. One (5&#x02032; amplicon) had a forward primer within the PhiRv2-derived sequence, and hence this amplicon is present only in H37Rv (and other PhiRv2 positive strains). The second (3&#x02032; amplicon) was located entirely downstream of the tRNA repeat and hence this amplicon represents an <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> core sequence, present in both H37Rv and N0072 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080047-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The maximum value obtained for the 5&#x02032; amplicon in N0072 samples (3&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) was set as the baseline, since this region is not present in PhiRv2-negative strains and any 5&#x02032; signal from PhiRv2-negative strains should therefore be considered as noise. This method confirmed a 50-fold starvation-induced increase in RNA levels for the 5&#x02032; amplicon in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv compared to exponential phase levels, and a six-fold increase during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080047-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The 3&#x02032; amplicon was detected at a level approximately two-fold lower than the 5&#x02032; amplicon in H37Rv during exponential growth, with a marked reduction in the relative level in starvation and decreasing below baseline during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080047-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Finally, we observed a very low level of the 3&#x02032; amplicon from N0072 exponential phase samples and even less after starvation, implying that transcriptional readthrough from the tRNA operon is minimal and only the PhiRv2-derived promoter is induced by starvation. Moreover, since our qRT-PCR was not strand specific, the results for the 3&#x02032; amplicon, which corresponds to the middle of the proposed Rv2660c sequence, also demonstrate that there is no detectable expression of Rv2660c mRNA in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> N0072 during mouse infection.</p><fig id="pone-0080047-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0080047.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Expression of ncRv12659 during infection.</title><p>Mycobacterial RNA extracted from tissues of mice infected with PhiRv2-positive <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv or PhiRv2-negative <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> N0072 was compared to RNA from exponential and starved cultures of the same strains.

In the case of PhiRv2, this includes Rv2645 (a fusion of duplicated host sequence and a flap endonuclease-like domain), Rv2646 encoding a second integrase, and KorB-like repressor Rv2647. These genes are separated from the remaining inversely oriented PhiRv2 genes by an IS<italic>6110</italic> insertion.

Six of these probes corresponded to sequences contained in the overexpression construct and were therefore disregarded, leaving 21 probes representing 11 genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0080047-t002">Table 2</xref>). Thirteen of the probes (fold change 6&#x02013;113) mapped to a set of genomic loci containing partial duplications of a common core sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080047.s005">Figure S5</xref>). The repeat loci have been linked to diverse hypothetical protein products in different genome annotations, though the frameshifts present in the nucleotide alignment suggest that coding capacity is not conserved between the different copies.

Hence, it remains questionable if the Rv2660c protein exists.</p><p>The sequence of the proposed hypothetical Rv2660c protein has several unusual features. Most of the sequence is present in all strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and in the precursor-like mycobacterial strains represented by <italic>M. canettii</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080047-Supply1">[24]</xref>, but lacks primary sequence or structural homology with any annotated proteins outside of this group. The C-terminal region of Rv2660c corresponds to antisense translation of the 3&#x02032; portion of a valine tRNA molecule. In PhiRv2-positive strains, part of the Rv2660c nucleotide sequence has an imperfect duplication within the bacteriophage protein Rv2645. In some genome annotations the N-terminal region of Rv2660c is extended to include part of the Rv2661c sequence; other annotations include an alternative open reading frame on the opposite strand.</p><p>The starvation-induced sRNA transcript, ncRv12659, originates within the PhiRv2 prophage, and ncRv12659 is found only in strains that have retained PhiRv2. It is likely that PhiRv2 infected an early ancestor of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> complex, but has undergone progressive erosion with loss of tail genes and deletion from many extant clinical isolates. Our results are consistent with a model in which the ncRv12659 promoter would have had a primary role in gene expression in the free circular virion and is relatively repressed in the stable lysogen. Activation of the ncRv12659 promoter together with the Rv2659c integrase promoter in response to starvation may reflect the release of repression as part of a programme to initiate the lytic cycle of the phage. The decision between lysis and lysogeny has previously been shown to be tightly linked to the nutrient availability of the host in many phages e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080047-Los1">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080047-Williams2">[27]</xref>, and may explain why the ncRv12659 promoter responds so dramatically to starvation.</p><p>As described for other sRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080047-Arnvig1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080047-Lamichhane1">[10]</xref>, ncRv12659 accumulates to high levels during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection and provides a potential biomarker for detection of cells that are starved for nutrients as well as oxygen, and which may represent future persisters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080047-Betts1">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080047-Voskuil1">[6]</xref>; in this case specifically for PhiRv2-positive strains. The observation that only the 5&#x02032; portion of ncRv12659 is detected during infection is intriguing and suggests premature termination of transcription or internal processing followed by degradation of a less stable 3&#x02032; portion of the transcript. It may be that the inclusion of part of the tRNA has a stabilising effect on the RNA.</p><p>The presence of host as well as phage sequences raised the possibility that expression of the sRNA transcript could affect the physiology of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and overexpression of ncRv12659 did result in impaired growth as well as perturbations in the transcription profile of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv. More than fifty genes showed significant changes, the most highly up-regulated genes being PhiRv2 genes and a novel repeat locus. The observed induction of Rv2659c and massive increase in ncRv12659 level after transformation with pMSC12659 could result from sequestration of a repressor protein by provision of multiple copies of its binding site. We did not identify significant sequence similarities in the regions upstream of the TSSs of the up-regulated repeat loci. The mechanism by which over-expression of ncRv12659 leads to enhanced transcription of these sequences, and their potential coding (or non-coding) function remains to be determined. We conclude that the 5&#x02032; end of ncRv12659 provides a useful marker for phenotypic analysis of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> during infection with PhiRv2-positive strains, but that the distinctive transcriptional up-regulation of this locus in the starvation model is unlikely to play a direct role in the enhanced efficacy of the H56 vaccine against reactivation disease.</p><p>If Rv2660c represents a misannotation, how can we account for the beneficial effect of its addition to the H56 vaccine? There may be a fortuitous cross-reaction between the T cell response elicited by the recombinant Rv2660c protein and some as yet undefined antigen of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. This would be consistent with the observed detection of T cell responses to Rv2660c in a panel of infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080047-Govender1">[28]</xref>. Alternatively, but somewhat unlikely, there may be some highly specific environmental but yet unidentified condition that the bacteria encounter <italic>in vivo</italic> under which expression of Rv2660c is in fact induced. In light of the successful H56 vaccination data, identification of such a condition would provide an important insight into the physiology of latent infection. Finally, it's possible that fusion of the Rv2660c peptide to the remaining vaccine constituents has some beneficial effect on the way in which are processed and presented to T cells. Further efforts to understand the mechanism by which Rv2660c improves efficacy of the H56 vaccine are likely to provide insights into the pathology and immunology of tuberculosis and possibly also provide a further understanding of why a promising vaccine candidate such as MV85A has failed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080047-Tameris1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080047-Tameris2">[30]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains and plasmids</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> DH5&#x003b1; was used for plasmid constructions and grown in LB broth or on LB agar.

Subsequently, cells were disrupted by ribolysing the samples at a setting of 6.5 for 30 secs at 4&#x000b0;C using 150 &#x000b5;m glass beads (SIGMA). Lysates were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The clarified lysate was filtered using 0.2 &#x000b5;m Millipore tubes (UFC30GV25). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay according to manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein disulfide bonds were reduced by adding 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and incubating for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Next, the free cysteine residues were alkylated by adding 10 mM iodoacetamide and incubating for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Excessive iodoacteamide was captured by addition of 12.5 M N-acetyl cysteine and incubation for 10 min at room temperature. Extracted protein samples were diluted at a ratio of 1&#x02236;5 with 0.05 M ammonium bicarbonate buffer to reach a urea concentration of &#x0003c;2 M. Sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega) was added at a ratio of 1&#x02236;100 enzyme&#x02236;substrate (weight/weight) and incubated for over night at 37&#x000b0;C with gentle shaking at 300 rpm. To stop the tryptic digest and to precipitate RapiGest the pH was lowered to 2 using 50% trifluoro acetic acid (TFA) followed by an incubation for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C with shaking at 500 rpm. Water-immiscible degradation products of RapiGest were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min. The cleared peptide solution was desalted with C18 reversed-phase columns (Waters). Prior to use, the C18 columns were activated with 100% acetonitrile (ACN), followed by equilibration with 2% ACN/0.1% TFA. After loading the sample, the columns were washed four times with 2% ACN/0.1% TFA.

Rv2660c peptides were measured in unscheduled selected reaction monitoring (SRM) acquisition mode on a 5500 QTRAP mass spectrometer (AB Sciex) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. The optimal 5 SRM transitions per peptide precursor, as well as the chromatographic retention time, were obtained from the Mtb Proteome Library <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0080047-Schubert1">[19]</xref>. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive mode using electrospray ionisation. The SRM transitions were acquired with a mass window of 0.7 half-maximum peak width (unit resolution) in Q1 and Q3, a cycle time of &#x0003c;2 s and a dwell time of 20 ms. Collision energies were calculated as follows: CE&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.044 * (m/z)+5.5 and CE&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.051 * (m/z)+0.5 for 2+ and 3+ charged precursor ions, respectively.
