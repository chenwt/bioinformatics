Eusociality in insects requires the evolution of two alternative phenotypes - workers, who sacrifice personal reproduction, and queens, who realize that reproduction. Extensive work on honeybees and ants has revealed the molecular basis of derived queen and worker phenotypes in highly eusocial lineages, but we lack equivalent deep-level analyses of wasps and of primitively eusocial species, the latter of which can reveal how phenotypic decoupling first occurs in the early stages of eusocial evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We sequenced 20 Gbp of transcriptomes derived from brains of different behavioral castes of the primitively eusocial tropical paper wasp <italic>Polistes canadensis</italic>. Surprisingly, 75% of the 2,442 genes differentially expressed between phenotypes were novel, having no significant homology with described sequences. Moreover, 90% of these novel genes were significantly upregulated in workers relative to queens. Differential expression of novel genes in the early stages of sociality may be important in facilitating the evolution of worker behavioral complexity in eusocial evolution. We also found surprisingly low correlation in the identity and direction of expression of differentially expressed genes across similar phenotypes in different social lineages, supporting the idea that social evolution in different lineages requires substantial <italic>de novo </italic>rewiring of molecular pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These genomic resources for aculeate wasps and first transcriptome-wide insights into the origin of castes bring us closer to a more general understanding of eusocial evolution and how phenotypic diversity arises from the same genome.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Phenotypic plasticity is a fundamental biological process that allows organisms to adapt to changes in their environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Examples of plastic phenotypes include insect castes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], horn-polyphenic beetles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and sex differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], where they play a crucial role in shaping the ecology and evolution of species and ecosystems. Understanding how alternative phenotypes arise from the same genome is one of the most challenging questions in modern biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The most impressive examples of phenotypic plasticity are found in the eusocial Hymenoptera (ants, some bees and some aculeate wasps), where specialized reproductive or non-reproductive phenotypes (castes) play a pivotal role in the ecological success of these insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Eusocial insect castes usually arise through differential expression of shared genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], but studies to date have been largely restricted to the highly eusocial bees and ants, where caste phenotypes are evolutionarily derived, being greatly modified from their ancestral state (for example, with morphological adaptations that are established early in development). Thus, some of the molecular processes underlying the origins of castes are likely to differ substantially from those underlying highly eusocial species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Understanding how castes first arise is best studied in primitively eusocial species, but little is known about their molecular evolution, particularly in the aculeate wasps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Thus, there is a need for comprehensive gene-level studies on primitively eusocial wasps.</p><p>In the evolution of eusociality, behavioral and physiological traits of the non-social ancestor become decoupled into complementary queen and worker phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], but we understand little about the molecular patterns and processes by which this originates and to what extent molecular ground plans are re-organized. These questions are of general biological importance in understanding the evolution of phenotypic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Empirical assessment of how gene transcription is decoupled into alternative phenotypes has been difficult to obtain because it requires unbiased quantification of gene expression (of both known and novel (undescribed) genes) across whole genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Microarray analyses of the highly eusocial honeybee (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) and fire ant (<italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic>) suggest marked functional decoupling of molecular processes in queens and workers, involving large numbers of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Little is known about the patterns and processes of transcriptional decoupling for castes in primitively eusocial insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A simple prediction is that patterns of transcriptional and functional decoupling should be less pronounced than in highly eusocial species, because phenotypes are in the first stages of merely behavioral decoupling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Processes of phenotypic decoupling at the molecular level may occur via several mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Conserved toolkits of ancestral molecular processes may be redeployed to regulate similar alternative phenotypes across species and lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In eusocial insects, conserved toolkit genes appear to be differentially expressed in castes across species, including bees and wasps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. An alternative, untested prediction is that at least some of the molecular processes underlying social phenotypes, in different social lineages and among different levels of social complexity, will differ substantially. This is because extensive molecular and developmental re-wiring or new gene evolution may be required for the loss of phenotypic plasticity and elaboration of phenotype-specific traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. There may also be rapid evolution of genes associated with the emergence of alternative phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and there is evidence for this in the highly eusocial honeybees and fire ants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Finally, the importance of novel genes (that is, previously undescribed genes that lack any detectable protein-coding homologues from existing sequence data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]) in the evolution of phenotypic innovations has recently emerged in animals as varied as yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], hydra, reptiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and also honeybees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. To date the eusocial insect literature has largely focused on conserved molecular pathways for social behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and the relative roles of the different mechanisms of phenotypic decoupling are unknown.</p><p>We sequenced over 20 Gbp of genome-wide caste-specific transcripts from the primitively eusocial, tropical paper wasp <italic>Polistes canadensis </italic>using high-throughput sequencing technologies. Castes in <italic>Polistes </italic>differ only in behavior and are determined through differential gene expression during adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], making <italic>Polistes </italic>important models for studying the early stage in the evolution of eusociality and phenotypic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. <italic>Polistes </italic>originated in the tropics, and the secondary adaptations to diapause found in temperate species (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]) will be absent in <italic>P. canadensis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Typically a few foundresses build and provision new colonies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). One foundress becomes the primary egg-layer (queen). Emerging adults help raise the offspring of their mother queen, but retain the ability to become egg-layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Thus, <italic>Polistes </italic>castes represent an early stage of phenotypic decoupling in the evolution of eusociality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Phenotypes produced through the life cycle of the tropical paper wasp <italic>Polistes canadensis</italic></bold>. Queens and workers show specific behaviors - reproduction or provisioning, respectively. Foundresses show both worker and queen behaviors, and additionally build new nests, whilst callows (newly emerged females; &#x0003c;2 days old) exhibit none of these behaviors. Colonies are founded, and males and females produced, throughout the year with no seasonal diapause.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2013-14-2-r20-1"/></fig><p>Here, we generate a genome-wide catalogue of aculeate wasp genes expressed in adult females to provide a resource for genomic analyses. We then conduct the first RNA-seq analyses of caste-biased expression in a wasp and primitively eusocial insect to test the above hypotheses on the patterns and processes of molecular decoupling of alternative phenotypes at the early stages in the evolution of eusocial behavior. These datasets allow a first simultaneous assessment of the role of conserved genetic toolkits, novel genes and gene evolution when social behavior first evolves. We also use our data to re-assess the phylogenetic relationships between the three aculeate Hymenoptera subfamilies (bees, wasps and ants), which is vital information for interpreting common processes and lineage-specific novelties underlying the evolution of alternative phenotypes. Recently, there has been much debate over the relationships of aculeate bees, wasps and ants, challenging the morphology-based view that Vespoidea (ants plus aculeate wasps) are monophyletic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Genome sequences (or similar catalogue of genes) for aculeate wasps will help resolve this controversy and provide a basis for interpreting comparative data on social evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Gene assembly for an aculeate wasp</title><p>We first generated a reference assembly of the genes expressed by <italic>P. canadensis </italic>adult female phenotypes (queens, workers, foundresses and callows) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; Section 1 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) by sequencing normalized 454 libraries from phenotype-specific pools (37 individuals in total; Section 2 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Using transcriptome rather than genome sequencing data to provide a gene set is a powerful and accessible approach for initiating genomic analyses on non-model organisms. Library normalization meant that we were able to capture transcripts at all levels of the expression spectrum. The longer read lengths provided by 454 technology and the high coverage of these datasets increase the likelihood of full transcript assembly. The 454 reads were assembled into a reference transcriptome set of 26,284 isogroups - henceforth referred to as 'genes' for simplicity (Section 2 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). This gene set included 98% of the core eukaryotic genes with equal coverage for each phenotype (Section 3 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Additionally, sequences were 100% identical to existing overlapping Sanger sequences for this species (n = 36 genes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Genes were equally spread across honeybee chromosomes and included 94% of publicly available ESTs for the temperate paper wasp <italic>Polistes metricus </italic>(n = 422 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]; Section 3 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Although this assembly is restricted to the genes expressed in adult females, it provides an important step forward in generating a comprehensive genome-wide sequence resource for aculeate wasps.</p><p>We characterized in detail the sequence and expression features for two groups of genes. The first group corresponds to the set of genes with detectable homology to protein sequences of any species in the comprehensive GenBank non-redundant (NR) database. We identified homologs for 37.4% of the total <italic>P. canadensis </italic>genes (n = 9,839), which were then annotated using Gene Ontology (GO; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; Section 4 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>; Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>): 71% of best hits were with the honeybee, which reflects the wealth of genomic resources for this species rather than any close phylogenetic relationship (see below). This level of homology is comparable with data for the temperate wasp <italic>P. metricus </italic>where 39% of the approximately 391K sequence fragments had putative orthologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In comparison, 60% to 70% of genes in the genomes of other social insects (ants and bees) had homology with sequences in other insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Number of best BLAST hits between the genes of sequenced genomes for aculeate hymenopterans</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Species</th><th align="center"><italic>P. canadensis</italic>

These include taxonomically restricted genes, and they may be derived from ancestral coding genes, or arise <italic>de novo </italic>from noncoding ancestors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Overall, transcripts with homology were longer (with-hits group, 1,718 &#x000b1; 1,343; no-hits group, 736 &#x000b1; 768) and had longer ORFs (with-hits group, 256 &#x000b1; 205; no-hits group, 83 &#x000b1; 36) than those without (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). By scanning the sequences for known protein domains with HMMscan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] we detected domain homology in 48% of the sequences with NR hits and only 9.9% in the group without hits (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). GC content was also lower in the no-hits group (mean GC with-hits, 0.337: no-hits, 0.306; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). Analysis of protein coding potential with PORTRAIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] revealed a significantly lower potential for protein coding in the group of isotigs without hits (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). We then examined whether the novel isotigs could potentially be long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). First, we looked more closely at the distribution of isotigs that are longer than 300 bp and have an ORF shorter than 90 amino acids (96% of the <italic>A. mellifera </italic>transcripts have an ORF greater than 90 amino acids). The vast majority of these isotigs lacked homology (n = 12,751 with no homology; n = 1,162 with homology), suggesting that the putative novel isotigs had shorter ORFs. Next, we imposed a PORTRAIT score lower than 0.5 (at which a sequence is more likely to be non-coding than coding), which yielded more isotigs in the set lacking homology (n = 4,096), than those with (n = 314). Finally, we imposed the condition of no homology with known protein domains, which again yielded more isotigs in the set without homology (n = 3,824) than with (n = 262). These latter two results suggest lower protein coding potential in the putative novel isotigs. The distribution of the median expression across all castes shows that, in general, isotigs with hits have higher expression values than those without (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>; but see also expression analysis below).

This has received mixed support from recent molecular analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], but these studies were limited to a maximum of four genes and sparse data matrices. High-throughput transcriptomics data are a reliable source of phylogenetic information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Our transcriptome affords a first assessment of the monophyly of Vespoidea using a large and complete data matrix.

A maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of these genes across all 32 insect species placed <italic>Polistes </italic>as the basal, sister group to the bees and ants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). This topology was significantly more supported (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05, Shimodaira-Hasegawa test) than the earlier proposal that Vespoidea (ants and <italic>Polistes </italic>in our study) are monophyletic. This result is consistent with the levels of gene sharing across aculeates (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), where <italic>P. canadensis </italic>does not share more genes with ants than bees, as would be expected if wasps and ants were monophyletic.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogenetic relationships across hymenopterans with sequenced genomes or transcriptomes</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>Phylogeny inferred from a maximum-likelihood analysis of a set of 93 conserved proteins (see Materials and methods).

The reason for the discrepancy in the results of these two methods is likely to be due to the wasp clade being the most poorly represented in our analysis (with only one species), and moreover, it is the clade with the longest branch. Our dataset offers a first chance to examine subfamily relationships across large numbers of genes but, clearly, phylogenomic data on more species of aculeate wasps are required to determine whether the term 'Vespoidea' should be dropped, or reclassified as paraphyletic. This finding would have important general implications for our understanding of eusociality as it would suggest that bees and ants shared an aculeate wasp-like common ancestor, that ants are wingless wasps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], and that bees are wasps that lost predacious behaviors. Primitively eusocial wasps may therefore hold some important clues to the early stages of eusociality, if they are the basal descendants of non-aculeate Hymenoptera.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional and functional decoupling at the origin of alternative phenotypes</title><p>We next conducted RNA-seq analyses of phenotype-biased expression to provide a first genome-wide look at molecular decoupling of alternative phenotypes at the early stages of eusocial evolution. We quantified genome-wide transcription in individuals (n = 2 to 12 per phenotype) from each of the four adult female phenotypes by sequencing at least 3 Gbp of Illumina short-reads of brain cDNA per phenotype (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). These samples appeared to capture most transcription across the genome since 99.8% of the 26,284 genes in the reference transcriptome were detected in our pooled Illumina dataset (Section 7 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p>We identified genes that were differentially expressed between phenotypes using NOIseq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].

Some of these could be attributed directly to a corresponding up-regulation in workers: specifically, 55% and 75%, respectively, of the down-regulated genes in foundresses and callows. But, the remaining foundress and callow down-regulated genes were not upregulated in other castes. This is also reflected in the GO classification (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>), where none of the 22 GO terms over-represented among the down-regulated genes in foundresses and only 5 of the 23 terms over-represented among the down-regulated genes in callows were up-regulated in workers. Although preliminary, these results raise some important questions: they suggest that callows are born neither worker- nor queen-like, but perhaps instead as an undifferentiated state, as expected in a species where all females retain full reproductive totipotency; down-regulation in callows may also reflect maturation processes that take place in the first days after emergence as an adult. Foundresses are thought to be hopeful reproductives, co-founding a nest in the hope of becoming the dominant egg-layer (queen); our data suggest that foundresses are quite different from established queens, even though they fit the queen phenotype in all other respects (that is, they are active egglayers, rarely absent from the nest, and are behaviorally dominant). Taken together, these results highlight how the definition of a phenotype in this species is more complex than a simple distinction between queens and workers.</p><p>Using the 268 genes differentially expressed between queens and workers that could be annotated (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), we then looked for any signs of functional specialization between these castes. Of the GO terms corresponding to these genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>), 2.4% (53 out of 2,242) were significantly enriched between queens and workers (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>; 40 terms (1.7%) over-represented in queens, 13 terms (0.57%) over-represented in workers). Although many of our genes did not have any functional information, there are some interesting first insights from these analyses. The putative lack of substantial functional specialization between castes in <italic>Polistes </italic>contrasts with the marked functional specialization in highly eusocial species, such as honeybees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This may reflect selection on females to retain reproductive totipotency in primitive societies, like <italic>P. canadensis</italic>, in order that they can exploit alternative reproductive strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], and minimize the risks of specialization associated with small colony size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. General terms overrepresented in workers include cellular protein modification processes, membrane and ion transport, which may suggest elevated cellular activity in worker brains. Among the over-represented terms in queens, several candidates associated with cell structure and cytoskeleton were found, such as homologs of myosin chains, actin isoforms and troponin, which may be associated with synaptic plasticity and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. However, because so few of the genes up-regulated in workers could be annotated, and because of the lack of significant levels of enrichment between castes, these inferred functional differences between castes should be taken with caution and require further analyses once some functionality can be assigned to the unknown genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of novel genes in the evolution of alternative phenotypes</title><p>We explored the hypothesis that novel genes (those lacking homologs in NR databases; see above) may play an important role in the early stages of phenotypic decoupling in <italic>P. canadensis</italic>. The importance of novel genes was recently highlighted in organisms as varied as <italic>Hydra </italic>to reptiles for their contribution to phenotypic diversity, through generating both behavioral and morphological variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Of the 2,442 up-regulated caste-biased genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), 24.4% (n = 596 genes) had known homologues, indicating that both novel and described genes are important in <italic>P. canadensis </italic>social behavior. Interestingly, 81.5% of worker-biased genes lacked homologs, compared to only 17.1% of queen-biased genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Foundresses and callows show similar levels of homology to queens. Lack of homology cannot be attributed to fragmentation or other anomalies arising from using transcriptome data (Section 6 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) and they are also valid for the stricter comparison of queens versus workers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). These results are exactly in line with Johnson and Tsutsui [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and Barchuk <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], who found an over-representation of novel (taxonomically restricted) genes up-regulated in honeybee workers (adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and brood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]), and suggested that these novel genes may facilitate expansion of worker behavioral complexity. Our data provide the first suggestion that novel gene transcription may be important at the early stages of worker evolution, confirming the potentially broad role of novel genes in eusocial evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and adding to the emerging general importance of novel genes in the evolution of phenotypic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It is important to note that microarray methods (as used in the honeybee studies) are largely biased towards conserved genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], as sequence conservation facilitates gene prediction. Thus, RNA-seq methods as used in our study offer new potential to explore the role of putative novel genes in phenotypic evolution.</p><p>Our ability to interpret what these novel genes are is limited without genome and proteome analyses, which is beyond the scope of this study. But, we explored the hypothesis that many of the caste-biased novel genes were in fact non-coding RNAs, as identified from our whole transcriptome analysis (above). Interestingly, we found a significant difference in the proportion of novel transcripts that were putatively lncRNAs, with an over-representation in workers relative to queens (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). lncRNAs are thought to play a role in gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], but also may be evidence of <italic>de novo </italic>gene origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

Alternative phenotypes (social insect castes) may therefore evolve through the decoupling of conserved sets of genes that regulated changes in hormone titers underlying the provisioning and reproductive phases of the non-social ancestor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A prevailing hypothesis is that changes in the patterns of expression of these ancestral ground-plan genes could account for caste evolution across social taxa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Using a candidate gene approach, sets of such 'toolkit' genes and molecular processes have been shown to have conserved roles in caste regulation across bees and wasps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

However, other toolkit genes (hexamerin, <italic>Malvolio, Amfor</italic>, P450) were present in our dataset, but were not identified as significantly caste-biased (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].</p><p>As a genome-wide, unbiased representation of genes expressed by alternative phenotypes in wasps, our datasets also offer the opportunity to test to what extent a conserved molecular toolkit in general explains alternative social phenotypes across eusocial taxa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, we found little correlation in the general identity and direction of expression of genes underlying castes in other eusocial insects, as identified from microarray analyses. For example, only 6.5% of honeybee (<italic>A. mellifera</italic>) caste-biased genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] were caste-biased in <italic>P. canadensis </italic>and there was no consistency in the direction of expression.

There was no correlation in direction and identity of gene expression in castes of the highly eusocial fire ant <italic>S. invicta </italic>(r ~ 0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Finally, only 22 of the 423 caste-biased genes of the temperate wasp <italic>P. metricus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] were also caste-biased in <italic>P. canadensis</italic>, and they showed a low correlation in the direction of phenotype-specific expression between species (Pearson correlation of 0.25 for worker, 0.14 for queen, 0.24 for foundress and 0.23 between gyne and callow; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). This was unexpected since these two species are close relatives, share a recent common ancestor, and have similar social and behavioral traits. Differences in ecology of tropical and temperate <italic>Polistes</italic>, and possible secondary adaptation to temperate living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], may contribute to these differences. These analyses suggest that the social toolkit represents a small portion of the genome involved in phenotype decoupling of <italic>P. canadensis</italic>, and that there is much lineage and ecology-specific transcription underlying caste differences. This supports the hypothesis that the genes underlying castes in different social lineages will not necessarily be conserved, because extensive molecular and developmental re-wiring may be required in the evolution of caste commitment and eusociality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Insights into gene evolution in alternative phenotypes</title><p>Rapid evolution of genes has been associated with alternative phenotypes in a range of animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

Under-represented groups (which include regulatory and signaling processes) may be less important in complex eusociality and hence not maintained by stabilizing selection. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that these differences are wasp-specific. Over-represented terms may be important in complex eusocial behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These included processes previously highlighted for putative roles in caste determination (for example, oxidation reduction, metabolic processes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], suggesting they reflect the level of eusociality rather than differences in ecology or lineage.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our RNAseq analyses of phenotypic decoupling in <italic>P. canadensis </italic>provide some intriguing novel insights into the evolution of alternative phenotypes, and the early stages of caste evolution and sociality. First, they highlight the importance of novel genes in phenotypic diversity, emphasizing the need to expand existing genomic datasets beyond established model organisms to include a wider range of taxonomic groups. Secondly, they add important insights to the current emerging picture that much of the molecular changes that accompany social evolution occur predominantly in the worker rather than queen caste, with an over-representation of novel caste-biased genes in workers. These features may be important in facilitating the evolution of behavioral complexity in the worker caste. We show that these patterns are evident even at the early stages of sociality, where castes retain plasticity. Further, contrary to highly eusocial species, genes involved in caste differentiation do not appear to be subject to relaxed selection at the early stages of sociality. Diversity in the molecular regulation of castes across social lineages is expected if many pleiotropic genes involved with sexual conflict are lost in the early stages of social evolution, when ancestral monogamy is required to generate the conditions for the evolution of worker behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Subsequent evolution of queen and worker behaviors, therefore, may take very different molecular pathways in different lineages, requiring new gene networks to evolve independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Further RNA-seq studies on other species (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]) and also genome sequencing to explore the potential role of alternative splicing (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]) will help determine the complementary roles of conserved and novel molecular processes in shaping social and other polyphenisms, bringing us closer to understanding how genomes give rise to phenotypic diversity in general.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Source material</title><p><italic>P. canadensis </italic>wasps of known behavioral repertoires were collected from wild populations in Panama, in July 2009 (Punta Galeta, Colon). All wasps were collected directly off their nests with forceps around midday during the active periods (that is, sunny weather) and preserved immediately in RNAlater (Ambion, Invitrogen, Applied Biosystems), and stored at -20&#x000b0;C until analysis (Section 1 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptome sequencing, assembly and analyses</title><p>454 sequencing of pooled samples of 37 wasps across phenotypes (5 to 18 individuals per phenotype; 2.1 million reads, 80% brain, 10% abdomen, and 10% antennae) was used to generate a reference transcriptome (Section 2 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Newbler v2.3 was used to generate the final assembled gene set (Table S1 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Transcripts were annotated using GO categories assigned using BLASTx of GenBank NR databases with a conservative e-value threshold of 10<sup>-5</sup>, and Blast2Go was used to assess enrichment of GO terms among phenotypes (Section 4 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Illumina sequencing of 14 biological replicates (&#x0003e;377 million reads) across 5 lanes was conducted to quantify differential gene expression, expressed as RPKM (reads per kilobase per million) values (Section 8 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). We trialed a number of methods for identifying differentially expressed genes and settled on a novel non-parametric method (NOISeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]) This method infers the noise distribution from the data and performs pairwise comparison of the samples to identify differentially expressed genes. A variety of probability thresholds were tested (Section 8 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). For the GO analysis we used a q-value &#x0003e;0.6 that represents a 50% chance that the gene is differentially expressed rather than not differentially expressed.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analyses</title><p>Protein sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>], with default parameters. This is a multiple sequence aligner that includes an iterative alignment refinement phase to overcome known pitfalls of the progressive alignment strategy. Subsequently, poorly aligned regions of the alignment were trimmed with trimAl v1.3. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>] to remove columns with gaps in more than 30% of the sequences. A maximum-likelihood analysis was conducted on the concatenated alignment containing 33,506 sites using PhyML v3.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Out of a total of five evolutionary models (LG, JTT, WAG, VT, BLOSUM62), the general replacement model LG (after 'Lee and Gascuel') was found to be the best fitting model using the AIC criterion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. In all cases four categories of evolutionary rates were used, estimating the gamma shape parameter and the proportion of invariable sites from the data. Branch supports were obtained using an approximate likelihood ratio test as implemented in PhyML ('Minimum of SH and chi-square' option). The resulting topology was compared to an alternative topology placing <italic>Polistes </italic>as a sister group to the ants. To do so, the phylogeny was re-computed, fixing the monophyly of <italic>Polistes </italic>and ants, but allowing the rest of the topology to be optimized. Support for the two topologies were compared using a Shimodaira-Hasegawa test, as implemented in CONSEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. A Bayesian analysis was conducted as implemented in PhyloBayes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>], using the default CAT model and running two independent MCMC runs during 300,000 generations, and sampling every 100 generations. Consensus trees were built after removing the first 20% sampled trees and using a majority consensus rule.</p></sec><sec><title>Data access</title><p>Raw sequence data are available at the European Read Archive (accession number ERP001342).
