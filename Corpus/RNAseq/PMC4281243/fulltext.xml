Here, we used comparative transcriptomic analysis of all major organs and tissues in the human body, in combination with kidney tissue micro array based immunohistochemistry, to generate a comprehensive description of the kidney-specific transcriptome and proteome. A special emphasis was placed on the identification of genes and proteins that were elevated in specific kidney subcompartments. Our analysis identified close to 400 genes that had elevated expression in the kidney, as compared to the other analysed tissues, and these were further subdivided, depending on expression levels, into <italic>tissue enriched</italic>, <italic>group enriched</italic> or <italic>tissue enhanced</italic>. Immunohistochemistry allowed us to identify proteins with distinct localisation to the glomeruli (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11), proximal tubules (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;120), distal tubules (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9) or collecting ducts (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8). Among the identified kidney elevated transcripts, we found several proteins not previously characterised or identified as elevated in kidney. This description of the kidney specific transcriptome and proteome provides a resource for basic and clinical research to facilitate studies to understand kidney biology and disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wallenberg.com/kaw/en">http://www.wallenberg.com/kaw/en</ext-link>) and by the Stockholm County Council (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.forskningsstod.sll.se">http://www.forskningsstod.sll.se</ext-link>).

Furthermore, it has an important role in elimination of organic compounds, metabolic waste products and many pharmaceutical drugs. A detailed knowledge of the proteins expressed by the cells comprising the different parts of the kidney forms the basis for understanding their functions, under both physiological and pathological conditions. Previously, molecular biology studies have lead to the identification of many proteins important for kidney function. These include nephrin (NPHS1), a primary component of slit-membrane in the glomerulus that functions as the glomerular ultrafiltration barrier <xref rid="pone.0116125-Kestila1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, aquaporin families (AQP) that are key molecules for water re-absorption in proximal tubules, descending limb of Henle's loop and collecting ducts <xref rid="pone.0116125-Yamamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and many other transporters involved in the re-absorption/secretion of organic substrates or solutes <xref rid="pone.0116125-Schlessinger1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref><xref rid="pone.0116125-Morrissey1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Takemoto <italic>et al.</italic> identified glomerulus transcripts in mouse kidney through large-scale sequencing and microarray profiling <xref rid="pone.0116125-Takemoto1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, while Miyamoto <italic>et al.</italic> identified the proteins localised in glomeruli using 2D SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS <xref rid="pone.0116125-Miyamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Despite these advances in our knowledge, a comprehensive kidney-specific transcriptome and proteome has not yet been defined.</p><p>We recently performed a large RNAseq analysis on 27 human tissues, covering all other major organs <xref rid="pone.0116125-Fagerberg1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We have here used this data to define the kidney-specific transcriptome by comparing the kidney RNAseq analysis to that from the 26 other tissues <xref rid="pone.0116125-Fagerberg1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This analysis was used as a basis for antibody-based staining for the proteins in kidney sections, using The Human Protein Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org">www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>) with more than 50,000 samples of kidney tissue analysed with immunohistochemistry and individually annotated by certified pathologists <xref rid="pone.0116125-Uhlen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Thus, the transcriptomics analysis of kidney homogenate, with its mixture of cell types, was supplemented by immunohistochemistry analysis to determine the precise spatial distribution of the corresponding proteins. In this manner, we have generated a knowledge resource with a comprehensive list of genes elevated in kidney with data on specificity and localisation of the corresponding proteins in the various nephron segments of the kidney.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sample characteristics</title><p>The tissue samples used for transcript profiling of human kidney included histologically normal tissue from operated material from four individuals: Female, 58 years (Sample 1); female, 67 years (Sample 2); female, 55 years (Sample 3); male 46 years (Sample 4).</p><p>The kidney tissue samples were collected from surgical specimens of resected kidneys from individuals operated for renal cell carcinoma.

The use of human tissue samples was approved by the Uppsala Ethical Review Board (Ups 02-577, no. 2011/473). Human tissue samples used for protein and mRNA expression analyses were collected and handled in accordance with Swedish laws and regulation and obtained form the Department of Pathology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden as part of the sample collection governed by the Uppsala Biobank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uppsalabiobank.uu.se/en/">http://www.uppsalabiobank.uu.se/en/</ext-link>). All human tissue samples used in the present study were anonymised in accordance with approval and advisory report from the Uppsala Ethical Review Board (Dnr Ups 02-577 (protein) and Dnr 2011/473 (RNA)), and consequently the need for informed consent was waived by the ethics committee. The use and analyses based on human tissues has previously been described in Fagerberg L et al. <xref rid="pone.0116125-Fagerberg1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Tissues samples were embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature (O.C.T.) compounds and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stained frozen sections (4 &#x000b5;m) were prepared from each sample using a cryostat and the CryoJane Tape-Transfer System (Instrumedics, St. Louis, MO, USA). To ensure proper tissue morphology each slide was examined by a pathologist. From each frozen tissue block three sections (10 &#x000b5;m) were cut and collected for RNA extraction. Tissue was homogenised using a 3 mm steel grinding ball (VWR). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA samples were analysed using either an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser system (Agilent Biotechnologies, Palo Alto, USA) with the RNA 6000 Nano Labchip Kit or an Experion automated electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) with the standard-sensitivity RNA chip. All samples had an RNA integrity number of at least 7.5. mRNA sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq2000 and 2500 machines (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using the standard Illumina RNA-seq protocol with a read length of 2&#x000d7;100 bases.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Analysis of data</title><p>The software &#x02018;Sickle&#x02019; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/najoshi/sickle">http://github.com/najoshi/sickle</ext-link>) was used to trim raw reads obtained from the sequencing system for low quality ends, using a phred quality threshold of 20. After discarding reads shorter than 54 bp, processed reads were mapped to the GRCh37 version of the human genome with Tophat v2.0.3 <xref rid="pone.0116125-Trapnell1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Potential PCR duplicates were eliminated using the MarkDuplicates module of Picard 1.77 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://picard.sourceforge.net/">http://picard.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>). Quantification scores for all human genes, FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads) values were calculated using Cufflinks v2.0.2 <xref rid="pone.0116125-Trapnell2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, which corrects for transcript length and the total number of mapped reads from the library to compensate for different read depths for different samples. The gene models from Ensembl build 69 were used in Cufflinks <xref rid="pone.0116125-Flicek1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In addition to Cufflinks, HTSeq v0.5.1 was run to calculate read counts for each gene. These were used in the DESeq package for analyses of differentially expressed genes <xref rid="pone.0116125-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. All data was analysed using R Statistical Environment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>) with the addition of package &#x02018;gplots&#x02019; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html">http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html</ext-link>).

Where a log2-scale of the data was used for analyses, pseudo-counts of +1 were added to the data set. The significance of the enriched/enhanced genes were calculated using the DESeq software <xref rid="pone.0116125-Anders1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, doing a pairwise comparison between all the biological replicates of the enriched/enhanced tissue (or group of tissues) and all other tissues.

The outcome of the TMA IHC stainings in the screening phase, was manually evaluated by certified pathologists and and scored using a web-based annotation system (unpublished). In brief, the manual score of IHC-based protein expression was determined as the fraction of positive cells defined in different tissues: 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0&#x02013;1%, 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2&#x02013;25%, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;26&#x02013;75%, 3&#x0003e;75% and intensity of immunoreactivity: 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;negative, 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;weak, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;moderate and 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;strong staining.

The lowest correlation was found between kidney and testis (Spearman correlation of 0.69) while thyroid gland tissue displayed the highest similarity (0.88) to kidney (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Classification of the genes expressed in kidney</title><p>All putative protein coding genes (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;20,050) were classified into four categories; (1) not detected in kidney (6,365 genes), (2) &#x02018;kidney elevated&#x02019; (387 genes) - subdivided into &#x02018;kidney enriched&#x02019; (expression level 5 times greater than any other tissue, respectively), group enriched (5-fold higher average expression in a group of 2-7 tissues including kidney, compared to all other tissues) or &#x02018;kidney enhanced&#x02019; (expression level over 5 times the average across all other tissue types), (3) a mixed group of genes that were found to be expressed in several, but not all tissue types, and furthermore did not full-fill the criteria for tissue-elevated genes (4,048 genes), and (4) &#x02018;housekeeping&#x02019; genes, defined as genes expressed in all 27 tissue types (9,250 genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0116125-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>).

When ordered according to nephron segment, these are; glomeruli podocytes (NPHS2), proximal tubule cytoplasm (MIOX) and proximal tubule basolateral membrane (SLC22A8, SLC22A2) and proximal tubule luminal membrane (TMEM174, SLC34A1, SLC22A12, SLC6A18, SLC36A2 and SLC22A13), distal tubule cytoplasm (UMOD) and distal tubule luminal membrane (SLC12A1, KCNJ1, SLC12A3), and collecting duct luminal membrane (AQP2). MCCD1 localises the cytoplasm in cells of all tubular segments cytoplasm.

Tissue proteomics using methods for proteomic content enrichment can enable identification of the specific proteomes of different functional units, compartments and cells of the kidney. For example, isolating glomeruli followed by 2D SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS was successful to enable an in depth characterisation of the glomerular proteome <xref rid="pone.0116125-Miyamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116125-Cui1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Beyond glomeruli, the proteomes of kidney compartments are not well characterised. Efforts have been made to isolate tubular structures and cells to define the tubular proteome in animals, however the human tubular and collecting duct proteomes remain to be comprehensively characterised <xref rid="pone.0116125-Curthoys1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116125-Walmsley1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. We therefore compared our data to a recent comprehensive analysis of multiple LC-MS/MS shotgun proteomics data sets available from different studies used to define the non-redundant proteomes of plasma, urine and kidney tissue <xref rid="pone.0116125-Farrah1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. We found that 51 of our 148 compartment specific proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0116125.s006">S4 Table</xref>) were not represented neither in the urine, plasma nor kidney tissue proteomes defined by Farrah et al. <xref rid="pone.0116125-Farrah1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The majority of these are transmembrane proteins, and the results may reflect technological challenges in separating and identifying membrane components by traditional LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry based methods <xref rid="pone.0116125-Griffin1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Interestingly, among 352 protein described by Farrah et al. <xref rid="pone.0116125-Farrah1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> as unique to the urine proteome, several proteins we here identified as specific for the proximal tubuli (SLC3A1, SLC34A1, SLC7A8, SLC13A2, SLC28A1, KL, or collecting duct (AQP2) can be found, suggesting that in the urine proteome these actually represent kidney derived tissue leakage proteins. Furthermore, we compared the 148 compartment specific proteins to publically available omics datasets in the Kidney and Urinary Pathway Knowledge base, KUPKB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kupkb.org/">http://www.kupkb.org/</ext-link>), to datasets of glomeruli proteins in the Human Kidney and Urinary Proteome Project, HKUPP, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hkupp.org/">http://www.hkupp.org/</ext-link>), and to datasets in the Urinary Exosome Protein Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dir.nhlbi.nih.gov/papers/lkem/exosome/">http://dir.nhlbi.nih.gov/papers/lkem/exosome/</ext-link>). The results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0116125.s006">S4 Table</xref>. Interestingly, for several proteins we identify as specific for only one nephron segment or collecting ducts, there is conflicting previous data (when available) between public repositories KUPKB and HKUPP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0116125.s006">S4 Table</xref>).</p><p>The Human Protein Atlas database contains quantitative annotations of protein expression across the different tissues sections using IHC. These IHC annotations (high&#x02019;, &#x02018;medium&#x02019; or &#x02018;low&#x02019;) are based on the evaluation of a pathologist and give a quantitative measure specified for different tissue parenchymal cells (e.g. proximal tubuli cells, glomerular cells). The parenchyma specific annotations of protein expression in a tissue section could differ from the quantitative average measure of mRNA transcription that is captured by RNAseq analysis, as the proportion of parenchymal cells relative to other cell types (e.g. fibroblasts, cells of the vasculature) differ between tissues and sections. For comparison, we queried the HPA database of IHC-based annotations of protein expression with search criteria that would correspond to either the &#x02018;Group enriched&#x02019; or &#x02018;Kidney enriched&#x02019; categories in the transcriptome dataset. This query identified 12 proteins annotated as uniquely found in kidney tissue, of which 6 corresponded to genes found among the 20 &#x02018;highly kidney enriched genes&#x02019; in the transcriptome analysis (data not shown). The total overlap between the query-based analysis of the quantitative IHC-annotations in the HPA database and the transcriptome analysis was 35 proteins/genes. These 35 genes were classified as &#x02018;Kidney enriched&#x02019; (11 genes), &#x02018;Group enriched&#x02019; (14 genes) and &#x02018;Kidney enhanced&#x02019; (10 genes) in the transcriptomics analysis. Thus, while IHC analysis provide more specific information of protein expression in parenchyma cells in individual tissues, the combination of RNA seq followed by IHC-based confirmation of protein expression and localisation enabled a more comprehensive identification of kidney enriched genes on genome wide level.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we have comprehensively described the kidney elevated transcriptome and proteome. By comparing the kidney transcriptome against the transcriptomes from 26 other organs, we were able to produce a kidney specific profile of gene expression. To our knowledge, this is the first study utilising RNA-seq in an integrated &#x02018;omics&#x02019; approach with supplementary immunohistochemistry data to provide a comprehensive characterisation of protein expression in normal human tissues. We show how this combined approach adds value to the IHC-based information of protein expression in the Human Protein Atlas when aiming to identify kidney enriched genes on a genome wide scale.</p><p>Our RNAseq analysis is based on kidney tissue from only four individuals, but the high correlation in mRNA profile between the four samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0116125.s002">S2 Fig</xref>.) suggest low individual variation. However, for follow-up studies using the same approach to study the kidney proteome in different pathological conditions, analysis of larger sample numbers is likely to be necessary to accommodate for known disease heterogeneity between individuals.</p><p>We validated this profile using immunohistochemical staining, which allowed us to identify specific sub-compartments or cell types where these proteins were expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0116125.s004">S2 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0116125.s006">S4 Table</xref>). Importantly, this allowed us to identify both novel uncharacterised kidney-specific proteins, as well as known genes that had never previously described in the context of the kidney. The elevated expression reflect active differential transcriptional regulation of genes with a role in kidney that go beyond functions common to many or all tissues and cells and should be of interest for further research aiming to better understand kidney biology.</p><p>Furthermore, our results can also provide a resource for more clinically applied research since expression specificity of a protein is useful in the quest for specific markers of injury or disease of a particular tissue or cell type, e.g. elevated plasma levels. From this perspective, our list of identified kidney-enriched proteins with specific compartment location (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0116125.s006">S4 Table</xref>) provide interesting candidates for more in-depth studies in plasma or urine.</p><p>To conclude, we here provide a comprehensive knowledge resource identifying the kidney transcriptome and, importantly, the specific localisation of expression of the corresponding proteins. We envisage that this will be a useful tool for researchers working in both basic and clinical nephrology research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116125.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>Histology of the samples used for RNA-Seq.</bold> Hematoxylin-eosin stained frozen sections of kidney tissue, showing the histology of the four individual kidney samples used for RNA-Seq preparation.
