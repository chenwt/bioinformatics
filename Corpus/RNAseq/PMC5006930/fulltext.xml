We revisited TIL abundance specifically in patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC without evidence of lymph node or metastatic spread. Examination of the density of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in primary tumors in the context of other pro-oncogenic markers was performed to investigate potential regulators of TILs. Two independent cohorts of patients with MSS T2-4N0M0 CRC, enriched for cases with atypical relapse, were investigated. We quantified CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD45RO<sup>+</sup> -TILs, inflammatory markers, NFkBp65, pStat3, Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX2) and GRP78 as well as transcription factors (TF), &#x003b2;-catenin and MYB. High CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs correlated with a better relapse-free survival in both cohorts (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002) with MYB and its target gene, GRP78 being higher in the relapse group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001); no difference in pSTAT3 and p65 was observed. A mouse CRC (CT26) model was employed to evaluate the effect of MYB on GRP78 expression as well as T-cell infiltration. MYB over-expressing in CT26 cells increased GRP78 expression and the analysis of tumor-draining lymph nodes adjacent to tumors showed reduced T-cell activation. Furthermore, MYB over-expression reduced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 to modulate CT26 tumor growth. This high MYB and GRP78 show a reciprocal relationship with CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs which may be useful refining the prediction of patient outcome. These data reveal a new immunomodulatory function for MYB suggesting a basis for further development of anti-GRP78 and/or anti-MYB therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>CD8<sup>+</sup>ve T Cells</kwd><kwd>early stage colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>GRP78</kwd><kwd>MYB</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><ref-count count="36"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Early stage CRC is managed by surgery, followed with adjuvant chemotherapy in higher risk cases. There is now compelling evidence that a poor immune response in CRC, as defined by the absence of lymphocytes within the primary tumor, is a robust predictor of relapse.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1,2</sup></xref> Initiating a specific, or reawakening a latent, immune response in patients might improve CRC control but how this might be achieved remains unclear. The mechanism for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in CRC is intriguing and remains to be fully determined. Perhaps, there is a role for T-regulatory cells (T-regs), myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), as well as immune check point control in suppressing the patient's immune response as measured by the absence of TILs.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Thus, it is paramount to understand the central mediators of both positive and negative host responses as this will inform future CRC therapeutic strategies.</p><p>Inflammatory pathways mediated by the TF NF&#x003ba;B and phosphoStat3 (pStat3) are considered to be central players in the gastro-intestinal tract immune system.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> However, it is unclear whether these TFs are responsible for the attraction of TILs or suppression of antitumor immune responses. It also remains unclear if the actions of these TFs are tumor-driven or stroma-mediated. Thus, defining prognostic markers that are independent of the traditional indicators such as T and N stage are likely to influence patient management. To this effect, the demonstrated interplay between TILs and patient outcome has initiated a paradigm shift in thinking.</p><p>To help determine further markers of patient outcome independent of T and N staging, we have defined the TILs status in patients, who as a group, would normally be considered to be at low risk of relapse with markers measuring inflammatory pathway activation. Patients with microsatellite unstable (MSI-H) tumors were deliberately excluded because on the whole they have superior survival <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> and typically higher TILs. Patients with MSI-H CRC also appear to respond to anti-immune check point therapy likely due to an increased mutational load.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6,7,8</sup></xref> In addition to TILs, we examined the role of the TF MYB, as it has also been found to predict outcome in CRC patients,<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> but had not yet been explored in early stage CRC.

<italic>(BCL2L1)</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic>,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> we investigated its expression in these cohorts. To confirm that MYB was actively operating as a TF, we determined whether target gene, <italic>GRP78 (glucose regulatory protein-78</italic> (<italic>HSPA5, BIP</italic>) <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> was also elevated in concordance with nuclear MYB.</p><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein GRP78 is a sentinel for the induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR).<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> GRP78 has also been found to modulate both immune and therapy responses in cancer.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> As the development of cancer accompanies a spectrum of elevated cellular stress responses,<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> we decided to use GRP78 as measure of the UPR and elevated cellular stress in tumors which are responding to glucose deprivation and hypoxia.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> GRP78 has also been implicated in modulating cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor killing <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15-17</sup></xref> and here we asked if there was any association with reduced CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs in patients with CRC relapse and GRP78.</p><p>Using IHC, RNA expression and a relevant animal model, we found that high MYB and high GRP78 were robust predictors of poor patient outcome. Furthermore, the high expression of these proteins tracked with low CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs in patients who relapsed with MSS CRC. Using the CT26 mouse model, we directly showed that increased MYB expression led to a downregulation of immune activation and a reduction in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy efficacy. Collectively, we have identified a new role for MYB in modulating immune responses, which is shown by the linked relationship between high TILs, low MYB and good outcome on the one side and low TILs, high MYB and poor outcome in early CRC on the other.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s0002"><title>Results</title><sec id="s0002-0001"><title>Lymphocyte status</title><p>Whole tumor sections were evaluated for the presence of CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic or CD45RO<sup>+</sup> memory T-cells in five randomly selected tumor regions determined using histology and/or &#x003b2;-catenin staining to demark tumor boundaries. The tumor core, tumor margin, as well as proximal stroma and stroma distal to the tumor were analyzed in each patient. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis was used to measure stained T-cells, with the tumor and stroma averaged separately. We observed no significant difference with regards to T-cell abundance in the tumor stroma in either cohort. However, in CRC Series 1, the presence of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells was significantly greater in the tumor core and margin in sections from relapse-free patients. This trend was not observed with CD45RO<sup>+</sup> staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.&#x000a0;1A&#x02013;B</xref>). Median scores were calculated and used to generate Kaplan&#x02013;Meir plots. Using the median cut-off for CD8<sup>+</sup> density, a significant separation between relapse-free patients from those that relapsed can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.&#x000a0;1C</xref>). This again was not consistent with CD45RO staining in tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.&#x000a0;1D</xref>). Similar discrimination was evident in Series 2, although the area of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells was on the whole higher in this series compared to the first series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.&#x000a0;1E</xref>). Analysis of Series 2 using Kaplan&#x02013;Meir plots also demonstrated a clear difference in relapse between the CD8<sup>+</sup>-high and low groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.&#x000a0;1F</xref>). Combining the two cohorts and using the collective median cut-off, the presence of high CD8<sup>+</sup> cells remained highly significantly different between patients who relapsed and those that did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.&#x000a0;1G</xref>). Although the presence of CD45RO<sup>+</sup> TILs was unable to discriminate between the two patient groups alone in terms of relapse, low CD45RO<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> cells was indicative of poor patient outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Fig.&#x000a0;1H</xref>).

A low number of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells confined to the stroma surrounding the tumor, mirroring our findings in relapse CRC patients. As the TILs could not be quantified numerically using IHC, flow cytometry of primary tumors was employed. While flow cytometry does not allow for accurate quantification of total CD8<sup>+</sup> cells, it does facilitate an evaluation of the quality of the TILs from both CT26 parental and CT26-MYB tumors to be determined using cell surface markers CD44 and CD62L. Analysis of CT26 parental and CT26-MYB tumors showed a modest but statistically significant reduction in the activation state of MYB over-expressing tumors compared to parental (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Fig.&#x000a0;6A</xref>).

</p><p>Given MYB appeared to be suppressing the infiltration of activated T cells at the primary tumor site, we then investigated whether a similarly reduced activation state could also be found at the tumor draining lymph node. Analysis of tumor-draining lymph nodes from CT26 and CT26-MYB tumor bearing mice showed that the percentage of activated (CD44<sup>+</sup>; CD62L<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly lower in MYB over-expressing tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Fig.&#x000a0;6B</xref>). Similarly, we found a significant reduction in the activation status of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells when we looked at the ratio of activated CD44<sup>+</sup> CD62L<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells to na&#x000ef;ve CD44<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD62L<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Fig.&#x000a0;6B</xref>). These analyses were performed on relatively small tumors (&#x0223c;0.2&#x000a0;g), suggesting that MYB directly influences (early on) the ability of the host animal to mount a robust immune response against tumors. These observations are thus in accord with what we found in human CRC and suggest that the reciprocal relationship between high MYB, its target GRP78 and low CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs is a direct result of the expression levels of MYB.</p><p>As MYB appeared to be directly influencing the activation state of the immune system in CT26 tumor bearing mice, we next determined whether this would impact upon immunotherapy. Other studies,<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> including our own,<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> have shown the CT26 model to be responsive to anti-PD-1 check-point blockade. Employing the same therapeutic strategy as our previous study, we demonstrated that overexpression of MYB eliminated any therapeutic benefit in half of the treated mice compared to uniform tumor control in the GFP-expressing CT26 parental tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Fig.&#x000a0;6C&#x02013;D</xref>). These data directly highlight the immunomodulatory capabilities of MYB in CRC and how it might affect the implementation of immunotherapy in CRC.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s0003"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have shown that that high CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs are associated with relapse-free survival in patients with early stage, node-negative MSS CRC, similar to previous findings when all stages are considered.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> This analysis of early stage MSS CRC shows that the immune system remains an important prognostic indicator of relapse, even when neo-epitopes are likely to be very low. Given the importance of the immune microenvironment in cancer, the lack of association with either recurrence or relapse free survival for COX-2, pSTAT3 and NFkBp65 when analyzed within the tumor or in surrounding stroma, was unexpected (<italic>data not shown</italic>). In view of the lack of obvious associations with transcriptional drivers of inflammation, pSTAT3 and NF&#x003ba;Bp65, we investigated another TF, MYB, which we had shown to predict CRC outcome in more advanced disease.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p><p>We were additionally interested in <italic>GRP78</italic> expression because we had previously found it to be a MYB regulated gene, with high expression observed in CRC cell lines, particularly those with amplified <italic>MYB</italic>.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Beyond GRP78 being a sentinel of MYB activity, it also serves to show induction of the immune-modulatory UPR pathway. Others have also noted the potential importance of the UPR in immune modulation.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24,25</sup></xref> When GRP78 is over-expressed, it is mis-localized to the cell surface and has also been shown to be secreted.<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> With specific relevance to immune-modulation, GRP78 has been found to reduce cytotoxic T-cell activity <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and induce T-regs.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> When we analyzed MYB expression, we found that it was concordant with GRP78 and combined, these proteins were inversely correlated with CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs.</p><p>Although the role of the UPR in cancer immunity is emerging, it is important to emphasize that MYB is a master regulator of a plethora of pro-oncogenic genes. There are more than 80 pro-oncogenic genes that are directly regulated by MYB, including GRP78 and GRP94<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11,10</sup></xref> Accordingly, the concept of targeting transcriptional regulation directly is building currency.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> With specific reference to MYB, it is the case that it directly regulates genes including <italic>VEGFA, COX2</italic> and <italic>BCL2. VEGFA</italic> for instance is also an immune modulator while BCL2 protects cells from apoptosis. Therefore, focusing on any single MYB target gene is unlikely to explain MYB's association with immune evasion as the multifaceted orchestration of oncogenesis by MYB is certain to involve many of its targets.</p><p>To directly address whether high MYB expression in CRC was driving low CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs, we used a mouse CRC model. We expressed additional MYB in this mouse CRC line that generates highly aggressive tumors in an immunocompetent host. We found no significant differences in cell line growth <italic>in vitro</italic>, and there was at best, only a trend to more rapid induction of tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, we were able to demonstrate more uniform and extensive cell-surface expression of GRP78 in the MYB-transduced cells that formed tumors.</p><p>As we found very few CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs in the parental CT26 tumors, it was not surprising that they were numerically too few to evaluate robustly in tumors generated from MYB-over-expressing cells. Nevertheless, the activation status of TILs was statistically significantly decreased by the expression of elevated MYB. Perhaps more interestingly, when we evaluated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in the tumor-draining lymph nodes, we were also able to establish that these were also substantially reduced in terms of activation. When we then challenged mice with established tumors with anti-PD-1 immune check-point blockade, we found that half of the mice with CT26-MYB were able to escape the characteristic tumor control normally observed in this model. These observations suggest that MYB has strong immunomodulatory effects, perhaps through induced GRP78 expression or another undefined mechanism, that have the potential to operate at a distance from the primary tumor site. Thus, these data go some of the way to explain why high MYB is associated with a reduced antitumor immunological response and poor outcome.</p><p>In conclusion, these studies have shown the prognostic significance of a robust CD8<sup>+</sup> TIL response in patients with early stage, presumably mutation-low, CRC. The recognition that MYB and its downstream transcriptional target GRP78 track with CRC development provides opportunities to advance new therapeutic strategies in treating CRC and to better predict treatment outcome. This study is the first direct demonstration that MYB expressed in tumor cells can modulate the host immune response, which has the potential to influence the use of immunotherapy in CRC patients. Emerging strategies to exploit cell surface expression of GRP78 in cancer are being reported,<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29-31</sup></xref> and our results suggest they may synergize with immunotherapy in CRC. While MYB has numerous gene targets, many with a pro-tumorigenic action, we have considered approaches that directly target MYB over-expression in CRC using immunological strategies with some success in pre-clinical animal models.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23,32,33</sup></xref> The data presented here further elevate the importance of MYB in cancer, highlighting a new pro-tumorigenic role in negatively modulating the immune response to tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s0004"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0004-0001"><title>Patients' characteristics</title><p>Characteristics of tumors from atypical relapse (n =&#x000a0;21) and relapse-free (n =&#x000a0;19) patients are tabulated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0001">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>).
