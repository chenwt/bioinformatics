In conjunction with histone modifications, remodeling complexes and non-coding RNAs, it modulates chromatin density and thereby accessibility of the underlying DNA to the transcriptional machinery. As a result, DNA methylation is involved in a diverse range of processes including embryogenesis, genomic imprinting, cellular differentiation, DNA-protein interactions, and gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>In mammalian genomes, methylation predominantly occurs symmetrically on both DNA strands at palindromic CpG dinucleotides, but the preference between CpG and non-CpG methylation appears to vary with the degree of cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Of the methylcytosines detected in human somatic cells (fetal lung fibroblasts), more than 99% have been shown to be in a CpG context. In contrast, in embryonic stem cells there is abundant methylation in non-CpG contexts, comprising approximately 25% of the total number of methylcytosines detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>There are a plethora of methods available for the exploration of DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Since the advent of high throughput sequencing, methods for genome-wide methylome profiling are both available and increasingly affordable. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] is a popular enrichment based method, in which an antibody capable of recognizing 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is utilised to immunoprecipitate the methylated fraction of the genome. A number of tools have been developed for the analysis of MeDIP data, including Batman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], MEDME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], MEDIPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], MeQA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and SeqMonk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. MeDIP, originally developed for use on arrays, can be combined with sequencing (termed MeDIP-seq) to interrogate the methylation status of cytosines across entire genomes. MeDIP-seq has been used in numerous studies, including the first mammalian methylome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and the first cancer methylome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), a member of the uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) superfamily of DNA repair enzymes, has been shown to be essential for embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, its exact functionality is still unclear. The protein structure and biochemical properties suggest it has a role in DNA repair, whilst interactions with other proteins indicate involvement in the regulation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A recent study has shown TDG to have a dual role in epigenetic maintenance. Firstly, as a structural component, TDG is involved in the maintenance of active and bivalent chromatin through interactions with activating histone modifiers. Secondly, TDG appears to provide DNA repair functionality leading to the ability to erase aberrant methylation at GC-rich promoter regions. This dual-role suggests that TDG is important for the protection of critical genomic regions from <italic>de-novo</italic> DNA methylation and heterochromatinization during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Data description</title><p>Here, we present a comprehensive resource comprising data and tools for the study of genome-wide methylation profiles in mouse. 18 methylomes were generated using a dataset of over 251 million uniquely mapped fragments (&#x0003e;502 million mapped paired-end reads) and were processed using our novel MeDIP-seq computational analysis pipeline (Methylated DNA Utility for Sequence Analysis, or MeDUSA). The methylomes represent 6 biological cohorts, demonstrating robust detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the context of both differentiation and, more subtly, a gene KO system, in this case <italic>Tdg</italic>. Further analysis of these DMRs by integration with Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data provides new insights into the functionality of TDG.</p><p>The MeDIP-seq data from this study have been submitted to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] under accession no.

The biological samples were generated as described by Cort&#x000e1;zar <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Over 500 million reads were uniquely mapped to the reference genome (NCBIM37), using BWA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] (alignment score&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;= 10), representing over 250 million mapped fragments (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1). Additionally, fragment length normalisation was performed in order to eliminate potential bias in coverage resulting from discrepancies in the distribution of fragment lengths between samples. Correlation in genome-wide sequence coverage between replicates was calculated. The correlation between the 3 biological replicates of the NPC and MEF cohorts was high (&#x0003e;0.83 and &#x0003e;0.90 respectively) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S2). Correlation in the ESC cohorts was considerably lower (&#x0003e;0.51), perhaps reflecting greater epigenetic dynamism in the undifferentiated cells. Non-CpG methylation, believed to be prevalent in undifferentiated cells, has been shown to display both lower methylation levels within a cell population and lower conservation between cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. If true, this dynamism would not be seen in technologies such as MethylCap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] that only pull back methylation from CpG dinucleotides, and could potentially contribute to the increased variation between ESC replicates. Correlation between ESC samples in CpG islands was notably higher (0.85-0.89). Whilst the increased variation in ESCs, reflected by the lower correlation, could present challenges, our method for DMR identification can locate true biological variation whilst minimizing false positives. In addition to determining the correlation between biological replicates, we determined the proportion of CpG sites in the reference genome that were covered by aligned fragments (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1 and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1). Furthermore, both saturation analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and between replicate correlations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] indicated we had sufficient reads to provide reproducible genome-wide methylation profiles (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S2). An example of the output from the saturation and coverage analysis performed in the MeDUSA pipeline, by MEDIPS is shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure 1.</p><p>We validated our MeDIP-seq results, utilising previously published reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) data from wild type (wt) ESCs, wt NPCs and wt MEFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (BS-seq) of wt ESC and wt NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. For the purpose of validation, absolute methylation values were calculated from the MeDIP read counts for the ESC <italic>Tdg</italic><sup><italic>+/&#x02212;</italic></sup>, NPC <italic>Tdg</italic><sup><italic>+/&#x02212;</italic></sup> and the MEF <italic>Tdg</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> cohorts using MEDIPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Reads from each of the replicates within each cohort were merged into a single cohort-specific dataset. Validation was performed for all CpG sites in ESC and NPC that were covered (minimum depth of 10) in both the RRBS and the BS-seq datasets. Only RRBS data was available for MEFs. Overall correlation was high between the data types, ranging from 0.86 for the ESC comparison, to 0.80 for the NPCs and 0.67 for the MEFs. This validation also supported our saturation analysis, as regions lacking coverage in MeDIP-seq reads were shown to be largely unmethylated as opposed to being an artifact resulting from insufficient sequencing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The decrease in correlation as the cells become increasingly differentiated could be an artifact of the CpG subset analysed, though it may also reflect true clonal effects. This is supported by the decrease in correlation between the RRBS and Bis-seq data for ESC (0.96) and NPC (0.86).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of MEDIPS normalised MeDIP-seq data with RRBS</bold>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]<bold>and BS-seq</bold>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]<bold>data.</bold><bold>(a)</bold> ESC <italic>Tdg</italic><sup><italic>+/&#x02212;</italic></sup> MeDIP vs ESC wt RRBS. <bold>(b)</bold> NPC <italic>Tdg</italic><sup><italic>+/&#x02212;</italic></sup> MeDIP vs NPC wt RRBS. <bold>(c)</bold> MEF wt MeDIP vs MEF wt RRBS. <bold>(d)</bold> ESC <italic>Tdg</italic><sup><italic>+/&#x02212;</italic></sup> MeDIP vs ESC wt BS-seq. <bold>(e)</bold> NPC <italic>Tdg</italic><sup><italic>+/&#x02212;</italic></sup> MeDIP vs NPC wt BS-seq.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2047-217X-1-3-1"/></fig><p>Our dataset can be accessed through Ensembl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] as part of the HEROIC portal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S2) and the <italic>GigaScience</italic> database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>MeDUSA computational pipeline</title><p>The MeDIP-seq data were processed using our novel analysis pipeline MeDUSA (Methylated DNA Utility for Sequence Analysis). MeDUSA brings together numerous software packages to perform a full analysis of MeDIP-seq data, including sequence alignment, quality control (QC), and determination and annotation of DMRs. In contrast to previously published tools for MeDIP-seq analysis (e.g. Batman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], MEDIPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]) in which the primary focus was the ability to accurately call absolute methylation values based on CpG density, the focus for MeDUSA is the accurate and statistically rigorous identification of DMRs. To achieve this, relative changes in DNA methylation between cohorts (rather than absolute changes within cohort) need to be determined, and as such the problem has much in common with identifying differential expression between RNAseq cohorts. MeDUSA utilises several applications from within the USeq software suite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and in turn uses the R Bioconductor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] package DESeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] for differential count analysis. In addition, MeDUSA controls several other important functions from the alignment (BWA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]) and subsequent filtering (SAMtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]) through the generation of numerous quality control metrics (FastQC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and MEDIPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]), and preliminary annotation of the DMRs (utilising the capabilities of BEDTools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]).</p><p>There are several issues that can hinder MeDIP-seq analysis, particularly when identifying DMRs. Firstly, sequencing depth between samples will vary and so read counts need to be normalised. Whilst global read count normalisation can help address this problem, it does not account for &#x02018;competition&#x02019; effects. Such competition can be seen in RNA-seq, in which sample specific highly expressed genes can lead to a depressed normalised read count in other genes and hence a bias when comparing samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Analogous situations can be found in MeDIP-seq, where sample-specific repeat methylation could potentially bias analyses, particularly given the large proportion of methylated repetitive sequence found in the genome, or samples with high levels of non-CpG methylation could lead to an underestimation of methylation levels at CpG sites. Secondly, MeDIP-seq experiments will often have small numbers of biological replicates, and hence it can be difficult to obtain reliable estimates of model parameters to fit statistical models and locate real differences between samples. MeDUSA utilises DESeq to address these challenges. DESeq estimates variance in a local fashion and in doing so removes potential selection biases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Additionally, rather than attempting to reliably estimate the variance and mean parameters of the distribution from limited numbers of replicates, DESeq estimates a more flexible, mean-dependent local regression. Typically, there is enough data available in these experiments to allow for sufficiently precise local estimation of the dispersion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and hence avoid bias towards certain areas of the dynamic range when identifying DMRs. Finally, it is possible that differences in DNA fragment size distributions between samples could compromise accurate biological interpretation. MeDUSA provides the option to perform fragment length normalisation through read sub-sampling to equalize the distributions, thus eliminating this potential bias.</p><p>Additionally, taking advantage of the genome-wide nature of MeDIP-seq and the affinity of the MeDIP-seq antibody for methylated cytosine (i.e., not in a CpG-methylation specific context), MeDUSA also allows identification of potential non-CpG methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. By determining the ratio of fragments originating from each strand, we can infer the strand from which the methylation signal originated. An even distribution on both strands would be anticipated for a methylated region driven by symmetric CpG methylation. In contrast an asymmetric fragment distribution, preferentially aligning to one strand, could indicate the presence of non-CpG methylation, particularly when supported by sequence motif analysis. Compared to previous methods, the MeDUSA-analysed profiles result in 3 separate tracks per methylome, with the proportion of reads indicated that are mapping to both, forward or reverse strands, allowing assessment of CpG and potential non-CpG methylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The potential to search for DMRs driven by non-CpG methylation illustrates the flexibility inherent when performing a relative analysis of MeDIP samples. This flexibility means that the pipeline will also be equipped to analyse enrichment data for other DNA modifications such as hydroxymethylcytosine, formylcytosine and carboxylcytosine.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Mouse NPC methylomes viewed in the UCSC browser.</bold> Each sample has 3 tracks representing total coverage (red) and coverage on forward (green) and reverse (blue) strands.

Using MeDUSA, we compared the MeDIP-seq methylation profiles of ESC <italic>Tdg</italic><sup><italic>+/&#x02212;</italic></sup>, NPC <italic>Tdg</italic><sup><italic>+/&#x02212;</italic></sup> and the MEF <italic>Tdg</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> samples to define large numbers of statistically significant DMRs associated with different stages of differentiation. As expected, more DMRs (maximum FDR 5%) were found between ESCs and MEFs (366,980 hypomethylated in MEFs, 109,694 hypermethylated in MEFs) than between ESCs and NPCs (125,335 hypomethylated in NPCs, 75,496 hypermethylated in NPCs) or NPCs and MEFs (263,911 hypomethylated in MEFs, 100,365 hypermethylated in MEFs). DMRs ranged in size from 29&#x02009;bp to 46,820&#x02009;bp (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S3a). The distance between adjacent DMRs was largely dependent on total number of DMRs identified (correlation&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.92) and ranged from 500&#x02009;bp to 7,501,000&#x02009;bp (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S3b). Comparison of global methylation status suggested a trend for decreased methylation during differentiation (shown by the increased numbers of hypomethylated DMRs versus the numbers of hypermethylated) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). This is supported by data from previous studies of human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Of the 125,335 hypomethylated DMRs found between NPCs and ESCs, 85% were also deemed to be hypomethylated between MEFs and ESCs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S4). Additionally, 31% underwent further hypomethylation between the NPC and MEF state, illustrating that in some cases hypomethylation is a continuous process through multiple stages of differentiation. A contrast to this global hypomethylation with differentiation was shown in CpG island regions. We saw more instances of increased methylation in CpG islands along the transition to differentiated cells (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c; 0.001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). This supports the idea of an increasingly restrictive pattern of gene expression associated with differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These dynamic islands include many regions associated with system development, including numerous members of the <italic>Hox</italic><italic>Pou</italic><italic>Six</italic><italic>Klf</italic>, and <italic>Tcf</italic> gene families. Enrichment analysis of genes associated with these islands shows significant enrichment in roles for tissue development (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.02e-56) and embryonic development (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.11e-43). Additionally, as expected, the Homeobox domain was found to be strongly associated within these island regions (FDR&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.85e-32).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Number of DMRs identified in comparisons of samples from different stages of differentiation.</bold> DMRs hypermethylated in the more differentiated state are shown in blue, those hypomethylated in the more differentiated state are in yellow. <bold>(a)</bold> All DMRs. <bold>(b)</bold> DMRs located in CpG Island regions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2047-217X-1-3-3"/></fig><p>To perform a large-scale validation of all the DMRs (maximum FDR 1%) called between ESC and NPC cohorts, BS-seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] was utilised (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The methylation score for each CpG dinucleotide was determined from the BS-seq data.

This property is of particular use when interrogating stem cell datasets in which non-CpG methylation is reportedly prevalent. Additionally, the development of the MeDUSA pipeline allowed for the analysis of the MeDIP-seq data from alignment and QC through to calling and annotation of significant DMRs.

By performing a range of computational analyses, we were able to consistently link <italic>Tdg</italic> KO-associated DMRs with regulation of transcription during developmental processes and regions involved in the maintenance of repressive chromatin, particularly those occupied with PRC2. These findings support the notion that TDG may be involved in the protection of critical regions from <italic>de-novo</italic> methylation by actively demethylating erroneously methylated cytosines. Recent studies have shown that TET catalyses the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxycytosine (5caC), the latter two being substrates for TDG and, thus, readily replaced by unmodified cytosine via base excision repair (BER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].
