For example, previous studies have shown that female threespined stickleback fish (<italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>) exposed to predation risk produce offspring with altered behavior, metabolism and stress physiology. Here, we investigate the effect of maternal exposure to predation risk on the embryonic transcriptome in sticklebacks. Using RNA-sequencing we compared genome-wide transcription in three day post-fertilization embryos of predator-exposed and control mothers. There were hundreds of differentially expressed transcripts between embryos of predator-exposed mothers and embryos of control mothers including several non-coding RNAs. Gene Ontology analysis revealed biological pathways involved in metabolism, epigenetic inheritance, and neural proliferation and differentiation that differed between treatments. Interestingly, predation risk is associated with an accelerated life history in many vertebrates, and several of the genes and biological pathways that were identified in this study suggest that maternal exposure to predation risk accelerates the timing of embryonic development. Consistent with this hypothesis, embryos of predator-exposed mothers were larger than embryos of control mothers. These findings point to some of the molecular mechanisms that might underlie maternal effects.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (grant IOS 1121980), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsf.gov">www.nsf.gov</ext-link>, and the National Institutes of Health R01 (GM082937), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov">www.nih.gov</ext-link>.

Prenatal exposure to maternally-derived stress hormones can have organizational effects on development with lifelong consequences for offspring (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0098564-Weinstock1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0098564-Matthews1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098564-Clarke2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>).</p><p>Predators are one of the most important naturally-occurring stressors for animals in natural populations <xref rid="pone.0098564-Canoine1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098564-Blanchard1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, influencing both evolved and plastic life history traits of prey such as growth <xref rid="pone.0098564-Sheriff1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098564-VanBuskirk1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, age at reproduction <xref rid="pone.0098564-Magnhagen1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098564-Stibor1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and size at reproduction <xref rid="pone.0098564-Stibor1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098564-Gliwicz1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. A number of recent studies have shown consequences of in utero exposure to predation risk <xref rid="pone.0098564-Sheriff1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098564-Storm1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098564-Weisser1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098564-Shine1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. For example, predator-exposed female sticklebacks produced larger eggs with higher concentrations of cortisol and, initially, a higher metabolism <xref rid="pone.0098564-Giesing1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Later in life, offspring of predator-exposed stickleback mothers exhibited greater antipredator behavior <xref rid="pone.0098564-Giesing1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, an altered stress response to predation risk <xref rid="pone.0098564-Mommer1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, and performed relatively poorly in a learning task <xref rid="pone.0098564-Roche1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Maternal exposure to predation risk also influenced offspring survival in sticklebacks <xref rid="pone.0098564-Mcghee1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that maternal exposure to predation risk has organizational effects on the development of the offspring brain and HPI (hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal) axis that influences offspring traits well into adulthood.</p><p>Despite growing appreciation of maternal effects occur across taxa and traits, we are just beginning to understand the molecular mechanisms by which maternal experience influences offspring. Therefore, we used RNA-sequencing technology to compare the stickleback embryonic transcriptomes of predator-exposed mothers and unexposed (control) mothers. We measured embryos at three days post-fertilization (dpf) because in zebrafish it is the earliest period when maternally-derived RNAs are thought to be fully degraded <xref rid="pone.0098564-Mathavan1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and when brain regions begin to develop <xref rid="pone.0098564-Mueller1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>We made the following predictions about the types of genes and pathways likely to be influenced by maternal exposure to predation risk. First, because embryos from maternally-stressed stickleback mothers had higher initial respiration of oxygen <xref rid="pone.0098564-Giesing1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> we predicted that maternal stress would increase transcription of yolk-processing enzymes <xref rid="pone.0098564-Kwon1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and the mitochondrial genes involved in oxidative metabolism.</p><p>Second, stress influences brain gene expression (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0098564-Mueller2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>) therefore we predicted that genes associated with neural development might be differentially expressed between embryos of predator-exposed and control mothers. We also predicted that genes involved in eye development might be affected by maternal predator exposure because an earlier study in sticklebacks found that genes associated with eye development were differentially expressed in adults following exposure to predation risk <xref rid="pone.0098564-Sanogo1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>Third, previous studies have shown that exposing fish embryos to elevated cortisol alters the expression of genes encoding insulin-like growth factor, growth hormone, thyroid hormone receptors, and growth hormone receptors <xref rid="pone.0098564-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Since stickleback mothers produce eggs with elevated cortisol after exposure to a predator <xref rid="pone.0098564-Giesing1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> we predicted that genes that are activated or repressed by cortisol or synthetic glucocorticoids would be differentially expressed between treatments. Three day post-fertilization stickleback embryos do not produce endogenous cortisol (Paitz et al, unpublished). Therefore we did not expect that the key gene products required for HPI axis function, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) to be expressed. Also, since glucocorticoids are known to affect the expression of immunity-related genes, for example genes of the complement pathway (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0098564-Rhen1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>), we predicted an effect of maternal exposure to predation risk on the expression of genes involved in immunity.</p><p>Fourth, predation pressure is associated with a relatively &#x02018;fast&#x02019; life history (accelerated development, small size at maturity, early age at reproduction) in many taxa (fish, reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0098564-Endler1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, birds <xref rid="pone.0098564-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, amphibians <xref rid="pone.0098564-Chivers1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>), including sticklebacks <xref rid="pone.0098564-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> therefore we predicted that genes related to accelerated growth and development would be upregulated in embryos as a result of maternal exposure to predation risk.</p><p>Finally, given the broad epigenetic changes that occur across the genome during tissue differentiation (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0098564-Jaenisch1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>), and previous studies showing that maternal care influences offspring DNA methylation patterns <xref rid="pone.0098564-Szyf1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> we also predicted that genes involved in epigenetic modifications to the genome, such as the DNA methyltransferases, would be influenced by maternal exposure to predation risk.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This work was conducted in accordance with national standards on animal welfare as approved by the University of Illinois Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC# 09204).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Animal collection and maternal treatment</title><p>Juvenile threespine sticklebacks were caught by baited trap from the Navarro River, CA in July, 2011 and transported to the University of Illinois (Urbana, IL). Fish were housed until adulthood (approximately 1 year of age) in 37L tanks (53L x 33W x 24H cm) with gravel-bottom, artificial plant refugia, a flow-through system with UV, charcoal, particulate and biological filters that remove olfactory cues and a photoperiod that mimics seasonal changes at a density of 10 fish/tank. Fish were fed <italic>ad libitum</italic> once daily frozen bloodworms, brine shrimp, mysis shrimp, and cyclopeez.</p><p>In August, 2012 when sticklebacks showed reproductive morphology (red throat in males, gravidity in females) they were separated by sex. Males were housed individually in 9L tanks, females were housed in groups of four in 26.5L tanks (36L x 33W x 24H cm) with opaque external shading. Tanks of females were randomly assigned as control or predator exposed. The females in predator exposed tanks were chased daily for 30 seconds at a randomly chosen time with a rubber model of a sculpin (<italic>Cottus</italic> spp, SL: 7 cm) to simulate predation risk. Sculpin of this size are a known predator of stickleback eggs and juveniles in the Navarro River (personal observation). Females were chased 29.4&#x000b1;7.3 days (mean &#x000b1; standard error); chased females were exposed to simulated predation risk prior to and during gravidity. Males and control females were not chased. Females were wild caught therefore it is possible that they experienced predation risk prior to the experiment, but they were randomly assigned to either the predator-exposed or control treatment. A promising future direction is to evaluate for how many generations in sticklebacks the effects of maternal exposure to predation risk persist. Further, it is possible that some of the genes differentially expressed in embryos as a result of maternal exposure to predation risk are not specific to predation risk, but instead are common to all stressors or to maternal effects in general. Future studies that expose mothers to multiple and various treatments could potentially distinguish those genes specific to predator-induced maternal effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Rearing embryos</title><p>When females became visibly gravid they were netted from their tank and gently squeezed to obtain live eggs. Males were netted from their tank and immediately sacrificed with a fatal concentration (&#x0003e;0.2 mM) of MS-222 anesthetic. Testes were dissected from individual males, macerated, and the suspension was used to fertilize eggs in a glass petri dish. Egg fertilization was confirmed by observation under a light microscope. Clutches were obtained from n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8 control and n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8 predator-exposed females. Eggs were transferred to mesh-bottom cups in 9 L tanks with air bubblers directly beneath developing clutches. All embryo tanks were treated with 100 uL of methylene blue solution to prevent fungal infection. Unfertilized and infected eggs were removed daily. We sampled whole embryos at 72.040&#x000b1;0.012 (mean &#x000b1; standard error) hours post-fertilization (3 dpf). By 3 dpf our embryos had pigmented eyes, melanopores, and intermittent tail spasms <xref rid="pone.0098564-Swarup1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Morphological differentiation of the sexes in sticklebacks occurs no earlier than 11 dpf <xref rid="pone.0098564-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, so it was not possible to distinguish between male and female embryos. Embryos were collected between August and October, 2012. Embryos were placed in RNAlater RNA stabilization reagent (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) for one hour, and stored at -80C until total RNA extraction in February, 2013.</p><p>In our study gene expression was measured in whole embryos. As a result, many tissue-specific expression changes would not have been detected, particularly for genes that exhibit low levels of expression or are expressed in minute tissues. Measuring sex- and tissue-specific embryonic expression at multiple time-points is an obvious task for future study. Also, measuring cortisol in mothers, eggs, and offspring would be useful toward understanding possible mechanisms for the observed effects on gene expression, and is an obvious future direction. In this experiment it was our priority to obtain sufficient RNA from embryos for sequencing. Since the sacrifice of adult fish or viable eggs is necessary for the measurement of cortisol in sticklebacks it was therefore not possible to set aside a sufficient quantity of mothers, eggs, or offspring for steroid measurement.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>RNA Sequencing</title><p>To obtain sufficient quantity of RNA for quantitation, quality control, and template for cDNA library creation, we haphazardly selected and pooled ten embryos from each mother (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8 control and n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8 experimental mothers, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;160 embryos total). Pools represent independent mothers and so are treated as biological replicates. Embryo pools were homogenized and total RNA extracted from the homogenate using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions (as in <xref rid="pone.0098564-Triant1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>). Briefly, each embryo pool was frozen on dry ice in a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, disrupted with a pestle, treated with extraction buffer containing &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, and then homogenized with a battery operated pestle grinder (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ). Total RNA was purified and treated with on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen). RNA was quantified on a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Hudson, NH) and quality verified on an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The quantity of total RNA obtained from embryo pools was 5.19&#x000b1;0.49 (mean &#x000b1; standard error) micrograms.</p><p>For all samples cDNA libraries were constructed from 1 ug total RNA using the TruSeq Stranded RNAseq Sample Prep kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). These were quantitated on a Qubit fluorometer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), run on an Agilent bioanalyzer chip, diluted to 10 nM, and quantitated again with qPCR. The library construction process selectively purified for mRNA using oligodT primers. Each of the 16 samples was individually barcoded. All samples were combined into a single pool which was divided in half and sequenced on two single-end lanes on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 (TruSeq SBS sequencing kit version 3) at the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center (Urbana, IL). RNA-sequencing of embryo samples produced over 356 million reads each 100 nt in length with average quality scores over 30; there were 22.28&#x000b1;0.48 million reads (mean &#x000b1; standard error) per sample.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Genome alignment and differential expression analysis</title><p>Raw reads were trimmed and trimmed reads aligned to the stickleback reference genome (BROADS1, Ensembl database version 71.1, Feb 2006) using TopHat 2 (version 2.0.8).

Across all samples 88.95&#x000b1;0.18 percent (mean &#x000b1; stderr) of trimmed reads mapped to the genome, and 51.87&#x000b1;0.79 percent (mean &#x000b1; stderr) that mapped to the genome mapped uniquely within known or predicted genes, consistent with other RNA-seq studies that used genomes with comparable assembly and annotation quality <xref rid="pone.0098564-Blow1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Genes were removed from the dataset if they were detected in only a single sample and at less than one count per million mapped reads (3339 genes) or if they had zero counts for all samples (1677 genes). The remaining 17440 out of the 22456 genes in the stickleback genome representing aligned reads were evaluated for differential expression between maternally-stressed and control embryos using two methods. First, we used the <italic>exactTest</italic> function in EdgeR (bioconductor.org, version 2.11). Second, we used Cufflinks/Cuffdiff (version 2.1.1). Cuffdiff employs an algorithm that probabilistically divides ambiguous fragments among genomic loci and then counts expression data at the transcript level, resulting in counts of Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million mapped reads (FPKM, <xref rid="pone.0098564-Blow1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098564-Trapnell1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>). EdgeR uses a different algorithm that counts reads at the gene level, applies a normalization factor that adjusts for library size, and reports the results as the logarithm of modified Counts Per Million mapped reads (logCPM, <xref rid="pone.0098564-Blow1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098564-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>). The list of differentially expressed genes identified in EdgeR (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;295 genes, FDR cutoff &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.10) was compared for overlap with the list generated in CuffDiff (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;268 genes, FDR cutoff &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05) and combined into a single dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098564.s001">Figure S1</xref>; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;455 genes).

The majority of genes falling between the 0.05 and 0.10 FDR thresholds in EdgeR are also significant within the Cuffdiff FDR&#x02264;0.05 threshold or they code for a different subunit of a gene that falls within the Cuffdiff threshold, confirming that our choice to use different FDR cutoffs did not greatly affect the composition of the gene list.</p><p>Stickleback Ensembl gene IDs were downloaded from BioMart (toplevel.fa version 70 ensemble.org) for all 455 differentially expressed genes along with 292 of the corresponding gene symbols (unique gene identifiers assigned by HGNC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genenames.org">http://www.genenames.org</ext-link>); 101 gene symbols for the remaining Ensembl IDs were obtained manually from the Ensembl database (release 71, Apr 2013) based on 1-to-1 orthology to other vertebrate species, for a total of 393 genes (&#x0223c;86% of the dataset) with gene symbols.

The DAVID analysis was carried out a second time using Human Ensembl IDs corresponding to 15504 of the 17440 detected stickleback genes (&#x0223c;89%) to test the reliability of using genome as background. The majority of the 317 genes with gene symbols (&#x0003e;80%) were not represented in the output when Human Ensembl IDs converted from the list of detected stickleback genes were used as background, likely due to incomplete annotation of genes with official gene symbols within DAVID. Using the 17440 detected (i.e. expressed) genes as background instead of the whole genome reduced the total number of terms that met the FDR threshold but did not change the nature of the terms obtained (results not shown). Due to the fact that some gene symbols might not match between stickleback and humans and to test the effect of species-specific quality of annotation within DAVID we carried out additional analyses. The first additional analysis was run using mouse annotations and mouse genome background: 294 of 455 genes from the list of differentially expressed genes (64.6%) had corresponding gene symbols within DAVID. The second additional analysis was run using zebrafish annotations and zebrafish genome as background: 165 of the 455 differentially-expressed genes (36.3%) had corresponding gene symbols within DAVID. Finally to evaluate whether some of the identified GO terms might reflect spurious associations, a random list of n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;455 genes were selected from the total 17440 expressed genes in stickleback embryos and run through DAVID using human annotations and genome as background. This procedure was repeated three times. In all 71&#x02013;75% of genes in the lists were mapped within DAVID, and all three trials produced no significant GO_BP, GO_CC, GO_MF, or KEGG pathways below the FDR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05 cutoff.</p><p>A separate functional classification of the genes differentially expressed in stickleback embryos was performed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) using Human Ensembl Gene IDs converted from the 455 Stickleback Ensembl Gene IDs in BioMart. There were corresponding Human Ensembl Gene IDs for n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;302 of the 455 stickleback genes in the dataset (&#x0223c;66%). However because the human genome has multiple orthologs per gene relative to the stickleback genome, the number of Human Ensembl Gene IDs (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;596) we obtained was greater than the number of genes in the original dataset. Gene identifiers, their fold changes, and FDR values for the 596 human genes were uploaded to IPA and queried against the Ingenuity database to identify biological functions enriched in the dataset, at default stringency. A total of n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;334 of the 596 Human Ensembl Gene IDs (&#x0223c;56%) were successfully recognized by IPA.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Embryo morphological measurements</title><p>To understand whether changes in gene expression relate to morphological changes we measured total length and eye diameter on a subset of embryos. Clutches were thawed, decanted to glass petri dishes and photographed at 15&#x000d7; magnification under an Olympus SZX12 stereo light microscope with a DF Plapo 1x-PF objective and an Olympus DP26 camera. The anterior/posterior axis of each embryo (nose to tail, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098564.s004">Fig S4</xref>) was digitally measured using the microscope's cellSens v1.6 Dimension software. Since a previous study in sticklebacks exposed to predators identified increased expression of genes associated with eye photoreceptor development <xref rid="pone.0098564-Sanogo1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> we predicted that maternal exposure to a predator might cause an increase in the size of the embryonic eye. To accurately measure embryo eye diameters photographs were printed and eyes measured with a ruler. The longest obtainable dimension from the area of eye pigmentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098564.s004">Fig S4</xref>) of the largest visible eye of each embryo was recorded to the nearest 33.3 um. Since the physical reorientation of an embryo within the petri dish disturbed the orientation of several adjoining embryos it was not possible to obtain photographs that showed the eyes of all embryos. Therefore, we were unable to obtain dimensions of the eyes from some embryos (28%). We obtained data on embryo length from n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;127 embryos from n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4 control mothers and n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;388 embryos from n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;14 predator-exposed mothers. We obtained data on eye diameter data from n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;92 embryos from 4 control mothers and n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;282 embryos from 14 predator-exposed mothers. Morphological data were normally distributed and were analyzed in SPSS (version 20.0) using a linear model with maternal treatment as a fixed effect and mother identity as a random effect. The model for eye diameter data was run with embryo length as a covariate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Overall expression patterns</title><p>There were n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;455 differentially expressed genes between embryos from control and predator-exposed mothers identified either by EdgeR, Cuffdiff, or both (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098564.s001">Fig S1</xref>). Nearly twice as many genes were upregulated (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;302) than downregulated (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;153).

Changing the annotation and background from human to mouse and zebrafish tested whether the quality of between-species annotations within DAVID influenced the quality of GO and KEGG enrichment results. Using mouse annotations instead of human led to the inclusion of GO_BP terms associated with osmoregulation and coagulation, but did not largely change the GO_CC, GO_MF, or KEGG pathway annotations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098564.s006">Table S2</xref>). Using zebrafish annotations instead of human led to the inclusion of a new GO_BP term &#x0201c;generation of precursor metabolites and energy&#x0201d;, though this is not largely different from previously obtained GO_BP terms, and fewer terms met the FDR threshold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098564.s007">Table S3</xref>). The consistent recovery of GO and KEGG enrichment results across species, coupled with the failure of randomly-drawn gene lists to identify any significant GO terms, suggests that the results of the

We did not detect a difference in eye diameter between embryos of maternally-stressed and control mothers, possibly due to limitations in our method of measurement, limited statistical power to detect a subtle difference, or a true lack of difference between the embryos. Future studies wishing to understand the influence of maternal stress on the developing embryo visual system might focus on the proliferation and differentiation of cells of the visual system and the localization of the expression of the specific genes reported here.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Effects of maternal predator exposure on stress- and immune-related genes</title><p>Many of the genes that are essential for the functioning of the vertebrate HPI axis were not expressed in 3dpf stickleback embryos, including several key neuroendocrine ligands, their receptors, and enzymes responsible for the production of cortisol. These results are not surprising given results that suggest rapid clearance of embryonic steroids early in development (Paitz et al, unpublished). Also, we detected a significant effect of maternal stress on the expression of genes shown to be similarly influenced in humans and other mammal cells by exposure to the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. It is therefore possible that some of the genes differentially expressed in stickleback embryos in response to maternal stress were activated or repressed through the action of maternal cortisol, though cortisol was not measured in this experiment. Further study is needed to understand the magnitude and tissue specificity by which maternal glucocorticoids might influence the embryonic transcriptome.</p><p>Consistent with the known effects of glucocorticoids on immune function, we detected the differential regulation of several immune genes, including genes involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses.

An unexpected result of this study, then, is that pathways involved with gonadal steroids and sexual differentiation were influenced by maternal exposure to predation risk in three days post-fertilization embryos. Sticklebacks are external fertilizers and stickleback males are the heterogametic sex, so it is interesting that maternal stress would affect sexual differentiation when sex is not determined until after mothers have broken contact with offspring. These results suggest that sexual maturation and gonadal differentiation could be occurring earlier in maternally-stressed embryos, again reflecting a difference in the timing of development.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Maternal predator exposure influences genes associated with epigenetic modifications</title><p>Several factors involved in the epigenetic silencing of gene transcription, including multiple DNA-methyltransferases and two histone proteins, were differentially expressed in maternally-stressed embryos. DNMT3 is responsible for de novo methylation, specifically methylation at CpG sites, during development <xref rid="pone.0098564-Okano1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. Decreased methylation of CpG sites in or nearby genes is associated with increased transcription <xref rid="pone.0098564-Jaenisch1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> and so downregulation of DNMT3A and DNMT3B, as we observed in this study, is expected to increase activation of genes with nearby CpG islands. Further, we observed a downregulation of the histone H1 and H2A proteins, which are part of the histone complex that interacts with methylated DNA to suppress transcription (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0098564-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>). Downregulation of these genome-wide epigenetic repressors of transcription is consistent with the finding that twice the number of genes were activated (i.e. upregulated) in response to maternal stress than were repressed (i.e. downregulated). These results are consistent with the emerging literature on epigenetic modifications to the genome that have long term effects on offspring development (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0098564-Szyf1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Maternal predator exposure influenced the expression of microRNAs</title><p>The unbiased whole transcriptome approach we used allowed us to identify the differential expression of several small RNAs that are not picked up in traditional microarray studies.
