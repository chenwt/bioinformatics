    "Among mammals, milk constituents directly influence the ecology of the infant's commensal microbiota. The immunological and nutritional impacts of breast milk and microbiota are increasingly well understood; less clear are the consequences for infant behavior. Here, we propose that interactions among bioactives in mother's milk and microbes in the infant gut contribute to infant behavioral phenotype and, in part, have the potential to mediate parent-offspring conflict. We hypothesize that infant behavior likely varies as a function of their mother's milk composition interacting with the infant's neurobiology directly and indirectly through the commensal gut bacteria. In this article, we will explore our hypothesis of a milk-microbiota-brain-behavior dynamic in the context of the coevolution between human milk oligosaccharides, bacteria, the gut-brain axis and behavior. Integrating established features of these systems allows us to generate novel hypotheses to motivate future research and consider potential implications of current and emerging clinical treatments."
