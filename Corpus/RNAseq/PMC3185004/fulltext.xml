At the heart of sequence-dependent expression-regulation is both the sequence of the gene and its encompassing genomic environment. In most eukaryotes, the first stage of sequence-dependent gene expression regulation occurs at the point of transcription initiation. This regulation is dependent on short specific sequences which can act positively or negatively to effect transcriptional regulation, and in most cases mediate their effects through the recruitment of specific DNA binding proteins. For the purposes of this work, we consider this group of short regulatory elements to encompass all transcription factor binding sites and promoter/polymerase recruitment sites. Short specific sequences also play a role in regulation of gene expression post transcription, and in this context can appear in the form of polyadenylation signals, splice sites (e.g. sequences which mark intron-exon boundaries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Zheng1">[1]</xref>) or sites which recruit RNA binding proteins. Post-transcriptional processing is also dependent on longer sequences which function to impart structure to the emerging or mature RNA transcript, for example the hairpin loop found in the 3&#x02032; un-translated region of histone mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Wang1">[2]</xref>. Finally, at the point of translation, the sequence of the gene itself can play a regulatory role in its expression through its intrinsic codon bias: i.e. by using codons which correspond to different iso-accepting tRNAs with different relative abundances in the cell, translational efficiency and hence gene expression efficiency can be affected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Gustafsson1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Lavner1">[4]</xref>. Regulation beyond this point is assumed to be independent of the sequence encompassed in the gene or its genomic location.</p><p>The trypanosomatids are a monophyletic sub-group of excavate parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Hamilton1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Simpson1">[6]</xref> which collectively exhibit an extraordinarily broad host-range which extends from crocodiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Hoare1">[7]</xref> to coconut palms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Camargo1">[8]</xref>. Several members of the trypanosomatid group cause globally important parasitic diseases of humans including sleeping sickness, Chagas disease and leishmaniases which together kill and debilitate hundreds of thousands of people worldwide each year (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int">http://www.who.int</ext-link>). The study of gene-expression in trypanosomatids has been highly productive and has led to the discovery of several fundamental aspects of transcription, some of which have subsequently been found to be utilised in many other eukaryotes. These discoveries include RNA editing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Benne1">[9]</xref>, trans-splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Boothroyd1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Borst1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-VanderPloeg1">[12]</xref> and RNA polymerase I transcription of protein coding genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Rudenko1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Navarro1">[14]</xref>. Despite these early breakthroughs in understanding gene expression in trypanosomatids, we know little about the identity and role of the many regulatory elements which must govern this system. This is particularly pertinent as most protein coding genes in trypanosomatids are expressed in polycistronic transcription units where promoters appear to be absent from the 5&#x02032; end of genes. There are a few exceptions to this rule, and these include the characterisation of a number of Pol I and Pol II promoters. The characterised Pol I promoters drive expression of the ribosomal RNA and the major surface protein genes of the parasite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Brown1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Janz1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Pham1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Sherman1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Vanhamme1">[19]</xref>, and the characterised Pol II promoter drives expression of the spliced-leader RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Gilinger1">[20]</xref>.

This obligatory transition to monocistronic RNA molecules is mediated by trans-splicing, a process in which a 35 nucleotide capped RNA molecule is added upstream of the start codon of each coding sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Borst1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-VanderPloeg1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Clayton1">[31]</xref>. Prior to the release of the trypanosomatid genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Ivens1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Berriman1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-ElSayed1">[33]</xref>, analysis of the few available gene sequences resulted in the proposal of a canonical trans-splicing signal. This signal was believed to be composed of four elements: 1) a branch-point adenine site (YNYURAC where Y&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;C or U; R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;G or A, and N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;any base), 2) a poly-pyrimidine tract, 3) a short variable spacer region and 4) a splice acceptor site (AG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Vanhamme2">[34]</xref>. The importance of the poly-pyrimidine tract has since been repeatedly documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Ullu1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Hotz1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Hug1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Lee1">[38]</xref>, however its role in the trans-splicing process or its properties have yet to be defined. Moreover, it became apparent on release of the genome sequences that one could not use these elements to locate <italic>bona fide</italic> trans-splice sites.</p><p>In the absence of obvious motifs controlling trans-splice site specification, two statistical methods for identifying putative trans-splice acceptor sites in the 5&#x02032; intergenic region of coding sequences were developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Siegel2">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Gopal1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Benz1">[41]</xref>. One method is based on the observation that the AG di-nucleotide that is often used as the splice acceptor site is situated in a region of DNA otherwise poor in AG di-nucleotides. The other is based on the position of an AG di-nucleotide relative to a semi-defined polypyrimidine tract element. In both studies, short specific sequences could not be identified, rather statistical approaches were taken to produce scores for individual AG sites outside of open reading frames. The convergence of both studies on an absence of &#x0201c;motifs&#x0201d; implies that secondary structure plays an important role in splice-site delineation. Moreover, discrepancies between prediction methods implies that there are extra levels of information encoded in the genome which have so far evaded characterisation.</p><p>Unlike in most eukaryotes, polyadenylation of transcripts in trypanosomatids is dependent on post-transcriptional processing of the downstream gene. It was shown in experiments with permeabilised cells that trans-splicing of a gene occurs before the polyadenylation of its upstream neighbour and that inhibition of trans-splicing leads to coupled abolition of polyadenylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Ullu1">[35]</xref>. Given the gene-dense nature of the trypanosomatid directional gene clusters, and the fact that trans-splicing by its nature cleaves the transcript near to the 3&#x02032; end of the preceding gene, it is easy to hypothesise that polyadenylation in trypanosomatids became dependent on trans-splicing for production of the free 3&#x02032; end. Since it appears that only one cleavage event occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Ullu1">[35]</xref>, and that transcripts are polyadenylated at specific reproducible sites (though often more than one site per gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Hug1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Matthews1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-LeBowitz1">[43]</xref> the 3&#x02032;end must be degraded back to an as yet elusive polyadenylation signal. Implicit in this coupled mechanism is that there must be trans-splice sites not associated with coding sequences located downstream of genes at the ends of polycistrons. Indeed, trans-splicing to AG sites lacking any associated coding sequencing has been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Hug1">[37]</xref>. However, the role of these trans-spliced non-coding RNA sequences, apart from generating free 3&#x02032; ends, has yet to be determined.</p><p>Several methods have been developed to identify regulatory motifs in DNA sequences. The methods are diverse and can range from information-rich methods, which utilise groups of co-regulated or functionally related genes to search for regulatory sequences in upstream regions (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Cora1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Gupta1">[45]</xref>), to information-poor methods, which simply look for over-represented sequence motifs in a collection of sequences (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Bailey1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Thompson1">[47]</xref>). To date these and other methods have failed to shed light on any recurring regulatory motifs in trypanosomatid DNA sequences. However, regulatory elements must exist, as both cell-cycle and life-cycle dependent regulation of gene expression has been extensively documented.</p><p>Given that complex patterns of gene expression regulation exist, that cis-acting regulatory motifs appear to be rare and that local nucleotide composition has been shown to be a useful marker in predicting trans-splice sites in kinetoplastid DNA sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Gopal1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Benz1">[41]</xref>. We attempted to determine whether any common or recurring compositional elements could be identified which correlated with known RNA processing sites or which could yield insight into the how gene expression regulation is being mediated in trypanosomatid genomes. To this end we utilised a Bayesian segmentation method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Liu1">[48]</xref> to interrogate the fluctuations in compositional bias in trypanosomatid DNA sequences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Bayesian segmentation</title><p>The Bayesian segmentation method used in this analysis is based on schema adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Liu1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Boys1">[49]</xref>. In brief, the goal of segmentation is to separate out homogeneous regions from sequential data. As such, segmentation plays a critical role in data mining for a wide range of scientific and commercial/industrial applications. A holy grail of data segmentation is to discover homogeneous regions without the requirement for prior assumptions or user derived parameters. Given that DNA is composed of only four nucleotides, it presents an ideal candidate for data segmentation and homogeneous region discovery. The full description of the mathematics is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0025666.s001">file S1</xref>. The Perl source code for segmenting FASTA format sequences is provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0025666.s002">file S2</xref>.</p><p>Our method has two prior assumptions. The first is the conceptual basis for our analysis i.e. that some regulatory elements in the genome may be defined by their local nucleotide composition. The second assumption is that we assign equal weighting to all nucleotides when identifying changes in local nucleotide composition. Given these two assumptions we use a Bayesian method to assign a probability of there being a change in nucleotide composition at every point along a given sequence. Using Bayes rule it is possible to determine the most likely number of change-points in any given sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0025666.s001">File S1</xref>). Hence, for all tests the most probable number of change-points (N) given the sequence was determined and then the N most probable change points were selected as the N highest peaks. Peak selection was made on smoothed probability density profiles which were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with &#x003c3;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3 nucleotides. We then use these inferred change-points in sequence composition to demark the edges of regions containing homogeneous local nucleotide composition. Putative regulatory elements are then identified by comparing these regions and their edges across multiple different sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Evaluation of segmentation performance</title><p>To demonstrate the ability of the method to detect changes in nucleotide composition we tested the ability of the method to recover true changes in sequence composition from simulated sequence data.

In this high-throughput sequence data putative polyadenylation sites were identified as a run of 8 or more A nucleotides in the sequenced RNA molecule. As some of these sites could be false positives arising from A nucleotides occurring at the same place in the genome sequence we excluded those sequences which also contained a run of 8 or more A nucleotides in the genome at the position of the putative splice site (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1968). 100 bp of coding sequence at each end was also included so that the start and stop codons were included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>A tiling approach to analyse larger sequences</title><p>Using the Bayesian approach outlined above, the amount of time taken to analyse a given sequence increases exponentially with sequence length, making analysis of larger sequences or chromosomes as a single DNA sequence difficult. However, since our method is sensitive to changes in composition occurring over relatively short stretches of DNA it is not necessary to analyse larger sequences in one pass. Therefore as computational demand is exponentially related sequence length but linearly related to the number of sequences of the same length we chose to adopt a tiling approach for analysing large sequences. We used this tiling approach to segment the large multi-copy gene arrays. In this tiling approach, the multi-copy array was split up into overlapping sequences each of 500 nucleotides. A 500 bp sequence tile was taken every 20 nucleotide positions so that each tile had a 460 bp overlap with either neighbour sequence tile. This means that each position in the large sequence occurred in 25 overlapping sequence tiles. Each sequence tile was subjected to Bayesian segmentation analysis and the probability profile for the query sequence was re-constructed from the mean probability of all overlapping profiles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>A Bayesian segmentation method detects simulated changes in nucleotide composition</title><p>Several tests were designed to determine the sensitivity of the Bayesian segmentation method to changes in sequence composition. The first test entailed simulation of 100 DNA sequences each composed of 10 directly abutted segments of 50 bp. Each segment was simulated using one of two randomly generated state spaces so that each segment (excluding those at the ends) was positioned between two segments of contrasting composition. The Euclidean distance between the two contrasting state spaces was recorded. For example if the state space for segment 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 was A&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.25, C&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.25, G&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.25, T&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.25 and the state space for segments 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 was A&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.30, C&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.20, G&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.21, T&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.29 then the Euclidean distance between these state spaces is 0.09. Each of the 100 simulated sequences was then subject to Bayesian segmentation. The most likely number of change points (N) given the sequence was inferred and the corresponding N most likely change points were selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025666-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The positions of the inferred change points were noted in each of the 100 simulated sequences and the number of change points within 5 bp of the true change point between segments was recorded. This process was repeated 500 times for different randomly generated state spaces so that the relationship between sequence difference and detection performance could be determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025666-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

This is interesting as secondary structure can act to either enhance or reduce the stability and hence abundance of an RNA molecule within the cell. The potential hybridisation of these two segments was interrogated <italic>in silico</italic> using the DINAMelt Server <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Markham1">[52]</xref> for both the PFR1 and PFR2 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0025666.s007">File S7</xref>). It is unknown whether an interaction between these oppositely composed segments occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>. However it is interesting to note that, for both PFR1 and PFR2, there is potential for these oppositely composed segments surrounding the coding sequence to hybridise with extensive base pairing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0025666.s007">file S7</xref>). If these interactions were to occur, they would be highly stable at temperatures relevant to both life-cycle stages of the parasite (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0025666.s007">file S7</xref>). While it is interesting to consider the interaction potential of these gene encompassing DNA sequences, there is no genome-wide correlation between transcript level as determined by RNAseq technology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Siegel3">[50]</xref> and the free energy of interaction of the DNA immediately surrounding each gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0025666.s008">file S8</xref>). As interaction between the ends of a single RNA molecule might provide a function independent of modulating transcript abundance, we interrogated whether free energy of hybridisation was higher for sequences encompassing the same gene than for sequences from the ends of different randomly selected genes. This analysis showed that there is no difference between the distribution of free energies observed for hybridisation of the 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; ends of the same molecule and the distribution of free energies observed from randomly selected 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; ends from different molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0025666.s008">file S8</xref>). Additionally, the distribution of free energies observed for hybridisation of the 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; ends is more positive (and hence less stable) for randomly generated sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0025666.s008">file S8</xref>). This analysis suggests that the ends of the RNA molecule are coded in such a way as to minimise their interaction potential. Hence, it is unlikely that there is a role played by hybridisation between the 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; un-translated regions in regulating mRNA level control or gene expression regulation in general.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Genome-wide analysis of regulatory element detection</title><p>To determine whether our observations from the monotypic and polytypic gene arrays described above apply to the whole genome we utilised a recently produced high-throughput mRNA sequence dataset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Siegel3">[50]</xref>. From the complete set of intergenic sequences predicted in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome we extracted all nucleotide sequences spanning intergenic regions in the direction of transcription (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10,051). We filtered this set to so that only intergenic sequences which had both annotated tans-splice sites (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6,577) and polyadenylation sites (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5,650) were retained. This filtration resulted in the selection of 5,121 intergenic regions. We included 100 bp of coding sequence at each end such that our predicted intergenic regions contained start and stop codons ad defined positions. We subjected these intergenic regions to Bayesian segmentation. The most probable number of change points given the sequence was determined and the corresponding most probable change points selected. We then counted the number of times that each of the characterised features in the intergenic region (comprising the start codon, the stop codon, the polyadenylation site and the splice acceptor site) was within 5 bp of an inferred change point in nucleotide composition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0025666-t001">Table 1</xref>). We found that approximately one third of all splice sites analysed occur within 5 bp of a predicted change in nucleotide composition. In contrast to this only 17&#x00025; of polyadenylation sites occur within 5 bp of a change in nucleotide composition, which is similar to background levels (16.4&#x00025;). The change in composition associated with the trans-splice site is more readily detectable by this sequence segmentation method than the change in composition between coding and non-coding sequence as both the start and stop codons are only detected by this method in 23.2&#x00025; and 20.8&#x00025; of intergenic regions respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0025666-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0025666-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0025666.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Genome wide analysis of intergenic region features.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0025666-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0025666.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nucleotide element</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Proportion of sites at change-points</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Trans splice site</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.334</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Polyadenylation site</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.17</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Start codon</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.232</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stop codon</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.208</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Randomly selected position</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.164</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><label/><p>The score given represents the proportion of 5,121 elements which were identified as inferred change points in nucleotide composition.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Genomic environment of polyadenylation sites</title><p>To confirm the above observations that polyadenylation sites do not seem to occur at predicted changes in nucleotide composition a further analysis was performed.

Throughout the region upstream of the putative trans-splice site the sequence is predominantly T-rich. As you approach the trans-splice site from the upstream region the sequence becomes increasingly T-rich and G-poor with a local maxima/minima occurring at approximately position &#x02212;30. As observed in our analysis of arrayed genes the splice acceptor site occurs at an inversion in sequence composition where A and G nucleotides replace T and C nucleotides as the highest frequency representatives. This composition inversion strongly suggests that secondary structure, rather than specific sequence elements, are driving trans-splice site delineation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The identification of regulatory elements within DNA, RNA and protein sequences is key to progressing our understanding of the developmental, morphological and behavioural diversity of life. The trypanosomatid transcription system has provided a wealth of insight into transcription processes in eukaryotes yet its regulation remains largely uncharacterised. Evidence from analyses of protein components which mediate transcription suggest that the system of regulation in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> is likely to be dramatically different to well documented systems such as in humans and yeast. Hence, there is a need to develop <italic>ab initio</italic> methods for regulatory information discovery in this organism.</p><p>In our analysis, we found several features common to the genes which are located in multi-copy gene arrays. First, each array is directly preceded by a large A-rich segment of DNA. Each array is also directly followed by at least one large T-rich segment of DNA. Interestingly, the tubulin gene array appears to be the exception to this rule as it is not followed by a T-rich segment. However, it is followed by an additional array containing the histone H3 genes which itself is immediately followed by several large segments of T-rich DNA. The opposing composition found at the opposite ends of the arrays is also found surrounding the individual genes of the arrays themselves. In this case, each coding unit is preceded by an A-rich segment and followed by a T-rich segment. Interestingly the 5&#x02032; boundary of the A-rich segment corresponds to an AG di-nucleotide (&#x0002b;/&#x02212; 3 bp) which in the case of all analysed arrayed genes is known to be the AG used <italic>in vivo</italic>. In each case, this predicted 5&#x02032; boundary separates the A-rich segment from a preceding pyrimidine rich segment. The fact that this critical regulatory site occurs at sequence boundaries raises the question as to what functions the other sequence boundaries might be playing in these intergenic regions.</p><p>T-rich sequences are known to cause pausing which can lead to transcriptional termination by RNA polymerase III in humans and in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Schramm1">[53]</xref>. Indeed the T-rich tracts in the spliced leader RNA genes have been shown to be sufficient to terminate transcription by Pol II in trypanosomatids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025666-Sturm1">[54]</xref>. Therefore, one possibility is that these T-rich regions at the ends of arrays may function as transcriptional modulators. Hence we propose these T-rich regions may be causing transcriptional pausing to aid post-transcriptional processing of transcribed genes. It is possible that pausing leading to termination may be dependent on the length of the T-rich tract.</p><p>The opposite composition of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the mRNA molecule raises several interesting possibilities for a potential role in gene expression regulation. One obvious possibility for the role of oppositely composed segments encompassing each coding sequence is in producing secondary structure in the mRNA. As there is no correlation between the observed mRNA level in the cell and the free energy of interaction between these opposing ends, we can infer that this putative secondary structure is not influencing transcript abundance in the cell. However a role in expression regulation independent of transcript abundance cannot be ruled out.</p><p>By providing a genome wide analysis of intergenic regions we showed that approximately 1/3 of all trans-splice sites occur within 5 bp of an inferred change in nucleotide composition. Moreover, by interrogating the DNA surrounding putative polyadenylation and trans-splice sites we have demonstrated that our observations for the highly expressed arrayed genes extends to all sampled genes in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. We also identified a common polyadenylation motif &#x0201c;TKAA.&#x0201d; Unlike in metazoa, fungi and land plants, the <italic>T. brucei</italic> polyadenylation motif is short and degenerate. We propose that the degeneracy of this motif may be due to a change in the role of the polyadenylation motif from a cleavage site delineator to a coding sequence protector. As the free 3&#x02032; end of an RNA molecule is generated by trans-splicing of the downstream gene there is no requirement for the polyadenylation machinery to produce its own 3&#x02032; end. In the presence of a near by free 3&#x02032; end, the function of the polyadenylation machinery is then to protect the coding sequence from destruction by exonucleases through addition of the poly(A) tail. This modified role of the polyadenylation signal is hence different in trypanosomatids than in other eukaryotes. In this context, it is interesting to note that the polyadenylation motif we identify encompasses two of the three stop codons (TGA and TAA) and that these two stop codons are the two most commonly used stop codons in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome (TGA&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;37&#x00025;, TAA&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;35&#x00025; and TAG&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;28&#x00025;).</p><p>There is an inversion in nucleotide composition which occurs at the position of the trans-splice site. We propose that this inversion in composition is the biological mechanism of trans-splice site specification which is being utilised by the cell. Moreover, this composition inversion suggests a mechanism which is dependent on the secondary structure of the emerging RNA molecule around this inversion point. This proposal is supported by the observations that there are no recurring motifs or specific/degenerate sequence elements associated with the trans-splice site.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0025666.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p><bold>The Bayesian segmentation method.</bold></p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0025666.s001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0025666.s002"><label>File S2</label><caption><p><bold>The source code for the Perl algorithm which subjects FASTA format nucleotide sequences to Bayesian segmentation.</bold></p><p>(PL)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0025666.s002.pl" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0025666.s003"><label>File S3</label><caption><p><bold>The Trypanosoma brucei PFR1 gene array on chromosome 3.</bold> In each case the peak base and the three bases either side are written in blue and centred above the peak.
