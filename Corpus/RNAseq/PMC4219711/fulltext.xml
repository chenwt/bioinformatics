CARD14 is a scaffolding protein that regulates NF-&#x003ba;B activation, and psoriasis-associated <italic>CARD14</italic> mutations lead to enhanced NF-&#x003ba;B signaling. CARD14 is expressed mainly in epidermal keratinocytes, but also in unidentified dermal cells. In this manuscript, the identity of the dermal cell types expressing CARD14, as well the potential functional consequence of overactive CARD14 in these dermal cell types, was determined. Using two-color immunofluorescence, dermal CARD14 did not co-localize with T-cells, dendritic cells, or macrophages. However, dermal CARD14 did highly co-localize with CD31<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells (ECs). CARD14 was also expressed non-dermal endothelial cells, such as aortic endothelial cells, which may indicate a role of CARD14<sup>+</sup>ECs in the systemic inflammation and cardiovascular comorbidities associated with psoriasis. Additionally, phosphorylated NF-&#x003ba;B was found in psoriatic CARD14<sup>+</sup> CD31<sup>+</sup> ECs, demonstrating this pathway is active in dermal ECs in psoriasis. Transfection of dermal ECs with psoriasis-associated <italic>CARD14</italic> mutations resulted in increased expression of several chemokines, including CXCL10, IL-8, and CCL2. These results provide preliminary evidence that CARD14 expression in ECs may contribute to psoriasis through increased expression of chemokines and facilitating recruitment of immune cells into skin.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported in part by grant # 8 UL1 TR000043 from the National Center for Research Resources and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), and AR050266 (AMB) from the National Institutes of Health.

Although the precise etiology of psoriasis is not completely understood, several genetic factors predispose individuals to this chronic skin disease. These chromosomal regions are identified as <italic>psoriasis susceptibility loci</italic> (<italic>PSORS1-PSORS16</italic>). However, the exact gene (or genes) responsible for the susceptibility within each <italic>PSORS</italic> region have not yet been identified.</p><p>Recently, Jordan <italic>et al</italic> described mutations in the <italic>caspase recruitment domain family, member 14 (CARD14/CARMA2</italic>) gene that are responsible for <italic>PSORS2</italic><xref rid="pone.0111255-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Mutations in <italic>CARD14</italic> were described in two families (one of European descent, and a Taiwanese family), as well as a <italic>de no</italic>vo mutation in a Haitian child with sporadic, early-onset, generalized pustular psoriasis <xref rid="pone.0111255-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Additionally, a SNP in <italic>CARD14</italic> achieved genome-wide significance in a recent meta-GWAS study containing 10,588 cases of psoriasis and 22,806 controls <xref rid="pone.0111255-Tsoi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. CARD14 mRNA was also differentially upregulated in lesional psoriasis in an RNAseq study <xref rid="pone.0111255-Jabbari1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Together, these observations suggest CARD14 may play a pathogenic role not only in individuals with psoriasis associated <italic>CARD14</italic> mutations, but also in general psoriasis pathogenesis.</p><p>CARD14 is a scaffolding protein involved in activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B). In steady state conditions, NF-&#x003ba;B is located within the cytoplasm, bound by the inhibitor I&#x003ba;B <xref rid="pone.0111255-Blonska1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Upon activation of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, I&#x003ba;B is phosphorylated by I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK), targeting I&#x003ba;B for degradation, allowing release and activation of NF-&#x003ba;B <xref rid="pone.0111255-Blonska1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111255-Hoesel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Related CARD family members interact with molecules involved in NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, such as Bcl10, MALT1, and TRAF2, which aid in recruitment and activation of the IKK complex <xref rid="pone.0111255-Blonska1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111255-Scudiero1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111255-Bertin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and CARD14 might be operating in the same way. The familial psoriasis-associated mutations in <italic>CARD14</italic> result in altered splicing and inclusion of an additional 22 amino acids within the CARD14 protein (G117S) <xref rid="pone.0111255-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111255-Jordan2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The <italic>de novo</italic> mutation is a missense point mutation (E138A) <xref rid="pone.0111255-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Both of these mutations result in production of a gain-of-function CARD protein and subsequent overactive NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, with the E138A mutation resulting in the most dramatic increase in NF-&#x003ba;B activity <xref rid="pone.0111255-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111255-Jordan2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, the molecular details of how these CARD14 mutations increase NF-&#x003ba;B signaling and lead to inflammation have not yet been elucidated.</p><p>CARD14 was originally described as most abundant in placental and mucosal tissue <xref rid="pone.0111255-Bertin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Recently, our studies have demonstrated that CARD14 is expressed in epidermal keratinocytes <xref rid="pone.0111255-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111255-FuchsTelem1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Transfection of keratinocytes with the psoriasis-associated mutations in <italic>CARD14</italic> resulted in increased NF-&#x003ba;B activity, as well as transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, such as CCL20 and IL-8 <xref rid="pone.0111255-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111255-Jordan2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, previously published immunohistochemistry also revealed a dermal population of CARD14-expressing cells, but the identity of this population has not yet been investigated <xref rid="pone.0111255-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we found that dermal CARD14 localized to the CD31<sup>+</sup>endothelial cells (ECs). Both dermal blood and lymphatic ECs were found to express CARD14, and dermal ECs co-localized with phosphorylated NF-&#x003ba;B (pNF-&#x003ba;B), indicating activity of this signaling pathway in ECs within psoriatic skin. Transfection of ECs with psoriasis-associated CARD14 mutations resulted in increased expression of several chemokines, including IL-8, CCL2, and CXCL10. Culture of dermal ECs with psoriatic cytokines (such as IFN&#x003b3;, IL-17, and TNF&#x003b1;) also induced expression of many of the same chemokines found upregulated after transfection of ECs with psoriasis-associated CARD14 mutations. Additionally, several of these chemokines were indeed increased in lesional psoriatic skin, and co-localized with dermal ECs <italic>in situ</italic>. Similar findings were observed in both classical psoriasis patients and a patient from a PSORS2-linked family (GEN001), who harbored a confirmed gain-of-function <italic>CARD14</italic> mutation (G117S). Therefore, CARD14 may play an important role in psoriasis pathogenesis partially through pro-inflammatory activities within dermal endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Dermal CARD14 is expressed in endothelial cells</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that CARD14 is expressed in epidermal keratinocytes <xref rid="pone.0111255-Jordan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

To determine which cell types within normal, non-lesional (NL), and lesional (LS) psoriatic skin expressed CARD14, double immunofluorescence studies were performed. Due to the critical role of activated immune cells in psoriasis, we first determined if CARD14 co-localized with markers of various immune cell populations. Dermal CARD14 did not co-localize with CD3 (T-cells), CD11c (dendritic cells), and CD163 (macrophages) in all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111255-g001">Figure 1a</xref> and Figure S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111255.s001">File S1</xref>), indicating that these immune cells do not express CARD14.</p><fig id="pone-0111255-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0111255.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CARD14 was expressed in dermal endothelial cells.</title><p>Two color immunofluorescence on frozen sections of psoriatic skin for CARD14 (red) versus (a) CD3<sup>+</sup>T-cells, CD11c<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells, CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages, and CD31+ endothelial cells (green); as well as versus (b) PAL-E+ blood endothelial cells and LYVE-1 lymphatic endothelial cells (green).

Indeed, CARD14<sup>+</sup> cells were highly co-localized with the general EC marker, CD31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111255-g001">Figure 1a</xref> and Figure S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111255.s001">File S1</xref>), most notably in lesional skin, where there are abundant blood vessels. ECs (CD31<sup>+</sup> cells) can be further subdivided into two types: human dermal blood endothelial cells (HDBECs) and human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs), defined by expression of PAL-E and LYVE-1, respectively. CARD14 co-localized with both LYVE-1<sup>+</sup> cells and PAL-E<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111255-g001">Figure 1b</xref>), indicating expression within both types of ECs. CARD14 also co-localized with vimentin, a marker of mesenchymal cells (Figure S3a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111255.s001">File S1</xref>). Triple immunofluorescence studies showed that vimentin<sup>+</sup>CARD14<sup>+</sup> cells were also CD31<sup>+</sup> (Figure S3b in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111255.s001">File S1</xref>). These studies demonstrated that ECs were indeed the dermal cell type expressing CARD14.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>CARD mRNA in Keratinocytes, Endothelial Cells, T-cells, and Monocytes</title><p>To validate these immunofluorescence findings, quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed for expression of CARDs in various cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111255-g001">Figure 1c</xref>). CARD14 was detected at highest amounts in keratinocytes (KCs), however, both HDBECs and HDLECs also expressed CARD14 mRNA. CARD14 mRNA was not detected in T-cells or monocytes. CARD10 is expressed in non-hematopoietic cells <xref rid="pone.0111255-Blonska1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and therefore served as a positive control in keratinocytes and ECs. CARD9 and CARD11, which are highly expressed by monocytes and T-cells, respectively <xref rid="pone.0111255-Blonska1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, were minimally detected in KCs and ECs. These findings confirm that CARD14 is expressed in both KCs and ECs.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>CARD14 in aortic tissues</title><p>To determine if endothelial cells outside of the skin might express CARD14, RNA from human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) was assessed for expression of CARDs. Similar to the HDBECs and HDLECs, HAECs expressed CARD10 and CARD14, albeit with lower levels of CARD14 mRNA expression compared to the dermal EC subsets, and minimal to no CARD9 or CARD11 (data not shown). In macroscopically identified NL and LS atherosclerotic aortas, CARD14 protein was significantly detected, with the clearest staining in the EC layer (Figure S4a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111255.s001">File S1</xref>). Immunofluorescence studies confirmed that CARD14 protein co-localized with the CD31<sup>+</sup> aortic ECs (Figure S4b in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111255.s001">File S1</xref>).

These studies focused primarily on pNF-&#x003ba;B in keratinocytes, showing significant staining of the epidermis in LS skin. However, dermal staining for pNF-&#x003ba;B was also observed. To confirm these findings, we performed immunohistochemistry for pNF-&#x003ba;B on normal, NL, and LS skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111255-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). As previously published, normal skin had minimal pNF-&#x003ba;B, NL skin contained moderate amounts of pNF-&#x003ba;B, and LS skin contained the maximal amount of activated NF-&#x003ba;B. Dermal staining was most pronounced in LS skin. To determine if any of the dermal pNF-&#x003ba;B was within endothelial cells, we performed double immunofluorescence studies. Minimal expression of dermal pNF-&#x003ba;B and therefore minimal co-localization with CD31<sup>+</sup> ECs was found in normal skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111255-g002">Figure 2a&#x02013;b</xref>). However, pNF-&#x003ba;B co-localized with CD31<sup>+</sup> ECs in the dermis of NL and LS skin, showing that ECs exhibit an activated phenotype in psoriasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111255-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). Triple immunofluorescence studies confirmed that the CARD14<sup>+</sup> CD31<sup>+</sup> dermal ECs in LS skin contained pNF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111255-g002">Figure 2c</xref>). Expression of pNFkB in CD31<sup>+</sup> dermal ECs was also confirmed using confocal microscopy (data not shown). In summary, these studies show that CD31<sup>+</sup>ECs contain the NF-&#x003ba;B scaffolding molecule, CARD14, and have phosphorylated NF-&#x003ba;B in LS and NL skin.</p><fig id="pone-0111255-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0111255.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Phosphorylated NF-&#x003ba;B (pNF-&#x003ba;B) was upregulated in psoriatic skin and dermal pNF-&#x003ba;B co-localized with CARD14<sup>+</sup> ECs.</title><p>(a) Immunohistochemistry of pNF-&#x003ba;B in normal, non-lesional, and lesional frozen skin sections.

The principal components analysis (PCA) showed that the transcriptome of LS biopsies from patients with <italic>CARD14</italic> mutations clustered close to those of LS classic psoriasis, and the NL and post-treatment biopsies of these two patients clustered close to normal and NL skin of classic psoriasis (Figure S5a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111255.s001">File S1</xref>). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for these patients were defined as LS skin compared to the NL (for GEN001) or post (for NIH) skin. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA; <xref rid="pone.0111255-SuarezFarinas1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>) showed that published upregulated and downregulated psoriasis transcriptomes were significantly enriched in the transcriptomes of these two patients with <italic>CARD14</italic> mutations (Connectivity Scores of 0.69&#x02013;0.78) (Figure S5b in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111255.s001">File S1</xref>). The transcriptome of these two patients with <italic>CARD14</italic> mutations was mined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, to identify biologically relevant pathways enriched in these transcriptomes, and compared with the psoriasis meta-analysis derived (MAD3) transcriptome (Top pathways shown in Figure S6a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111255.s001">File S1</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0111255-Tian1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

In summary, these data suggest that CARD14 over-activity within dermal ECs potentially endows them with the ability to recruit immune cells into the skin, initiating and maintaining psoriatic lesions.</p><p>Few studies have focused on the role of ECs in human psoriasis pathogenesis. Several of the chemokines that were determined to be upregulated by psoriasis-associated <italic>CARD14</italic> mutations in ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111255-g004">Figure 4</xref> and Figure S7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111255.s001">File S1</xref>), have been found by previous gene array studies that LS skin contains significantly higher expression of <italic>IL-8</italic>, <italic>CXCL1</italic>, and <italic>CXCL10</italic> than does NL skin <xref rid="pone.0111255-SuarezFarinas2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

The chemokines found upregulated included those that are chemotactic to T-cells (CCL5, CXCL10), monocytes (CCL2, CCL4), and neutrophils (IL-8, CXCL1). Psoriatic skin is characterized by increased vascularity and angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0111255-Heidenreich1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111255-Canavese1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, alluding to the importance of blood vessels and ECs in psoriasis pathogenesis. The fact that ECs can express adhesion molecules and chemokines warrants further studies to determine their precise contribution to inflammation in psoriasis.</p><p>The roles of individual CARDs within particular cell types remains to be more specifically defined. In our studies, it was determined that both KCs and ECs express <italic>CARD14</italic> mRNA.

Recently, mutations in CARD9 were found to be the genetic cause of deep dermatophytosis <xref rid="pone.0111255-Lanternier1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Therefore, NF-&#x003ba;B signaling through CARDs is an important topic, relevant to many human diseases.</p><p>Although we found CARD14<sup>+</sup> ECs contained phosphorylated NF-&#x003ba;B in psoriatic skin, the important biological mediators eliciting NF-&#x003ba;B activation <italic>in vivo</italic> within dermal ECs are not yet known.

However, it is highly possible that other molecules are eliciting CARD14-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation within ECs <italic>in vivo</italic>. The CARD10-Bcl10-MALT1 complex plays a crucial role in endothelial cell response to thrombin and angiotensin II via NF-&#x003ba;B <xref rid="pone.0111255-Delekta1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111255-McAllisterLucas1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0111255-McAllisterLucas1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Interestingly, in our study these two chemokines were found to be upregulated by psoriasis-associated overactive CARD14 transfection in ECs. Therefore, signaling through CARDs in ECs appears to be important in inducing the expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines. The endogenous elicitors of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling specifically through CARD14 however, remains to be determined, and is a critical next step in understanding how CARD14 mutations contribute to psoriasis.</p><p>In conclusion, we have determined that CARD14, the gene responsible for <italic>PSORS2</italic>, is expressed dermally in both blood and lymphatic ECs, as well as in aortic ECs, the latter of which may prove to be an interesting link to the cardiovascular comorbidities associated with psoriasis. Transfection of psoriasis-associated CARD14 mutations into HDBECs resulted in increased protein and mRNA of several chemokines, as well as a mild increase in cell adhesions. Additionally, we were able to support our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings from transfected HDBECs within human skin biopsies <italic>in vivo</italic>. These data support the hypothesis that CARD14 is not only an important player in keratinocytes, but could also play a pro-inflammatory role within dermal ECs, a cell type which may contribute in previously unappreciated ways to psoriasis pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Skin, Aorta, Blood Samples, and Ethics Statement</title><p>Skin biopsies from normal volunteers and psoriasis patients, as well as blood samples from normal volunteers, were obtained under a Rockefeller University Institutional Review Board-approved protocol.
