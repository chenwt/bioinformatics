The mechanisms driving this resistance remain poorly characterised. This study investigated the molecular basis of insecticide resistance in Malaysian populations of <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Microarray-based transcription profiling revealed that metabolic resistance (cytochrome P450 up-regulation) and possibly a reduced penetration mechanism (consistent over-expression of cuticular protein genes) were associated with pyrethroid resistance. <italic>CYP6P12</italic> over-expression was strongly associated with pyrethroid resistance whereas <italic>CYP6N3</italic> was rather consistently over-expressed across carbamate and DDT resistant populations. Other detoxification genes also up-regulated in permethrin resistant mosquitoes included a glucuronosyltransferase (AAEL014279-RA) and the glutathione-S transferases GSTS1 and GSTT3. Functional analyses further supported that <italic>CYP6P12</italic> contributes to pyrethroid resistance in <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> as transgenic expression of <italic>CYP6P12</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> was sufficient to confer pyrethroid resistance in these flies. Furthermore, molecular docking simulations predicted <italic>CYP6P12</italic> possessing enzymatic activity towards pyrethroids. Patterns of polymorphism suggested early sign of selection acting on <italic>CYP6P12</italic> but not on <italic>CYP6N3</italic>. The major role played by P450 in the absence of <italic>kdr</italic> mutations suggests that addition of the synergist PBO to pyrethroids could improve the efficacy of this insecticide class and overcome resistance in field populations of <italic>Ae. albopictus.</italic></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The mosquito <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> Skuse is an important vector of dengue and chikungunya throughout the tropical and subtropical world.

Although there are less reports of insecticide resistance in <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> than in <italic>Ae. aegypti,</italic> cases of resistance are increasingly reported for this species. Resistance towards DDT has been recorded in adult <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations from Cameroon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and Sri Lanka<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.

In Malaysia, after previous reports of susceptibility to pyrethroids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> recent studies have detected the presence of resistance in <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> against permethrin and deltamethrin. First, pyrethroid resistance was reported in larvae in Kuala Lumpur<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and second, a recent assessment of the susceptibility profile of this species across Malaysia showed that although it was less resistant than <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, it nevertheless was resistant to several insecticides such as carbamates, organophosphates and organochlorines (DDT, dieldrin). Additionally, a population from Kuala Lumpur was resistant to pyrethroids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.

For DDT, a mixed resistance pattern was observed with Kuala Lumpur and Kota Bharu exhibiting high resistance levels (6 and 14% mortality rate respectively) while the Penang population was nearly fully susceptible (96.8% mortality)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In contrast, most populations were resistant to bendiocarb except for Kota Bharu (93% mortality). Overall, the KL population was the most resistant as it was also resistant to all insecticide classes including to the organophosphate malathion and to the organochlorine dieldrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genome-wide microarray-based transcriptional profiling</title><p>The transcriptional profiles of resistant <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations in Malaysia were analyzed with two aims; i) first to detect the genes directly associated with permethrin resistance through a comparison of the sets of genes differentially expressed between the permethrin R-C, R-S and C-S hybridizations from KL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>); ii) Second, to detect the genes associated with resistance to other insecticides (such as bendiocarb, DDT and malathion) across Malaysia through a comparison of the C-S hybridizations between KL, PG and JG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>).

The KL sample was chosen for this study as it was the only location where <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was resistant to permethrin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In addition, the relatively lower level of permethrin resistance in KL also makes it more relevant to compare resistant mosquitoes to non-exposed control sample from KL. The large phenotypic difference between the permethrin resistant mosquitoes (100% resistant, since all survivors are considered resistant) and the control non-exposed (only 13% resistant since there was a mortality of 87% after exposure to permethrin) present a higher contrast likely to facilitate the detection of permethrin resistance genes by microarray hybridisation between resistant (R) and Control (C) (R-C) as there is no confounding factor caused by the difference in genetic background. Furthermore, the permethrin resistant mosquitoes (R) were also compared to the lab permethrin susceptible (S) VCRU strain (R-S) to further validate the consistency of the expression pattern of candidate resistance genes. The possible induction of some genes in the R-C and R-S comparisons because of the exposure to insecticide was corrected by also performing a comparison of the control non exposed mosquitoes (C) to the susceptible ones (S) (C-S). Overall, the expression profiles from the three R-C, R-S and C-S hybridisations were used to generate the list of candidate resistance genes as presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>.

This transcript was also up-regulated in the R-S comparison. The possible involvement of a reduced penetration mechanism in the permethrin resistance of this KL population was further supported by the presence of several other probes belonging to cuticle protein genes with high FC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>) with four of the five top up-regulated resistance-related genes belonging to cuticular protein genes.

This is further supported for the KL sample for which a significant estimate of the neutrality test D* (Fu and Li) was observed. This could be associated with the pyrethroid resistance observed in KL. However, further analysis with more sequences is needed to establish the presence of such signature of selective sweep.

Because of a greater phenotypic contrast between the permethrin resistant (R) and the unexposed mosquitoes (C) due the moderate level of permethrin resistance in KL, the direct comparison of permethrin resistant mosquitoes from KL to unexposed mosquitoes from the same location very successfully detected the genes associated with permethrin resistance in this study. This is different from previous studies, in which attempts using such R-C comparison have not been too successful, notably in malaria vectors such as <italic>An. funestus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> or <italic>An. gambiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. This is mainly because resistance level was already high in the population and the phenotypic difference between the resistant mosquitoes after exposure (R) was minimal than that of control non-exposed population.</p><p>The presence of a reduced cuticle penetration mechanism for permethrin resistance was suggested by the fact that several probes belonging to cuticular protein genes were consistently over-expressed in the KL R-C comparison. The possible role of reduced penetration was further supported because of consistency of the expression of these probes but also their higher FC with the highest over-expressed gene been always a cuticle protein (the transcript Aalb_oocyte_GH79BIP02H77ZJ with FC of 77.8; Aalb_oocyte_rep_c16319 with FC of 33.7). Over-expression of cuticular protein genes has previously been reported in several studies on insecticide resistance mechanisms such as in <italic>An. gambiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> or in <italic>An. funestus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. However, the level of fold change observed in this <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> population far exceeds that observed in these other mosquito species suggesting a more preeminent role for the reduced penetration mechanism in this population. Reduced penetration through cuticular thickening has also been previously suggested as the cause of pyrethroid resistance in the malaria vector <italic>An. funestus,</italic> through a cuticle thickening<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and the aphid <italic>Myzus persicae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p><p>Even though cuticular protein genes were highly over-expressed in the permethrin resistant comparison, cytochrome P450 genes were by far the gene family most abundantly over-expressed suggesting that these genes play a key role in the permethrin resistance in <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in KL. Probes from several transcripts showing the best BLAST hits to either <italic>CYP6P12</italic> in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> or to <italic>CYP6P4</italic> in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> were consistently the most over-expressed. Because <italic>CYP6P12</italic> and <italic>CYP6P4</italic> are orthologous genes, it is very likely that all these <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> transcripts belong to the same gene, ortholog of <italic>CYP6P12</italic> and <italic>CYP6P4</italic> as supported by recent draft genome of <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. It is also possible that these transcripts could belong to duplicated version of these genes as observed in <italic>An. funestus</italic> where the <italic>CYP6P4</italic> is duplicated in two copies <italic>CYP6P4a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P4b</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. However, the involvement of the <italic>CYP6P4</italic> ortholog in permethrin resistance in <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> will be similar to recent reports that <italic>CYP6P4</italic> was involved in permethrin resistance in a population of the malaria vector <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> in Chad<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. <italic>CYP6P4</italic> has also been associated with pyrethroid resistance in <italic>An. gambiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and in <italic>An. funestus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The involvement of the <italic>CYP6P4</italic> ortholog in the permethrin resistance in the KL population of <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is further supported by the lower expression of this gene in the C-S comparison while it is highly over-expressed in the R-C and R-S comparison. Furthermore, the transgenic expression of <italic>CYP6P12</italic> in Drosophila flies demonstrated that the over-transcription of this gene alone was sufficient to confer pyrethroid resistance. However, a significant difference was observed between type I and II pyrethroids as the flies expressing <italic>CYP6P12</italic> showed a greater mortality than control flies for type I pyrethroids, whereas it was the opposite for type II pyrethroid deltamethrin. This is consistent with the <italic>in silico</italic> analysis in which enzymatic activity was predicted to differ between deltamethrin and permethrin due to differences in binding position. This difference in the mortality profile of transgenic flies toward insecticides of the same class could be due to the toxicity of the intermediate metabolites generated from the detoxification of type I pyrethroids (permethrin or bifenthrin) possibly in the absence of suitable Phase II detoxification enzymes in the flies whereas such metabolites for type II are probably further detoxify by the flies. Indeed, it is known that phase I reactions catalysed by cytochrome P450 enzymes can generate reactive molecules, which is often more effective and in some cases more toxic than the parent product. And unless an efficient phase II metabolism system is in place, such intermediate metabolite can react with and cause damage to proteins, RNA and DNA with the cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. It is possible that the flies expressing CYP6P12 did not have the required phase II system to deal with the generated metabolites from type I pyrethroids explaining the higher mortality observed than in control flies. Further metabolomics studies will established the nature of these metabolites. However, other technical and biological effects may also explain this unexpected result. First, a different P450 or detoxification enzyme may be responsible for permethrin resistance in the KL population with CYP6P12 being rather involved in deltamethrin resistance but still associated with permethrin resistance due to multi-resistance phenotype carried by individuals composing the KL strain. Second, it is possible that a different CYP6P12 variant than the one used for transgenesis may have the capacity to metabolize permethrin since allelic variation of P450 genes can significantly impact their metabolic ability to confer insecticide resistance as recently observed for the duplicated <italic>CYP6P9a</italic> and <italic>CYP6P9b</italic> in the African malaria vector <italic>An. funestus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.
