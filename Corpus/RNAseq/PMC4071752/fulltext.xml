Due to an additional round of WGD, the rainbow trout genome offers a unique opportunity to investigate the early evolutionary fate of a duplicated vertebrate genome. Here we show that after 100 million years of evolution the two ancestral subgenomes have remained extremely collinear, despite the loss of half of the duplicated protein-coding genes, mostly through pseudogenization. In striking contrast is the fate of miRNA genes that have almost all been retained as duplicated copies. The slow and stepwise rediploidization process characterized here challenges the current hypothesis that WGD is followed by massive and rapid genomic reorganizations and gene deletions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms4657-i1.jpg"/>Although whole-genome duplications (WGDs) are rare events, they have an important role in shaping vertebrate evolution.

While WGDs are rare within animal lineages, they deeply shaped vertebrate evolution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> and represent important evolutionary landmarks from which some major lineages have diversified. For instance, the ancestral genome of all teleost fish underwent a WGD, termed here the teleost-specific 3rd WGD (Ts3R)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, that has been dated 225 to 333 million years ago (Mya)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). The signature of this Ts3R is still present in modern teleost genomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and was preceded by two older WGD events common to all bony vertebrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Following WGD, the resulting duplicated genomes eventually retain only a small proportion of duplicated genes, while seemingly redundant copies are inactivated by a process termed gene fractionation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. To date, this gene fractionation process has been poorly investigated in vertebrates because all well-characterized WGDs are extremely ancient<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and gene fractionation is thought to be completed in these species. Salmonids are thus of particular interest in that context as gene fractionation may still be ongoing in their lineage because of an additional and relatively recent WGD event (the salmonid-specific 4th WGD or Ss4R) that has been dated 25 to 100 Mya<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Rainbow trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) is a member of the salmonid family that is of major ecological interest worldwide. It is one of the most studied fish species and is extensively used for research in many fields such as carcinogenesis, toxicology, immunology, ecology, physiology and nutrition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. It is also an important aquaculture species of major economic importance raised in both hemispheres and on all continents.</p><p>Due to a relatively recent WGD, the rainbow trout thus provides a unique opportunity to better understand the early steps of gene fractionation. Our results based on the analysis of the whole-genome sequence of rainbow trout show that despite 100 million years of evolution the two ancestral subgenomes have remained extremely collinear. Only half of the protein-coding genes have been retained as duplicated copies and genes have been lost mostly through pseudogenization. In striking contrast with protein-coding genes is the fate of miRNA genes that have almost all been retained as duplicated copies. Together our results reveal a slow and stepwise rediploidization process that challenges the current hypothesis that WGD is followed by massive and rapid genomic reorganizations and gene deletions.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genome structure evolution after the Ss4R WGD</title><p>To obtain a global representation of the two copies of the ancestral salmonid genome in the modern rainbow trout genome, we reconstructed double-conserved synteny (DCS) regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> (that is, paralogous regions originating from the Ss4R). The organization of the ancestral karyotype of salmonids prior to Ss4R was reconstructed using comparisons with non-salmonid teleost genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In addition, we reconstructed the more ancient paralogy relationships inherited from the Ts3R event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The rainbow trout genome is organized into 38 pairs of large duplicated regions distributed over the 30 chromosomes, 14 of which result from the fusion of two different post-Ss4R chromosomes, in agreement with the known paralogies inferred from the trout linkage maps<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Other chromosomes are more complex mosaics of different post-Ss4R chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), reflecting additional inter-chromosomal rearrangements that have occurred since the Ss4R event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Timing of the Ss4R WGD</title><p>We defined as ohnologues (that is, paralogues formed by a WGD event)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> 6,733 pairs of trout-specific paralogues identified in DCS regions, and therefore consistent with an Ss4R origin. We computed the distribution of silent substitutions (dS) among pairs of Ss4R ohnologues (modal value=0.1875) and between Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout pairs of orthologues (modal value=0.055; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>).

These 569 DCS regions contain 13,352 genes (29% of all the protein-coding genes), which are the descendants of 9,040 pre-Ss4R ancestral genes that are now represented by 4,728 single-copy genes (singletons) and 4,312 pairs of ohnologues. Across the entire genome, this would mean that only 52% of the Ss4R duplicated gene pairs have undergone gene fractionation and returned to a single-copy state, while 48% have retained both ohnologues. Additionally, we systematically aligned protein sequences predicted from singletons to their ohnologous genomic region, and found that the majority of singletons (66%) can still be paired with clear paralogous sequences stemming from the Ss4R, although the latter are largely non-functional. In addition to the high retention rate of ohnologous protein-coding genes, we found that the post-Ss4R conservation of miRNAs genes is even more pronounced. We identified 241 miRNA loci in DCS regions of the rainbow trout genome. Among these 241 loci, 233 are present in duplicated copies (97%) while 8 loci only display one member of the ohnologous pair (3%). A ratio of 3.04 loci per mature miRNA sequence was observed in rainbow trout (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). In teleosts that have undergone Ts3R WGD without the additional and more recent Ss4R WGD, the number of loci per mature miRNA ranges between 1.22 and 1.45. In vertebrate species that have not undergone Ts3R (that is, tetrapods in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), this ratio is close to 1 and similar to the ratio observed in non-vertebrate metazoan species in which no WGD has been reported.</p><p>Mature and pre-miRNA sequences are short sequences exhibiting an average size of 22 and 70 nucleotides, respectively. These sequences are much shorter than mRNA sequences and the chance of fixing a mutation leading to pseudogenization could then be simply reduced due to these size differences. We tested this simple size hypothesis by looking at the size differences between ohnologues and singletons and the size differences within pseudogenes. We found that singleton genes are significantly smaller than genes retained as ohnologues (1,065&#x02009;bp versus 1,435&#x02009;bp; pval&#x02264;2.2 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>). In addition, the percentage of divergence of the pseudogenes with their functional singleton homologues is not correlated with their size (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.02). These two results demonstrate that, at least for protein-coding genes, longer sequences are not more prone to accumulate mutations and that this size effect is an unlikely explanation for the retention of all miRNA genes as duplicate copies in the rainbow trout genome.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Gene inactivation rate after the Ss4R WGD</title><p>The rainbow trout genome assembly contains 46,585 annotated protein-coding genes. Assuming that these are distributed similarly as observed on the 569 high-confidence DCS regions, they correspond to 48% of ancestral pre-WGD genes retained as ohnologues and 52% retained as singletons. As such, we estimate that the ancestral pre-WGD genome contained 31,476 genes (95% CI: 31,265&#x02013;31,690), 16,368 of which have been retained as singletons in the modern trout genome (95% CI: 16,162&#x02013;16,795). The second copy of these genes has been inactivated since the Ss4R WGD, leading to an average gene inactivation rate of 170 genes per million years since the Ss4R in the rainbow trout lineage (95% CI: 168&#x02013;175).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Colinearity of Ss4R paralogous genomic regions</title><p>At the genome organization level, the analysis of the Ss4R duplicated regions reveals a high colinearity between paralogous genomic sequences, consistent with a conserved order of ohnologues (97.7% of conserved gene adjacencies) and no strong evidence of a clustering of singletons versus ohnologues throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a&#x02013;c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We also found that the nucleotide sequence identity between alignable paralogous genomic regions is still high (86%) and that Ss4R ohnologous protein-coding sequences and miRNAs are also highly conserved in their sequences with 92.9% amino-acid identity (SD=2.7%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>) and 96.4% nucleotide identity (SD=2.9%), respectively. In addition, the identity between the Ss4R protein-coding singletons and their corresponding pseudogenes remains high (average amino-acid identity 79.0%, SD=5.5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Gene preferentially retained by successive WGDs</title><p>We analysed the genes originally present in the ancestor of Euteleostomi that were retained in two ohnologous copies after each WGD (1R, 2R, Ts3R, Ss4R). We identified 4,862 ancestral genes retained as 1R or 2R ohnologues in the Human genome, 2,728 ancestral genes retained as Ts3R ohnologues in the zebrafish genome and 4,688 ancestral genes retained as Ss4R ohnologues in the trout genome. The intersection of these three sets of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>) shows that genes retained as 1R&#x02013;2R and Ts3R ohnologues are significantly more likely to be retained in duplicated copies after Ss4R (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test, <italic>P</italic>=2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup> and 0.03, respectively). The ontology analysis revealed that vertebrate ohnologues are significantly enriched in processes regarding embryonic development and neuronal synapse development and function, and molecular functions involving transcription factors and receptor activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). However, the gene ontology analysis of the Ss4R ohnologues did not yield any significant results.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Evolution of gene expression following the Ss4R WGD</title><p>To better investigate gene fractionation, we carried out an expression analysis across 15 tissues and showed that Ss4R ohnologues still present a remarkable pairwise correlation of their expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). However, different clusters of ohnologue pairs displaying specific expression profiles can be identified. Both ohnologues can have statistically correlated expression patterns (high correlation or HC; Pearson&#x02019;s correlation, <italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.05) or not (no correlation or NC; Pearson&#x02019;s correlation, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). Additionally, within each group, the two Ss4R ohnologues can present similar average expression levels (similar expression or SE; paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) or one can be consistently overexpressed compared to the other (differential expression or DE; paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.05). These characteristics define four clusters of ohnologues: HCSE, HCDE, NCSE and NCDE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The pairs of ohnologues in NC clusters present a significantly lower percentage of identity and higher dS, dN and dN/dS compared to the HC clusters (Wilcoxon&#x02019;s rank sum test, all <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;13</sup>), showing that the divergence of expression patterns is associated with lower selective pressure on the coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Gene ontology analysis reveals that the four types of clusters defined based on expression patterns are clearly associated with different functional classes of genes. The HCSE cluster is enriched in genes involved in development and transcriptional regulation, while the HCDE cluster is enriched in genes involved in housekeeping cellular and metabolic processes.

The rainbow trout genome sequence provides, for the very first time in any vertebrate, a unique opportunity to build a possible scenario on these early steps of gene fractionation occurring after a WGD event.</p><p>We first use the rainbow trout genome to refine the timing of the Ss4R and we dated this event around 96 Mya (&#x000b1;5.5 Mya), a timing in the upper range of the previous 25&#x02013;100 Mya estimation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. This result is in striking contrast with the age of the Salmonidae family, which has been estimated as 50&#x02013;60 Mya<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, suggesting that the Ss4R occurred long before the last common ancestor of extant salmonids. This observation is consistent with the WGD Radiation Lag-Time Model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> that has been proposed in plants in which significant lag times would be needed between WGDs and the subsequent adaptive radiations that are often associated with these WGD events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p><p>Despite this 100 My of evolution since the Ss4R, we found many evidences of an extreme stability of the two ancestral genome copies in the rainbow trout genome. At the chromosome level, no pervasive rearrangements were observed, and the structure of the Ss4R paralogous sequences remains surprisingly well conserved in sequence identity and gene order on chromosomes. Together these observations show that gene fractionation does not involve many genomic rearrangements such as inversions or translocations that would modify the order of genes in the genome, or large deletions that would result in long clusters of singletons. At the gene level we estimated the number of genes in the pre-Ss4R salmonid ancestor to be &#x0223c;31,000 genes. Interestingly, the zebrafish genome, the teleost fish with the most exhaustive and well-supported protein-coding gene annotation to date, contains &#x0223c;26,000 genes. This figure of 31,000 genes estimated here for the ancestral salmonid genome is compatible with the modern estimate in zebrafish, since, being 100 My closer to the event, the pre-Ss4R ancestral salmonid was likely to contain more duplicated gene copies remaining from the teleost Ts3R WGD. After 100 My of evolution since the Ss4R, gene fractionation only affected half of the ancestral Ss4R ohnologues, which have now returned to a single-copy state, resulting in an average gene inactivation rate of &#x0223c;170 genes per My. In contrast with the idea that gene fractionation after WGD involves massive and rapid gene deletions, we found numerous traces of pseudogenization events, and most of these pseudogenes exhibit a low sequence divergence compared to their respective functional copy. These numerous pseudogenization events may have initiated subsequent deletions that we also observe, and thus played a major role in the rediploidization of the trout genome. Altogether these multiple evidences suggest that gene fractionation is a slow process, largely incomplete and still in progress in the trout genome. This challenges the current hypothesis that WGDs are followed by massive and rapid genomic reorganizations and gene deletions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In plants, it has been suggested that preferential retention of singletons is localized on one of the two chromosomes from the WGD, leading to the appearance of a &#x02018;dominant&#x02019; chromosome in the modern genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The distribution of the ohnologues on the duplicated chromosomes of rainbow trout does not support such a hypothesis in vertebrates.</p><p>In striking contrast with the retention of half of the protein-coding genes as ohnologues is the nearly complete retention of miRNA gene as duplicate copies originating from the Ss4R. Together with the differences in the number of loci per mature miRNA observed in trout, and to a lower extent in teleost, in comparison with tetrapods and non-vertebrate metazoans, these results indicate that the fractionation process is considerably slower for miRNA genes than for protein-coding genes. This difference is unlikely to be explained by the short sequence of miRNA genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Note 1</xref>). It is, however, noteworthy that miRNAs are acting in a dose-dependent manner to tune gene expression at post-transcriptional level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and that miRNAs have several, if not many, targets among protein-coding mRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. It is thus possible that all duplicated copies of miRNA genes are still necessary to control gene expression in the context of a recent WGD. The fractionation process of miRNA genes would then occur, in a second step, at the end of the protein-coding gene fractionation process.</p><p>Our analysis also revealed that genes retained in duplicated copies after the successive WGD events that occurred during vertebrate evolution were also more likely to be retained as duplicates following Ss4R. This observation confirms the preferential retention and amplification of a number of gene families over successive WGD events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Our results show that genes preferentially retained by successive WGDs are associated with specific ontologies, in consistency with several studies that have shown preferential retention of some functional categories of genes among ohnologues present in modern vertebrate genomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. However, the gene ontology analysis of Ss4R ohnologue did not yield significant results, possibly because gene fractionation is still largely in progress and the set of trout ohnologues has not yet narrowed down to genes selectively retained as duplicates.</p><p>Finally, while the conservation of the structure and expression of the two ancestral genome copies is remarkable, a substantial number of Ss4R ohnologues have strongly diverged in terms of expression profiles and/or expression levels. Following WGDs, it is well accepted that the remaining ohnologues can acquire new expression patterns potentially leading to neo- or subfunctionalization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. This suggests that evolution after WGD is also acting on regulatory regions of these ohnologous genes that could subsequently be either silenced, or sub- or neo-functionalized.</p><p>Together, the analysis of the rainbow trout genome reveals a slow and stepwise rediploidization process after the Ss4R that challenges the current hypothesis that WGD is followed by massive and rapid genomic reorganizations and gene deletions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Genome sequencing</title><p>The 454 (single read, and 8-, 12- and 20-kb mate pairs) genomic libraries were prepared following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol (GS FLX Titanium Library Preparation Kit, Roche Diagnostic, USA) using genomic DNA from a single homozygous doubled haploid YY male from the Swanson River (Alaska) clonal line<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>).

We systematically compared the gene locations in rainbow trout with those of medaka, stickleback, tetraodon and takifugu using <italic>ad-hoc</italic> scripts to identify pairs of regions in the rainbow trout genome that are syntenic with single regions in non-salmonid species, and that correspond to DCS blocks. Pairs of paralogous trout genes on two different chromosomes (or non-anchored scaffolds) that belong to a DCS block are most likely duplicates originating from the Ss4R WGD event and are called ohnologues; there were 6,733 pairs of ohnologues. Genes that are inserted in a DCS block based on synteny with a non-salmonid species, but have no paralogous gene on the other chromosome or scaffold, are most likely former Ss4R duplicates in which one of the duplicated genes was lost, and are called singletons. Each pair of duplicated regions within a DCS block is descended from a single ancestral region in the pre-duplication genome.

A given Ss4R ohnologue was always aligned separately to each Ss4R duplicate copy stemming from the Ts3R (for example, A1 to B1 and B2), when they existed.

Material from the androgenetic doubled haploid rainbow trout line used for genome sequencing was provided by G.H.T. and from the gynogenetic doubled haploid line for transcriptome sequencing by E.Q. Genome sequencing, assembly and annotation was coordinated by O.J. &#x00026; P.W. The genome was sequenced by K.L., assembled by M.B. and J.-M.A., annotated by B.N., P.B., C.D. and J.-M.A., and anchored on the genetic map by Ca.G., Ma.B., Me.B. and R.G. The repeat elements database was built by D.C., Ca.G., D.G., P.D. and J.-N.V. The transcriptome RNAseq sequencing was done by A.A. and C.D. and analysed by C.K., C.C., J.B., J.M., Y.G. and C.B. The miRNA RNAseq sequencing and analysis was coordinated by J.B. with contributions from P.B., Ch.G., A.J., J.M. and C.B. Evolutionary and comparative whole-genome analysis were carried out by C.B., A.L., O.J., F.B. and H.R.C. The paper was written by Y.G., C.B., H.R.C. and J.B. with input from other authors.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional information</title><p><bold>Accession codes</bold>: Genome, transcriptome and miRNA sequence data for <italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic> have been deposited in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ sequence read archive (SRA) under the accession codes <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="NCBI:sra" xlink:href="ERP003734">ERP003734</ext-link>, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="NCBI:sra" xlink:href="ERP003742">ERP003742</ext-link> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="NCBI:sra" xlink:href="SRP032774">SRP032774</ext-link>.

Each medaka chromosome (represented as a horizontal black line) is mostly syntenic with two different chromosomes in the trout genome (syntenic trout regions represented on either side by different colours according to their chromosomal location), a pattern typically associated with whole-genome duplication. Pairs of paralogous trout genes that are inserted in a double-conserved synteny block compared to a non-salmonid fish genome are consistent with an origin at the Ss4R event (ohnologues), while genes that are inserted in a double-conserved synteny block but have no paralogue are singletons that have lost their duplicate copy since the Ss4R event. Only genes anchored to a trout chromosome are represented. (<bold>b</bold>) Successive rounds of duplication in the trout genome. The double-conserved synteny pattern between trout and non-salmonid fish delineates large chromosomal regions in the trout genome that are Ss4R duplicates of each other (outer circle, joined by grey links), descended from the same ancestral region. These ancestral pre-duplication regions could be grouped into 31 ancestral chromosomes (inner circle) based on the organization of their orthologous counterparts in non-salmonid genomes. The ancestral pre-duplication karyotype itself is an ancient tetraploid following the Ts3R event: Ts3R-duplicated regions in the pre-duplication karyotype are highlighted by grey links within the inner circle.

Enrichment <italic>P</italic>-values were obtained using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test; colours highlight the fold change between expected and observed genes annotated with a given ontological term (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref> for the complete list of enriched terms and methodological details). (<bold>d</bold>) Whisker plots (with whiskers representing the range of the distribution, excluding the 5% most extreme values) showing the sequence conservation for each class of ohnologues (numbers of ohnologue pairs HCSE=1,407; HCDE=1,895; NCSE=1,248; NCDE=1,573). Highly correlated ohnologues are on average significantly more conserved at the sequence level and under higher selective pressure (as described by dN/dS ratios) than non-correlated ohnologues, showing that divergence in expression patterns is associated with divergence of the coding sequence.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ncomms4657-f6"/></fig></floats-group></article>
