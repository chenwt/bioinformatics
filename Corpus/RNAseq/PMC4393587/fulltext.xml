Yet, the role of <italic>BRCA1</italic> as a driving gene in sporadic breast cancer is, at best, far from clear. Early studies identified a very low proportion of somatically acquired <italic>BRCA1</italic> inactivating mutations in sporadic breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Recent efforts aimed at elucidating the cancer genome have confirmed this view. According to the COSMIC database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/projects/cosmic/">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/projects/cosmic/</ext-link>; last accessed 08/01/2015), <italic>BRCA1</italic> somatic mutations are very rare, regardless of the breast cancer subtype analyzed (0.61% of breast cancer samples overall, 0.44% of basal-like breast cancers). While the analysis of somatic mutations does not support a major role for <italic>BRCA1</italic> in sporadic breast carcinogenesis, other evidences suggest that altered transcriptional regulation, rather than somatic mutations, might be involved in breast carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For instance, it has been reported that sporadic basal-like tumors frequently down regulate <italic>BRCA1</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As far as we know the role of other possible <italic>BRCA1</italic> inactivating mechanisms (such as splicing alterations) in breast carcinogenesis has not been comprehensively explored.</p><p>Recently, the ENIGMA consortium has analyzed naturally occurring <italic>BRCA1</italic> alternative splicing (AS) in blood related RNA sources (commonly used for clinical splicing assays) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], identifying up to 63 AS events, and supporting an AS model in which most non-mutually exclusive AS events are randomly combined into individual mRNAs molecules to produce probably hundreds of different RNA isoforms. To what extent these findings are tissue specific is not known. The ENIGMA study suggested that AS at the <italic>BRCA1</italic> locus is similar in blood and healthy breast tissue, albeit only one healthy breast tissue was available (one breast epithelia sample from a cosmetic surgery), thus limiting the power of the analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we have employed approaches previously developed by the ENIGMA consortia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] to perform a comprehensive characterization of AS at the <italic>BRCA1</italic> locus in a cohort of 70 breast tumor samples from patients diagnosed as having locally advanced breast cancer, enrolled in a neoadjuvant clinical trial and whose tumors have been classified into intrinsic subtypes. For comparative purposes, we have characterized as well AS in 72 blood samples from healthy control individuals and 4 healthy breast tissues (cosmetic surgeries). As far as we know, this is the most comprehensive description of AS at the <italic>BRCA1</italic> locus reported so far in human breast cancer samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>Tumor biopsy specimens were obtained from a set of 70 pre-treated patients, diagnosed as having locally advanced breast cancer. These patients participated in a neoadjuvant clinical trial (registered at the following Web site: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>; identifier NCT00123929) in which they were randomly assigned to receive four cycles of either doxorubicin (75&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>body surface area) or docetaxel (Taxotere, Sanofi-Aventis, Spain) (100&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>body surface area) every 3&#x000a0;weeks followed by surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The clinical trial was approved by the Hospital Cl&#x000ed;nico San Carlos Ethics Committee, Madrid, Spain. Briefly, eligibility criteria included the following: women aged between 18 and 78&#x000a0;years; clinical stage IIB, IIIA, or IIIB breast cancer; and palpable breast tumors not amenable to breast-preserving surgery. Before the start of the trial, an informed consent was obtained from all participants. Clinico-pathological features of the study population are presented in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1.</p><p>Additionally, breast tissue samples were obtained from four healthy individuals who underwent reduction mammoplasty. Similarly, whole blood was drawn from 72 healthy control donors (collected in EDTA tubes). All patients signed an informed consent for voluntary donation of biological samples for research to the Hospital Cl&#x000ed;nico San Carlos Biobank.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Laboratory analysis</title><p>Tumor biopsy specimens were obtained before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. To check cellularity, an H&#x00026;E image was obtained from all tumors; only samples with more than 80% tumor cells were used. Total RNA was extracted using the kit Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), following the instructions of the manufacturer. Blood samples were kept ice-cold for a maximum of 30&#x000a0;minutes before RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from whole blood (200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L) using a MagnaPure Compact workstation and MagnaPure RNA Isolation Kit according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. The amount of RNA was assessed using a Nanodrop ND-1000 UV Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). RNA integrity was assessed using a kit (RNA 6000 Nano Chip kit), followed by analysis with Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Total RNA, 200&#x000a0;ng, was used as a template to obtain first-strand cDNA using SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen, Parsley, UK), following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p><p>Comprehensive characterization of AS events at the <italic>BRCA1</italic> locus was performed by semi-quantitative capillary electrophoresis (capillary EP). The overall strategy has been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For the purpose of this study, we define AS events as those incorporating splice junctions not present in the reference transcript Ensemble ENST00000357654 (hereafter referred to as full-length transcript). In brief, eight combinations of forward and reverse primers located at exonic regions (hereafter referred to as splicing assays) were used to amplify cDNAs that later were analyzed by capillary EP. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows representative examples of each of the eight splicing assays. Primers sequences are shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2. All assays were performed in a 25 ul reaction volume containing 1 ul of cDNA template, 2.5 ul of 10&#x000d7; PCR reaction buffer with 20&#x000a0;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim Germany), 0.2ul of FastStart Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim Germany) 200 umol of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate and 0.25 umol of each primer. Thermal cycling consisted of an initial 10-minutes hold at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by 30-second hold at 95&#x000b0;C, 30-second hold at 58&#x000b0;C, and 60-second hold at 72&#x000b0;C for 33&#x000a0;cycles. In all cases, capillary EP analysis was performed in an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using 50&#x000a0;cm capillary arrays filled with POP-7 and GeneScan 500-LIZ (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as internal size-standard. A standard electrophoresis protocol was used in all cases (temperature 60&#x000b0;C, injection 15&#x000a0;sec at 1.6KVolts, and running 1800&#x000a0;sec at 15KVolts). Peak heights under 100 RFU (Relative Fluorescent Units) were not considered for analyses. Size-calling and peak areas were analyzed with GeneMapper software version 4.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Peak annotation was performed as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Representative examples of each of the eight cDNA splicing assays.</bold> Peak heights represent fluorescence intensity (scale on relative fluorescent units (RFU)). GeneScan 500-LIZ standard peaks are colored in orange. Peaks imputed to AS events are colored in blue. Capillary EP analysis permitted us to identify peaks imputed to transcripts carrying more than one independent splicing. For instance, assay 1&#x02013;6 demonstrated that &#x00394;1Aq (6&#x000a0;bp shorter than the FL) is combined with most of the splicing events visualized in this amplicon. Similarly, a peak of 322&#x000a0;bp in 7-11B assay demonstrated the presence of transcripts containing &#x00394;8p and &#x00394;9,10. As shown in 7-11B assay &#x00394;9,10 is 123&#x000a0;bp shorter than the FL. In 7&#x02013;12 assay a peak of 361&#x000a0;bp can be imputed to the combination of &#x00394;9,10+ &#x00394;11q since this peak is 123&#x000a0;bp shorter than &#x00394;11q peak.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12885_2015_1145_Fig1_HTML" id="d30e603"/></fig></p><p>Relative quantification of individual AS events (expressed as the average ratio between the peak area of that particular event and the peak area of the full-length signal in the corresponding assay) allowed us to classify AS events as <italic>predominant</italic> (&#x02265;10% of the full-length signal) or <italic>minor</italic> (&#x0003c;10%). AS events detected by the exons 7&#x02013;12 assay were not classifiable because the full-length reference transcript containing exon 11 (&#x0003e;3300&#x000a0;bp) was not co-amplified. <italic>BRCA1</italic> exons were named according to the Breast Core Informative (BIC) database nomenclature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], so that the 22 coding exons of the reference full-length transcript are numbered from 2 to 24 with no exon 4 defined. We have designated splicing events as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] combining the following symbols: &#x00394; (skipping), &#x025bc; (retention), p (proximal), and q (distal). Structural and functional annotation of AS events was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Briefly, functional annotation of <italic>BRCA1</italic> AS events includes: Non-Coding (splicing events eliminating the full-length start codon), PTC-NMDs (splicing events introducing Premature Termination Codons predicted to induce the Nonsense-Mediated RNA Decay pathway), No-FS (in-frame splicing events), FS-alternative STOP (frame-shift events generating PTCs not predicted to induce NMD as they are located in the most downstream <italic>BRCA1</italic> exons) and UTRs (splicing events modifying Un-Translated Regions). Further on, based on functional annotation, we classify AS events into <italic>likely inactivating</italic> and <italic>other</italic> AS events. The former category, referring to AS events that render the corresponding transcript unable to codify for functional <italic>BRCA1</italic> proteins, includes Non-Coding and PTC-NMD events, as well as two in-frame splicing events that target the critical RING (&#x00394;5) and BRCT (&#x00394;18) functional domains. By contrast, No-FS, FS-alternative STOP, and UTR AS events, with no obvious functional interpretation, were considered collectively as <italic>other</italic> AS events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>IHC FISH, Tumor grading and subtype assignation</title><p>Paraffin-embedded tumor samples from core biopsy specimens were evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis for estrogen receptor (ER) (clone 1D5, 1:35; Dako Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) and progesterone receptor (PR) (clone PgR 636, 1:50; Dako Cytomation). After incubation with the primary antibodies, immunohistochemical studies were performed using the Autostainer link 48 (Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA). The cut points for ER and PR positivity were established at 1% or greater of stained cells. Slides of all tumors were reviewed for diagnostic reassessment of the tumor histotype and histological grade, in a blinded fashion. The amplification of <italic>ERBB2</italic> was measured by FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization).The probes used were as follows: Centromere enumeration probe 17, labeled in green; and locus-specific identifier <italic>ERBB2</italic> probe, labeled in orange (Vysis-Abbott, Downers Grove, IL). Slides were prepared according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. A positive result was defined as an <italic>ERBB2</italic> gene/chromosome 17 ratio of 2.2 or greater. A minimum of 100 nuclei were counted per case.</p><p>Gene expression data from previously hybridized gene expression microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (available in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository database under accession number GSE21997) was used for intrinsic subtype assignment.

P-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using False Discovery Rate (FDR) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For quantitative variables, comparisons were assessed by T-student test or Mann Whitney test when appropriate. P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 was considered for statistical significance.

As previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], most AS events were rather minor in most analyzed samples, with the notable exception that &#x00394;1Aq, &#x00394;8p, &#x00394;9,10, &#x00394;14p and &#x00394;5q (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were frequently identified as <italic>predominant</italic> AS events, regardless of the tissue of origin. Further on, the relative quantification of these AS events is similar in breast tumor and blood samples, with &#x00394;1Aq expressed on average at similar levels than the full-length reference and &#x00394;8p, &#x00394;9,10 and &#x00394;14p, signals representing roughly 35%. Nonetheless, &#x00394;5q levels were higher in breast tumor samples (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Equally relevant, we have not identified any breast specific AS event, neither in healthy nor in malignant samples. Taken together, the data suggests that, AS events at the <italic>BRCA1</italic> locus in human breast tissue and blood are similar, with no evidence for tissue specific AS events. These observations support the clinical use of blood samples as an adequate surrogate for testing the spliciogenic effect of <italic>BRCA1</italic> genetic variants. Further on, our data suggests as well that somatic inactivation of <italic>BRCA1</italic> through the acquisition of spliciogenic mutations is, at best, an uncommon mechanism in breast carcinogenesis.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

To begin with, we have identified up to 27 AS events that were annotated as <italic>predominant</italic> (&#x0003e;10% of the reference full-length signal) in at least one tumor sample (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Focusing on individual AS events, we found that seven (&#x00394;5q, &#x00394;13, &#x00394;9, &#x00394;5, &#x025bc;1aA, &#x00394;10 and &#x025bc;4, all of them <italic>likely inactivating</italic>) were more frequently annotated as predominant in breast tumor samples than in blood-derived samples, albeit in the case of &#x00394;10 and &#x025bc;4 the findings did not reach statistical significance (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). After FDR correction, the differences in &#x00394;5q and &#x00394;5 frequency distribution between blood and tumor samples remained significant (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.014 and P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003 respectively).</p><p>Similarly, we observed that, on average, the absolute number of predominant splicing events per sample was higher in tumor samples than in healthy breast tissue samples (6.8 vs. 5.0; P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.010). The same was true for peaks corresponding to the combination of two or more splicing events (8.9 vs. 5.7; P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004). Additionally, we found that <italic>likely inactivating</italic> AS events were, on average, more frequently annotated as predominant in breast tumor samples than in healthy breast samples (2.6 vs 1.0; P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.020), while the same effect was not true for <italic>other</italic> AS events (4.1 vs 4.0; P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.689). Some representative examples of <italic>likely inactivating</italic> AS events occurring in breast tumor samples are displayed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1. Overall, the data suggests an excess of <italic>likely inactivating</italic> AS events in breast cancer cells.</p><p>Finally, we explore the possibility that certain AS events annotated as predominant in individual tumor samples were associated with the intrinsic subtype, as defined by PAM50&#x02009;+&#x02009;CLP genomic profiling, but we did not identify any obvious association.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive description of AS at the <italic>BRCA1</italic> locus reported so far in human breast samples. To perform this analysis, we took advantage of recent studies conducted by the ENIGMA consortium for the characterization of naturally occurring AS at the <italic>BRCA1</italic> locus in blood related samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. According to the ENIGMA consortium, pervasive AS at the <italic>BRCA1</italic> locus is observed in blood related samples, with up to 63 individual AS events identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This observation was consistent with several genome-wide analyses that have identify a strong association of high level AS loci with intrinsically disordered protein/domains (IDPs/IDDs), IDPs/IDDs with Hub proteins, and Hub proteins with disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we analyze to what extent this high level of AS is observed also in breast related samples. With this aim, we have characterized <italic>BRCA1</italic> AS in 70 breast tumor samples and 4 healthy breast tissue samples. For ethical reasons, it is difficult to access healthy human breast samples, so that we have performed the study in a very small cohort. Overall, our study concludes that AS at the <italic>BRCA1</italic> locus is similar in breast and blood samples. First, most AS events previously identified in blood, 54 out of 63, have been identified as well in healthy and tumor breast samples. Second, we have not identified any novel AS event not previously described in blood. Third, up to four AS events (&#x00394;1Aq, &#x00394;8p, &#x00394;9,10, &#x00394;14p) emerge as <italic>predominant</italic> in almost all samples of both tissues. Four, the relative semi-quantification of these <italic>predominant</italic> AS events reveals similar profiles in both tissues, with &#x00394;1Aq representing roughly 90% of the reference full-length signal, &#x00394;8p, &#x00394;9,10, and &#x00394;14p representing 30% (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As a corollary, we conclude that somatic inactivation of <italic>BRCA1</italic> through spliciogenic mutations is, at best, a rare mechanism in breast carcinogenesis.</p><p>We have concluded that, on average, AS at the <italic>BRCA1</italic> locus in breast and blood samples is very similar. Yet, in the present study we addressed as well the possibility that subtle quantitative alterations involving certain AS events were detectable in individual breast tumor samples. Due to the complexity of such analysis, in the present study we have restricted ourselves to compare the average number of <italic>predominant</italic> AS events detected in individual breast and blood samples. Interestingly, our data supports an excess of <italic>predominant</italic> AS events in tumor samples, in particular AS events annotated as <italic>likely inactivating</italic>. Since we have analyzed very few healthy breast samples, we cannot rule out the possibility that this finding (and excess of <italic>likely inactivating</italic> AS events in breast tumor samples) reflects tissue specific AS regulation, rather than a tumor specific phenotype acquired in the carcinogenic process. Further on, according to our data <italic>likely inactivating</italic> splicing events are not associated with any particular breast cancer subtype. Splicing deregulation represents a relevant ethiopathogenic mechanism of some diseases, including cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Yet, further studies are needed to establish a role, if any, for <italic>BRCA1 likely inactivating</italic> AS events in sporadic breast carcinogenesis.</p><p>A catalogue of AS events occurring at the <italic>BRCA1</italic> locus in breast tissue sample is an essential requirement for the design of adequate RNA splicing assays assessing the pathogenicity of <italic>BRCA1</italic> sequence variants. Indeed, our findings of similar AS events in breast and blood samples somehow validate the use of blood-derived samples for <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing assays testing the clinical relevance of <italic>BRCA1</italic> sequence variants, a key issue in molecular diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, the results presented here will help researchers to analyze and validate data from RNAseq experiments that are becoming increasingly widespread. Moreover, tools for functional annotations of novel sequences (novel transcripts) and the analyses of annotation data are clearly warranted. In this way, our data might be useful for the development of such tools.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results complement recent findings by the ENIGMA consortium, demonstrating that <italic>BRCA1</italic> AS, despite its tremendous complexity, is very similar in breast and blood samples, with no evidences for tissue specific AS events.
