Recently, an antisense lncRNA to mouse Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (Uchl1) was reported to increase UCHL1 protein synthesis, representing a new functional class of lncRNAs, designated as SINEUPs, for SINE element-containing translation UP-regulators. Here, we show that an antisense lncRNA to the human protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12A (PPP1R12A), named as R12A-AS1, which overlaps with the 5&#x02032; UTR and first coding exon of the PPP1R12A mRNA, functions as a SINEUP, increasing PPP1R12A protein translation in human cells. The SINEUP activity depends on the aforementioned sense-antisense interaction and a free right Alu monomer repeat element at the 3&#x02032; end of R12A-AS1. In addition, we identify another human antisense lncRNA with SINEUP activity. Our results demonstrate for the first time that human natural antisense lncRNAs can up-regulate protein translation, suggesting that endogenous SINEUPs may be widespread and present in many mammalian species.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Recent data imply that up to 80% of mammalian genome is transcribed and that many expressed genomic loci produce RNAs from both the sense and antisense DNA strand<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.

Antisense lncRNAs, or Natural Antisense Transcripts (NATs) have been shown to regulate gene expression by affecting transcription and mRNA stability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Most NATs were reported to down-regulate their target genes, though selected works also show up-regulation pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The mouse SINEUP, Uchl1-AS, was shown to increase translation of the UCHL1 protein in mouse MN9D cells, and relies on a sense/antisense interaction, in which the region of the Uchl1-AS that overlaps with the UCHL1 translation initiation site (TIS) was named as Binding Domain (BD). The SINEUP activity also depends on an inverted SINEB2, subclass 3 retrotransposon embedded within Uchl1-AS, serving as an effector domain (ED)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> in the SINEUP. Similarly, the mouse Uxt (<underline>U</underline>biquitously <underline>e</underline>xpressed <underline>t</underline>ranscript protein) NAT was able to up-regulate the level of the UXT protein, thus representing an additional member of naturally occurring SINEUPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Using the modular SINEUP structure, synthetic so-called miniSINEUP constructs, comprising a BD, ED and a short spacer sequence, have been generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and shown to efficiently up-regulate recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP) in HEK293T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. However, to date no SINEUP homologs have been described in other species.</p><p>Here, we identify a NAT to the human protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12A (PPP1R12A), named as R12A-AS1, and show that it functions as a SINEUP, increasing PPP1R12A protein levels in human cells. Furthermore, we show that a synthetic SINEUP construct, having R12A-AS1 SINE as an ED effectively up-regulates GFP, when combined with a BD targeting the GFP mRNA. Our results demonstrate for the first time that a human NAT can up-regulate protein translation in human cells, suggesting that endogenous SINEUP lncRNAs may be widespread and present in many mammalian species. The short free right Alu monomer repeat element (FRAM) sequence provides a basis for uncovering the molecular mechanism of SINEUP-mediated up-regulation of protein synthesis, and an attractive opportunity for many biotechnological applications.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Discovery of NATs with potential SINEUP function in the human brain transcriptome</title><p>The mouse Uchl1-AS is expressed in the brain, which is known to maintain complex and dynamic transcriptional landscapes and contains many noncoding RNAs. Thus, to identify human NATs with possible SINEUP activity, we first generated an inventory of antisense RNAs in the human brain by constructing a cDNA library from brain total RNA for sequencing on the Illumina platform (see Methods section for details). Sequencing reads, which passed initial quality control values (MAPQ&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;10, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) were assembled into transcripts by Cufflinks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, using RABT-guided assembly pipeline with the RefGene or Ensembl data set as reference annotations. The overview of the processing pipeline is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>. Cufflinks had assembled 1971 RNAs overlapping reference transcripts on the opposite strand. Coordinates of these RNAs were retrieved from Cufflinks&#x02019; output and intersected with SINE coordinates, identified in the human genome by Repeat Masker<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, using Galaxy; a platform for interactive genome analysis at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.usegalaxy.org">www.usegalaxy.org</ext-link>&#x02009;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The resulting data set contained 1096 transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), overlapping opposite-strand-located mRNAs and at least one SINE. The full list of the transcripts is available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Next, we intersected these transcripts with coordinates of the last 5 nucleotides of 5&#x02032;-UTR exons, which come into close contact with the Translation Initiation Site (TIS, usually the first AUG codon of ORFs) on ENSEMBL mRNAs. As a result, 129 transcripts, covering the translation initiation codon of the target mRNA were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1, Supplementary Table 2</xref>), and their expression was verified by finding supporting ENCODE/RIKEN CAGE peaks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> at corresponding loci. In addition, we searched the database of RIKEN full-length human cDNA clones, produced by the Genome Network Project (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.osc.riken.jp/english/contents/genom/">http://www.osc.riken.jp/english/contents/genom/</ext-link>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> for cDNA clones in these regions. These clone positions are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>. The figure presents each clone as two separate fragments, because only about 500 nucleotides of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; terminal regions had been sequenced, in order to position the clones into the most fitting genomic region. The sequences between the highlighted regions were unknown and have been determined by this work, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>. To facilitate downstream analysis, factors such as mRNA and protein size and expression level were considered.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The NAT overlapping protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12A increases protein translation</title><p>We decided to focus our subsequent studies on a NAT to protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12A (PPP1R12A), because the target protein is expressed at a relatively high level in a wide range of human cells, thus simplifying its detection. The genomic locus of the PPP1R12A 5&#x02032; region is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, with a more detailed view with supporting CAGE peaks, clusters and cDNA clones shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, the PPP1R12A mRNA has a number of isoforms, with three possible variants of the 5&#x02032; end: a long spliced UTR (ENST00000261207; ENST00000437004), a long unspliced UTR (ENST00000450142) and a short unspliced UTR (ENST00000550107), respectively. The NAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), assembled from the brain RNAseq data and named PPP1R12A-AS1 (R12A-AS1), only intersected exon 1 of the long 5&#x02032; UTR, leaving the TIS 22 nucleotides upstream (in cDNA coordinates). However, two RIKEN full-length human cDNA clones were also found to intersect the PPP1R12A mRNA in the antisense direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). One of these clones, H013051F04 matched almost perfectly the assembled R12A-AS1 RNA, whereas the other, H07D062A22 had its transcription start site (TSS) further upstream, intersecting all known PPP1R12A mRNA isoforms and covering the TIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Both cDNAs ended within a 147 nucleotide-long FRAM, covering 128 (H07D062A22) and 131 (H013051F04) nucleotides of the FRAM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). FANTOM5 permissive cluster dataset contained hypothetical TSSs for both variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Transcription from the plus strand, corresponding to H07D062A22 was additionally confirmed by analysis of the FANTOM5 CAGE dataset<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> by ZENBU-omics interactive visualization system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/zenbu/">http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/zenbu/</ext-link>. All samples having tags, mapped to +/&#x02212;200 nucleotides around H07D062A22&#x02032;s 5&#x02032;end (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) were recorded with their corresponding tag per million reads (tpm) values. The full list of samples and expression values is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>, blood cells and neural tissues express R12A-AS1 at highest levels, while its restricted expression in specific cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) suggests a possible regulatory function. Both R12A-AS1 cDNAs were PCR amplified and inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector, generating the expression constructs pR12A-AS1 (produced from H07D062A22) and pR12A-AS1&#x00394;5&#x02032; (produced from H013051F04), respectively.</p><p>To ask whether R12A-AS1 functions as a SINEUP, we transfected HEK293T cells with both pR12A-AS1 and pR12A-AS1&#x00394;5&#x02032;. The level of PPP1R12A protein was analyzed by Western blotting 48 hours after transfection. As shown at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, the protein level was elevated after transfection with pR12A-AS1, without any changes in the PPP1R12A mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). The RNA, produced by pR12A-AS1&#x00394;5&#x02032; and only overlapping 5&#x02032;-UTR did not change PPP1R12A protein level, compared to the full-length RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). This observation confirmed the importance of the TIS-overlapping BD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Notably, deleting the FRAM region from pR12A-AS1 hampered PPP1R12A&#x02019;s up-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3 versus lanes 5&#x02013;7), consistent with the functional importance of the transposable element (TE) as an ED<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Low amounts of the ED-lacking SINEUP construct reduced the PPP1R12A protein levels below control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, lane 5), which is possibly due to the sense-antisense interaction that could interfere with protein translation in the absence of ED. However, higher amounts of the ED-lacking SINEUP construct restored the protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, lanes 6 and 7), suggesting that additional sequences within the SINEUP RNA may produce structures, able to mimic the ED.</p><p>Similar to HEK293T cells, overexpression of R12A-AS1 in HeLa cells resulted in protein up-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>), without major changes in PPP1R12A mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). In addition, transfection with pR12A-AS1 was able to up-regulate the levels of recombinant, c-terminal-FLAG-tagged PPP1R12A protein in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a&#x02013;c</xref>). The expression of PPP1R12A with 5&#x02032; UTR and C-terminal FLAG-tag was consistently very low across all three experiments. However, the up-regulation and the dose response were still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The human FRAM repeat of PPP1R12A-AS1 functions as an ED in a synthetic miniSINEUP</title><p>Previously, the SINEB2-derived ED was shown to retain its activity, when transferred to a chimeric antisense RNA, containing the BD for pGFP-c2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. To test whether the human TE sequence is also transferable, we constructed a miniSINEUP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, named miniSINEUP-GFP-FRAM with the BD for GFP-c2. Instead of SINEB2, as in the canonical miniSINEUP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, it contained the FRAM repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>, co-transfection of HEK293T cells with pGFP-c2 and miniSINEUP-GFP-FRAM led to a marked increase of GFP production, without any notable changes in GFP mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Combined, these findings demonstrate that R12A-AS1 functions as a SINEUP in human cells, and that the FRAM element, when transferred to a synthetic miniSINEUP construct, retains its effect, directed by the sense-antisense overlap, thereby up-regulating heterologous protein production.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of an additional human NAT with SINEUP activity</title><p>Next, we tested a NAT for Integrin-Alpha FG-GAP Repeat-Containing Protein 2 (ITFG2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), another abundant protein, expressed by HEK293T cells for having SINEUP activity. ITFG2 contained an inverted MIRb transposable element as a potential ED. Organization of the ITFG2 genomic locus is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>.

Similar to R12A-AS1, expression of ITFG2-AS1 in HEK293T cells resulted in up-regulation of ITFG2 at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>), without affecting mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>), implying that also ITFG2-AS1 functions as a SINEUP in human cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Different repeat elements can potentially function as Effector Domains in SINEUPs</title><p>Since it is possible that only certain types of repeat elements could function as EDs, we investigated our candidate list of putative human SINEUPs in more detail. The 129 NATs, listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>, contained different SINEs, in almost perfect correlation with their frequencies in the human genome (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.93863). Thus, no enrichment for a given SINE element in the candidate SINEUPs could be identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). The primary sequences of SINEB2 and FRAM originate from different parental genes, tRNA for SINEB2, and 7SL RNA for FRAM, and they do not share any significant sequence similarity, as detected by NCBI BLAST algorithm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. However, a sequence alignment of the two elements using predicted secondary structures (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tcoffee.org/">http://www.tcoffee.org/</ext-link>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, identified short stretches of identical sequences in FRAM and SINEB2, which could potentially fold into similar structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). The use of RNAfold<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> predicted a long rod-like stem-loop structure for SINEB2, as also previously reported for the mouse SINE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, whereas FRAM was predicted to fold into a different structure, comparable to that of 7SL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). Thus, more detailed studies are needed to dissect the exact structural requirements of the different types of EDs, which likely share some conserved structural elements that may interact with the translational machinery.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>We report here for the first time that two human NATs can function as SINEUPs, and thereby up-regulate protein translation, indicating that this hitherto unknown phenomenon is not only present in mice and men, but could be widespread in a large number of mammalian and possibly other eukaryotic species.</p><p>TEs within antisense RNAs may provide binding and recognition sites for molecular factors, regulating translation, while the overlapping antisense region directs the SINEUP activity to specific target sites in mRNAs. Our data on the human FRAM and MIRb TEs reported here suggest that SINEUPs can employ different TEs as their EDs. The short size of FRAM makes it possible to analyze the sequence requirements in more detail, which will be necessary in order to understand the functions of SINEUPs <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, a SINEUP RNA, containing FRAM can be readily produced <italic>in vitro</italic>, thus enabling development of new and possibly even shorter SINEUP sequences. RNAs, constructed of minimal ED, short spacer and BD can possibly reach the length of 100&#x02013;120 nucleotides or less. Molecules of this size are suitable for both viral delivery systems and for use as naked RNAs. Such short and highly efficient synthetic SINEUP RNAs, designed to specifically enhance translation of a given target protein sets the stage for development of SINEUP-based therapeutics for selective up-regulation of protein production for treatment of haploinsufficiencies and metabolic diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Both as molecular biology reagents and therapeutic molecules SINEUPs show important advantages over other technologies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Briefly, they increase protein production in the physiological range (2&#x02013;4-fold), do not modify the cell&#x02019;s genome and do not overrun cellular regulatory pathways.
