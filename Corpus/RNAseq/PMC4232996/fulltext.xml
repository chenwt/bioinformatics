We show that Notch controls this choice. Notch promoted differentiation of immediately protective TECs and was correspondingly required for clearance of an acute influenza virus infection. Notch activated a major portion of the TEC-specific gene expression program and suppressed the MPC-specific program. Expression of Notch receptors was induced on na&#x000ef;ve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by inflammatory mediators and interleukin 2 (IL-2) via mTOR and T-bet dependent pathways. These pathways were subsequently amplified downstream of Notch, creating a positive feedback loop. Notch thus functions as a central hub where information from different sources converges to match effector T cell differentiation to the demands of the infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CD8 T cell</kwd><kwd>effector</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>MPC</kwd><kwd>TEC</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P4">The adaptive immune system must simultaneously curb the acute threat of microbial infections and generate immunological memory. Adaptive immunity to intracellular pathogens largely depends on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Protective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses require expansion of naive antigen-specific cells and their differentiation into cytolytic and cytokine-producing effector cells<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Different types of effector cells are generated, responsible for acute protection or generation of memory<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. At one extreme, a population of terminally differentiated KLRG1<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>&#x02212;</sup> effector cells exists (terminal effector cells, TECs), which are mostly short-lived<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The capacity to differentiate into long-lived memory cells is found predominantly in a KLRG1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup> population, collectively referred to as memory precursor cells (MPCs)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Apart from ability to survive, marked differences exist between these populations. TECs express higher amounts of effector molecules than MPCs<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and favor migration to non-lymphoid tissues and splenic red pulp. In contrast, MPCs preferentially home to lymph nodes and splenic white pulp<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Both lineages express distinct transcriptional programs. The transcription factors Blimp1 and T-bet are critical regulators of the TEC gene expression program<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, whereas Eomesodermin, Tcf-1, FoxO1, Stat3 and Id3 control various aspects of MPC biology<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">TECs and MPCs can derive from a single naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell or from different precursors<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Cells committed to either lineage can be identified among KLRG1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD127<sup>&#x02212;</sup> early effector cells (EECs) within three days after infection<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. An important question is how differentiating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells choose between effector cell fates. This choice may be affected by asymmetric segregation of fate determining factors<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. It stands to reason that generation of TECs is proportional to the severity of the infection<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>: greater infectious load requires generation of more fully armed effector cells, without increasing the demand for memory cells. Such proportionality would require instructive signals that relay information regarding the severity of infection. Candidates include inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 12 (IL-12) and type I interferons (IFN), help by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and strong IL-2 receptor signaling, all of which promote generation of TECs<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Given the potentially harmful consequences from erroneous generation of highly cytotoxic TECs, it makes intuitive sense that their generation requires licensing by multiple signals.</p><p id="P6">The cell surface receptor Notch is a conserved regulator of binary cell fate decisions<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Notch responds to membrane bound ligands of the Delta-like (DLL) and Jagged families. Its intracellular domain (NICD) acts as a transcriptional activator after ligand induced cleavage and nuclear translocation<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. All four mammalian Notch receptors activate a pathway involving recruitment to DNA via RBPJ molecules<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Notch reportedly regulates the gene encoding Eomesodermin, a factor required for the formation of stable CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Furthermore, during asymmetric division of naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, an inhibitor of Notch signaling called Numb is targeted towards the proximal cell, destined to become a TEC<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that Notch may promote MPC and inhibit TEC differentiation. On the other hand, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have implicated Notch in control of the genes encoding IFN-&#x003b3;, Perforin, Granzyme B and T-bet<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, more consistent with a positive role in differentiation of TECs. To establish whether Notch governs the cell fate decision between TEC and MPC, we here used the well-characterized influenza virus infection model and mice with T cell specific genetic deficiencies in the Notch pathway. We find that Notch is an essential hub in a feed forward network to integrate multiple signal inputs and translate these into differentiation of fully protective TECs.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>TEC promoting signals induce Notch expression</title><p id="P7">To study how the degree of viral infection affects effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation, we infected mice intranasally with different concentrations of the A/HK&#x000d7;31 (HK&#x000d7;31) influenza strain.influenza strain. Influenza specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were identified at the peak of the response (day 10-results not shown) using D<sup>b</sup> tetramers loaded with the immunodominant 366&#x02013;374 peptide of the influenza nucleoprotein (H-2 D<sup>b</sup>&#x02013;NP)<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Increasing viral loads across a 100-fold range resulted in great elevation of TEC numbers, whereas the number of MPCs remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This result suggests that signals exist, which couple the severity of the infectious threat to generation of TECs.</p><p id="P8">To examine whether Notch could be involved in this process, we determined whether expression of Notch receptors on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is regulated by signals known to promote TEC differentiation. Important among these are inflammatory mediators produced by antigen presenting cells (APCs). We incubated naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with dendritic cells (DCs) and added the RNA analog R-848, a mimic of RNA viruses. These conditions indeed induced surface expression of Notch1 on the na&#x000ef;ve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells within 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Expression of Notch2 was only marginally induced. Addition of R-848 to naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells without DCs did not elevate expression of Notch1, but supernatant from DCs treated with R-848 (R-848 DC sup) did (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a and b</xref>). This induction required the presence of the TLR adapter Myd88 in DC, but not in T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b and c</xref>). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) similarly induced expression of Notch1 on na&#x000ef;ve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells via a Myd88-dependent pathway in DCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Thus, TLR activation stimulates DCs to produce soluble factors that in turn induce surface expression of Notch receptors on na&#x000ef;ve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Such soluble factors also elevated the expression of RBPJ mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), suggesting general enablement of the Notch pathway.</p><p id="P9">T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation of naive OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by DCs presenting the Ovalbumin peptide (amino acids 257&#x02013;264) resulted in modest induction of Notch1 and Notch2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Induction of both these receptors was markedly enhanced by addition of R-848 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). This induction was not due to improved antigen presentation, as R-848 DC supernatant also enhanced Notch1 expression on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells activated with antibodies to CD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To identify the soluble mediators responsible for induction of Notch, we focused on type I IFN. These cytokines are produced by APCs upon recognition of viral nucleic acids and promote differentiation of TECs<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells lacking expression of IFNAR1, the receptor for type I IFN, failed to elevate Notch1 in response to R-848 DC supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Thus, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells respond to type I IFN by elevating surface expression of Notch1.</p><p id="P11">We further tested whether signaling pathways known to regulate differentiation of TECs might control expression of Notch. The rapamycin-sensitive TORC1 complex is required for differentiation of TECs<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and is activated by type I IFN receptor signaling<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Rapamycin almost abrogated induction of Notch1 expression on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by R-848 DC supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Differentiation of TECs also depends on T-bet<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Expression of this factor was induced in naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by R-848 DC supernatant (results not shown) and is partially responsible for induction of Notch1 expression, as Notch1 surface expression was reduced in <italic>Tbx21</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Finally, strong IL-2 receptor signaling enhances TEC differentiation<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and IL-2 also synergized with TCR stimulation to elevate expression of Notch1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Consistent with a role in driving TEC differentiation, Notch abundance was also transiently elevated <italic>in vivo</italic> on early KLRG1<sup>+</sup> effector cells compared to KLRG1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> effector cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, promoters of TEC differentiation also induce receptivity of the Notch pathway in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Convergence of all these signals on expression of Notch suggests that perhaps Notch plays a role in guiding the decision between TEC and MPC differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Notch ligands are induced on APC by viral infection</title><p id="P13">Two major populations of APCs in lungs are CD11c<sup>hi</sup>MHCII<sup>int</sup> alveolar macrophages and CD11c<sup>high</sup>MHCII<sup>high</sup> migratory DC (characterized by intermediate and large size, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <bold>middle</bold> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. These migratory DCs (mDCs) were shown to carry influenza antigen to the mediastinal lymph nodes and are responsible for priming naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells through direct presentation<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Both mDCs and alveolar macrophages expressed undetectable amounts of Dll4 and Jagged2 and low amounts of Dll1 and Jagged1 in lungs from uninfected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, bottom). Expression of Dll1 and Jagged1 was increased on both types of APCs upon infection with influenza virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, bottom). This elevated expression persisted on lung-derived migratory DCs (but not lymph node resident macrophages) isolated from the lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes from infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Yet, Notch ligands were virtually undetectable on other populations of MHCII<sup>+</sup> cells present in lungs, even upon infection with influenza (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). Therefore, expression of Notch ligands is induced by influenza infection on the APC that prime naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, positioning these molecules for a potential role in differentiation of virus specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Notch controls acquisition of effector function</title><p id="P14">The above results show that the Notch signaling module is assembled on both sides of the T cell-APC interface under conditions favoring differentiation of TECs. To investigate whether Notch controls differentiation of these cells, we used mice lacking expression of <italic>Notch</italic> genes in the T cell lineage.

However, the proportion of influenza specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was consistently higher in mediastinal lymph nodes from Notch1-2-KO than from wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Also, Notch1-2-KO CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells preferentially localized to sites in spleens not accessible to antibodies injected into the blood stream, suggesting localization in the white pulp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Although the proportion of IL-2 producing cells in response to NP<sub>366&#x02013;374</sub> peptide was similar between wild-type and Notch1-2-KO CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells, production of IFN-&#x003b3; or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were reduced in the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Production of the cytolytic effector molecule granzyme B was almost undetectable in Notch1-2-KO CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and mRNA abundance for both granzyme B and perforin were reduced in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Low expression of these molecules translated into reduced cytolytic effector function in an <italic>in vivo</italic> cytolysis assay. Whereas nearly all CFSE<sup>lo</sup> NP peptide&#x02013;loaded splenocytes were killed by pre-infected wild-type mice, a proportion of peptide carrying cells could still be detected in infected Notch1-2-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). As expected from these defects in effector function, viral clearance and weight recovery were compromised in Notch1-2-KO mice infected with the aggressive A/PR/8/34 influenza strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i,j</xref>). Although Notch1-2-KO mice also lack expression of Notch in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, defective viral clearance in these mice was not caused by ineffective help to B cells, as titers of neutralizing antibodies to A/PR/8/34 were similar in both wild-type and Notch1-2-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3k</xref>). Thus, Notch is required for generation of fully functional CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Notch controls differentiation of TECs</title><p id="P16">High expression of effector molecules and residence outside lymph nodes and splenic white pulp are characteristics of TECs.

Our results are therefore consistent with a defect in the TEC compartment and an increase in MPCs in Notch1-2-KO mice. Indeed, hardly any KLRG1<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> TEC T cells were detectable in Notch1-2-KO mice at the peak of the response, whereas numbers of KLRG1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> MPC T cells were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). TECs were also absent in Notch1-2-KO mice at earlier and later time points, demonstrating that their absence did not reflect altered response kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Partial loss of TECs was observed in mice lacking expression of only Notch1 or Notch2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>) or mice that were heterozygous for both these genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).

We focused on the major functional categories, which define the difference between MPCs and TECs, including those associated with effector function, migration, viability, activation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). The near complete overlap of enriched Gene Ontology terms (shown by the red color of both the core and periphery of each node) revealed a representation of Notch-dependent genes in all these categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5c</xref>). Thus, Notch does not control individual aspects of TEC differentiation, but exerts broad control throughout the TEC gene expression program. This conclusion was further supported by a comparison of the relative expression patterns of specific genes encoding transcription factors (involved in effector cell differentiation), chemokine receptors, adhesion molecules, cytotoxic effector molecules or Killer Lectin-like Receptors. Expression of TEC-specific genes across all these categories was reduced in Notch1-2-KO effector cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5d&#x02013;i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary data set 3</xref>, compare expression ratios of MPC/TEC in dark blue and knock out/wild-type in light blue).

Important is the requirement to balance effective rejection of invading microorganisms and the risk of immunopathology. Given their destructive potential, generation of TECs must be regulated by signals that shape the response to the threat posed by the infection. Indeed, inflammatory signals promote the development of TECs<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. We now show that Notch bridges signaling by innate pattern recognition receptors and inflammation to TEC development. Type I IFN induce expression of Notch receptors and RBPJ on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, while TLR and inflammatory cytokines induce expression of Notch ligands on APC<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Thus, microbial and inflammatory stimuli activate both sides of the T cell-APC interface to assemble the Notch signaling module. Notch receptors and ligands never reach very high surface levels. However, it is important to note that these levels are often actively kept low, for instance by internalization<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, a property that may promote dosage sensitivity of the pathway<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. TEC differentiation is indeed sensitive to Notch dose, as shown in mice lacking <italic>Notch1</italic> or <italic>Notch2</italic> genes individually or heterozygous mice for both. Importantly, combined induction of receptors, ligands and the downstream mediator RBPJ likely results in cumulative amplification of signal amplitude.</p><p id="P28">Our results show that Notch, IL-2 receptor, mTOR and T-bet together form a positive feedback module, which integrates signals from various sources. These signals may signify the detection of living microorganisms (type I IFN), direct interaction of the APC with those micro-organisms (Notch ligands) and perhaps help by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (IL-2). Such a system requiring integration of multiple signals is presumably less prone to spuriously develop the potentially destructive TECs than one depending on an individual signal. Together, these factors (and possibly yet others) could serve as a licensing code, which allows full differentiation of TECs only when justified by the severity of the infection. The fact that delivery of all these signals together sets up a positive feedback loop, presumably ensures maximal separation between the TEC and MPC fates.</p><p id="P29">Notch and Akt promote survival in multiple cell types<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>, but this does not appear to explain their roles in effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Activation of Akt in fact reduces survival of CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, presumably by promoting differentiation of the short lived TEC fate<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. Likewise, our results are not consistent with a major role for Notch in survival of TECs. First, Notch deficiency does not affect the magnitude of the H-2 D<sup>b</sup>&#x02013;NP<sub>366&#x02013;374</sub> specific response, inconsistent with loss of a major population. Second, if Notch deficiency compromised TEC survival, one would expect loss of the entire TEC signature in Notch1-2-KO mice. Instead, we find that approximately half of the TEC gene expression signature is unaffected by N1/2 deficiency. Furthermore, there are marked differences in the degree to which different TEC genes are affected. These data strongly suggest that Notch controls TEC differentiation by regulating a large proportion of the TEC specific gene expression program. In this program, some genes rely more heavily on Notch than others. Yet, in the absence of Notch, the program as a whole collapses, resulting in a severe differentiation defect. Direct Notch target genes have been identified with dedicated roles in effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. These include the genes encoding granzyme B, perforin, IFN-&#x003b3; and T-bet<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Furthermore, Notch controls expression of a critical component of the IL-2 receptor as well as the amplitude of Akt and mTOR signaling during effector CD8 T cell differentiation. All of these promote differentiation of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and regulate additional transcription factors involved in this process, including STAT5, Foxo and HIF1 proteins<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>. Thus, besides directly regulating key effector genes, Notch mobilizes additional signaling pathways and thereby coordinates an extensive differentiation program. Still, the fact that approximately half the TEC specific transcriptome is unaffected by the absence of Notch shows that the TEC differentiation program is modular. It seems likely that the other module(s) are controlled by additional signals activated by inflammation.</p><p id="P30">Loss of part of the TEC signature in Notch1-2-KO mice is mirrored by elevation of roughly a third of the MPC specific transcriptome. This unlikely reflects a relative increase in MPC numbers due to the absence of TECs, as that would result in elevation of the entire MPC transcriptome. The simplest interpretation of these data is therefore that, apart from inducing a TEC gene expression program, Notch represses part of the MPC program. This program may further be suppressed by additional TEC promoting signals and/or may require provision of MPC promoting signals, such as Wnts and activators of STAT3, including IL-10 and IL-21 (refs.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>).

Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. For Deep sequencing analysis, total RNA was further purified by nucleospin RNAII columns (Macherey-Nagel) and RNA was amplified using the Superscript RNA amplification system (Invitrogen) and labeled with the ULS system (Kreatech), using either Cy3 or Cy5 dyes (Amersham). Sequences were obtained by pooling 10 samples in one lane on a HiSeq2000 machine. Between 17 and 27 million reads were obtained per sample.</p><p id="P45">Read mapping (TopHat) and determining differentially expressed genes (DESeq) was done as described in<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup>. Reads were mapped against the mouse reference genome (build mm9) using TopHat (version 1.4.0), which allows to span exon-exon junctions. TopHat was supplied with a known set of gene models (NCBI build 37, version 64). In order to obtain per sample genecounts HTSeq-count was used. This tool generates genecounts for each gene that is present in the provided Gene Transfer Format (GTF) file. Genes that have zero counts across all samples were removed from the dataset. Statistical analysis was performed using the R package DESeq. Differentially expressed genes were determined between the SLEC and MPEC samples, and between the wild type and knock-out samples. DESeq assumes that gene counts can be modelled by a negative binomial distribution. For sample normalisation the &#x02018;size factors&#x02019; were determined from the count data. The empirical dispersion was determined with the &#x02018;pooled&#x02019; method, which used the samples from all conditions with replicates to estimate a single pooled dispersion value. Subsequently, a parametric fit determines the dispersion-mean relationship for the expression values resulting in two dispersion estimates for each gene (the empirical estimated, and the fitted value). Using the &#x02018;maximum sharingMode&#x02019; we selected the maximum of these two values to be more conservative. Finally, p-values and FDR corrected p-values were calculated.</p><p id="P46">To highlight biological processes that are over-represented in the set of differentially expressed genes we used Bioconductor package GOseq<sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>, which was developed for the analysis of RNA-seq data. First we selected all genes with an FDR&#x0003c;0.5 from the SLEC-MPEC and WT-KO comparisons. Subsequently, the GO &#x02018;Biological Processes&#x02019; gene sets were used to determine over-represented processes. In addition we used the &#x02018;C7&#x02019; gene set from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea">http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea</ext-link>), which is a collection of annotated gene sets. Gene set C7 comprises immunologic signatures composed of gene sets that represent cell types, states, and perturbations within the immune system. The signatures were generated by manual curation of published microarray studies in human and mouse immunology. This gene set was generated as part of the Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.immuneprofiling.org">http://www.immuneprofiling.org</ext-link>). An in-house R script was developed to convert the C7 gene set into a format that could be used by GOseq.</p><p id="P47">To visualize the results for the GOseq analysis based on the GO biological processes, we used the Cytoscape Enrichment Map plugin<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>. We first constructed a gmt file containing the GO terms and corresponding ensembl gene identifiers. GO terms associated with more than 250 genes were removed because these represent too general terms that are difficult to interpret. In addition, very small gene sets (&#x0003c;15 genes) were removed because these are more likely to become significant by chance alone. Subsequently, from the results of the GOseq analysis we selected biological processes related to chemokines, cytokines, cytotoxicity, differentiation, adhesion, migration, apoptosis, activation and proliferation. Selected GO terms with FDR&#x0003c;0.5 were visualized as an enrichment map.
