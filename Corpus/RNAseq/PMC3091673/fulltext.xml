A key component of nearly all gene expression assays is the reverse transcription of transcribed sequences that has traditionally been performed by priming the poly-A tails on many of the transcribed genes in eukaryotes with oligo-dT, or by priming RNA indiscriminately with random hexamers. We designed an algorithm to find common sequence motifs that were present within most protein-coding genes of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>and of <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, but that were not present within their ribosomal RNA or transfer RNA genes. We then experimentally tested whether degenerately priming these motifs with multi-targeted primers improved the accuracy and completeness of transcriptomic assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We discovered two multi-targeted primers that would prime a preponderance of genes in the genomes of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>and <italic>Neurospora crassa </italic>while avoiding priming ribosomal RNA or transfer RNA. Examining the response of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>to nitrogen deficiency and profiling <italic>Neurospora crassa </italic>early sexual development, we demonstrated that using multi-targeted primers in reverse transcription led to superior performance of microarray profiling and next-generation RNA tag sequencing. Priming with multi-targeted primers in addition to oligo-dT resulted in higher sensitivity, a larger number of well-measured genes and greater power to detect differences in gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results provide the most complete and detailed expression profiles of the yeast nitrogen starvation response and <italic>N. crassa </italic>early sexual development to date. Furthermore, our multi-targeting priming methodology for genome-wide gene expression assays provides selective targeting of multiple sequences and counter-selection against undesirable sequences, facilitating a more complete and precise assay of the transcribed sequences within the genome.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Gene expression levels have been quantified by numerous procedures, including reverse transcription (RT)-PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], sequencing of expressed sequence tags [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], serial analysis of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], microarray hybridization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and massively parallel signature sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Rapid development of platforms has improved throughput, but also generated strong demand for enhanced sensitivity and measurement accuracy. For nearly all expression assays, reverse transcription from messenger RNA (mRNA) to complementary DNA (cDNA) is a key step of the process that contributes less experimental variance than biological growth and harvest, but greater experimental variance than hybridization [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">6</xref>], but see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]]. Throughput of the reaction may be biased by secondary and tertiary structures of mRNA, affinities specific to the reverse transcriptase, inhibitors present in the sample, priming strategy, and variation in priming efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The most common priming strategies utilize oligo-dT primers, random primers, or gene-specific primers. When oligo-dT primers are used for reverse transcription, RNA secondary structure and variation in poly(A) tail length may result in gene amplification 3' bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Random primers, typically used in prokaryotic systems, fail to discriminate between mRNA and the preponderance of RNA in the form of ribosomal (rRNA) or transfer RNA (tRNA). Random hexamers, the most commonly employed, amplify only fraction of the transcriptome, comparing with random pentadecamers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, random oligonucleotides of any size also prime abundant rRNA and tRNA that can lead to high background and misleading signal.</p><p>Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences in many prokaryotes are GC rich relative to the genome at large and are highly conserved. These properties have been used to design non-random hexamers (HD/DHTTTT) to prime reverse transcription reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The result was a counter-selective synthesis of cDNA corresponding to mRNA from prokaryotic total RNA extractions. In contrast, application of gene-specific primers on a genomic scale requires synthesis of multiple primers. An algorithm to predict the minimal number of non-degenerate genome-directed primers that specifically anneal to all genes in a given genome has been designed and successfully applied in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Another recently developed method relies on a collection of short, computationally selected oligonucleotides ('not-so-random' (NSR) primers) to obtain full-length, strand-specific representation of nonribosomal RNA transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Selective enrichment of non-rRNA targets was achieved by computationally subtracting rRNA priming sequences from a random hexamer library. The presence of rRNA and tRNA plagues most mRNA purification procedures due to their relative abundance, leading to non-specific interactions like rRNA adsorption to the oligo-dT matrix, or hybridization of rRNA and mRNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Here we describe an alternate strategy, multi-targeted priming (MTP), that allows for selective amplification of chosen sequences. A degenerate oligonucleotide complementary to selected mRNAs and absent in both rRNA or tRNA was identified allowing for selective transcription of mRNA. To demonstrate the power of MTP, species-specific primers were designed and tested on RNA from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>exposed to nitrogen deficiency, and on RNA from <italic>Neurospora crassa </italic>during early sexual development following nitrogen depletion. When primary nitrogen sources are not available or are present in concentrations low enough to limit growth, many different nitrogen sources can be used. Utilization of secondary nitrogen sources is highly regulated, and nearly always requires the synthesis of a set of pathway-specific catabolic enzymes and permeases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Several studies have shown the induction of a common suite of effector genes during growth of fungal plant pathogens under nitrogen-starved conditions in vitro and during growth in planta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As a consequence, nitrogen-starved media has become a model for the environment that a pathogen encounters during growth in planta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, nitrogen uptake and exchange are key processes for ectomycorrhizal interactions that are established between the root systems of terrestrial plants and hyphae from soil-borne fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Finally, nitrogen deficiency has been associated with major problems encountered in contemporary wine making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], especially those related to slow and incomplete fermentations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Therefore, the response of budding yeast exposed to nitrogen starvation has been of interest in light of nutrient depletion during wine fermentation.</p><p><italic>Neurospora crassa </italic>is a heterothallic filamentous fungus that undergoes a complex pattern of sexual differentiation to form the female reproductive structure (protoperithecium) when subjected to conditions of nitrogen starvation, light, and low temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A large number of genes affecting sexual development have been identified by mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], but large-scale transcript profiling has not been performed.</p><p>Here we show for these applications that the addition of an MTP provides superior sensitivity and precision to microarray transcript profiling compared to sole use of oligo-dT primers. We corroborate these results for high throughput RNA tag sequencing, incorporating modification of the Illumina Digital Gene Expression protocols to facilitate use of MTPs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Transcript profiling of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>grown in nitrogen-poor conditions</title><p>We identified a 12-nucleotide (nt) degenerate sequence that occurs one or more times in 76% of 6608 mRNAs present in budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, but that is absent in rRNA or tRNA. The corresponding degenerate primer was NDKTBBBBDWGS. Among the 5039 yeast ORFs containing the identified degenerate sequence, 86% featured one to five exact priming sites and the remaining sequences featured six to 44 priming sites (see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). On average, there were 3.2 priming sites per gene. Priming for reverse transcription is not highly specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], thus MTPs may prime nearly all genes with some frequency. Nonetheless, the MTP and an equal proportion of oligo-dT primers were supplied for the reverse transcription step during the microarray target labeling procedure, to achieve the greatest coverage possible.</p><p>Contrasting yeast grown in nitrogen-poor and nitrogen-rich conditions, priming by MTP increased number of well measured genes, recorded after data normalization, by 31% over oligo-dT priming (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). A logistic regression indicates that a model featuring the number of MTP binding sites in a gene is a statistically significantly better predictor of whether a statistically significant difference in expression will be observed when using MTPs than is a model without a slope with regard to number of MTP binding sites (P &#x0003c; 0.0001, slope 0.05). However, a model featuring the number of MTP binding sites is also a statistically significant predictor of the probability of a statistically significant call when oligo-dT alone is used (P = 0.02, slope 0.03). More saliently, use of the MTP increased the number of genes that were identified as significantly differentially expressed by 66%.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the results comparing use of oligo(dT) and multi-targeted primers (MTPs) for reverse transcription.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="center" colspan="3"><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></th><th align="center" colspan="3"><italic>Neurospora crassa</italic></th></tr><tr><th align="left">Feature</th><th align="center" colspan="3">Nitrogen depletion</th><th align="center" colspan="3">Protoperithecial developmenr</th></tr><tr><th/><th colspan="6"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th/><th align="right">Oligo (dT)</th><th align="center">MTP</th><th align="center">Common</th><th align="center">Oligo (dT)</th><th align="center">MTP</th><th align="center">Common</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Number of well measured genes<sup>1 </sup>on the array</td><td align="right">4620</td><td align="right">6042</td><td align="right">4573</td><td align="right">469</td><td/><td align="right">416</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Number of genes significantly differentially expressed (<italic>P </italic>&#x02264; 0.05)</td><td align="right">2155</td><td align="right">3577</td><td align="right">1839</td><td align="right">172</td><td align="right">406</td><td align="right">2021</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Number of up-regulated genes (<italic>P </italic>&#x02264; 0.05)</td><td align="right">1080</td><td align="right">1855</td><td align="right">925</td><td align="right">66</td><td align="right">232</td><td align="right">31</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Number of down-regulated genes (<italic>P </italic>&#x02264; 0.05)</td><td align="right">1075</td><td align="right">1722</td><td align="right">912</td><td align="right">106</td><td align="right">174</td><td align="right">61</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Highest gene expression ratio</td><td align="right">49.15</td><td align="right">32.6</td><td/><td align="right">24.26</td><td align="right">10.74</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">Average gene expression ratio</td><td align="right">2.05</td><td align="right">1.77</td><td/><td align="right">1.96</td><td align="right">1.43</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">GEL<sub>50</sub><sup>2</sup></td><td align="right">1.51</td><td align="right">1.27</td><td/><td align="right">1.91</td><td align="right">2.08</td><td/></tr><tr><td align="left">Number of genes with gene expression ratio greater or equal to GEL50 (<italic>P </italic>&#x02264; 0.05)</td><td align="right">1237</td><td align="right">2617</td><td align="right">1166</td><td align="right">102</td><td align="right">141</td><td align="right">52</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>1 </sup>well measured genes recorded after data normalization (foreground fluorescence signals were at least three standard deviations of the distribution of intensities of the background pixels for that gene).</p><p><sup>2 </sup>GEL<sub>50 </sub>- gene expression level at which there is a 50% empirical probability of a significant call.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>We analyzed the frequency of MTP priming sites among genes identified as significantly differentially expressed in nitrogen-depleted yeast. Out of 1738 genes indicated by MTPs exclusively as differentially expressed, 342 did not have an MTP recognition site and 1396 genes contained one to 29 priming sites. Among 316 genes exclusively identified by oligo-dT primers as significantly differentially expressed in response to nitrogen depletion, 68 did not contain an MTP recognition site and 248 exhibited one to 18 priming sites. For the genes with the highest number of priming sites, the gene expression levels calculated based on the MTP experiment were similar to the oligo-dT experiment and typically yielded ratios close to one, indicating that a higher number of exact MTP priming sites per se did not increase detection of significant gene expression differences.</p><p>The ratio of genes abundantly expressed to genes meagerly expressed was largely unchanged when MTPs were used (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Just two genes manifested a statistically significant opposite direction of differential expression in the MTP-microarray dataset compared to both the oligo-dT dataset and the independent RNA-Seq datasets (YDR179W-A, YKL203C). Out of 3577 genes detected as significantly differentially expressed by MTP-microarray, this is a very small number and may be reasonably attributed to experimental error in the MTP-primed reverse transcription and hybridizations. The highest and average changes in gene expression level were lower for MTP than for oligo-dT (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Lastly, the gene expression level at which there was a 50% empirical probability of a significant call (GEL<sub>50</sub>), illustrating the statistical power of the experiment, demonstrated greater resolution for MTP than for oligo-dT primers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Three times more genes were detected as differentially expressed in the MTP experiment above its GEL<sub>50 </sub>threshold than were differentially expressed above the GEL<sub>50 </sub>threshold of the experiment performed with oligo-dT primers alone (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Functional classification of genes differentially expressed by <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>grown in nitrogen-poor conditions</title><p>While meager expression in nitrogen-poor medium was typical for genes functioning in protein synthesis and transcription, abundant expression was typical for genes coding for proteins involved in energy and genes of unknown function (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). This result was obtained both with the aid of MTPs and with oligo-dT primers. Using oligo-dT primers, functional categories of metabolism, development, and energy were identified as significantly affected under nitrogen deficiency (Fisher's Exact test, <italic>P </italic>= 0.01, <italic>P </italic>= 2.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-21</sup>, <italic>P </italic>= 0.01). The MTP experiment identified the same functional categories, and provided additional experimental power, also identifying genes involved in regulation with the environment (<italic>P </italic>= 4.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5</sup>). The classification for which the highest number of genes was indicated as significantly differentially expressed by either approach was metabolism. Within metabolism, the greater power of the MTP experiment provided a stronger signal of subcategory, as more measurements were statistically significant: 39% as indicated by MTP and 15% as indicated by oligo-dT primers were involved in amino acid metabolism; 36% and 15%, respectively, in carbohydrate metabolism; and 16% and 6% in lipid metabolism.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Functional classification of genes significantly differentially expressed (<italic>P </italic>&#x02264; 0.05) by a) <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>grown in nitrogen-poor conditions and b) <italic>N. crassa </italic>protoperithecia identified by transcript profiling using oligo(dT) (red) or multi-targeted primers (blue)</bold>.

For nearly every pathway or process, the microarrays performed with MTPs resulted in a more complete assessment of expression of proteins/enzymes building a pathway, assigning expression to more genes than the oligo-dT-primed experiment in each process (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>; see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Most of the genes coding for enzymes belonging to 26 pathways specifically related to nitrogen and amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis were meagerly expressed by yeast growing in nitrogen-poor conditions, e.g. glutamate metabolism and urea cycle (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). An opposite tendency of abundant expression in nitrogen-poor conditions was observed among genes encoding proteins composing energy-related pathways, e.g. the citrate cycle (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Typically, enzymes catalyzing reactions occurring in opposite directions exhibited opposite regulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Furthermore, we were able to more reliably characterize the expression of multiple genes coding for isozymes, isoforms with different cellular location and enzyme subunits (Figures <xref

While the functional classifications with the highest number of genes significantly differentially expressed in protoperithecia were the "unknown" functional category or were metabolism-related, the oligo-dT-primed experiment indicated that genes involved in protein synthesis were significantly affected by sexual development (Fisher's Exact test, <italic>P </italic>= 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6</sup>).

For genome-wide gene expression assays, the addition of multi-targeted primers offers the potential for improving the coverage of the reverse transcription. Reverse transcription reactions are fairly nonspecific: transcription may be primed by non-complementary primers, other RNA molecules present in the sample, and even by dNTPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], so the priming strategy selected may be expected to play a significant role in determining the results obtained. For instance, commonly-used oligo-dT primers generate a high frequency of truncated cDNAs through internal poly-A priming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We demonstrated that addition of MTP to commonly used oligo-dT primers for yeast and <italic>N. crassa </italic>microarray profiling substantially increased the number of well measured genes recorded after data normalization as well as the number of genes significantly differentially expressed, compared with the sole use of oligo-dT primers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Additionally, MTP-based profiling manifested higher statistical power as demonstrated by lower value of GEL<sub>50</sub>, a measure of empirical power to reveal differences in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], in the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>experiment.</p><p>High-throughput RNA tag sequencing validated our findings. It confirmed the utility of MTPs, combined with oligo-dT column purification, for priming reverse transcription reactions, yielding an increased number of detected and well measured genes, compared to oligo-dT primers alone (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Priming using MTPs, we were able to corroborate gene expression levels for a higher number of genes than when priming with oligo-dT (41% and 35%, respectively; Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). To explain this result, note that both traditional oligo-dT and MTP priming provide biased counts and profile only a proportion of the total RNA pool. Some genes that are poorly primed by oligo-dT primers are those that have protected poly-A tails due to foldback structures; other genes, such as histones in metazoan DNA, have no poly-A tail. In a particuliarly clear case for yeast, it has been demonstrated that many to all of the 24 putative and known mitochondrial mRNAs are not stabilized by a poly-A tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. For these genes, MTPs were successful at priming and revealing gene expression differences, whereas oligo-dT primers were not. Some genes feature multiple sites for priming by MTPs, leading to greater power for the detection of differential expression for those genes. However, the effect of multiple priming is modest, mostly increasing the chance of a gene being well measured. The equivalent coefficients of variation of our transcriptomic tag sequencing runs indicate that the complexity of the mRNA pool with either priming strategy is approximately the same. The advantage of adding MTPs obtains because the reverse transcription biases for each method of priming are different. In combination, they exhibit greater coverage than either would individually. Based on our high-throughput transcript sequencing data, MTPs might yield slightly better coverage of expressed sequences than oligo-dT. In terms of false negatives in the high-throughput transcript sequencing, MTP priming exhibited a lower false-negative rate (248 not detected by MTP mix that were detected by oligo-dT alone) than did oligo-dT priming alone (368 not detected by oligo-dT that were detected by MTP). Correlations between replicate tag sequencing results and between replicate MTP-based microarray results were similar. Next generation RNA tag sequencing offers a promise of increasing power, depth, and sensitivity of gene expression analysis, but even a limited depth of RNA sequencing remains costly compared to a highly replicated experiment using microarrays generated in the lab.</p><p>Finally, qRT-PCR validated the results based on MTP-priming. It confirmed that genes identified as well measured or as significantly differentially expressed only by MTP-primed microarray, had changed in expression in the direction revealed by the MTP-primed experiments, regardless of the primer combination used. This observation suggests that incorporating MTPs increases the power for detection of differential expression by microarrays, by increasing the coverage of the priming of reverse transcription while maintaining low noise due to nonspecific priming. Logistic regressions showed some evidence that genes with more priming sites were measured with increased power with MTPs applied than genes with fewer MTP priming sites, but this observation was true (albeit to a lesser extent) for oligo-dT priming as well. This commonality may well arise because longer genes have more MTP sites and are better measured with either MTPs or oligo-dT primers. Considering the 4762 observations underlying these effects, their statistical significance is unsurprising. The effect sizes are not large. It would be possible to procedurally minimize the variation in the number of MTP sites, but effectively, this minimization of variation would entail searching for MTPs that were less powerful for some genes. That would be counter-productive to the effort to measure genome-wide gene expression for as many genes as possible to the best precision possible. Because such gene-specific effects exist at approximately the same levels no matter the method of priming, decent statistical approaches toward microarray data have featured effects estimated for each gene, thus providing P-values and confidence or credible intervals that appropriately reflect the variation in power across genes. Markedly successful enhancement of the power of transcriptomic approaches was achieved here by usage of MTPs subsequent to a crude filtration provided by poly-A+ purification columns, which typically bring the RNA content to approximately 50% poly-A+ RNA and 50% other RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. An alternate approach with potential to further increase power would be to forego any column purification of poly-A+, relying solely on MTPs to pick out messenger RNA from other species of RNA.</p><p>Functionally, inclusion of MTPs provided a more complete picture of cellular processes undergoing change during fungal growth in nitrogen deficient conditions and in early sexual development. Interestingly, the most striking difference in the ability to detect genes differentially expressed between MTPs and oligo-dT primers was observed among <italic>N. crassa </italic>unknown and unclassified genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Genes expressed at a low level have a lower probability of being identified and characterized than those expressed at a higher level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Only 42% of genes in <italic>N. crassa </italic>genome have been assigned known functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] so identifying their expression signatures and inferring functional classification are key objectives of future experimentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The increased levels of yeast transcripts coding for enzymes involved in the TCA cycle observed here (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) supports a finding that the content of TCA cycle compounds increases during yeast starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Both carbon and nitrogen limitation have been shown to enhance respiration relative to fermentation in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Amino acid metabolism was strongly affected by exposure to nitrogen deficiency, as in the filamentous fungus <italic>Magnaporthe grisea </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Prevalent down-regulation of glutamate metabolism pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) was in accordance with decline of total glutathione pool found in nitrogen-starved <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Similarly, the urea cycle was down-regulated, with an exception of the branch responsible for urea degradation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Urea amidolyase, the enzyme corresponding to that branch, contains both urea carboxylase and allophanate hydrolase activities. It also converts allantoin to ammonia and carbon dioxide, enabling <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>to use allantoin as a sole nitrogen source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The urea cycle operates in terrestrial animals to detoxify ammonia, and in yeast plays a principal role in the biosynthesis of arginine. Within these pathways, we were able to characterize expression of multiple isozymes and isoforms (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) providing a key component of a full understanding of expression regulation in nitrogen-deficient medium. The general trend of shutting down amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism appears essential for survival during prolonged periods of starvation. These results from our experiments are entirely consistent with a functional category analysis of independent data from the unreplicated time-course experiment by Gasch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>A number of genes abundantly expressed by yeast during growth in nitrogen-poor conditions are components of the environmental stress response that was characterized by evaluating the transcriptional responses to a wide range of stress stimuli, including nitrogen depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The remaining genes might be involved in immediate responses specific to nitrogen limitation, but many are likely associated with transitive effects that occur over time, such as successive nutrient depletion, pH change, cell density, and growth arrest. The finding that development-related genes were significantly affected in our study may be related to growth arrest or to a morphological switch from the yeast to a filamentous or pseudohyphal growth triggered by nitrogen starvation in the presence of a fermentable carbon source, such as glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Nutrient and nitrogen sensing plays important roles in fungal development in general, and specifically in critical aspects of pathogenicity and virulence, for both animal and plant pathogens. Dimorphic pathogens such as the phytopathogenic smut fungi, <italic>Ustilago maydis </italic>and <italic>Microbotryum violaceum</italic>, must switch from a yeast-like to a filamentous form in order to cause disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p><italic>N. crassa </italic>protoperithecia consist of a small knot of vegetative hyphae surrounding ascogonial cells. Their formation requires extensive cell proliferation. Thus, it was not surprising to find a large proportion of differentially expressed genes involved in metabolism, especially carbohydrate metabolism (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), providing energy and the robust structural components necessary for specialized cell formation. The shift in transcript accumulation of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) supports previous observations that the fatty acid composition of sexual tissues of <italic>Neurospora </italic>differ substantially from the composition of asexual tissues. For instance, mutations in the gene encoding the b-fatty acid synthase affect sexual development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. On the other hand, we expected to identify known developmental genes responsible for the formation of protoperithecial reproductive structures, but the number of genes significantly differentially expressed involved in the functional category of development was very low. One of them coded for clock controlled pheromone <italic>ccg-4 </italic>precursor which had been first identified as a gene that is expressed with a 22 h rhythm under the control of the circadian biological clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The expression of the pheromone precursor genes is mating-type specific and is under the control of the mating type locus. These genes are highly expressed in conidia and under conditions that favor sexual development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>We found a reduced level of transcripts related to protein synthesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>) in both <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>under nitrogen starvation and in <italic>N. crassa </italic>sexual development occurring as a developmental response to nitrogen depletion. Ribosome biogenesis and protein translation are among the most energy-consuming cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Thus, these pathways are tightly controlled upon nutrient limitation. Decreasing levels of protein, RNA and soluble aminonitrogen were observed during protoperithecia development as early as 1975 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Additionally, ribosomes are rapidly degraded by autophagy upon nutrient starvation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, implying that degradation of excessive ribosomes may help to shut down protein translation rapidly and provide an important source of new building blocks to maintain cellular homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>The MTPs used in this study were designed to prime 76-85% of mRNAs rather than all the genes, so that reverse transcription of rRNA and tRNA could be simultaneously minimized. An additional step of primer design could be conducted to specifically target the remaining sequences to eliminate or further diminish the need to rely on low-complexity, low-specificity oligo-dT primers. For transcript profiling in prokaryotes, such a tiered approach would constitute an appealing alternative to the use of non-specific random primers. Correspondingly, the modification of Illumina massively parallel RNA tag sequencing presented here, involving the use of custom primers, presents the possibility of performing Digital Gene Expression assays on transcriptomes lacking poly(A) tails or on a designable fraction of all the genes. Furthermore, future applications of multi-targeted primers may include concurrent selective amplification of DNA sequences of interest from one or multiple genomes for the high-throughput sequencing of multiple homologous loci. Locked nucleic acid nucleotides could be included in the MTP sequence to increase binding strength and specificity, and to decrease non-specific amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here we presented a novel priming strategy for genome-wide gene expression assays, featuring selective targeting of mRNA and counter-selection against rRNA and tRNA. We demonstrated superior performance of two MTPs compared to oligo-dT by microarray profiling of the response of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>to nitrogen deficiency and by profiling <italic>Neurospora crassa </italic>early sexual development. MTPs resulted in higher sensitivity, yielding more well measured genes after data normalization, more genes significantly differentially expressed, and a greater power to detect meager differences in gene expression. Our results provide the most complete and detailed expression profiles of the nitrogen starvation response to date. Future applications of multi-targeted primers may include concurrent selective amplification of DNA sequences of interest from one or multiple genomes for the high-throughput sequencing of multiple homologous loci.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Multi-targeted primers (MTPs)</title><p>Sequences for all three types of RNA were obtained from the <italic>Saccharomyces </italic>Genome Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and the <italic>Neurospora crassa </italic>Genome Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. To identify a degenerate sequence that occurs in a maximal number of mRNAs and in a minimal number of tRNAs and rRNAs, exhaustive search is not a feasible option as there are 16<sup>12 </sup>such degenerate sequences. Our heuristic search started with a random degenerate 12-mer oligonucleotide. Iteratively, this oligonucleotide was randomly mutated and a score was computed as <italic>m/(m</italic><sub><italic>t </italic></sub><italic>* (1 + t + r))</italic>, where <italic>m</italic>, <italic>t</italic>, and <italic>r </italic>are the number of hits of the degenerate sequence to the annotated mRNAs, tRNAs, and rRNAs, respectively, and <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>t </italic></sub>is the total number of annotated mRNAs. If a randomly generated number (0-1) was smaller than the ratio of the new score to the previous, raised to the power of ten, then the new oligonucleotide was kept. Otherwise, it was discarded. This procedure was iterated so that the oligonucleotide experienced 2*10<sup>6 </sup>mutations before the search was terminated. To ensure convergence upon a globally optimal priming sequence, several different random initial sequences were used.</p><p>Each new oligonucleotide obtained was recorded. From the ranked list, we selected a high-scoring sequence that additionally showed strong binding (GC) in the 3' end. The MTP primer was designed to be reverse-complementary to the selected dodecanucleotide.</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast strain and conditions</title><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>S288c was grown in synthetic complete medium (SC) at 30&#x000b0;C shaking at 160 rpm until mid log phase (OD<sub>600 </sub>= 0.4).

Fluorescence intensity values were adjusted by subtracting background from foreground. A gene was considered well measured if the foreground fluorescence signals were higher than three standard deviations of the distribution of intensities of the background pixels for that gene. Genes were deemed significantly differentially expressed when <italic>P </italic>&#x02264; 0.05. To assess the power of the experiments to detect smaller differences in gene expression, the gene expression level at which there was a 50% empirical probability of a significant call (GEL<sub>50</sub>) was inferred by logistic regression of statistical significance against fold-change as in Townsend [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].
