To comprehensively examine AID's effects on the transcriptome and DNA methylome, we performed RNA-Seq and reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) on <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, wild-type and AID-overexpressing activated B cells. These analyses confirmed AID's known role in immunoglobulin isotype switching, while also demonstrating that it has little other effect on gene expression. Additionally, no evidence of AID-dependent mRNA or miRNA editing could be detected. Finally, RRBS data failed to support a role for AID in the regulation of DNA methylation. Thus, despite evidence of its additional activities in other systems, antibody diversification appears to be AID's sole physiological function in activated B cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Germinal center B cells undergo two processes of immunoglobulin diversification: somatic hypermutation (SHM), in which mutations are introduced into immunoglobulin (Ig) genes, and class-switch recombination (CSR), in which genomic constant regions are recombined to encode antibodies of different isotypes. Both of these processes require activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, which generates C-to-U lesions at the Ig loci that are resolved to generate point mutations or double-stranded DNA breaks in the cases of SHM and CSR, respectively (reviewed in<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P3">Despite over a decade of intense study, a number of outstanding questions regarding AID remain. The first regards its range of substrates. Based on its homology to the well-characterized RNA editing enzyme APOBEC1, AID was initially thought to deaminate an RNA substrate<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Since then, roles for AID in CSR and SHM have been convincingly shown to proceed by a DNA-editing mechanism (reviewed in<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>), and no AID activity has been detected on RNA substrates <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. However, AID has been shown to bind mRNA<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, to modulate translation<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, and to edit the genome of hepatitis B virus<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, leading to the hypothesis that it could edit RNA <italic>in vivo</italic> in conjunction with an unknown sequence motif or cofactor.</p><p id="P4">Additionally, AID has been shown to act on non-immunoglobulin loci in B cells<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. These off-target events can result in the mutation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors genes<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, and have been implicated in oncogenic chromosomal translocations in B cell lymphomas<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. AID expression has also been reported in a number of different non-B cell tumor types, where it has been hypothesized to contribute to malignant progression<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. In support of such off-target activities, ChIP-Seq experiments indicated AID occupancy at a large number of promoters beyond the Ig loci<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. However, the transcriptional consequences of these off-target activities for the typical B cell have not been determined.</p><p id="P5">Furthermore, numerous experiments in a variety of organisms have suggested that AID might also play a role in active DNA demethylation and corresponding gene regulation<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Because AID is active on 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in DNA<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, it has been hypothesized that, following AID-catalyzed 5mC:T deamination, active demethylation could occur via repair of the resulting T:G mismatch through error-free DNA repair<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, a model supported by reports linking AID to DNA demethylation in a variety of systems<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. However, these findings are puzzling in light of the low abundance of AID expressed in many of these systems and biochemical preference of AID for C over 5mC as a substrate<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Additionally, it is clear that AID is not absolutely required for active demethylation at least during development as indicated by the viability and fertility of <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">To answer the outstanding questions regarding AID activity on RNA and its capacity to mediate DNA demethylation, we sought to systematically characterize the effects of AID by performing a combined transcriptome and methylome analysis of AID-deficient, wild-type and AID-overexpressing activated murine B cells. These analyses clearly demonstrated AID activity at the Ig loci, but did not reveal additional AID-dependent transcriptional differences. Furthermore, we were unable to detect AID-dependent RNA editing activity, strongly suggesting that, despite initial models, AID does not act as an RNA editor in B cells. Finally, our analysis of the activated B cell methylome revealed no DNA methylation differences attributable to AID, even when AID was overexpressed. Overall, our data suggest that, at least within B cells, AID acts near-exclusively in its well-described role in Ig diversification.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>AID has little effect on gene expression</title><p id="P7">To determine the effects of AID on the B cell transcriptome, we performed 100-nt, single-end RNA-Seq on polyadenylated RNA from na&#x000ef;ve splenic B cells of <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, wild-type and AID&#x02013;miR-155T transgenic mice<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, which contain an AID-GFP fusion gene that lacks the miR155 target sequence in its 3&#x02032;UTR, resulting in AID overexpression. Isolated B cells were stimulated <italic>ex vivo</italic> with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin 4 (IL-4), and CD40-specific antibody for 72 h. These conditions induce strong expression of AID and appreciable frequencies of CSR to IgG1 (14% for WT, 31% for AID&#x02013;miR-155T) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We prepared RNA-Seq libraries using a standard protocol with the addition of two sets of &#x0201c;spike in&#x0201d; control transcripts: the ERCC panel of RNAs<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> (to ascertain the lower limit of detection for gene expression), and 5 &#x0201c;pre-edited&#x0201d; RNAs derived from <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes with a single C-to-T change introduced at a frequency of 50% (to serve as a positive control for the detection of RNA editing).</p><p id="P8">To determine the lower bound of accurate transcript measurement, the abundance of ERCC spikes was calculated. Estimates of abundance were extremely well correlated for each pair of samples for transcripts with &#x0003e; 5 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped (FPKM &#x02013; a relative measure of transcript abundance) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). This analysis demonstrates that even poorly expressed transcripts are well covered in these RNA-Seq datasets.</p><p id="P9">Overall, the gene expression profiles were extremely similar for the three samples, with a Pearson correlation coefficient &#x0003e; 0.995 for each pairwise comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Within these expression profiles, AID itself was clearly expressed at the expected level for each dataset. But besides AID, the short list of genes that display &#x0003e; 2 fold-change differences between conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) was composed of elements predominantly annotated as pseudogenes in other references, or elements with RNA-Seq coverage characteristic of mismapped reads derived from paralogous transcripts. In addition, few transcripts that displayed a &#x0003e; 2 fold difference did so for more than one of the binary comparisons, suggesting that these apparent differences were the result of noise rather than authentic AID-dependent effects. These findings are concordant with those from a lower-depth RNA-Seq comparison of <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and wild-type under slightly different conditions (36 nt paired-end sequencing, and IL-4 plus anti-CD-40 stimulation) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We also used the RNA-Seq data to estimate the abundance of different transcript isoforms. Expression analysis at the isoform level shows a high degree of similarity between <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, wild-type and AID&#x02013;miR-155T samples, with the exception of Ig transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d,e</xref>). Again, a high degree of similarity was also found in the lower-depth RNA-Seq runs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref>). While these results do not exclude the possibility of AID-dependent changes in gene expression in B cells, they demonstrate that if such changes exist outside the <italic>Igh</italic> locus, they are likely too small to be physiologically relevant.</p><p id="P11">The notable exception to this trend was transcripts derived from the <italic>Igh</italic> locus. By including a manually curated annotation for the <italic>Igh</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), we were able to estimate relative frequencies of CSR by comparing the abundance of J<sub>H</sub>-C spliced transcripts between samples for each Ig isotype. As expected, nearly all J<sub>H</sub>-C spliced transcripts for the <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> sample were IgM or IgD, while the wild-type and AID&#x02013;miR-155T samples both displayed appreciable amounts of IgE, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG3-derived transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1c</xref>). Furthermore, apparent CSR frequencies were higher for AID&#x02013;miR-155T than for wild-type for each secondary isotype, consistent with previous reports<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">To determine how CSR frequencies quantified by RNA-Seq analysis compare to standard measurements, we compared the fraction of IgG1<sup>+</sup> cells as determined by flow cytometry and the abundance of J<sub>H</sub>-C<sub>&#x003b3;1</sub> transcripts as a fraction of all J<sub>H</sub>-C transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3g</xref>). A clear linear relationship was observed, albeit with slope not equal to 1, which likely represents differing per-cell levels and/or sequencing efficiencies of different isotype transcripts. Determining these correction factors for each isotype should allow RNA-Seq to be used as quantitative tool for assaying absolute frequencies of CSR.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>AID has no effect on V<sub>H</sub> segment usage</title><p id="P13">AID deficiency has been associated with autoimmune disease and a skewed usage pattern of V<sub>H</sub> segments in both humans<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> and mice<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. We sought to determine whether the influence of AID on V<sub>H</sub> gene usage is apparent in our RNA-Seq data sets. Because our data was derived from na&#x000ef;ve B cells non-specifically stimulated to undergo CSR <italic>ex vivo</italic>, any differences in V<sub>H</sub> gene usage between samples ought to mirror the <italic>in vivo</italic> repertoire prior to affinity maturation.</p><p id="P14">We used our RNA-Seq data to derive FPKM values for the entire set of V<sub>H</sub> segments; these provided a measure of relative segment usage between samples. This transcript abundance analysis revealed only minor differences in V<sub>H</sub> transcript abundance between <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, wild-type and AID&#x02013;miR-155T samples. Importantly, none of these exhibited a clear relationship with AID expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), strongly suggesting that the pattern of V<sub>H</sub> usage was unaffected by AID. This result is in contrast to the pattern of V<sub>H</sub> usage in newly emigrant B cells in AID-deficient humans<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>, suggesting that the influence of AID over V<sub>H</sub> usage occurs after establishment of the primary repertoire and probably reflects the dynamics between AID-mediated affinity maturation and B cell survival, rather than a role in early B cell development.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>AID-dependent RNA editing is not detectable</title><p id="P15">We have previously demonstrated the utility of paired wild-type and specific deaminase-deficient comparative RNA-Seq for identifying RNA editing events<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Because AID has long been hypothesized to act on RNA<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, we applied a similar analysis workflow to our B cell RNA-Seq data. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were considered candidate editing sites if they had greater than 30&#x000d7; read coverage with at least 20% apparent C-to-T editing, were a minimum distance from a non-C-to-T SNV (1 kb if using reference, 10 kb if not), were not significantly strand-biased, were not located in regions that were not isogenic between the mice used, and did not occur in the <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> sample. Parallel analyses were performed for positions within reference exons (to achieve the lowest possible background) and for all positions (to include positions in transcripts not found in the reference annotation).</p><p id="P16">To estimate the fraction of the transcriptome covered by this technique, the amount of coverage by base was computed for ERCC spikes with various FPKM values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). More than 90% of bases of the transcripts with FPKM &#x02265; 10 had at least 30&#x000d7; coverage, while those with FPKM = 8 had about 60% of bases with sufficient depth to be interrogated for editing by our strategy. For the B cell RNA-Seq datasets, the top ~6600 transcripts have FPKM &#x02265; 10 and are thus well covered by the RNA editing analysis. Additionally, the editing event in the exogenous &#x0201c;pre-edited&#x0201d; VSG RNA with FPKM = 23 was detected, but that with FPKM = 7 was not. Thus this analysis strategy is appropriate for identifying editing events in moderately to highly expressed transcripts.</p><p id="P17">To verify that this strategy can effectively identify RNA editing events, the pipeline was applied to sets of RNA-Seq data from macrophages lacking the <italic>bona fide</italic> RNA editor <italic>Apobec1</italic> and a paired wild-type control (Hamilton <italic>et al</italic>., manuscript in preparation). Many unique C-to-T events were found in the wild-type sample that were absent in the <italic>Apobec1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). When the reciprocal comparison was made, very few appropriate SNVs occurred in the <italic>Apobec1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> sample that were absent in the wild-type. The small number of such events, which are likely due to mismapping or genomic differences between the mice from which the cells were derived, demonstrates the low background of the technique. The ratio of unique editing events in the deaminase-negative sample to those in the deaminase-positive sample yields an implied false positive rate (IFPR) for identification of the candidate editing events.</p><p id="P18">Application of the editing site identification pipeline to the B cell RNA-Seq data revealed very few candidate editing sites in the AID&#x02013;miR-155T and wild-type samples that were absent in the <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Approximately equal numbers of candidate sites were found in the reciprocal comparison, resulting in IFPRs of &#x0003e; 75% for each condition. In contrast, the IFPR for Apobec1-dependent editing in macrophages was 7&#x02013;8%. RNA-Seq mapping data for the few candidate AID-dependent editing events were visually inspected, and in each case these events were adjudged to be false positives because of one of the following criteria: near-threshold distance from non-C-to-T SNVs, C-to-T mismatches also occurring in the <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> sample, or complete absence of apparent editing in the AID&#x02013;miR-155T sample. Thus, while we can clearly detect Apobec1-catalyzed mRNA editing using this method, we failed to detect AID-dependent editing of moderately or highly expressed polyadenylated RNAs.</p><p id="P19">AID has also been implicated in the mutation of miRNA genes<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> as well as the editing of miRNAs themselves<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. We therefore sought to characterize the effects of AID deficiency on the miRNAome. Small RNA-Seq was performed on samples from <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> na&#x000ef;ve B cells stimulated in culture and retrovirally transduced to overexpress AID and GFP or GFP alone for 24 or 48 h. For both time points, miRNA abundance was well correlated between the samples (Pearson correlation coefficient &#x0003e; 0.95) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Thus AID appears to have no effect on mature miRNA abundance.</p><p id="P20">To determine whether AID acts as an editor of miRNAs, we employed an RNA editing detection strategy similar to that used for mRNAs. Briefly, positions with at least 10% mismatches and at least 10&#x000d7; depth were identified and classified by type of base change. C-to-T changes were among the least common base alterations observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). For each base change type, including C-to-T, the frequency observed was approximately the same for each sample. These likely represent sequencing error, mismapping, or other types of RNA editing that do not depend on AID. For instance, A-to-G alterations constitute the most common change observed for all samples, and are possibly the results of ADAR-catalyzed editing<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">To look more specifically at potential AID-dependent editing, unique mismatched sites were analyzed. These were defined as events that did not occur in the corresponding sample at the same time point while using a lower depth threshold. Again, C-to-T sites were among the least frequent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Only one C-to-T site for each of the AID-overexpressing samples fulfilled these criteria. These sites do not appear to be authentic RNA editing as they have insufficient depth in the GFP-overexpressing sample to compare, and they occur at nearly 100%, suggesting a genomic SNV or mismapping. Thus, if AID-catalyzed editing of miRNAs occurs, it does so at a rate that is well below the background of the sequencing protocol, and is therefore unlikely to be physiologically significant.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>AID-dependent DNA methylation changes are undetectable by RRBS</title><p id="P22">Given the numerous results suggesting a role for AID in DNA demethylation, we sought to look for differences in the methylomes of <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, wild-type and AID&#x02013;miR-155T B cells. To obtain genome-scale methylation data while minimizing the level of uninformative sequencing, we used reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS)<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. By performing an MspI digest and size selection before library preparation and bisulfite conversion, RRBS allows sequencing coverage to be focused on the CpG-rich, genic portion of the genome. Our coverage data reflects this enrichment (64% of promoters and 85% of CpG islands with &#x02265; 100 individual CpG measurements), despite low overall genomic coverage (2% of 1 kb windows with &#x02265; 100 individual CpG measurements) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Overall, nearly 950,000 CpGs had at least 10&#x000d7; coverage in all 3 samples and were used for further analysis.</p><p id="P23">To determine whether AID has a gross effect on the B cell DNA methylome, the distribution of methylation frequency for various genomic features was compared for the three AID genotypes. For each genomic feature type analyzed (1 kb windows, individual CpGs, CpG islands and promoters), there was no apparent difference in DNA methylation distributions associated with AID expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The mean methylation frequency for each set of features was highly similar for each genotype. For each feature type, the expected bimodal distribution of methylation was observed, with proportionally more 1 kb windows near-fully methylated than the other feature types.</p><p id="P24">To assess more subtle differences in DNA methylation by AID expression, methylation frequencies of individual features for each pair of samples were compared. For each feature set analyzed, methylation frequencies between samples were very strongly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a&#x02013;d</xref>). For 1 kb windows, a Pearson <italic>r</italic> = 0.997&#x02013;0.998 was observed for each pair; in comparison, the maximum reported <italic>r</italic> for methylation values of 1 kb windows for biological replicates of cells in the hematopoietic lineage is 0.997 (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">ref.<sup>44</sup></xref>).</p><p id="P25">The high degree of correlation of methylation values did not exclude the possibility that sampling noise could mask small numbers of true AID-dependent changes in methylation. To determine if this was the case, we sought to independently verify the largest apparent AID-dependent decreases in DNA methylation identified by RRBS. To this end, we used the Sequenom Epityper system to assay regions with &#x0003e; 20% methylation in the <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> sample than in the wild-type as measured by RRBS, along with randomly selected regions with &#x0003c; 10% difference in methylation between samples. High quality data for all 3 samples was obtained for 8 apparently AID-dependent hypermethylated CpGs and 18 similarly methylated CpGs that were also well covered by RRBS.</p><p id="P26">For the candidate differentially methylated CpGs, the methylation frequencies for the <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> sample as determined by RRBS were generally much higher than as determined by Epityper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). In contrast, these methods gave similar values for the wild-type and AID&#x02013;miR-155T samples. The fact that the apparent AID-dependent hypermethylated CpGs fail to validate and yield uniformly lower methylation values when assayed by an independent technique strongly suggests that the RRBS-derived values for these CpGs represent overestimates of the true population mean methylation frequency, due to noise or an artifact of the method. Additionally, the set of CpGs with similar methylation values between samples by RRBS displayed excellent agreement in methylation frequencies as determined by the two methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>), demonstrating that RRBS as performed here yields accurate methylation values for well-covered CpGs. Taken together, these results suggest that the most extremely hypermethylated CpGs in the <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> sample were not a result of an authentic AID-dependent process.</p><p id="P27">Finally, in an attempt to locate any subtle but biologically meaningful AID-dependent changes in DNA methylation, the fold-changes in gene expression by RNASeq were compared to the changes in promoter methylation for each pair of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5e,f</xref>). Each pairwise comparison between genotypes showed that these variables were uncorrelated (|<italic>r</italic>| &#x0003c; 0.03 in all cases), suggesting that the observed modest differences in DNA methylation were not associated with changes in gene expression and therefore were unlikely to be physiologically relevant. As a whole, these results demonstrate that no candidate for consistent AID-dependent loss of methylation in B cells can be identified by RRBS.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S6"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">Numerous studies have proposed roles for AID in RNA editing and DNA demethylation. Here we sought to examine these hypotheses in activated B cells by using genome-wide methods to comprehensively characterize the effects of AID on the transcriptome and methylome. Toward this goal, we have performed mRNA-Seq, miRNA-Seq and RRBS on material from <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, wild-type and AID-overexpressing cells. The resulting data allowed for RNA expression analyses at the gene-, isoform-, and miRNA-levels, detection of RNA editing via a validated pipeline, and determination of quantitative methylation values for nearly 1 million CpGs.</p><p id="P29">The capacity of AID to edit RNA <italic>in vivo</italic> has remained an open question for over a decade<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The advent of high-throughput RNA sequencing has made possible the comprehensive characterization of enzyme-specific RNA editing<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>, finally allowing this issue to be resolved. We employed a bioinformatic pipeline that can successfully identify APOBEC1-dependent RNA editing to query the transcriptome of B cells for AID-dependent RNA editing. Within moderately to well-expressed transcripts, and with a lower limit of detection of 20% editing frequency, we were not able to detect AID-dependent editing. Assuming that low efficiency editing of poorly expressed transcripts is unlikely to be a crucial determinant of a mechanism as efficient as CSR or SHM, our data imply that AID is unlikely to exert its functions in antibody diversity through RNA editing.</p><p id="P30">Our comparative RNA-Seq data also allowed for analysis of the population-level transcriptional consequences of AID activity. One notable aspect of our findings was the lack of AID-dependent changes in gene expression, despite the known ability of AID to catalyze hypermutation<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and translocations<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> at loci throughout the genome in B cells, especially when over-expressed. While certain varieties of AID-dependent DNA damage clearly have severe effects on B cell function<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, the lack of AID-dependent differences in gene expression or DNA methylation that we have observed suggests that such biologically meaningful off-target AID activity at a given locus is rare in absolute terms. Therefore, while AID can act at many places in the genome, at the population level its only observable activities at the transcriptional level are at the Ig loci. We note that none of the analyses presented here are direct measurements of the frequency of off-target AID activity or AID occupancy in the genome <italic>per se</italic>; while measurements of SHM and translocation frequency are theoretically possible from mRNA-Seq data, they are below the limit of detection for the depth of sequencing presented here.</p><p id="P31">Finally, AID has been proposed to act in DNA demethylation in a variety of systems<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Despite previous data showing AID occupancy throughout the genome<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and DNA demethylation concurrent with B cell activation<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>, we observed no AID-dependent demethylation events in activated B cells. There are a number of possible explanations for this discrepancy. It is possible that AID does not catalyze DNA demethylation at all in B cells because cofactors required for AID-dependent DNA demethylation are not present in B cells, or that B cells possess some other factor that prevents deleterious demethylation in the presence of AID. Alternatively, AID-dependent demethylation in B cells could be obscured by rapid re-methylation, for example by DNMT1. It is also possible that the lack of a dramatic DNA methylation phenotype in AID-deficient mammals as compared to <italic>D. rerio</italic><sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> could be related to differing deamination efficiencies on 5mC among these species<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. Regardless, if AID can act as a DNA demethylase, it does so below the limits of detection of our analyses, in an extremely targeted manner at loci not covered by RRBS, or in a cell type-specific manner (and not in <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulated murine B cells). Overall, the lack of AID-dependent differences in all of our analyses, excepting the case of Ig isotype usage, strongly suggests that the sole function of AID in B cells is its well-characterized role in the initiation of CSR and SHM.</p><p id="P32">In addition to confirming a narrow role for AID action in B cells, the analyses presented here also demonstrate the broad capabilities of high throughput RNA sequencing for the study of B cell biology. In addition to its standard usage as a gene expression assay, its utility in detecting RNA editing, CSR frequency and V<sub>H</sub> segment usage demonstrate its flexibility as a tool for characterizing populations of B cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Mice and cell culture</title><p id="P33">Mice used for 100-nt mRNA-Seq, RRBS, and small RNA-Seq were 9-week-old males, and those used for 36-nt mRNA-Seq were 6-week-old females. <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;1</sup> and AID&#x02013;miR-155T<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> mice have been previously described.
