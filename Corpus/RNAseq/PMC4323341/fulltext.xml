AECs in monolayer culture and differentiated epithelial cells in air-liquid interface (ALI) represent two distinct and commonly used <italic>in vitro</italic> models, yet differences in their response to pathogens have not been investigated. In this study, we compared the transcriptional effects of flagellin on AECs in monolayer culture versus ALI culture using whole-genome microarrays and RNA sequencing. We exposed monolayer and ALI AEC cultures to flagellin <italic>in vitro</italic> and analyzed the transcriptional response by microarray and RNA-sequencing. ELISA and RT-PCR were used to validate changes in select candidates. We found that AECs cultured in monolayer and ALI have strikingly different transcriptional states at baseline. When challenged with flagellin, monolayer AEC cultures greatly increased transcription of numerous genes mapping to wounding response, immunity and inflammatory response. In contrast, AECs in ALI culture had an unexpectedly muted response to flagellin, both in number of genes expressed and relative enrichment of inflammatory and immune pathways. We conclude that <italic>in vitro</italic> culturing methods have a dramatic effect on the transcriptional profile of AECs at baseline and after stimulation with flagellin. These differences suggest that epithelial responses to pathogen challenges are distinctly different in culture models of intact and injured epithelium.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>National Institutes of Health, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute grants HL091246 (JC) and HL088201 (JC).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All microarray and RNA-seq data have been deposited at GEO (GSE55460).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All microarray and RNA-seq data have been deposited at GEO (GSE55460).</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The paradigm of the lung epithelium as a physical barrier to injurious substances and infectious agents has evolved with the recognition that airway epithelial cells (AECs) are important modulators of the host&#x02019;s acute inflammatory and immune response to pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Moreover, AECs are not just targets of lung injury but also contribute to repair processes by proliferating, restoring intact cell barriers and facilitating extracellular matrix remodeling [<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Evidence for the pleotropic role of human epithelial cells in lung defense, immune and inflammatory processes and responses to lung injury has been based, in large part, from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, including cell lines and primary lung epithelial cell cultures in both submerged monolayer and air liquid interface (ALI) systems [<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Murine models, especially those involving genetically modified mice, have supported biological inferences derived from studies of AECs in culture [<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

Nevertheless, previous reports using microarray analysis indicated that AEC gene expression profiles representing numerous biological processes undergo extensive changes during differentiation in ALI culture [<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>These studies support the fidelity of ALI culture of human AEC as a reasonable <italic>in vitro</italic> model of intact epithelium.

The plasticity of epithelial cells raises the question of how AECs cultured under different <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions respond to external challenges such as pathogens.</p><p>Flagellin is the primary component of flagella [<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and is recognized by and activates several pathogen recognition receptors, including TLR5 and TLR2 [<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the lungs of mice, flagellin can induce neutrophils accumulation, an effect that is dependent on TLR5 expression by lung structural cells rather than bone marrow derived cells [<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Moreover, flagellin stimulates protective immunity to <italic>P. aerugenosa</italic> in a lethal murine model of pneumonia [<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A direct stimulatory effect of flagellin on lung epithelial cells is supported by <italic>in vitro</italic> expression of AEC proteins such as cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases [<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, flagellin may induce a broad range of responses in airway epithelial cells and serves as a prototypical external challenge to lung defense and homeostasis.</p><p>In this study, we examined the transcriptional state of two widely used human AEC models&#x02014;submerged monolayer and ALI cultures&#x02014;with the assumption that these <italic>in vitro</italic> systems represent the spectrum of AEC cell phenotypes present in injured and intact lung.

We identified 16,369 unique genes across all samples using RNA-seq, with gene counts ranging from 1 count/million to 520,967 counts/million&#x02014;a dynamic range &#x0003e; 5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup>. In comparison, the dynamic range of microarrays (based on normalized transcript intensity across samples) was less than 10<sup>4</sup>. Consistent with these observations, the maximum fold-change in gene expression between unstimulated and flagellin-exposed samples was ~400-fold (for NOS2 in monolayer) using RNA-seq, but even though NOS2 was also identified as the most up-regulated gene in the microarray experiments, it was substantially less changed (~15-fold). To confirm these findings, we compared differential expression of multiple candidates using qPCR (<xref rid="pone.0115486.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). We observed that NOS2 expression in monolayer cultures was up-regulated ~1000-fold in response to flagellin based on qPCR, more closely matching the RNA-seq results. Similar expression patterns were seen for the other candidates (e.g., CCL2, DEFB4), with RNA-seq and qPCR reporting the largest fold-changes (<xref rid="pone.0115486.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Although only a limited number of genes were differentially expressed in ALI cultures exposed to flagellin, we validated two of the most significantly up-regulated genes in the ALI system&#x02014;CCL20 and ICAM1&#x02014;using qPCR (<xref rid="pone.0115486.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). We observed that even for these genes, exposure to flagellin induced a higher transcriptional response in monolayer AECs compared to ALI cultures, and that RNA-seq was more sensitive than microarrays in capturing the fidelity of gene expression.

Here we show markedly different transcriptional states between two commonly used <italic>in vitro</italic> models of AECs: monolayer and ALI cultures. We also report widespread differences between the transcriptional responses of these culture systems to flagellin, suggesting that they model fundamentally different aspects of lung epithelial cell biology.</p><p>The dramatically altered AEC transcriptome between unstimulated monolayer and ALI cultures was highly enriched in processes mapping to various developmental programs. This observation makes sense given the profound morphological differences observed between confluent monolayer epithelial cells and those differentiating under an air-liquid interface. Our results are also consistent with previous studies reporting large transcriptional differences between monolayers of airway-derived cells and differentiated airway epithelial cells in ALI culture based on microarray analysis [<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], however, our study further extends this observation using RNA-seq. Accordingly, AECs in monolayer cultures may recapitulate an epithelium undergoing repair, whereas AECs in mature ALI cultures represent an intact airway epithelium [<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of recognizing the significant consequences of culture methodology on baseline epithelial gene expression.</p><p>The strikingly different response between the two culture systems when exposed to flagellin has important implications for <italic>in vitro</italic> modeling of airway injury and repair. Notably, AECs in monolayer responded to this bacterial product with increases in a wide range of gene transcripts involved in immunity, wound repair, and inflammation. In contrast, cells in ALI culture had a decidedly muted response both in number of genes with increased transcriptional activity, the magnitude of these changes, and the relative enrichment of functional pathways. Thus, in the presence of an intact epithelial barrier (as modeled by ALI), exposure to a bacterial product results in a tempered response from AECs. Such a measured effect may serve to regulate the activation of excessive pro-inflammatory programs. However, AEC response to bacterial products in the setting of lung injury or disease states might not be restrained to the same degree. This primed state of the lung epithelium may contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary disorders characterized by epithelial injury such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, acute lung injury, post-viral bacterial pneumonia, and cystic fibrosis.</p><p>The AEC culture models used in this study are operationally defined according to widely used methods reported in the literature. Although variations of culture methods might influence gene expression, the profound differences that we report are likely to be generalizable. However, it is important to note that <italic>in vitro</italic> culture systems do not fully capture the <italic>in vivo</italic> state of AECs at baseline or following injury. We recently reported that microRNA profiles are significantly different between AECs cultured in ALI and primary epithelial cells harvested <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we had the opportunity to compare the robustness of whole-genome microarrays and RNA-seq in interrogating the transcriptional state of AECs under tightly controlled conditions. We found that consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], RNA-seq possessed higher sensitivity and fidelity in measuring changes in gene expression, but we also observed that there was substantial overlap between both approaches in identifying similar enriched biological processes populated by differentially expressed genes.</p><p>While our transcriptional analyses provide a relatively comprehensive overview of epithelial cell biology, there are important limitations in our approach. All the cultured AEC samples were derived from a single donor, therefore we didn&#x02019;t capture inter-individual variability in gene expression. Other investigators have used this approach to study the transcriptional profile of AECs [<xref rid="pone.0115486.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Furthermore, this design is similar to the common usage of human cell culture lines that have been originally harvested from single individuals. In our case, this experimental design allowed us to directly compare the technical performance of microarray and RNA-seq-based profiling of the AEC transcriptome. The number experimental replicates (n = 2&#x02013;3) was low, but we applied statistical methods specifically designed for limited replicates, and observed very significant changes in gene expression despite this limitation. It is well recognized that transcriptional activity does not equate biological effects due to post-transcriptional modifications of gene products. We only investigated the transcriptional consequences of flagellin on monolayer and ALI cultures; other pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules may elicit different responses. Although we observed significant differences in transcriptional activity between monolayer and ALI AECs after 4 hours of exposure to flagellin, we did not assess changes in gene expression at additional time points between the two culture methods. While hypothesis generating, our analyses do not delineate mechanisms regulating the observed transcriptional differences. Future studies are needed to define these mechanisms that will likely involve multiple molecular pathways. However, our microarray and RNA-seq data have been made publicly available as a resource for further analysis of epithelial cell biology and its response to injury and pathogens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Collectively, our findings imply that different <italic>in vitro</italic> culture systems modeling <italic>in vivo</italic> AEC biology are characterized by significant differences in baseline gene expression and transcriptional responses to flagellin.
