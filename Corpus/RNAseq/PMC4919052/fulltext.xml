Sixteen cows were inoculated with live <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> into one mammary quarter at ~4&#x02013;6 weeks in lactation. For all cows, biopsies were performed at -144, 12 and 24 h relative to IMI in liver and at 24 h post-IMI in infected and non-infected (control) mammary quarters. For a subset of cows (n = 6), RNA was extracted from both liver and mammary tissue and sequenced using a 100 bp paired-end approach. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and the Dynamic Impact Approach analysis of differentially expressed genes (overall effect False Discovery Rate&#x02264;0.05) indicated that IMI induced an overall activation of inflammation at 12 h post-IMI and a strong inhibition of metabolism, especially related to lipid, glucose, and xenobiotics at 24 h post-IMI in liver. The data indicated in mammary tissue an overall induction of inflammatory response with little effect on metabolism at 24 h post-IMI. We identified a large number of up-stream regulators potentially involved in the response to IMI in both tissues but a relatively small core network of transcription factors controlling the response to IMI for liver whereas a large network in mammary tissue. Transcriptomic results in liver and mammary tissue were supported by changes in inflammatory and metabolic mediators in blood and milk. The analysis of potential cross-talk between the two tissues during IMI uncovered a large communication from the mammary tissue to the liver to coordinate the inflammatory response but a relatively small communication from the liver to the mammary tissue. Our results indicate a strong induction of the inflammatory response in mammary tissue and impairment of liver metabolism 24h post-IMI partly driven by the signaling from infected mammary tissue.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>GenSAP</institution></funding-source><award-id>12-132452</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOOD-CT-2006-016250</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries</institution></funding-source><award-id>BIOSENS</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Lattec I/S</institution></funding-source><award-id>BIOSENS</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Danish Cattle Association</institution></funding-source><award-id>BIOSENS</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, Aarhus University</institution></funding-source><award-id>BIOSENS</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The study was partly funded by the EU programme &#x02018;Sustainable Animal Breeding&#x02019; (SABRE), Work Package (WP) 5, Mammary gland function and by the BIOSENS project granted by the Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries (Innovations Law), Lattec I/S, the Danish Cattle Association, and Aarhus University (AU).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="12"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="28"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=czgzgcwwfxwjtub&#x00026;acc=GSE75">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=czgzgcwwfxwjtub&#x00026;acc=GSE75</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=czgzgcwwfxwjtub&#x00026;acc=GSE75">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=czgzgcwwfxwjtub&#x00026;acc=GSE75</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>During early lactation (i.e. the first 60 days of lactation), the massive repartition of nutrients to the mammary gland for milk synthesis has been identified as a major contributor to the high risk of developing diseases [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This repartition of energy toward the mammary gland is not compensated via feed intake, that is also reaching a nadir during early lactation [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The requirement of energy and nutrients increases ~5-fold from pregnancy to lactation in high producing dairy cows mainly due to the large amount of milk synthesized by the mammary gland [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In order to meet the nutrient demands in early lactation, most cows mobilize body tissue, e.g. skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, and thereby experience a period of negative energy balance, as reflected by the degree of increase in circulating non-esterified fatty acids (<bold>NEFA</bold>), ketone bodies (&#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate; <bold>BHBA</bold>) and decrease in blood glucose [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As a result, production diseases, such as ketosis and hepatic lipidosis, occur most often at this time [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and are associated with negative impacts on animal health and reduced economic outcome to the farmer.</p><p>The liver plays a central role in the metabolic and inflammatory physiology of the dairy cow. Dairy cows, being ruminants, have a negligible amount of glucose absorbed from the intestine [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; therefore, the large amount of glucose needed to synthesize milk lactose is coming largely from the hepatic gluconeogenesis. Especially in early lactation, the liver is naturally compromised via increased gluconeogenesis and the catabolism of infiltrating NEFA. Besides its vital role in metabolism, the liver participates to the immune response by synthesizing and secreting into the bloodstream inflammatory mediators (i.e. acute phase proteins) [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Acute phase proteins are non-specific innate immune components involved in restoring homeostasis and providing host protection from invading microorganisms and inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Few studies have focused on the metabolic changes that occur in the liver after an IMI. Recent work has demonstrated a large transcriptomic response of the bovine liver after intramammary infection (<bold>IMI</bold>) challenge with <bold>lipopolysaccharides (LPS</bold>), an endotoxin released from the cell wall of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<bold><italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic></bold>) [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Results indicated an increase in the hepatic expression of transcripts coding for proteins involved in acute phase reaction (and other inflammatory related proteins) and a consequent/concomitant reduction in the expression of transcripts coding for key metabolic enzymes, including the ones involved in gluconeogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, during inflammatory states such as mastitis, the immunometabolic demands may compromise liver function and increase risk of disease.</p><p>The cross-talk between different tissues is emerging as an important regulatory factor during health and disease. This has been observed in monogastrics [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Mastitis, an inflammation of the mammary gland, is the most costly disease in the dairy industry and occurs more frequently during early lactation [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Mastitis is characterized by an increase in milk somatic cell count (<bold>SCC</bold>) and may be accompanied by the presence of an intramammary pathogen [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], such as <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic>, one of the most common and costly mastitis-causing pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The mammary tissue is highly dependent on a highly functional liver and, therefore, it appears reasonable that a direct cross-talk between the mammary gland and the liver exists to coordinate the nutrient demands for lactation and to elicit the immune response to mastitis.</p><p>Our objective was to characterize the individual response and the cross-talk between liver and mammary tissue in response to IMI with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> using RNAseq technology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Experimental procedures involving animals were approved by the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate and complied with the Danish Ministry of Justice Laws concerning animal experimentation and care of experimental animals.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals, Experimental Design and Sample Collection</title><p>The animal trial was conducted at the Aarhus University&#x02019;s dairy barn, Ammitsb&#x000f8;l Skovgaard (Denmark). Sixteen healthy primiparous Holstein cows at ~4&#x02013;6 weeks in lactation were used for this study. The experimental design has been illustrated previously [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Cows were not treated for any clinical signs of disease before the study period. Details on animal housing, total mixed ration fed, treatment, preparation and inoculation of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and clinical examinations have been previously described [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Briefly, cows were considered healthy and free of mastitis-causing pathogens based on body temperature, white blood cell count, glutaraldehyde test, California Mastitis Test (Kruuse, Marslev, Denmark) and bacteriological examinations of aseptic quarter foremilk samples prior to the start of the study period. Using the portable DeLaval Cell Counter (DeLaval, Tumba, Sweden), the front quarter with the lowest SCC (&#x0003c;27,000 cells/mL) was used for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> infusion. All eligible cows were inoculated with ~20&#x02013;40 cfu of live <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (Danish field isolate k2bh2) into one front mammary quarter immediately following the afternoon milking (h = 0). Healthy, control quarters were chosen based upon bacteriological examinations where quarter SCC were &#x0003c;181,000 cells/mL at 24 h post-IMI. Daily feed intake and milk yield at each milking were recorded. Rectal temperature was recorded periodically and composite milk samples were collected at -180, -132, -84, -36, -12 h, 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 and 84 h relative to IMI challenge from infected quarters for analysis of lactate dehydrogenase (<bold>LDH</bold>), alkaline phosphatase (<bold>AP</bold>) and N-acetyl-&#x003b2;-D-glucosaminidase (<bold>NAGase</bold>) following procedures reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Aseptic quarter foremilk samples were collected at -12, 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 48, 60 and 84 h relative to IMI challenge from infected quarters. One day prior to IMI challenge, sterile Micro-Renathane polyvinyl catheters were inserted into the jugular vein and flushed with a sterile 0.9% NaCl solution containing 50 IU Na-heparin as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Blood was collected at -12, 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 60 and 84 h relative to IMI challenge and plasma was analyzed for concentrations of glucose, NEFA, BHBA and cholesterol using an autoanalyzer, ADVIA 1650<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Chemistry System (Siemens Medical Solution, Tarrytown, NY, USA) as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Liver biopsies were collected from all cows at -144, 12 and 24 h relative to IMI challenge were analyzed for gene expression as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; and, using a minimally invasive biopsy technique, mammary tissue was collected at 24 relative to IMI challenge from both infected and control quarters for gene expression analysis as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Combined biopsy had no effect on the production and inflammatory mediators presented for this study [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. After the mammary biopsies had been collected, cows were administered a prophylactic antibiotic treatment against infection with Gram-positive bacteria by intramuscular injection of 30 mL of Penovet<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> vet (300,000 IE benzylpenicillinprocain/ml; Boehringer Ingelheim Danmark A/S,Copenhagen, Denmark). No other antibiotic therapy was administered after IMI challenge.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>RNAseq Analysis</title><p>For a subset of liver and mammary tissue samples (n = 6 cows for both liver and mammary tissue), RNA extraction was performed as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. RNA was extracted from the liver of 6 cows at 3 different time points (i.e. -144, 12 and 24 h relative to IMI challenge; 3 x 6 = 18 liver RNA samples in total) and for the mammary tissue from the infected and control quarters of the same 6 cows (i.e. 2 x 6 = 12 mammary tissue RNA samples in total). Each sample was sequenced using a 100 bp paired approach with the Illumina Hiseq2000 sequencing technology by AROS Applied Biotechnology (Aarhus, Denmark). The standard Illumina TruSeq mRNA protocol was used with minor changes (fragmentation time was 1 minute and the number of PCR cycles was 13). Sequence reads obtained for each sample were aligned separately to the Bovine genome assembly (UMD3.1). Sequence alignment was conducted using an efficient and sensitive mapping paradigm based on seed-and-vote algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] implemented in the Rsubread package in R. The abundance of mRNAs for all genomic features (bovine Ensembl genes) was calculated for each sample. Procedures previously described [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] were used to obtain the annotated bovine Ensembl genes from the annotations available at the UCSC Genome Browser. The total number of bovine Ensembl genes was 24,616. The function &#x02018;Feature Counts&#x02019; in the R package was used to count the number of reads that mapped to each feature using the default settings. The total number of mapped reads for each sample varied from 10,434,369 to 22,098,317.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><sec id="sec006"><title>RNAseq</title><p>Differential expressed genes were identified using edgeR (version 3.4.2; [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). The count data were normalized using the weighted trimmed mean of M-values [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Count data were non-normally distributed thus a generalized linear model (<bold>GLM</bold>) was fitted for each gene. A negative binomial GLM was used allowing for a quadratic mean-variance relationship commonly observed in this type of data. The GLM allows for a design to be modeled and differential expression is determined using a likelihood ratio test. In the GLM model specified the number reads in RNA sample i that map to the gene g is denoted y<sub>gi</sub> and the total number of mapped reads is denoted N<sub>i</sub>. It is assumed that y<sub>gi</sub> &#x0223c; <italic>NB</italic>(&#x003bc;<sub>gi</sub>, <italic>&#x003d5;</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>), where &#x003bc;<sub>gi</sub> is the mean and <italic>&#x003d5;</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> is the dispersion parameters of the negative bionomial distribution. The expected number of reads for a particular gene &#x003bc;<sub>gi</sub> is the product of the relative abundance of that gene &#x003bb;<sub>gi</sub> and the total number of reads N<sub>i</sub> in the i<sup>th</sup> sample. It is assumes that &#x003bb;<sub>gi</sub> can be represented by a log-linear model:

Due to the nature of the sample analyzed the analysis carried out with IPA was restricted to IPA database related to liver as organ system and all Hepatoma cell lines for the data related to liver and IPA dataset related to mammary tissue as organ system and Brest Cancer cell lines and Other cell lines for the data related to mammary tissue. The genes used in the IPA were selected based on the following criteria: In the liver a FDR adjusted p-value below 0.05 for the joint test determining differentially expression at any of the time points, a fold change larger than 1 (or smaller than -1), and a p-value below 0.05 for each of the comparison -144 vs 12, -144 vs 24 and 12 vs 24.

By 12 h (i.e. early inflammatory response), 1,399 DEG were down-regulated and 2,244 were up-regulated whereas the same number of up- and down-regulated (2,388 up- and 2,336 down-regulated) were detected at 24 h post-challenge (i.e. peak inflammatory response) compared to 144 h pre-challenge. For mammary tissue, &#x0003e;2,379 DEG were observed 24 h post-challenge in the IMI compared to the control quarter with, similar to the liver at 12 h, more up-regulated (1,407) compared to down-regulated (972) DEG. Overall, the liver had a larger transcriptomic response to IMI when compared to mammary tissue. However, the mammary gland having a single comparison the use of a FDR cut-off for the overall effect of the treatment has accounted for the false positive while for the liver the false positives were accounted for the overall effect (i.e., time) but we did not corrected for false positive for the specific comparisons (i.e., 12 vs. 144 h, 24 vs. 144 h, and 24 vs. 12 h). The use of FDR &#x02264; 0.05 for the mammary tissue resulted in a <italic>P</italic>-value &#x02264; 0.005 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157480.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). The use of the same <italic>P</italic>-value cut-off for the liver resulted in lower DEG for the comparisons, with the comparison 12 vs. 144 h having 2,555 DEG and the comparison 24 vs. 144 h having 3,323 DEG (approx. 28% less DEG compared with the use of <italic>P</italic>-value &#x02264; 0.05). Thus, the overall transcriptomic effect of IMI was still larger for the liver compared to mammary tissue. Because of the difference in the overall effect considered for the mammary tissue (IMI vs. control) and the liver (time effect), we decided to use a consistent FDR for the overall effect and a <italic>P</italic>-value &#x02264; 0.05 for the various comparisons for the liver, while for the mammary the <italic>P</italic>-value was not used (but only the FDR for the overall effect). The use of a simple <italic>P</italic>-value (i.e. not corrected for multiple comparisons) &#x02264; 0.05 in liver is a liberal approach and can be a limitation when evaluating the functional analysis in enrichment approach analyses, such as the approach used by IPA. However, the <italic>Z</italic>-score for the up-stream regulator analysis in IPA can benefits from a larger number of DEG and the DIA is minimally affected by the <italic>P</italic>-value cut-off and, as for the <italic>Z</italic>-score, the algorithm benefits from a larger number of DEG.

The increase activation of PPAR&#x003b1;, the most abundant PPAR isotypes in liver, during the early response to IMI challenge is somewhat expected due to the anti-inflammatory role of PPAR via increased catabolism of arachidonic acid and modulation of liver acute phase response by transrepression of inflammatory transcription factors [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>The DIA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157480.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157480.s006">S6 Fig</xref>) uncovered as the most impacted and induced pathways at 12 h post-challenge the ones associated with the &#x02018;Immune System&#x02019; as well as metabolic-related pathways.

The summary of the pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157480.g003">Fig 3</xref>) indicated as highly impacted by the IMI also pathways related to signaling.

In addition, &#x02018;Glutathione-mediated Detoxification&#x02019; is a common pathway utilized by the liver for detoxification but requires acetyl-CoA as a substrate and acetyl-CoA availability may have been low due to the inhibition of hepatic fatty acid oxidation/metabolism (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157480.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157480.g003">3</xref>) and carbohydrate metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157480.g003">Fig 3</xref>) during the inflammatory response.</p><p>The DIA analysis confirmed IPA results with metabolic-related pathways being the most strongly impacted and inhibited and small or no effects were detected for immune-related pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157480.g003">Fig 3</xref>).

These results indicate that the overall metabolism in the liver was activated during early inflammation but strongly inhibited and may have been compromised in relatively later stage of inflammation. The data indicated that especially inhibited at 24 h post-IMI was the ability to oxidize fatty acids, synthesize ketone bodies, produce cholesterol, performed gluconeogenesis, and metabolize carbohydrates and amino acids. Coupled with the increase in &#x02018;Fatty acid biosynthesis&#x02019; pathway, it is likely that the liver of the cows at 24 h post-IMI had an increase in triglycerides accumulation. This is consistent with previous observations [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Furthermore, the inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis by inflammation has been observed in lactating dairy cows [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The decrease in BHBA observed in blood is explained by a combination of increased BHBA secretion in milk [<xref rid="pone.0157480.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and a down-regulation of genes associated with hepatic ketogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157480.g002">Fig 2</xref>). An impairment of the hepatic metabolic response during inflammation is further supported by the comparison of hepatic transcriptomic expression between 24 and 12 h post-IMI challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157480.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The DIA results indicated that DEG associated with metabolism such as &#x02018;Carbohydrate Metabolism&#x02019;, &#x02018;Lipid Metabolism&#x02019; and &#x02018;Metabolism of Other Amino Acids&#x02019; were the most inhibited pathways during the inflammatory response.

Results indicate that during the early response of mastitis an increase in both pro-and anti-inflammatory factors may help control inflammation while minimizing damage to liver tissue. In addition, results suggest an increase in the synthesis of acute phase proteins in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;) released primarily from resident macrophages and mammary epithelial cells during mastitis. During peak inflammatory response (i.e. 24 h post-IMI challenge), hepatic tissue shifts from an inflammatory state to a reduction in the liver&#x02019;s ability to metabolize nutrients, especially energy and protein metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Cross-talk Between Liver and Mammary Inferred by the Transcriptomic Analysis</title><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157480.g011">Fig 11</xref> is shown the cross-talk between liver and mammary tissue as inferred by the DEG with an expression &#x02265;2-fold at 24 h post-IMI challenge with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>.

Our data indicated that the liver had strong transcriptomic response at 12 h post-IMI characterized by a large inflammatory-type activity primarily via the acute phase response with minimal changes observed regarding metabolism and clearance. At 24 h post-IMI, the transcriptomic data indicated that the liver substantially decreased the overall metabolism, but in particular lipid metabolism. This impaired metabolic response of liver at the transcription level where a down regulation of DEG associated with hepatic gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis was observed that partly explains changes in metabolites observed in blood. The analysis indicated that the transcriptomic response of the liver was mainly influenced by cytokines and growth factors but with a substantial role of ligand-dependent nuclear receptor (i.e. <italic>PPAR</italic>) at 24 h post-IMI. A relatively small core of such TF appeared to have a strong interaction and had a large weight regulating the hepatic response at 24 h post-IMI (e.g. PPAR isotypes and related co-activators, HNF4A, SREBP isoforms, CEBP [CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha isoform d], and XBP1). Coupling the metabolic response in blood and milk with transcriptomic responses in liver, our results indicate impaired liver metabolism during later stages of inflammation.</p><fig id="pone.0157480.g012" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0157480.g012</object-id><label>Fig 12</label><caption><title>Model summarizing main findings.</title><p>Based on known physiology of the dairy cows we assumed that before intramammary infection (-144) the liver was performing its usual physiological functions, such as clearance/detoxification and producing and releasing in the bloodstream glucose, VLDL, and BHBA through gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism. The compounds released by the liver are taken up by the mammary gland to synthesize milk. Cross-talk between the two organs is plausible. In the early response to intramammary infection (i.e. 12 h), our data indicated a strong inflammatory response of the liver with increased synthesis of positive acute phase proteins (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157480.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) with no effects on metabolism. The data indicated that the acute phase response was mainly driven by STAT3 with PPAR and NR1I3 apparently the more activated and AHR the more inhibited ligand-dependent transcription factors. The effect on the liver is likely derived by the pro-inflammatory cytokines released by the infected mammary quarter during the first phases of IMI. At 24h post-IMI, the cytokines and growth factors released by the mammary tissue during IMI decreased the overall metabolism of the liver, especially acting through a relatively small network of transcription factors related to metabolism. As consequence the liver may have experienced a reduce lipid and glucose metabolism and momentarily impairment of clearance or detoxification. This is also supported by the significant decrease in expression of negative acute phase proteins at this time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157480.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). The data indicated also an induction of liver regeneration, possibly driven by growth factors released by the infected mammary quarter. Our data indicated a very little communication form the liver to the mammary tissue which was still experiencing a large inflammatory response mainly driven by the cytokine- factors NFKB and RELA. It is also possible that observed change in expression of miRNA may have played a role in maintaining the inflammatory status in the mammary tissue. Our analyses revealed substantial cross-talk between the two tissues with a communication almost unidirectional, i.e. mammary to liver, via various cytokines and growth factors altered during inflammation. The mammary tissue appears to have synthesized positive acute phase proteins but did not experience a reduction of negative acute phase proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157480.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). By 24 h post-IMI, milk synthesis decreased in the infected mammary gland, primarily milk fat synthesis. AHR = aryl hydrocarbon receptor; APP = acute phase proteins; BHBA = beta hydroxybutyrate; CEBP = CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha isoform d; HNF4A = hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, alpha; IMI = intramammary infection; NFKB = nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells; NR1I3 = nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group I, member 3; PPAR = peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors; RELA = v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A; SREBP = sterol regulatory element-binding protein; STAT3 = signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; VLDL = very low density lipoproteins.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0157480.g012"/></fig><p>The transcriptome analysis of the mammary tissue at 24 h post-IMI indicated a large immune response of the tissue with very little effect on metabolism, except a likely inhibition of lipid synthesis. Contrary to the liver, the transcriptomic adaptation of the mammary tissue appeared to be driven by a large network of up-stream regulators, with a large sensitivity to cytokines. The inflammatory transcriptomic response of the mammary tissue is supported by the inflammatory response observed in milk where dramatic increase in inflammatory mediators was observed after IMI with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>.</p><p>The analysis of cross-talk uncovered a large communication from the mammary to the liver to coordinate the inflammatory response with very few factors potentially released by the liver to control the response of the mammary tissue during IMI. Our data also indicate that the mammary tissue did not directly influence the decreased metabolism of the liver at 24 h post-IMI but, likely, indirectly impacted hepatic metabolism via stimulation of the hepatic inflammatory response.</p><p>A summary of the most relevant findings in the present experiment are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157480.g012">Fig 12</xref>. In conclusion, our data revealed a different response of the liver and mammary tissue during IMI, with a similar overall inflammatory-like response of the mammary tissue in the quarter treated with IMI vs. the control quarter at 24 h post-treatment and liver at 12 h vs. -144 h post-IMI with also a large increase in expression of positive acute phase proteins related genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157480.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Despite this, the metabolism of the mammary tissue was not significantly affected. As a result, the mammary tissue did not experience the &#x0201c;shutdown&#x0201d; of specific functions, i.e. metabolism and clearance, as observed in the liver, at 24 h post-IMI. The momentarily impairment of metabolism and clearance capability of the liver as consequence of the IMI might be partly explained by the shift in partitioning of nutrients towards the immune response. Due to the pivotal role played by the liver in controlling overall nutritional economy, metabolism, clearance from xenobiotics, and the immune response, our findings of a transcriptionally driven decline of critical functions in the liver provide further evidence of the negative consequence on overall performance of dairy cows affected by mastitis. The IMI response appeared to be highly coordinated by the potential increase in signaling between the two tissues with a strong regulatory role of the mammary tissue toward the liver via signaling molecules. Overall, the data revealed a previously unknown cross-talk between mammary and liver coordinating the response to IMI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157480.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Concentrations of alkaline phosphatase (A), N-acetyl-&#x003b2;-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase; B) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; C) in milk from cows (n = 16) after intramammary challenge during early lactation.</title><p>*Differences (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) when compared to h = 0.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157480.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157480.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Changes in daily feed intake (A) and milk yield (B) from cows (n = 16) after intramammary challenge during early lactation.</title><p>*Differences (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) when compared to h = 0.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157480.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157480.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Plasma concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA; A), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA; B), glucose (C) and cholesterol (D) from cows (n = 16) after intramammary challenge during early lactation.</title><p>*Differences (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) when compared to h = 0.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157480.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157480.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Expression of genes coding for selected pro-inflammatory cytokines and positive and negative acute phase proteins (data as also reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157480.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).</title><p>(JPG)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157480.s004.jpg"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157480.s005"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>Complete dataset with false discovery rate (FDR) for the overall time or treatment effect, expression ratio, and <italic>P</italic>-value between comparisons.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157480.s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157480.s006"><label>S6 Fig</label><caption><title>Dynamic Impact Approach of the KEGG pathways analysis for both liver and mammary tissue.</title><p>Presented are the summary of the categories of pathways, the details of each pathway, and sorted in descending order of impact in each comparison.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157480.s006.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157480.s007"><label>S7 Fig</label><caption><title>Results of the pathway and function analysis of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis for both liver and mammary tissue.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157480.s007.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157480.s008"><label>S8 Fig</label><caption><title>Complete results of the predicted up-stream regulators by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis for both liver and mammary tissue.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157480.s008.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Helle Daugaard Larsen, Danish Meat Research Institute (DMRI), Roskilde, Denmark for the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> bacteria.
