HTT is an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed protein that has been linked to a variety of functions including transcriptional regulation, mitochondrial function, and vesicle transport. This large protein has numerous caspase and calpain cleavage sites and can be decorated with several post-translational modifications such as phosphorylations, acetylations, sumoylations, and palmitoylations. However, the exact function of HTT and the role played by its modifications in the cell are still not well understood. Scrutiny of HTT function has been focused on a single, full length mRNA. In this study, we report the discovery of 5 novel <italic>HTT</italic> mRNA splice isoforms that are expressed in normal and <italic>HTT</italic>-expanded human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines as well as in cortical neurons differentiated from hESCs. Interestingly, none of the novel isoforms generates a truncated protein. Instead, 4 of the 5 new isoforms specifically eliminate domains and modifications to generate smaller HTT proteins. The fifth novel isoform incorporates a previously unreported additional exon, dubbed 41b, which is hominid-specific and introduces a potential phosphorylation site in the protein. The discovery of this hominid-specific isoform may shed light on human-specific pathogenic mechanisms of HTT, which could not be investigated with current mouse models of the disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work is supported by a grant from the Cure Huntington's Disease Initiative (CHDI) Foundation #A-8185 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chdifoundation.org">http://chdifoundation.org</ext-link>).

The human <italic>HTT</italic> genomic locus on chromosome 4 (4p16.3) consists of 67 exons transcribed to an mRNA of 13481 bps (referred hereon as the canonical HTT isoform), encoding a protein of 3144 amino acids (aa), according to public genome annotations. HTT is expressed maternally in the fertilized egg and subsequently in all cells of the adult[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mutations in the <italic>HTT</italic> locus have devastating consequences. Expansion of N-terminal polyQ repeats is sufficient to cause Huntington&#x02019;s disease (HD), a lethal neurodegenerative disorder. In addition, homozygous deletion of <italic>Htt</italic> leads to embryonic lethality in the mouse, demonstrating that Htt function is necessary for early embryonic development.</p><p><italic>Htt</italic><sup><italic>&#x02014;/-</italic></sup> mouse embryos die at E7.5 with severe defects in gastrulation and primitive streak patterning[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], thought to be due to primary effects on the visceral endoderm[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Work utilizing mice to model HD has been hampered by the inability of the mouse model to completely recapitulate human disease phenotypes[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This may be due to the temporal differences between mouse and human or to fundamental differences between the two species. Despite the fact that the <italic>HTT</italic> gene was identified more than 20 years ago and among the first human genes shown to be causal to a disease in a heterozygous background, the exact functions of the HTT protein remain unknown[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Investigation of the roles played in cells by HTT has mostly focused on the protein derived from the canonical mRNA that includes all 67 exons as well as cleavage fragments that occur during disease progression. In addition to the canonical mRNA, some studies have reported three shorter HTT isoforms: an alternatively spliced mRNA that eliminates exons 34 to 44 (originally named isoform B, hereafter referred to as <italic>HTT-&#x00394;34&#x02013;44</italic>) and one isoform that eliminates exon 28 (hereafter referred to as <italic>Htt- &#x00394; 28)</italic> have both been reported in human adult brains[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], while a spliced form of HTT mRNA where intron 1 is not spliced out (called Exon1-Intron1 isoform) has been reported in patients with HD[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This last splice form produces a truncated protein limited to exon1, which has increased toxicity[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. While the functions of these shorter isoforms are currently unknown, they have provided the first hint that the large <italic>HTT</italic> genomic locus can give rise to differentially spliced mRNAs potentially encoding different HTT proteins.</p><p>In order to decipher the function of <italic>HTT</italic> in humans, we began by investigating the presence and diversity of <italic>HTT</italic> transcripts in pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The canonical HTT isoform is expressed in both pluripotent mESCs and hESCs[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this study, we utilize high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to scan the transcriptome of hESCs, both wild-type and HD mutants, to assess the presence of differentially spliced <italic>HTT</italic> mRNA transcripts. We report the discovery of five novel isoforms of <italic>HTT</italic> that can give rise to HTT protein variants lacking specific domains. We also identify, for the first time, a hominid-specific isoform of <italic>HTT</italic>. This splice isoform, due to its conservation only to great apes, could be an important factor in HD pathogenesis and might shed light on differences between mouse models and human phenotypes of HD. Our results identify previously unrecognized <italic>HTT</italic> mRNAs that encode different subtypes of HTT proteins and highlight the importance of studying all isoforms to completely understand HTT physiological and pathological functions.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec003"><title>RNA-seq analysis of normal and HD hESCs identifies new HTT splice variants</title><p>In order to detect <italic>HTT</italic> transcripts, RNA-seq was performed in 3 independent hESCs lines cultured under pluripotency conditions. The lines included RUES2, a female (XX) line originally derived in our laboratory[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (NIHhESC-09-0013), and two hESC lines derived from sibling female (XX) embryos, one wild-type and one containing mutant <italic>HTT</italic> (Genea019 and Genea020, respectively[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). Examination of <italic>HTT</italic> transcripts confirmed the expression of the canonical <italic>HTT</italic> mRNA in all three lines, with enough read coverage to perform isoform analysis (a range of 12,000&#x02013;14,000 100-bp reads mapping the HTT locus&#x02014;<xref rid="pone.0127687.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). RNA-seq demonstrated that RUES2 has a normal CAG repeat length, with one allele harboring 22, and the other one 24 CAGs (22/24). In agreement with previous characterization[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Genea019 displayed normal CAG repeats (15/18), while Genea020 presented an extended CAG tract (17/48) that carries the signature for HD.

The absence of these previously reported <italic>HTT</italic> splice isoforms in either normal or diseased hESC lines suggests that they might represent temporally regulated isoforms that emerge after differentiation. Our RNA-seq approach did reveal the presence of 10 additional putative <italic>HTT</italic> splice variants, each with one or more exons spliced out from the canonical <italic>HTT</italic> isoform, as well as one longer isoform that incorporates a previously unreported exon (<xref rid="pone.0127687.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Most of these new HTT transcripts were found at low levels (&#x0003c;5% reads compared to the canonical HTT isoform), and not always detected in all three samples, suggesting that these putative splice variants of HTT are indeed rare transcripts, potentially explaining why they have not been previously reported (<xref rid="pone.0127687.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). However, the longer variant (incorporating a new exon between exons 41 and 42) was consistently found to be relatively prevalent &#x02013;about 7&#x02013;13% of the major <italic>HTT</italic> isoform- among all samples analyzed.</p><fig id="pone.0127687.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0127687.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>RNA-seq analysis reveals novel isoforms of <italic>HTT</italic>.</title><p>Using Tuxedo software, 10 putative <italic>HTT</italic> splice isoforms were detected in RNA-seq data.

This analysis confirmed the presence of 5 of the 10 novel HTT transcripts detected by RNA-seq (<xref rid="pone.0127687.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> and see below). The lack of detection of the other five might be due to artifacts from RNA-seq or to their very low abundance. We therefore focused on the 5 transcripts that were validated by PCR. Of these, 4 lacked an exon, either completely or partially: <italic>HTT-&#x00394;10</italic>, <italic>HTT-&#x00394;12</italic>, <italic>HTT-&#x00394;13</italic> and <italic>HTT-&#x00394;46</italic>, while the fifth, longer isoform incorporated the new exon: <italic>HTT-41b</italic>. Interestingly, these 5 novel <italic>HTT</italic> transcripts had two common attributes. First, they were all detected in both normal and HD hESC lines (<xref rid="pone.0127687.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> and see below). To confirm that they were present in more than one HD line, we also examined the expression of the four shorter isoforms in two other, unrelated HD lines: a male (XY) Genea017 (12/40) and female (XX) Genea018 (17/46) (<xref rid="pone.0127687.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). All isoforms were expressed with no significant differences in expression levels between cell lines when assessed by qPCR (<xref rid="pone.0127687.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). The second attribute is that none of the splice isoforms is predicted to disrupt the HTT open reading frame (ORF), but they are instead predicted to encode proteins where specific internal domains are deleted or gained. The discovery of these 5 new transcripts brings the total number of HTT mRNA subtypes, including the full-length, to 9.</p><fig id="pone.0127687.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0127687.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>PCR and qPCR validation of novel HTT isoforms.</title><p>(A) RT-PCR results with primers specific for each individual splice isoform, detecting expression of HTT-&#x00394;10, &#x00394;12, &#x00394;13 and &#x00394;46 in hESCs cells.

In addition to phosphorylation and ubiquitination sites, this sequence has been shown to include a nuclear localization signal[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], an ER targeting signal[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and a more general localization signal, which under stress conditions causes HTT to be released from the ER and accumulate in the nucleus[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A nuclear export signal has been found on the C-terminus of the protein, between aa 2397&#x02013;2406[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the rest of the HTT protein remains largely unexplored. Isoform-specific changes in HTT post-translational modifications due to missing amino acids are detailed below.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>HTT splice isoform 1: HTT-&#x00394;10</title><p><italic>HTT-&#x00394;10</italic> specifically lacks the 48bp-long exon 10, deleting amino acids 427 to 442 (<xref rid="pone.0127687.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). The splicing machinery connects exon 9 to 11 without disrupting the ORF, eliminating 16 aa from full length HTT. This domain of HTT has been previously shown to be the target of post-translational modifications. Cdk5 can phosphorylate Ser434, which is absent in the splice variant[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0127687.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). This phosphorylation in turn decreases caspase-dependent cleavage of HTT[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Since shorter forms of HTT are typically associated with enhanced toxicity, the Ser434 post-translational modification could decreases toxicity, presumably indirectly, through its effects on proteolysis of HTT. Due to the absence of this site in the <italic>HTT-&#x00394;10</italic> isoform, the protein predicted to be produced from this transcript might be more toxic than the full-length isoform.</p><fig id="pone.0127687.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0127687.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>HTT protein consequences of the 4 novel shorter isoforms.</title><p>(A, C-E) Alignment of sequencing data obtained from amplicons shown in <xref rid="pone.0127687.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> to canonical HTT, confirming the isoform sequences obtained from the RNAseq analysis.

Indeed, when we performed RNA-seq of <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> gastrula, we find that this isoform (<italic>htt-&#x00394;10)</italic> is the most prevalent in the embryo, representing ~96% of the total <italic>htt</italic> transcripts (<xref rid="pone.0127687.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). However, we also identified transcripts that retained exon 10 (<italic>htt-ex10i</italic>), which accounted for ~4% of all <italic>htt</italic> transcripts. These results were confirmed by RT-PCR (data not shown). Because of the stark contrast between human and <italic>Xenopus</italic> in the prevalence of transcripts with or without exon 10, we further investigated the temporal and spatial expression of these two isoforms. We found that while the major <italic>Xenopus</italic> isoform <italic>htt-&#x00394;10</italic> is expressed at all stages analyzed during early development (<xref rid="pone.0127687.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), the other isoform (<italic>htt-ex10i</italic>) is dramatically upregulated at stage 28, around the time when the nervous system is fully developed. Dissection of tadpoles at stage 35 into four regions showed that, consistent with expression in the CNS, the <italic>htt-ex10i</italic> form is predominantly expressed in the head and dorsal regions (<xref rid="pone.0127687.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Thus, these results suggest a possible link between development of the nervous system and expression of the <italic>htt-ex10i</italic> isoform, which was confirmed by analysis of <italic>HTT-&#x00394;10 and HTT-ex10i</italic> expression levels in hESCs differentiating towards the neuronal lineage (see below).</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>HTT splice isoform 2: HTT-&#x00394;12</title><p><italic>HTT-&#x00394;12</italic> isoform is generated by using an alternative splice donor site at nucleotide 1760, leading to a predicted protein that lacks 135 nucleotides from the 3&#x02019; end of Exon 12. This eliminates 45 amino acids from the canonical HTT protein, amino acids 539 to 583 (<xref rid="pone.0127687.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Interestingly, this splice form also eliminates another caspase cleavage site at D552 that is used to cleave both the normal as well as the CAG-extended mutant HTT[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

In human brains, increased concentration of N-terminal fragments in cortical neurons are a hallmark of HD[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Mouse studies have shown that HTT fragments appear before the onset of neurodegeneration[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. N-terminal fragments of HTT translocate into the nucleus[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and are considered to be more toxic than the full-length form[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

Strikingly, both the coding frame and the splice acceptor-donor sites are exclusively present in Great Apes (orangutan, gorilla, chimpanzee) and humans, reflecting a very recent acquisition in the human evolutionary scale (<xref rid="pone.0127687.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Indeed, the nucleotide sequence of the exon region suggests that it was acquired through the insertion of a new Alu element during evolution of the hominidae family. Thus, this discovery could explain at least some of the phenotypic differences observed between HD patients and mouse models. This HTT-41b isoform was validated by PCR in hESCs and its expression was stably maintained upon neural differentiation as determined by qPCR (<xref rid="pone.0127687.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>).

GENEA019 and GENEA020 lines were obtained from Genea Biocells (Australia). All three hESC lines were maintained under pluripotency conditions in MEF-conditioned medium in presence of 20ng/ml bFGF. Medium was changed every day and cells were passaged once a week to avoid overcrowding as previously described[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. RUES2 hESC were differentiated to neural lineage following previously described methods[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] with minor modifications. Briefly, embryoid bodies (EBs) were formed from ES cell colonies (in 20uM ROCK inhibitor Y27632, for the first two days) and treated with TGF&#x003b2; signaling inhibitors (10uM SB-431542 and 0.2uM LDN-193189) every other day for 10 days. At day 10 EBs were dissociated and seeded on poly-ornithine laminin coated dishes at 0.25M cells/cm2, cultured for another 13 days in medium with recombinant BDNF (10ng/ml, R&#x00026;D), Ascorbic Acid (20uM), and db-cAMP (Sigma, 1uM). Cultures were fixed or lysed in Trizol at day 0, 5, and 10 and 23. RNA was purified using RNAeasy columns and cDNA was synthesized with Superscript III and random hexamer primers. Neural differentiation protocol was validated using qPCR for PAX6 (f- ATC ATA ACT CCG CCC ATT CAC; r- GCA AAT AAC CTG CCT ATG CAA) and EMX2 (f- GGT TAA TAT GGT GCG TCC CTT; r- GAT ATC TGG GTC ATC GCT TCC) and expression was normalized to GAPDH (f- TCT CTT CCT CTT GTG CTC TTG; r- CAC TTT GTC AAG CTC ATT TCC TG). As validation of proper neural differentiation, at discrete time points along the neural differentiation protocol, EBs were fixed with 4% PFA, cryoprotected, sectioned at 12um and along with fixed adherent cultures (day23), stained for markers of pluripotency (OCT4: BD, mouse 1:100; NANOG: EMD, rabbit 1:100), neural plate (SOX1: R&#x00026;D, goat 1:500; PAX6: BD, mouse, 1:200), and neurogenic neuroepithelium (SOX9: R&#x00026;D, goat 1:500).</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>High-throughput sequencing and analysis</title><p>High-throughput sequencing was performed at The Rockefeller University Genomics Core Resource Center, using an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument. In order to obtain longest reads and increase the potential for reading through a splice site, 100bp, single-end reads were obtained. Raw data is publicly available on NCBI GEO (accession GSE66769). Sequencing reads in the sequencer output file were aligned to the reference genome (hg19) through TopHat2[<xref rid="pone.0127687.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and using UCSC hg19 annotations as a reference transcriptome. The total number of reads mapping to the HTT locus in each sample was calculated with the Samtools toolbox. Alternatively spliced HTT transcripts were visualized with the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) software. Quantification of the expression of the splicing isoforms was performed by dividing the read coverage of the isoform-specific junction (or the average of two junctions, in the case of a novel exon) by the read coverage of the canonical isoform junctions.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Isoform-specific PCR and qPCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent and RNeasy mini kits (QIAGEN), following manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. In-column DNAse treatment was performed during the purification to avoid any genomic DNA contamination (QIAGEN RNase-Free DNase Set). cDNA was generated using Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche) and an oligo-(dT)<sub>18</sub> primer, to ensure retrotranscription of polyadenylated transcripts. In order to amplify HTT splice isoforms specifically, we designed assays where one primer is common for both long and short isoforms, while the second primer specifically binds to the short isoform. This strategy was successful in amplifying short isoforms of HTT from cDNA templates prepared from hESC RNA. Non-specific amplification of the full-length isoform was assessed using a plasmid containing full-length HTT sequence. The amplicons obtained from the plasmid template were longer than those obtained from the cDNA templates and they were absent in cDNA lanes, showing minimal or no amplification. Both amplicons were sequenced for verification.
