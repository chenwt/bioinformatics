landscape of the pig. A new porcine Affymetrix expression array was designed in
order to provide comprehensive coverage of the known pig transcriptome. The new
array was used to generate a genome-wide expression atlas of pig tissues derived
from 62 tissue/cell types. These data were subjected to network correlation
analysis and clustering.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The analysis presented here provides a detailed functional clustering of the pig
transcriptome where transcripts are grouped according to their expression pattern,
so one can infer the function of an uncharacterized gene from the company it keeps
and the locations in which it is expressed. We describe the overall
transcriptional signatures present in the tissue atlas, where possible assigning
those signatures to specific cell populations or pathways. In particular, we
discuss the expression signatures associated with the gastrointestinal tract, an
organ that was sampled at 15 sites along its length and whose biology in the pig
is similar to human. We identify sets of genes that define specialized cellular
compartments and region-specific digestive functions. Finally, we performed a
network analysis of the transcription factors expressed in the gastrointestinal
tract and demonstrate how they sub-divide into functional groups that may control
cellular gastrointestinal development.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>As an important livestock animal with a physiology that is more similar than mouse

genome complexity and the transcriptional landscape of tissues and cells. Systematic
analysis of the transcriptome is of central interest to the biology community, but
global coverage was not possible until the complete sequencing of the human and mouse
genomes and the advent of microarrays. The pioneering work by Su <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] provided the first comprehensive analysis of the protein-encoding
transcriptome of major organs of human and mouse. Others have used microarrays or
alternative methods to map expression in specific tissues or cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The work of the FANTOM and ENCODE projects has revealed the true complexity
of the mammalian transcriptome, highlighting the impact of alternative initiation,
termination and splicing on the proteome, and the prevalence of multiple different
classes of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The pace of data acquisition has continued to grow with the increasing
reliability and decreasing cost of the core technologies such as microarrays and the
sequencing of RNA (RNAseq). Despite these efforts, knowledge of the human
transcriptional landscape is still sparse. Efforts to curate and analyze an 'atlas' from
the existing human microarray data are hindered by the fact that certain types of
samples have been analyzed extensively, for example hematopoietic cells and cancers,
while little or no data are available for many other tissues and cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Studies of the non-pathological human transcriptome are compromised further
because most tissues can only be obtained post-mortem, the provenance of samples can be
variable and the health status of the individual from whom they were obtained is often
unknown.</p><p>With numerous predicted mammalian protein-coding loci still having no informative
functional annotation and even less insight into the function of the many
non-protein-coding genes, detailed knowledge of a transcript's expression pattern can
provide a valuable window on its function. Previously, we have used coexpression
analysis of large mouse datasets to provide functional annotation of genes,
characterization of cell types and discovery of candidate disease genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Isolated cell types may differ not only in their specialized function but
also in their engagement with 'housekeeping' processes, such as growth and
proliferation, mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation, metabolism and
macromolecule synthesis, the cytoskeleton, the proteasome complex, endocytosis and
phagocytosis. Genes coding for proteins within pathways, both generic and cell-specific,
often form coexpression clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], so one can infer the function of a gene of unknown function from the
transcriptional company it keeps, by applying the principle of guilt-by-association. The
identification of coexpression clusters can, in turn, inform the identification of
candidate genes within genomic intervals associated with specific traits from
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or classical linkage studies. For example, we
identified a robust cluster of genes that is expressed specifically in cells of
mesenchymal lineages in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The cluster contained a large number of genes previously shown to be
causally associated with inherited abnormalities of the musculoskeletal system in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. By inference, other genes within this cluster that have less informative
annotation or no known function, are likely to be involved in musculoskeletal
development. As noted previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the conservation of coexpression clusters can provide an even more powerful
indicator of likely conserved function. These authors mapped coexpressed clusters onto
850 human Mendelian disease loci of unknown molecular basis from Online Mendelian
Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and identified 81 candidate genes based upon their conserved
restricted expression within the affected organ.</p><p>The domestic pig (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>) is economically important in its own right, and
has also been used increasingly as an alternative model for studying human health and
disease and for testing new surgical (including transplantation) and pharmacological
treatments (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]). Compared to traditional rodent models, the pig is more closely-related to
humans in its size, growth, development, immunity and physiology as well as its genome
sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The translation of preclinical studies in rodents into clinical applications
in humans is frequently unsuccessful, especially for structures where rodents have very
different anatomy and physiology, such as the cardiovascular system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The recently released pig genome sequence (Sscrofa10.2,
<ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Eukaryotes/vertebrates_mammals/Sus_scrofa/Sscrofa10.2/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Eukaryotes/vertebrates_mammals/Sus_scrofa/Sscrofa10.2/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and associated annotation will greatly enhance the utility of the pig as a
model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, compared to the mouse, the knowledge of the pig transcriptome is
very limited partly due to a lack of commercial expression microarrays with
comprehensive gene coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. While several EST (Expressed Sequence Tag) sequencing projects have explored
gene expression across a range of tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], a systematic global study of the tissue expression landscape is not
available. Here we present a new microarray platform for the pig with greatly improved
gene coverage and annotation. We have used this array to generate an expression atlas
for the pig, comparable to the human/mouse expression atlases, and, using advanced
visualization and clustering analysis techniques, we have identified networks of
co-expressed genes. A detailed analysis of the porcine gastrointestinal tract
illustrates the power of the analytical approach and data. These data will support
improved annotation of the pig and human genomes and increase the utility of the pig as
a model in medical research.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The pig is uniquely important both as a major source of food and an animal model for
human disease. Until recently the lack of a genome sequence for the pig and consequently
many of the functional-genomic analysis tools, have limited the kind of analyses now
routine in human and mouse systems. Here we report the design, annotation and validation
of a new comprehensive microarray for the analysis of gene expression in the pig and a
first attempt to produce a global map of the porcine protein coding transcriptome.</p><p>The new Snowball array (named after the Trotsky pig character in George Orwell's novel
<italic>Animal Farm </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]) is far more comprehensive in its gene coverage than the previous porcine
Affymetrix array which was based on the available expressed sequence tag data circa
2004. It is also more extensive than the new porcine 'peg' array (PorGene-1_0-st-v1)
recently released by Affymetrix (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), with nearly twice as
many probes included on the Snowball array, and draws on a larger cDNA sequence
database. The results from the analysis described here validate the performance and gene
annotation of the Snowball array. A major problem currently restricting genomic analysis
of production animals is the fact that many genes remain unannotated due to problems in
establishing orthology among homologous sequences from other species. We adopted a 'best
match' approach to increase the number of annotated features on the array. The repeated
finding that transcripts annotated in this way were expressed in a pattern that was
consistent with their proposed function (where known) supports the validity of this
approach. However, we would urge caution in accepting the orthology match of probes
annotated in this way without further verification. We have aligned the probe sequences
from the Snowball array with the recently released Sscrofa10.2 assembly. We will publish
these alignments as a DAS track in Ensembl in the short term and integrate the
alignments into Ensembl and Biomart in the next Ensembl release. These alignments enable
the expression data to be used to annotate the genome sequence further and the
interpretation of expression profiles for a gene/transcript in a genomic context.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of Affymetrix arrays designed for analysis of the pig

quality gene expression data. In terms of speed of data acquisition and availability of
established analysis routines that can be run on desktop machines, arrays still have
many advantages over sequencing-based analyses. With improvements in the assembly and
annotation of the genome and gene models and RNAseq analyses increasing our knowledge of
the transcriptional landscape of the transcriptome, there is no doubt the current array
design will be enhanced.</p><p>The primary cohort of animals used for this study was a group of three- to four-month
old juvenile pigs of both sexes. We aimed to gather samples of every major pig tissue.
Where possible biological replicates were analyzed that originated from different
animals of each sex. Regional analysis of the brain is clearly important, and more
feasible in pigs than in mice, but the method of killing (cranial bolt) meant that
detailed dissection of brain was not possible. The age/stage of the animals also meant
that certain tissues could not be collected and the panel of tissues was supplemented by
samples of placenta and a mature testis (since these are major sites of tissue
restricted gene expression) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Since macrophages have proved to be one of the most complex sources of novel
mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], we included a number of macrophage samples (with or without
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation) in the atlas. For details of the tissues and cells
used for this study see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Table S1.</p><p>BioLayout <italic>Express</italic><sup>3D </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] is a unique tool in the analysis of large complex expression datasets. The
statistical approach employed centers on the principle of coexpression, based on the
transcript-to-transcript comparison of the expression signal across the samples
analyzed, by calculation of a Pearson correlation matrix. For any given comparison, the
Pearson value can range from +1 (perfect correlation) to -1 (perfect anti-correlation).
The correlation and clustering algorithms within BioLayout
<italic>Express</italic><sup>3D</sup>, together with the ability to visualize and explore very
large network graphs, mean that it is uniquely positioned for the analysis of large
datasets and has been used extensively for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. A graph derived from a given correlation cut-off value includes only those
genes that are related in expression to others above the selected threshold and more or
less complex graphs may be analyzed by decreasing or increasing this value,
respectively. Core topological structures that often form separate graph components at
high thresholds are robust and are maintained as correlation cut-off values are
lowered.</p><p>We used BioLayout <italic>Express</italic><sup>3D </sup>to analyze the pig transcriptome data
generated using the Snowball array (all normalized expression data is provided in
Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). From a pairwise transcript-to-transcript
correlation matrix a weighted, undirected network graph was constructed using a Pearson
correlation threshold cut-off of r &#x02265; 0.80. The resultant graph was large and
highly structured (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>) with one large component of 19,708 nodes and 90 smaller components
(unconnected networks of correlations) of between 57 and 5 nodes (20,352 probesets in
total, that is, just under half the transcripts represented on the array). The topology
of the graph contained localized areas of high connectivity and high correlation
(representing groups of genes with similar profiles), dominated by groups of genes that
are coexpressed and form highly connected cliques within the network (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Nodes representing different
probesets designed to the same gene were generally highly correlated and connected to
each other in the graph, confirming the validity of the probeset annotation and
approach.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Network visualization and clustering of the pig transcriptome</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.
Three-dimensional visualization of a Pearson correlation graph of data derived
from analysis of pig tissues and cells. Each node (sphere) in the graph represents
an individual probeset on the array and the edges (lines) correspond to
correlations between individual measurements above the defined threshold. The
graph is comprised of 20,355 nodes (probesets) and 1,251,575 edges (correlations
&#x02265;0.8). The complex topology of the graph is a result of groups of
co-expressed genes forming cliques of high connectivity within the graph.
Clustering of the graph using the MCL algorithm was used to assign genes to groups
based on coexpression. By inspection of the underlying profiles, areas of the
graph can be associated with genes expressed by specific tissue or cell
populations. Plots of the average expression profile of genes in selected clusters
are given on the right: <bold>B</bold>. profile of cluster 4 genes whose expression is

expression pattern, the fewer neighbors it will have in the network. One example is the
protease inhibitor, alpha-2-macroglobulin (<italic>A2M</italic>). There were five probesets on
the array designed to this gene and all showed a highly similar expression pattern,
albeit at a range of signal intensities. These probesets formed a small correlation
network with themselves, but the expression pattern of this gene in the context of the
full atlas was essentially unique and no other porcine gene was expressed in this manner
(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In some cases, such isolation is a consequence of the
use of distinct cell-restricted promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. For <italic>A2M</italic>, there is a single major transcription start site in both
mouse and human, and the pattern of expression is similar in these two species ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biogps.org">http://biogps.org</ext-link>) and in pig, suggesting that a common set of
regulatory factors control this gene's expression across species. For the majority of
other probesets not found in the graph described here, transcripts appear to be
expressed at very low levels (or not at all). These genes may be highly-expressed in
cells or tissues we have not sampled in this sample set. For example, we would not
detect genes exclusively expressed during prenatal life as no samples from these stages
were represented in the current atlas.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Screenshot of the representation of the profile of the pig <italic>A2M </italic>gene

expression
atlas. Listed in the table are the 50 largest clusters of genes originating from
our analysis of the pig expression atlas. Clusters are numbered according to their
size (the largest being designated cluster 1) but are sorted here according to
their grouping within the graph and the biology they represent. The first two
columns give the cluster ID and number of transcripts present in the cluster and
the following column provides a description of the average expression profile of
all transcripts within the cluster. The final two columns aim to group clusters
according to the class of tissues in which these genes are predominately expressed
and the tissue, cell or pathway we believe they represent.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Several of the largest clusters showed relatively little tissue specificity in their
expression and might be considered to be 'housekeeping' genes since the proteins they
encode are likely to be functional in all cell types. Such clusters are a common feature
of large correlation graphs where a relatively low threshold has been employed.
Genes/probes with limited informative nomenclature were over-represented in these
clusters, perhaps reflecting previous research focus on genes that demonstrate
tissue-restricted expression profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Aside from these large, nondescript clusters, the majority of the
coexpression clusters were made up of transcripts that have a distinct tissue/cell
restricted expression pattern. In each case, the cluster was named based upon the
tissue/cell(s) in which the genes were most highly-expressed. These data recapitulate
many of the known tissue restricted expression patterns that have been described for
human and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. For example, there were multiple large clusters of genes with strong
expression in the macrophage samples with a subset more highly-expressed in the alveolar
macrophages and another set induced by LPS. Each of these clusters contained genes for
numerous well-studied macrophage surface markers and receptors, and proinflammatory
cytokines. A detailed comparative analysis of human and pig macrophage gene expression
has been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The present analysis did not identify the single large phagocytosis/lysosome
functional cluster that was evident in the analysis of mouse primary cell data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This cluster tends to be broken up when tissue samples are included in the
analysis because many of the components of this system are utilized more generally in
vesicle-trafficking and in other pathways.</p><p>A secondary feature of the network graph is that clusters with similar expression
patterns formed neighborhoods (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). For instance, clusters
of genes selectively expressed in the reproductive tract, gastrointestinal tract,
central nervous system (CNS), mesenchymal-derived tissues, dermal tissues or blood cells
tended to occupy similar areas. In this way the graph distributed the transcriptome into
groups of genes associated with tissues composed of cells of different embryonic
lineages.</p><p>Because cells and tissues differ in their engagement with fundamental biochemical
processes, the graph also contained clusters that grouped together genes associated with
a particular cellular process (pathway) which may be active in a wide range of tissues
albeit not at the exact same level. Examples include clusters enriched for ribosomal
(clusters 50, 65, 79 and 184), cell cycle (cluster 14) and oxidative phosphorylation
(clusters 27 and 99) genes. The clusters of ribosomal genes form a separate graph
component which together contain 106 transcripts (approximately 94 genes), including at
least 37 known ribosomal protein genes (others appear in the list but are annotated with
LocusLink (LOC) gene identifiers), genes for eukaryotic translation initiation factors
(EEF1B2, EIF3E, EIF3H), two members of the RNaseP complex, NACA (nascent
polypeptide-associated complex alpha subunit), U1 and U4 small nuclear
ribonucleoproteins and at least 23 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). snoRNAs function to
guide modifications of other RNAs, particularly ribosomal protein mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], consistent with their co-clustering with components of the ribosome complex.
Different tissues also vary in their rates of cell renewal and consequently in the
proportions of proliferating cells. Genes involved in the cell cycle, therefore, have a
pattern of expression that reflects the mitotic activity of the tissues and such genes
are readily identified in the graph. Cluster 14 contains many genes for proteins known
to be involved in the cell cycle (GO term enrichment analysis of this cluster returned
<italic>P</italic>-values of 5.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-60 </sup>for 'cell cycle' and 2.9 &#x000d7;
10<sup>-51 </sup>for 'mitosis') and supports the involvement of other cluster 14
genes in this pathway. For example, the cluster includes vaccinia-related kinase 1
(<italic>VRK1</italic>) shown recently to play a role in the control of mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], highlighting the importance of our approach for annotation of
uncharacterized genes.</p><p>To further illustrate the power of this approach in defining pathway systems, we show a
detailed analysis of the enrichment of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation
and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in clusters 27 and 99 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Clusters 27 and 99 were widely separated within the graph (see Figure
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This separation represents a different regulation of these
two sets of genes. All cluster 99 genes (17 transcripts) were highly expressed in all
tissues (hence their close association with the housekeeping clusters) and are core
components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes encoded by the
mitochondrial genome. In contrast, the genes in cluster 27 are encoded by the nuclear
genome and showed a marked elevation in their expression in the heart, reflecting the
high rates of respiration in this tissue. The 108 transcripts in this cluster include
multiple members of every one of the five complexes associated with the generation of
ATP by the mitochondria and most of the enzymes driving the TCA cycle. The coexpression
of multiple members of pathways for long chain fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial
membrane transport and ubiquinone and cytochrome C biosynthesis supports the functional
link between these pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. On the basis of guilt-by-association the unnannotated/poorly characterized
transcripts within this cluster are prime candidates for a functional association with
the oxidative respiration process. For example, <italic>GBAS </italic>and <italic>CHCHD10 </italic>were
recently identified by coexpression analysis and shown to be associated with
mitochondrial complex IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. There are numerous other clusters within this dataset which cannot easily be
associated with an obvious functional role but likely represent clusters of genes with
shared or related functions.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Genes associated with the oxidative phosphorylation pathway present in clusters 27

offer a unique opportunity to study the expression landscape of important organ systems.
In common with humans, the pig is an omnivore and its gastrointestinal tract (GI) has
evolved to be able to masticate, digest and absorb a wide range of foodstuffs. In this
study, we collected samples along the entire length of the GI tract from the tongue to
the rectum, a total of 15 distinct regions (in duplicate), as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>. The GI tract is lined with an epithelial layer whose cellular
composition changes in line with the functional role of the GI compartment. The upper GI
tract is lined with a stratified squamous epithelium which transitions in the stomach to
a columnar epithelium that runs through to the rectum. Even within the small intestine,
enterocyte expression of solute transporters and digestive enzymes is tightly regulated
to reflect the changing nature of the luminal contents, as well as the migration of
cells up the crypt-villus axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Associated with the epithelium are various glandular cell types involved
with enzyme secretion, lubrication, and endocrine control, and specialized structures,
such as the pyloric and fundic glands of the stomach and sub-mucosal Brunner's glands of
the duodenum. The lamina propria, which lies beneath the epithelium, is itself a complex
mix of cells made up of endothelial, immune and connective tissues. The GI tract is
almost entirely surrounded by musculature (predominately smooth muscle) and regulated by
the enteric neural plexus. Therefore, the GI tract is composed of five major classes of
cell types: epithelia, glandular/endocrine epithelia, immune cells, neuronal cells and
mesenchymal cells (muscle, connective tissue). The region-specific cellular composition
of the GI tract is summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Diagram of pig GI tract and table of the cell populations/structures associated

families/classes where expression is known to be specific to certain cell populations in
other mammals [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>, Figure S1]. Keratins are
structural proteins that distinguish different classes of epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. We looked at eight keratin gene family members (Figure S1a). All but
<italic>KRT8 </italic>and <italic>KRT19 </italic>were heavily expressed in the tongue, <italic>KRT5,
KRT13 </italic>and <italic>KRT78 </italic>were also expressed in the lower esophagus and fundus,
both of which are lined with a stratified squamous epithelium. <italic>KRT8 </italic>and
<italic>KRT19</italic>, markers of columnar epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], showed the anticipated inverse pattern, with strong expression in the
salivary gland, antrum and along the entire length of the small and large intestine. To
confirm region-specific epithelial function, we examined the expression of four
well-characterized brush border hydrolases: lactase (<italic>LCT</italic>), sucrose-isomaltase
(<italic>SI</italic>), aminopeptidase N (<italic>ANPEP</italic>) and dipeptidyl-peptidase 4
(<italic>DPP4</italic>) (Figure S1b). <italic>LCT </italic>is responsible for the enzymatic cleavage
of the milk sugar lactose and was detected in the duodenum and jejunum but not in the
ileum. <italic>SI </italic>expression was low in the duodenum and peaked in jejunum, with lower
expression in the ileum. <italic>ANPEP </italic>and <italic>DPP4 </italic>were expressed all along the
small intestine. <italic>DPP4 </italic>was also highly expressed in the salivary gland and in
the distal colon. These observations fit the known expression patterns for these genes
in post-weaned rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Associated with the role of the intestine in nutrient uptake, there were a
large number of solute transporters included in the GI tract data (86 members of the SLC
family alone), and many showed region-specific expression patterns consistent with their
known functions (Figure S1c). For example, ferroportin (<italic>SLC40A1</italic>), a protein
involved in iron export from duodenal epithelial cells and found to be defective in

have attempted to relate the clusters to the cell composition
of the GI tact, based on the gene membership of clusters and their expression pattern.
The different samples varied significantly in their muscle content, so some of the
largest clusters contained muscle-specific genes. GI-cluster 4 was enriched for genes
known to be expressed specifically in skeletal muscle and were highly expressed in the
tongue and esophageal samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). In contrast, the genes
in GI-cluster 2 were highly expressed throughout the GI tract, peaking in the pylorus
sample. The cluster contained not only genes associated with smooth muscle but also many
extra-cellular matrix (ECM)-associated genes identified previously from mouse data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Expression of these genes was shared with other mesenchymal lineages (fat,
adipose, bone) and they formed a separate cluster in the whole atlas data. GI-cluster 9
sits between GI-clusters 2 and 4 and comprises a set of genes expressed in both muscle
types. Another cluster in this region of the graph (GI-cluster 17) contained many of the
genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation (as discussed above) with a number of
interesting and plausible new additions to this pathway. Finally, GI-cluster 10 genes
were highly-expressed in the pylorus sample. The cluster contained numerous
neuron-associated genes and may derive from neuronal/supporting cells that make up the
enteric plexus. Although the motile and hormonal activity of the GI tract is controlled
by a complex nervous system, neurons actually represent only a small percentage of the
cells that make up the organ. Hence, their expression signature would appear to be
relatively weak compared with other cell types.</p><p>The GI tract is also a major immune organ. It represents one of the main battle grounds
in an animal's defense against invading pathogens because of the large surface area, the
nutrient rich luminal environment and the requirement for a thin lining permeable to
nutrients. It is, therefore, unsurprising that the largest cluster of genes (GI-cluster
1) contained many genes associated with the immune system, their expression being two-
to three-fold higher in the ileum than other regions. The lower small intestine is known
to be associated with increased immune surveillance and the presence of Peyer's patches
(specialized lymphoid follicles associated with sampling and presentation of luminal
antigens). The cluster analysis did not separate the immune cell types which are largely
co-located in the lamina propria and lymphoid aggregates. Included in GI-cluster 1 were
genes encoding many of the protein components of the B cell receptor complex
(<italic>CD19</italic>, <italic>CD22</italic>, <italic>CD79A/B</italic>, <italic>CR2</italic>) but also numerous
genes identified in the full atlas analysis as being expressed specifically by T cells
or macrophages. Also evident in this cluster were many of the core components of the
cell cycle, for example cyclins, DNA polymerases, kinesins, and so on, again identified
in the whole atlas as a discrete cluster (atlas cluster 14). The association of cell
cycle genes with an immune signature is most likely due to the high level of lymphocyte
proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], which increases the proportion of cells undergoing mitosis relative to the
rest of the organ. In the neighborhood of the main GI immune cluster were smaller
clusters of immune-associated genes that were expressed in a distinct but related
manner, perhaps connected to regional immune specialization. GI-cluster 20 contains many
of the components of the T cell receptor complex (<italic>CD2</italic>, <italic>CD3D/E/G</italic>,
<italic>CD8A</italic>) which could be aligned with the distribution of intraepithelial
lymphocytes. The analysis also detected a small, heavily expressed cluster of plasma B
cell genes (GI-cluster 39, high expression in salivary gland, stomach and along the
length of the small and large intestines) and two small clusters of immune response
genes (GI-clusters 27 and 33) that varied significantly in their level of expression
between animals. Other clusters were enriched for MHC class 1 (GI-cluster 11) and class
2 (GI-cluster 22) antigen presentation pathway genes.</p><p>Although the lamina propria of the gut contains the largest macrophage population in the
body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], many of the macrophage-specific genes identified in the whole atlas were not
detectable in GI-cluster 1. For each of the genes in the macrophage cluster as defined
in the full atlas dataset, we calculated the ratio of their highest expression in
macrophages to their highest expression across GI tract samples. The average ratio was
around 5, suggesting that macrophages provide around 20% of the total mRNA yield from
the gut. The genes that were under-expressed based upon this ratio were derived mainly
from atlas cluster 18, the subset of macrophage-expressed genes that was enriched in
alveolar macrophages. The most repressed was <italic>CYP7A1</italic>, the
cholesterol-7-hydroxylase, which metabolizes bile acids. The other striking feature was
the large number of genes for C-type lectins, including <italic>CLEC5A </italic>(MDL1),
<italic>CLEC7A </italic>(dectin), <italic>CD68 </italic>(macrosialin), <italic>CLEC4D </italic>(MCL),
<italic>SIGLEC1 </italic>(sialoadhesin), <italic>CLEC13D </italic>(MCR1, CD206), <italic>CLEC4E
</italic>(mincle) and <italic>CLEC12B</italic>, that are highly-expressed in alveolar macrophages
but appeared down-regulated in the GI tract. This pattern indicates that macrophages of
the gut are distinct from those of the lung and blood, perhaps adapted to be
hypo-responsive to food-derived glycoproteins where those of the lung must use the same
receptors to recognize and engulf potential pathogens. The phenotype of lamina propria
macrophages may also vary within different regions of the GI tract thereby breaking up
their expression signature.</p><p>The epithelial layer exhibits a great diversity between different GI compartments, its
structure and function changing in line with requirements. Many clusters correlated with
the known region-specific expression of structural proteins and solute carriers
described above. GI-clusters 3 and 8, containing specific keratin genes, are related to
the stratified squamous epithelial populations that protect against abrasion and
mechanical damage to the underlying tissues in the tongue and esophagus. Genes in
GI-cluster 3 tended to be expressed in equal levels in the tongue and lower esophagus,
whereas genes in GI-cluster 8 were more restricted in their expression to the tongue.
These genes define the specific signature of stratified squamous epithelial populations
present in this organ. Similarly GI-clusters 13 and 16 which were high in the salivary
gland or along the entire length of the gut, respectively, likely represent genes
specifically expressed in the stratified or ciliated columnar epithelium present in
these organs. Among the columnar epithelium populations, which line the gut from the
stomach to the rectum, there was region-specific differentiation, reflected by the
differing levels of expression of genes along the longitudinal axis of the intestine and
the presence of specific populations of glandular cells. Enriched in GI-cluster 5 were
many transcripts (representing 251 unique gene IDs) that were expressed specifically in
the small intestine and encode the machinery for the digestion and absorption of
nutrients. In contrast, there were relatively few genes expressed specifically in the
colon (GI-clusters 25 and 29, representing 37 unique gene IDs) and little evidence of
functional compartmentalization of expression along that organ. Among these genes many
matched the known markers of this tissue but others were novel. There are various
glandular and endocrine cell populations that are integral to the columnar epithelial
lining and in many cases have their origins in the same epithelial stem cell populations
located at the base of the crypts. Because they inhabit specific niches within the GI
tract, genes expressed specifically within them have a unique expression pattern. For
this reason, we can assign the genes in GI-cluster 23 with some confidence to expression
in the fundic glands, GI-cluster 18 genes to pyloric glands and GI-cluster 12 genes to
mucous secreting superficial gastric glands. These assignments are also strongly
supported by the gene membership of these clusters and the lists expand the complement
of genes known to be expressed in these specialized glandular systems. The genes in
GI-cluster 14 were likely expressed in glandular/endocrine cells present only in the
duodenum. Finally, genes expressed in the salivary gland could be segregated to those
expressed in serosal (GI-cluster 6) or mucosal (GI-cluster 15) acini. While both were
exclusively expressed in the salivary gland they separate the two salivary gland
samples, presumably due to chance sampling of different regions of the gland.</p><p>In our previous analysis of a mouse cell atlas, specific clusters frequently contained
the transcription factors that regulated them, and their promoters were over-represented
with the motifs that are the targets of those factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We analyzed a set of candidate transcription factors (TFs) encoded by the
human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] as a correlation network (r <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>0.8, MCL2.2 Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Clusters of TFs that had a preference in their expression for one or
multiple regions of the GI tract grouped together. The expression patterns of numerous
other TFs imply previously unrecognized roles in regulating cell differentiation in this
organ. RFX6 is classically associated with regulating insulin expression and has
recently been shown to be essential for islet cell differentiation in the murine
pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. In the pig GI tract, the <italic>RFX6 </italic>gene was highly expressed in the
salivary gland, with significant expression in the duodenum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). We suggest that the RFX6 protein could also contribute to
epithelial/endocrine differentiation in these organs. This suggestion is supported by
protein expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], and the discovery that mutations in this gene in human Mitchell-Riley
syndrome are associated with duodenal and jejunal atresia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The ONECUT2 protein is a member of a small TF family that contains a cut
domain and an atypical homeodomain. ONECUT2 has been associated with the regulation of
retinal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] and pancreatic and enteric endocrine differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. In the pig gut, the gene was highly and specifically expressed in the
duodenum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>) and was tightly coexpressed with the TF
<italic>PDX1 </italic>(Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1), a gene which is expressed by
duodenal enterocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], suggesting a role in defining epithelial differentiation in the region of
the intestine. Finally, SATB2 is a homeobox protein with known roles in osteoblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] and neuronal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] differentiation. The recently characterized HSA2q33.1 microdeletion syndrome
is associated with genomic deletion of all or part of the human <italic>SATB2 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. In the pig, expression of this gene was exclusively found in the lower
bowel, consistent with human protein expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] and its utility as a marker of colorectal derived cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. This specific expression in the epithelium of the large intestine would
predict a defining role in this region.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>GI tract transcription factor network</bold>. A plot of the relationships in

pig. Since the pig is a large animal with a physiology that is closer to man's than is
that of mouse, this analysis provides a major new resource for understanding gene
expression with respect to the known physiology of mammalian tissues and cells. At the
single gene level, this dataset represents a comprehensive survey of gene expression
across a large range of pig tissues. In instances where the expression of a gene is
regulated in a tissue-specific manner it represents a good starting point for
understanding its likely cellular expression pattern and, therefore, its functional
role. The availability of the data on the BioGPS web portal renders the data amenable to
such queries. However, it is the ability to understand the expression of a gene in the
context of others that makes this analysis unique. Correlation analysis and the use of
advanced network visualization and clustering techniques go beyond standard pairwise
hierarchical approaches in defining coexpression relationships between genes. The
approach used here allows us to capture and visualize the complexity of these
relationships in high dimensional data, rendering large proportions of the data
available for analysis. Using this network clustering approach we have been able to
recapitulate known expression and functional relationships between genes as well as
infer new ones based on guilt-by-association. The detailed analysis of the
transcriptional landscape of the gastrointestinal tract provides the first comprehensive
view of the regional specialization of this organ in a large animal, and has highlighted
numerous candidate genes that may underlie genetic diseases of the human
gastrointestinal tract such as colitis and cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design of the 'Snowball' array and annotation of the probesets</title><p>Porcine expressed sequences (cDNA) were collated from public data repositories

sequence, with the ultimate aim being to obtain 20 to 25 probes per transcript.
Oligonucleotide design against the approximately 343,000 PSRs was performed by
Affymetrix (High Wycombe, UK). In addition, standard Affymetrix controls for
hybridization, labelling efficiency and non-specific binding were included on the
array (a total of 123 probesets) together with complete tiling probesets for 35
porcine-related virus genome sequences (both strands, center-to-center gap of 17
nucleotides) for possible future infection-based studies. The final array is
comprised of 1,091,987 probes (47,845 probesets) with a mean coverage of 22
probes/transcript.</p><p>Initial annotation of the gene models was obtained from the sequence sources and
converted into an annotation set using the AnnotateDbi Bioconductor package. However,
following this exercise many probesets were without useful annotation. Therefore, the
original sequences from which the probes had been designed were blasted against NCBI
Refseq in order to impute the most likely orthologous gene of the 'unannotated' pig
transcripts. In order to have one gene per query sequence the following annotation
pipeline was followed:</p><p>1. For each query the hit with lowest e-value within each species was
chosen.</p><p>2. Genes with e-value hits &#x0003c;1e-9 against <italic>Homo sapiens </italic>were
annotated with HUGO (Human Genome Organization) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC)
names/descriptions; however, genes with matches starting with 'LOC' were not
used.</p><p>3. Step 2 was repeated using in order: S. scrofa, Bos taurus, Pan
troglodytes, Mus musculus, Canis lupus familiaris, Pongo abelii, Equus caballus,
Rattus norvegicus, Macaca mulatta.</p><p>4. Step 3 was repeated using any other species (in no particular order) to
which a hit could be obtained.</p><p>5. For the remaining probes LOC gene annotations were used from (in order
of priority): <italic>H. sapiens, S. scrofa, B. taurus, P. troglodytes, M.
musculus</italic></p><p>6. Everything else was used, in no particular order.</p><p>Out of 47,845 sequences represented on the array, 27,322 probesets have annotations
that correspond to a current (15 December 2011) HGNC symbol for human protein coding
gene, 14,426 of which are unique (out of a total 19,219 listed by HGNC). The
remaining probesets were annotated with the information available for those
sequences. The array design has been submitted to ArrayExpress (AcNo.
A-AFFY-189).</p></sec><sec><title>Tissues and cells</title><p>The majority of fresh tissue samples were obtained from young Landrace pigs (one
male, three female 12- to 16-weeks old) that were being sacrificed for another study
examining normal expression patterns in hematopoietic cell lineages. Pigs were
sedated with ketamine (6 mg/kg) and azaperone (1 mg/kg), left undisturbed for a
minimum of 15 minutes, and then killed by captive bolt. Tissues were dissected and a
small piece immediately snap-frozen on dry ice and stored in a -155&#x000b0;C freezer
until RNA extraction. All tissues were collected within a window of 10 to 90 minutes
following the death of the animal. Samples of adult testis (Large
White-Landrace-Duroc cross, eight- years-old) and placenta (Large White-Landrace
cross, gestation day 50) that were not obtainable from the young animals were
collected separately. Samples of blood and three different macrophage populations
were also obtained from other animals. Blood samples were collected by jugular
venepuncture of 8- to 12-week old Landrace males and 3 ml was placed in Vacuette
Tempus Blood RNA tubes (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) and stored at 4&#x000b0;C
until RNA extraction. Alveolar macrophages were collected from the same animals by
washing the left caudal/diaphramatic lung lobe with PBS (using 200 to 250 ml)
followed by centrifugation of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at 800 g for 10
minutes; the supernatant (alveolar wash fluid) was retained. The alveolar macrophages
were washed once with PBS prior to analysis. Bone marrow- (BMDM) and monocyte-derived
macrophages (MDM) were generated from primary monocytes. A total of 400 ml of blood
was collected together with five posterior ribs from each side of male Large
White-Landrace pigs of 8- to 12-weeks of age. The buffy coat (after spinning the
blood for 15 minutes at 1200 g) was mixed to one volume of RPMI and separated on a
Ficoll gradient (Lymphoprep, Axis-Shield, Norway) for 25 minutes at 1,200 g.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were then washed twice (10 minutes at 600
g, then 10 minutes at 400 g) with PBS. Bone-marrow cells (BMC) were isolated and
cryopreserved at -155&#x000b0;C as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Both BMC and PBMC were thawed and derived into macrophages in the
presence of recombinant human CSF-1 for five to seven days. BMDM and MDM were then
treated with LPS from <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>serotype Minnesota Re 595 (L9764,
Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, USA) at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml and RNA was
collected at 0 and 7 hours.</p><p>Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit as specified by the manufacturer (Qiagen
Ltd, Crawley, UK). RNA concentration was measured using ND-1000 Nanodrop (Thermo
Scientific, Wilmington, USA). The quality was assessed by running the samples on the
RNA 6000 LabChip kit (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) with the Agilent 2100
bioanalyzer. A total of 500 ng of total RNA was amplified using the Ambion WT
Expression Kit (Affymetrix). A total of 5.5 &#x000b5;g of the resulting cDNA was
fragmented and labelled using the Affymetrix Terminal Labelling Kit. The fragmented
and biotin labelled cDNA was hybridized to the Snowball arrays, using the Affymetrix
HybWashStain Kit and Affymetrix standard protocols. The fluidics protocol used was
FS_0001. In total, 111 arrays were run on samples derived from 65 tissue/cell
types.</p><p>All animal care and experimentation was conducted in accordance with guidelines of
The Roslin Institute and the University of Edinburgh and under the Home Office
project licence number PPL 60/4259.</p></sec><sec><title>Data quality control and analysis</title><p>The quality of the raw data was analyzed using the arrayQualityMetrics package in
Bioconductor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">http://www.bioconductor.org/</ext-link>) and scored on the basis of
five metrics, namely maplot, spatial, boxplot, heatmap and rle in order to identify
poor quality data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Arrays failing on more than two metrics, were generally removed. However,
in a number of cases after examining the data, particularly from a number of the
macrophage samples, it was considered that their poor quality control (QC) score was
down to the samples being significantly different from the others but not of poor
quality. RNA samples from the pancreas were partially degraded and consequently these
data were scored as being of a lower quality, but were left in the final analysis due
to yielding a cluster of pancreatic marker genes. A further QC step involved the
creation of a sample-sample correlation network where edges represented the Pearson
correlation value and nodes the samples [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>, Figure S3]. In a number of cases samples clearly did not group with
similar samples, indicating a likely error at the point of collection or during
processing and these samples were removed from the analysis. Details of the
tissues/cells used in this study are given in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Table S1.</p><p>Following QC, data from 104 arrays run on samples derived from 62 tissue/cell types
were normalized using the robust multi-array average (RMA) expression measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. In order to make these data accessible all raw and normalized data have
been placed in ArrayExpress (AcNo. E-MTAB-1183) and the expression and graph layout
files have been made available to support future graph-based analyses using BioLayout
<italic>Express</italic><sup>3D </sup>[see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>
and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, the data have been uploaded onto the
BioGPS web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biogps.org">http://biogps.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] enabling the search for a profile of an individual gene and those
correlated with it. This site also supports mouse and human atlas datasets allowing
the direct comparison of gene expression profiles across species. Following data
normalization, samples were ordered according to tissue type and the dataset was
saved as an '.expression' file and then loaded into the network analysis tool
BioLayout <italic>Express</italic><sup>3D </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A pairwise Pearson correlation matrix was calculated for each probeset on
the array as a measure of similarity between the signal derived from different
probesets. All Pearson correlations with r &#x02265;0.7 were saved to a '.pearson' file
and a correlation cut off of r = 0.8 was used to construct a graph containing 20,355
nodes (probesets) and 1,251,575 edges (correlations between nodes above the
threshold). The minimum sub-graph component size included in the network was five.
Graph layout was performed using a modified Fruchterman-Rheingold algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] in three-dimensional space in which nodes representing genes/transcripts
are connected by weighted, undirected edges representing correlations above the
selected threshold. Gene coexpression clusters were determined using the MCL
algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], which has been demonstrated to be one of the most effective graph-based
clustering algorithms available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. An MCL inflation value of 2.2 was used as the basis of determining the
granularity of clustering, as it has been shown to be optimal when working with
highly structured expression graphs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Clusters were named according to their relative size, the largest cluster
being designated Cluster 1. Graphs of each dataset were explored extensively in order
to understand the significance of the gene clusters and their relevance to the cell
biology of pig tissues. A cluster was annotated if the genes within it indicated a
known function shared by multiple members of the cluster. These analyses were
supplemented by comparison of the clusters with tissue- and cell-specific clusters
derived from network-based analyses of a human tissue atlas and an atlas of purified
mouse cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and tissues, Gene Ontology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>], The Human Protein Atlas database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] and comprehensive reviews of the literature (data not shown). A
description of the average profile and gene content of the major clusters can be
found in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>, Table S2.</p><p>In order to focus down specifically on expression patterns along the porcine GI
tract, the data from these tissues (30 samples in total) were treated separately. Due
to the smaller size of this dataset there is a greater chance of low intensity data
being correlated by chance, so data were removed for all probesets where the maximum
normalized expression value never exceeded a value of 50 in any of the GI samples.
This filtering left 29,918 probesets. These data were then subjected to network
analysis at a correlation cut-off value of r = 0.90 and clustered using an MCL
inflation value of 2.2. This network was inspected manually and clusters were removed
where they showed no particular region-specific expression pattern or were most
likely formed due to contamination of GI tissues with surrounding tissues (for
example, it would appear that one of the rectal samples was contaminated with
glandular tissue of the reproductive tract). The remaining data were again subjected
to network analysis (r = 0.90) producing a graph composed of 5,199 nodes/195,272
edges [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>, Figure S2] which was
clustered using an MCL inflation value of 1.7 (the lower inflation value reducing the
overall number of clusters). The resulting cluster analysis of 120 clusters with a
membership between 801 and 5 probesets, was then explored in order to annotate the
most likely cellular source of the expression signatures observed. This was aided by
reference to the cluster analysis of the whole dataset.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BMC: bone marrow cells; BMDM: bone marrow-derived macrophages; CNS: central nervous

Expression profiles of selected gene family members/functionally
related genes along the length of the GI tract</bold>. A number of gene families
were selected and the profile of specific members investigated. <bold>A</bold>. The
keratins are a large gene family where the expression of individual members is
associated with specific classes of epithelial/dermal layers. In this case there
are numerous family members expressed in the stratified squamous epithelia of the
tongue and esophagus whereas others are expressed specifically in columnar
epithelia of the mid to lower GI tract. <bold>B</bold>. Expression of digestive enzymes
is in most cases restricted to the small intestinal enterocytes but individual
patterns of expression along the longitudinal axis of the region do vary in line
with requirements. <bold>C</bold>. In common with the genes shown in B, expression of
the solute transporters associated with absorption mirrors the requirement for
their activity being expressed in a region-specific manner along the small and
large intestine. <bold>D</bold>. Mucins play a crucial role in the lubrication and
protection of the GI tract. The profiles of a number of gene family members are
shown, some of which are highly expressed in the salivary gland (<italic>MUC12,
MUC19</italic>), others in the stomach (<italic>MUC1, MUC5AC</italic>) and <italic>MUC4</italic>'s
expression is restricted to the colon. <bold>E</bold>. Regulating many aspects of GI
function are a range of hormones expressed by endocrine cells that line the organ.
The expression of the hormone genes shown here is largely restricted to the
stomach and duodenum. <bold>F</bold>. Expression of T and B cell marker genes whose
expression peaks in the ileum where the immune cell content of the organ is at its
highest. <bold>G</bold>. Myosins are essential components of muscle fibers and are
utilized differently in different types of muscle. In this case they segregate
according to the distribution of skeletal muscle (tongue, esophagus) or smooth
muscle (other regions). <bold>H</bold>. Many collagens are required for the formation of
the extracellular matrix that is a major component of connective tissues and is
produced by various mesenchymal cells types particularly fibroblasts. These genes
are consequently observed to be expressed along the entire GI tract albeit in a
region-dependent manner.</p></caption><media xlink:href="1741-7007-10-90-S5.PDF"><caption><p>Click here for file</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S6"><caption><title>Additional file 6</title><p><bold>Figure S2. <italic>Screenshots of the GI tract transcriptional network in 2D and
