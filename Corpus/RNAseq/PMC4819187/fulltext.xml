Thus, the objectives of this work are to study NOS1 and NOS-related counterparts involved in regulating physiological function of myocyte, to analyze NOS1 localisation, activity, dimerisation, and its relationship with systolic function in ICM. The study has been carried out on left ventricular tissue obtained from explanted human hearts. Here we demonstrate that the upregulation of cardiac NOS1 is not accompanied by an increase in NOS activity, due in part to the alterations found in molecules involved in the regulation of its activity. We observed partial translocation of NOS1 to the sarcolemma in ischemic hearts, and a direct relationship between its protein levels and systolic ventricular function. Our findings indicate that NOS1 may be significant in the pathophysiology of human ischemic heart disease with a preservative role in maintaining myocardial homeostasis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) is a major cause of heart failure (HF) and represents an enormous medical and societal burden with significant attributable morbidity and mortality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Dysregulation of nitric oxide, and increased oxidative and nitrosative stress are implicated in the pathogenesis of HF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Nitric oxide produced in the heart by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is an important modulator of myocardial function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Three NOS isoforms have been identified in the heart: neuronal (NOS1), inducible (NOS2), and endothelial (NOS3), all associated with calmodulin (CaM). Nitric oxide derived from NOS1 and NOS3 has important effects on contractility of cardiomyocytes. NOS1 is preferentially located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) where it is associated with the ryanodine receptor Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel (RyR). NOS3 resides in sarcolemma caveolae and in endothelial cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. On the other hand, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor of NOS regulated by GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) which facilitates electron transfer from NOS reductase domain, stimulates nitric oxide synthesis, and maintains and stabilises NOS dimers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>The role of NOS1 as a major modulator of cardiac function and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes has been extensively studied in experimental models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In addition to CaM, NOS1 protein and mRNA binds a number of other molecules that alter its activity or expression, such as heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), protein inhibitor of NOS1 (PIN: <italic>DYNLL1</italic> gene), NOS interacting protein (NOSIP), and <italic>Mm-antiNOS1</italic> RNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Furthermore, NOS1 negatively regulates the activity of myocardial xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. A significant increase in NOS1 mRNA and protein expression, NOS1 translocation from the SR to the sarcolemma, has been reported in human non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and animal models of HF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.

Next, we investigated the potential relationships between the protein levels of NOS1 and the LV function and haemodynamic parameters in the ICM group. The complete parameters of LV function were available in 18 of 20 samples and cardiac index in 13 of 20 samples. Interestingly, as showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, we found a significant relationship between the LV ejection fraction and the NOS1 level (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.63, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). We obtained a statistical trend between this protein and cardiac index (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.484, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.094).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Nitric oxide synthase 1 translocation in human ischemic hearts</title><p>Immunofluorescence experiments revealed partial translocation of NOS1 from the SR to the sarcolemma in ICM hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). No fluorescent signal was observed when samples were only incubated with secondary antibody (not shown). In order to more specifically assess the subcellular localisation of NOS1, we studied protein-protein interactions of NOS1 with caveolin 3 (membrane protein) and also with RyR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Levels of caveolin 3-NOS1 were increased in the ICM group compared to the CNT group (171&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;79&#x02009;au versus 100&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;62&#x02009;au, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). In contrast, levels of RyR-NOS1 were decreased in the ICM group (47&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;21&#x02009;au versus 100&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;27&#x02009;au, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). The reverse experiment, co-immunoprecipitation of NOS1 with caveolin 3 or RyR by western blotting, confirmed these results. We found similar caveolin 3 and RyR protein levels when we compared pathological hearts with CNTs (96&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;25&#x02009;au versus 100&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;26&#x02009;au and 97&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11&#x02009;au versus 100&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10&#x02009;au, respectively). These findings demonstrate that a significant amount of NOS1 is translocated from the SR to the membrane, where it interacts with caveolin 3.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrates the presence of important alterations in different NOS-related counterparts involved in regulation of physiological function of cardiomyocyte in cardiac tissue of ICM patients. We found relevant changes in NOS1 expression and localisation as well as in some closely related molecules involved in the regulation of its activity. No changes were observed in NOS1 activity. In addition, we found a significant relationship between NOS1 protein levels and systolic ventricular function.</p><p>Increased NOS1 levels in failing myocardium did not necessarily translate into higher nitric oxide production rates. We found a substantial increase in the gene and protein levels of NOS1 in ICM hearts in absence of change in its activity. In addition, we observed a decrease in the gene and protein levels of GCH1, the rate-limiting enzyme in BH4 biosynthesis. Thus, we obtained alterations in the enzymatic system of the main cofactor of NOS1 in human ischemic hearts. Furthermore, NOS1 is highly regulated, requiring binding of CaM, HSP90, NOSIP, and PIN (<italic>DYNLL1</italic> gene) for its activity, and several signalling pathways initiate NOS activity by raising intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. We found upregulation of <italic>CALM2, CALM3, NOSIP,</italic> and <italic>DYNLL1</italic>, and downregulation of <italic>HSP90AA1</italic> in the pathological group. Our results demonstrate that the increase found in cardiac NOS1 expression is not accompanied by an increase in its activity in ICM hearts, probably due in part to the alterations observed in the other molecules involved in the regulation of NOS1 activity. On the other hand, earlier studies on the directionality of changes in NOS2 and NOS3 isoforms in HF are contradictory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. These discrepancies could be due to differences in the underlying cause of development of HF. In our study, we did not observe changes in these isoforms.</p><p>The central role of cardiac SR and its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling proteins, including RyRs, SERCA2a, and phospholamban (PLB), in excitation-contraction coupling is well known<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. NOS1 is normally located in the SR, where it associates with RyR and XOR, and where it is involved in the functions of calcium-handling molecules. The translocation of NOS1 from the SR to the sarcolemma has been reported in various animal models of HF and in human non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Our results precisely demonstrate this specific subcellular change from the cytosol to the plasmatic membrane, in human hearts with ICM, where this enzyme interacts with caveolin 3. This alteration would result not only in reduced NOS1&#x02013;RyR colocalisation leading to reduced RyR S-nitrosylation, but also in suppressed inhibition of XOR leading to increased O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In addition, we observed upregulation of XOR in the pathological hearts. Taking into account the loss of XOR inhibition and the increase of XOR protein, we suggest these mechanisms as important contributors to myocardial redox state in agreement with the previously published studies involving rodents and non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Moreover, the increased nitric oxide production in caveolae may enhance feedback inhibition of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and decrease local nitric oxide in the SR, thus disrupting the normal regulation of RyR2 and SERCA2a. In HF, the level and the activity of SERCA2a are decreased, contributing directly to impaired cardiac contraction and relaxation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. As was expected, we found downregulation of <italic>SERCA2a</italic> in our study. It has been reported that SERCA2a is impaired in the absence of NOS1. Taking into consideration all these changes, translocation of NOS1 from the SR to the sarcolemma may have relevant effects on myocardial contractility. Besides, we observed alterations in the expression of <italic>RyR3</italic> and not in that of <italic>RyR2</italic>; this could open an unexplored area of research on the role of this isoform in HF.</p><p>Furthermore, we found a significant relationship between NOS1 protein levels and LV ejection fraction. This result is in agreement with the previously published studies using experimental models since NOS1 has been shown to act as a major modulator of cardiac function. NOS1 in the LV myocardium of chronically infarcted animals appears to attenuate adverse LV remodeling and functional deterioration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> Our results provide novel evidence suggesting that NOS1 plays a crucial role in the remodeling of human ICM. A remarkable finding was the positive correlation between the level of NOS1 protein and the LV systolic function indicating that an increased NOS1 level is associated with a better ventricular performing. From these findings and taking into account the previously published literature involving experimental HF models, we infer that NOS1 may delay the development of HF due to its involvement in the myocardial response to injury in ischemic conditions. Thus, the increased levels of NOS1 could be a mechanism to compensate the loss of its activity. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the upregulation of cardiac NOS1 in absence of increase in NOS1 activity could improve the ventricular function are unknown. We can find a possible explanation in the relocation of the enzyme, possibly nitric oxide released in the sarcolemma may be affecting a different profile of proteins also involved in the regulation of ventricular function in ischemic hearts. In this sense, more studies are needed to assess this point.</p><p>Dimerisation is a requirement for catalytic activity of NOS. The dimeric form catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of nitric oxide, while the monomeric form catalyzes the synthesis of O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, a highly reactive oxidant species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In this work, dimeric and monomeric NOS1 concentrations were higher in the ICM group; however, we did not find differences in the dimer/monomer NOS1 ratio. Notably, the dimer conformation or the distribution of NOS1 between the monomeric and dimeric forms did not change in ischemic hearts in contrast with the results of the previous studies involving other pathologic conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. In this sense, the pathophysiological relevance of the distribution of NOS1 between monomeric and dimeric forms in ICM seems questionable.</p><p>A common limitation of studies in which the cardiac tissues used are obtained from end-stage failing human hearts is that disease etiology and treatments vary considerably. However, we ensured that our study population was etiologically homogeneous.</p><p>In summary, we detected differentially expressed genes involved in the regulation of physiological function of myocyte by NOS in ventricular tissue of ICM patients. We demonstrate that the upregulation of cardiac NOS1 is not accompanied by an increase in NOS1 activity, due in part to the alterations found in molecules involved in the regulation of its activity. We observed partial translocation of NOS1 to the sarcolemma in ischemic hearts, and a direct relationship between its levels and LV ventricular function. These results suggest that NOS1 may be important in the pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction in ischemic heart disease with a preservative role in maintaining myocardial homeostasis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Collection of samples</title><p>LV tissue samples were obtained from 30 explanted human hearts: 20 from patients with ICM and 10 from non-diseased CNTs.

The membranes were blocked overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with 1% BSA in Tris buffer solution containing 0.05% Tween 20 and thereafter, were incubated for 2&#x02009;hours with the primary antibody in the same buffer. The primary detection antibodies used were anti-NOS1 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:100, obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, INC), anti-XOR rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:4000, obtained from Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-GCH1 rabbit polyclonal (1:1000, obtained from Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and anti-GAPDH mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000, obtained from Abcam, Cambridge, UK) as a loading control.</p><p>The bands were visualized using an acid phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) substrate system. Finally, the bands were digitalized using an image analyzer (DNR Bio-Imagining Systems, Israel) and quantified with the GelQuant Pro (v. 12.2) program.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Nitric oxide synthase 1 activity</title><p>Total NOS and NOS1 activity were measured using radiochemical detection of L-arginine to L-citrulline conversion, as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Briefly, separation of the products of L-arginine metabolism was obtained by ion exchange chromatography (Jasco Ltd.) and on-line radiochemical scintillation detection (Lablogic Systems Ltd). Recorded data were analysed using Azur software (Datalys, France).

After centrifugation (13,000&#x02009;rpm for 10&#x02009;mins at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C), the supernatant was then incubated for 30&#x02009;mins on ice with added NOS cofactors except BH4 (i.e., 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;mol/L FAD, 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;mol/L FMN, 1&#x02009;mmol/L NADPH), in the presence or absence of either the non-specific NOS inhibitor, L-NAME (1&#x02009;mmol/L), or the NOS1-selective inhibitor SMTC (100&#x02009;nmol/L), followed by 4&#x02009;hours incubation at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with 3&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of labelled<sup> 14</sup>C L-arginine (Amersham Biosciences UK Ltd.). Trichloroacetic acid (10%) was then added to de-proteinate the samples, prior to centrifugation. The supernatant was placed into the auto-sampler cooled to 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for chromatographic analysis. Standards of <sup>14</sup>C-labelled Larginine (1&#x02009;&#x003bc;mol/L), L-citrulline (0.1&#x02009;&#x003bc;mol/L), and L-ornithine (0.2&#x02009;&#x003bc;mol/L, all from Amersham Bioscience UK Ltd.) were used to determine elution time. Chromatographic peaks were integrated and expressed as a proportion of total <sup>14</sup>C counts for each sample. Results were expressed as the L-NAME- or SMTC-inhibitable fraction.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Fluorescence microscopy</title><p>Frozen muscular sections were transferred to glass slides and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15&#x02009;minutes at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.
