This suggests that PRC2 functions in the transition from cardiac progenitor to differentiated cardiomyocyte.</p><p id="P4">To determine the function of PRC2 in mouse heart, we inactivated Ezh2 by Cre-mediated recombination in a subpopulation of cardiac progenitors known as the anterior heart field (AHF), which contribute to the right ventricle, interventricular septum, and outflow tract<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Mice with loxP sites flanking the catalytic domain-encoding region of Ezh2 (<italic>Ezh2<sup>fl/lf</sup></italic>)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> were crossed with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the <italic>Mef2cAHF</italic> enhancer (<italic>Mef2cAHF::Cre</italic>), which is active from embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.

H3K27me3 levels were not reduced in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). Mice with <italic>Ezh2</italic>-deficient AHF cells developed normally structured hearts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). However, <italic>Ezh2</italic>-deficient hearts became enlarged after birth, with increased heart weight to tibia length ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Cardiac enlargement was restricted to the right ventricular wall, in which cardiac myocytes were massively hypertrophied, with an almost fourfold increase in cross-sectional area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). Echocardiography confirmed right ventricular enlargement and showed mild pulmonary stenosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Cardiomyocytes were already enlarged in E20 fetuses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>), ruling out altered hemodynamics as a primary cause of hypertrophy. <italic>Ezh2</italic>-deficient right ventricles were fibrotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>), and the endocardium was invaginated into the ventricular myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), resembling ventricular non-compaction<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.

Upon loss of Ezh2, Six1 might activate transcription of a skeletal muscle genes subset in cardiomyocytes, contributing to instability of cardiac gene expression.</p><p id="P10">We addressed the relevance of increased <italic>Six1</italic> expression in deregulating gene expression in Ezh2-deficient hearts. Quantitative real time PCR (QRTPCR) confirmed <italic>Six1</italic> de-repression in early developing ventricular myocardium (E10) and exclusively in the adult <italic>Ezh2</italic>-deficient right ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), consistent with specific repression by <italic>Ezh2</italic>. At E13.5, in newborn, and adult hearts, <italic>Six1</italic> expression was increased in <italic>Ezh2</italic>-deficient right ventricular myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>), and <italic>Eya1</italic> was derepressed exclusively in adult cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).
