Here, we perform transcriptome analysis of 153 samples representing lung adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, large cell lung cancer, adenoid cystic carcinomas and cell lines. By integrating our data with The Cancer Genome Atlas and published sources, we analyze 753 lung cancer samples for gene fusions and other transcriptomic alterations. We show that higher numbers of gene fusions is an independent prognostic factor for poor survival in lung cancer. Our analysis confirms the recently reported CD74-NRG1 fusion and suggests that NRG1, NF1 and Hippo pathway fusions may play important roles in tumors without known driver mutations. In addition, we observe exon skipping events in c-MET, which are attributable to splice site mutations. These classes of genetic aberrations may play a significant role in the genesis of lung cancers lacking known driver mutations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and is histologically classified as either non&#x02013;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC accounts for 80% of all lung cancers with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) representing the major subtypes and large cell lung cancer (LCLC) and lung adenoid cystic carcinomas (LACC) the minor subtypes.

Recent analyses by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) of both LUSC<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and LUAD<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> revealed recurrent mutations and recurrent copy number alterations in genes that present in both subtypes and also specific to each.

In addition to driver somatic gene mutations, oncogenic gene fusions including the <italic>EML4-ALK</italic> fusion gene have been identified in approximately 4% of LUAD<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. This fusion protein links the N-terminal portion of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) with the intracellular signaling portion of a receptor tyrosine kinase, the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK).

Our &#x0201c;UMICH cohort&#x0201d;, samples included 67 LUAD, 36 LUSC (64 stage I, 17 stage II and 22 stage III patients), 9 LCLC, 11 LACC, 24 lung cancer cell lines and 6 matched nonmalignant lung samples. Eighty-two patients were heavy smokers (&#x0003e;20 pack years), 13 were light-smokers (defined by &#x0003c;20 pack years) and smoking status of 15 patients was unknown (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The median smoking pack years was 45 (range, 2 &#x02013; 300). The average follow-up was 5.05 years. Sample acquisition details are provided in the <bold>Methods</bold> section. To increase the power of our analysis and to discover recurrent fusions, we included two publically available NSCLC datasets from TCGA and Korean LUAD (SEOUL cohort) studies<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and assembled a RNASeq cohort that totaled 753 patient tumors.

For each sample we determined the mutation status of oncogenes and tumor suppressors known to play a role in lung cancer<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and reflected the previously reported mutational landscape of LUAD and LUSC (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. <italic>KRAS</italic> was mutated in 30.1% and 1.6% of LUAD and LUSC respectively; <italic>EGFR</italic> in 13% and 1.6 of LUAD and LUSC; <italic>BRAF</italic> in 8% and 3.2% of LUAD and LUSC and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> in 7.6% and 13.5% of LUAD and LUSC respectively.

The pattern observed in LCLC is consistent with a recent report<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> supporting their reclassification into either LUAD or LUSC based on shared genetic aberrations.</p><p id="P10">In LACC, despite the small sample size, we observed a higher frequency of <italic>RAS/RAF</italic> pathway mutations (72%, 8/11) compared to the major NSCLC subtypes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The mutations were mutually exclusive, where five samples with <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations had <italic>KRAS</italic><sup>G12C, G12V, G13C, G12D, Q61H</sup> variants respectively, while <italic>BRAF</italic><sup>V600E</sup>, <italic>HRAS</italic><sup>Q61L</sup>, and <italic>NRAS</italic><sup>Q61R</sup> were observed in three independent samples.

While 2 LACC samples had no mutations reported in COSMIC, one sample harbored an <italic>IDH1</italic><sup>V178I</sup> variant. Interestingly, <italic>MYB-NF1</italic> gene fusions were absent in the lung ACC, unlike the salivary gland-ACC where it occurs in 57% of cases<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Likewise, <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations were common in LACC, but none were detected in the 60 salivary-ACCs sequenced recently<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. However, in the salivary-ACC cohort a potential driver <italic>HRAS</italic> non-synonymous mutation was noted to be mutually exclusive with <italic>MYB</italic> gene fusion. Another recent study identified activating <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>HRAS</italic> mutations in breast adenoid cystic carcinoma (BACC) samples that were a distinct subset of triple negative breast cancers<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Hence the previous report on BACC and our results here on LACC have identified distinct ACC subsets that harbor activating RAS/RAF mutations but lack MYB fusions that are primarily found in head and neck ACC, revealing differences in underlying molecular events despite histological similarities. Due to the small cohort size and lack of significant fusion events in LCLC and LACC samples, these cohorts were excluded from the fusion analysis presented below.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>NSCLC Fusion Landscape</title><p id="P11">In order to generate comparable results across samples from different cohorts, we developed a consistent data-driven gene fusion prediction pipeline and analysis workflow shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> (also see <bold>Methods</bold>). We detected 6,348 unique fusions among the 733 samples for an average of 13 fusions per tumor sample (range: 0&#x02013;67). Although both LUAD and LUSC had a comparably high single nucleotide mutation rate of 8.1 mutations/Mb<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> they differed in the average number of fusions per sample with 11 fusions in LUAD, and 17 in LUSC (Student&#x02019;s t-test <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;2.2e-16). We did not observe a statistically significant difference in average number of fusions among heavy and light smokers (LUAD Student&#x02019;s t-test <italic>P</italic>=0.06; LUSC Student&#x02019;s t-test <italic>P</italic>=0.59) among different clinical stages and regardless of the tumor type (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).

As most LUSC have somatic mutations in <italic>TP53</italic><sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, this difference is consistent with the average number of fusions between LUAD and LUSC samples. In LUAD, we observed a significant correlation between the presence of oncogenic mutations (e.g., <italic>KRAS</italic> activating mutations) and <italic>TP53</italic> deleterious mutations (stop codon or splice site mutations) and the number of fusions (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test <italic>P</italic>=0.008).

Statistically significant clinical covariates in the univariate Cox model (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) were used in the multivariate analysis to examine the prognostic value of fusion number.

Interestingly, the <italic>SDC4-NRG1</italic> index sample with the highest <italic>NRG1</italic> outlier expression (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>, <italic>NRG1</italic> expression: 380FPKM, higher than the cell line H1793) did not show high <italic>HNF4A</italic> expression, suggesting that <italic>NRG1</italic> fusions with partners other than <italic>CD74</italic> are perhaps more prevalent in non-mucinous LUAD<italic>. NRG1</italic> rearrangements have also been detected using FISH in breast cancer cell lines<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. Moreover, <italic>NRG1</italic> over-expression was recently demonstrated in a subset of breast clinical tumor samples, and was mutually exclusive with <italic>HER2</italic> mutations<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. These observations together with our results from lung and ovarian cancers suggest that <italic>NRG1</italic> rearrangements are recurrent and likely drivers of various cancers types.</p><p id="P27">The therapeutic targeting of NRG1-ERBB autocrine loop was previously suggested<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> and recently blocking NRG1 and other ligand-mediated HER4 signaling shown to enhance the magnitude and duration of the chemotherapeutic response of NSCLC<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. Therefore, the characterization of all <italic>NRG1</italic> fusions presented in this study, as well as the common signaling pathways activated in both fusion and outlier expression index samples could further elucidate NRG1 mechanism of action and reveal further therapeutic opportunities.</p><p id="P28">Our integrative analysis combining mutation and fusion status extended previous observations of <italic>c-MET</italic> exon skipping and <italic>NF1</italic> truncating mutations. We detect novel truncating fusions involving several tumor suppressor genes such as <italic>NF1, NF2, TP53</italic> (data not shown)<italic>, LATS1, DCHS2, FAT1, SMARCA4, TAOK1</italic> and <italic>TAOK3</italic> among others. These results highlight gene fusions as potentially common and a previously underappreciated mechanism for loss of function of many tumor suppressor genes. In summary, Hippo pathway fusions (2.6%), <italic>NRG1</italic> fusion/outlier expression (3.9%), <italic>NF1</italic> truncating mutations/fusions (6.2%) and c-<italic>MET</italic> exon skipping (3.6%) account for ~16% of driver-unknown lung cancer cases, and expanding the repertoire of lung cancer molecular subtypes. The previously documented success of targeted therapies against low recurrence oncogenic fusions and the heterogeneity of the fusion landscape, demonstrated in this study, reinforce the demand for personalized molecularly targeted drug therapies in lung cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Sample Acquisition and Total RNA isolation</title><p id="P29">We collected tumor samples from 67 LUAD, 36 LUSC, 9 LCLC patients along with 6 matched normal lung tissues samples following surgery at the University of Michigan. The recruitment of subjects and informed consent were reviewed and approved by our Institutional Review Board. The publically available dataset from TCGA was downloaded using the TCGA portal and the Seoul data from dbGAP. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections from 11 adenoid cystic carcinoma samples were from IRCCS AOU San Martino-IST, Genova, Italy. The 24 lung cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured following their media and growth conditions. Total RNA from frozen tissues or cell lines were isolated using miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Valencia, CA) while RNA was isolated from FFPE sections using FFPE RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). Only high quality RNA from frozen sections and cell lines with RNA integrity number (RIN) &#x0003e;8.0, upon 2100 Bioanalyzer analysis (Agilent Santa Clara, CA) were subjected to RNA sequencing (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Preparation of RNASeq Libraries and Sequencing</title><p id="P30">Transcriptome libraries were prepared following a previously described protocol for generating strand-specific RNASeq libraries with slight modifications<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Libraries were next size selected in the range of 350 bps after resolving in a 3% Nusieve 3:1 (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) agarose gel and DNA recovered using QIAEX II gel extraction reagent (Qiagen). Libraries were barcoded during the 14-cycle PCR amplification with Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Library quality was estimated with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer for size and concentration. The paired end libraries were sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2000 (2&#x000d7;100bases, read length).

The PCR product was gel purified and cloned into pLenti-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and Sanger sequencing verified. The control LacZ or C-terminal V5 tagged CD74-NRG1 constructs were transfected into the normal lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells. The stable cells were generated following selection in BEBM media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) containing 3 micrograms of blasticidin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For proliferation assays, 50,000 cells were plated in 12-well plates and grown in regular media. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and counted manually at indicated time points. All assays were performed in quadruplicates. For migration assays, stable cells were re-suspended in medium without growth factors, then seeded at 50,000 cells per well into Boyden chambers (8 &#x003bc;m pore size, BD Biosciences) and were incubated for 24 hours in a humidified incubator at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO2 atmosphere. The bottom chamber contained medium with growth factors as chemo-attractant. The top non-migrating cells were removed with a cotton swab moistened with medium and the lower surface of the membrane was stained with Diff-Quick Stain Set (Siemens). The number of cells migrating to the basal side of the membrane was visualized with an Olympus microscope at 20x magnification. Pictures of five random fields from 4 wells were obtained and the number of stained cells was quantified.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Sequence Alignment, Fusion and Mutation Calling</title><p id="P32">Sequence alignment was performed using the Tuxedo pipeline: Bowtie2 (Bowtie2/2.0.2) and Tophat2 (TopHat/2.0.6)<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>. Fusion calling was performed with TopHat-fusion<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> (THF) on the UMICH, TCGA and Seoul cohorts. Additional details and parameter values used for sequence alignment and fusion calling are provided in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Fusion Annotation and Lung Cancers Fusions Database</title><p id="P33">A database of fusions in lung cancers was developed, and for each fusion structural and functional annotation was recorded. The structural information corresponds to characteristics such as fusion type (inter-chromosomal, intra-chromosomal, tandem-duplication), number of spanning and encompassing reads, median alignment quality of reads that support 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; gene, among others (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>). The functional annotation corresponds to features such as kinase status, oncogene status and tumor suppressor status among others. Moreover, the gene expression of the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; partner genes was calculated in fragments per-kilo base per million (FPKM) using Cufflinks<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> and stored in the database. Furthermore, the outlier sum score<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> was independently calculated for the expression of both 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; partners in order to identify fusion cases for which the 3&#x02032; gene partner was highly expressed relative to its median expression in the cohort. Overexpression of the 3&#x02032;-partner as consequence of gene fusions has been observed in well-known fusions such as <italic>TMPRSS2-ERG</italic> and others<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>. Finally, we also recorded the mutation status for each patient, allowing us to classify each patient as &#x0201c;driver positive&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;driver negative&#x0201d; according to mutation status of well-known cancer related genes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Fusions Classifier</title><p id="P34">All fusion-calling algorithms produce a significant number of false positive fusions when applied on RNASeq data. Many of these spurious fusions are due to diverse and difficult to model bioinformatics, sequencing and biological factors such as: template switching and chimeric events associated with amplicon regions among others<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>. Therefore, we developed a classifier in order to prioritize fusions for follow up based on the structural and functional features collected for each fusion, which were described above and stored in our fusion&#x02019;s database.</p><p id="P35">THF called 31304 fusions across the combined cohort, making the task of separating false positive fusions from potentially true ones far from trivial. We first reason that functional fusion proteins have open reading frames (ORFs); therefore fusions in which the exon of one gene is fused to the intron of another or two introns are fused together would not produce fusion products with ORFs. This first level filtering reduced to 6465 the number of fusions to classify. Then, we reason that fusions found in normal samples, fusions involving pseudogenes, lincRNAs, or antisense transcripts and fusions for which the median alignment quality of reads supporting any of the gene partners was equal to zero (indicating multi-mapping) are potentially false positives, and there were excluded from downstream analysis. This second level filtering reduced to 4990 the number of fusions called by THF. Because assessing the quality of each one of those fusions manually is impractical, we built a random forest classifier to prioritize what fusions to follow up out those 4990 gene fusions.</p><p id="P36">For the classification step, we train a random forest classifier with 10000 trees using the structural, functional and expression features described above (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>). True positives examples were selected from the TCGA, Seoul and UMICH cohorts. On one hand, the examples chosen from the TCGA and Seoul cohorts correspond to well-known fusions involving ALK, RET and ROS1 kinases. On the other, the examples chosen from the UMICH cohort correspond to fusions called by at least two independent algorithms, carefully curated manually and validated by PCR (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data 4</xref>). False positive examples were selected representing different types of spurious fusions: e.g. overlapping genes, fusions involving highly expressed genes such as ribosomal proteins among others. After applying the classifier, we obtained 422 high quality gene fusions. Taken together our approach allowed us to efficiently prioritize the initial set of 31,304 fusions reported by THF, filtering out potential false positives. Finally, open reading frame prediction and protein domain retention analysis were performed in recurrent fusions or biologically interesting fusions found in this final set of 422 fusions.</p><p id="P37">An additional advantage of using a classifier to determine the potential true fusions, as opposed to hard filters defined a priori, is that we can learn those features or rules from the data itself. In our dataset, the top five features that contributed the most for the random forest classifier were, in decreasing order of importance, fusion type (Inter-chromosomal, Intra-chromosomal, Tandem-duplication), sum of the median alignment quality of both gene partners, number of reads spanning and encompassing reads across the fusion junction and the cohort normalized expression value of the 3&#x02032; gene (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p id="P38">Two additional sets of true fusions were left out of the training dataset to calculate the recovery rate. First, a set of 11 fusions called in the Seoul cohort<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and validated by PCR by the same authors, and a second set of 15 fusions called in the UMICH cohort by THF, and validated by PCR. In the first of these datasets, our classifier recovered 10 out 11 true fusions for a 90.1% recovery rate (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). In the second set, the classifier recovered 14 out 15 validated fusions for a 93.3% recovery rate (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S19"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS643650-supplement-1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1973" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><p>We would like to thank Daniel Miller, Terrence Barrette, Marcin Cieslik for NGS data processing pipeline and analysis, Jyoti Athanikar and Karen Giles for critically reading the manuscript and submission, Xia Jia and John Prensner for experimental assistance.</p><p><bold>Grant Support</bold></p><p>This research is supported in part by the National Institutes of Health through grant R01CA154365 to (DGB and AMC) and through the University of Michigan&#x02019;s Cancer Center Support Grant (5 P30 CA46592).
