It is commonly assumed that the expression level of a microRNA is directly correlated with its repressive activity &#x02013; that is, highly expressed microRNAs will repress their target mRNAs more. Here we investigate the quantitative relationship between endogenous microRNA expression and repression for 32 mature microRNAs in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> S2 cells. In general, we find that more abundant microRNAs repress their targets to a greater degree. However, the relationship between expression and repression is nonlinear, such that a 10-fold greater microRNA concentration produces only a 10% increase in target repression. The expression/repression relationship is the same for both dominant guide microRNAs and minor mature products (so-called passenger strands/microRNA* sequences). However, we find examples of microRNAs whose cellular concentrations differ by several orders of magnitude, yet induce similar repression of target mRNAs. Likewise, microRNAs with similar expression can have very different repressive abilities. We show that the association of microRNAs with Argonaute proteins does not explain this variation in repression. The observed relationship is consistent with the limiting step in target repression being the association of the microRNA/RISC complex with the target site. These findings argue that modest changes in cellular microRNA concentration will have minor effects on repression of targets.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/G022623/1 to AK, SGJ; BB/H017801/1 SH, MR] <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bbsrc.ac.uk/home/home.aspx">http://bbsrc.ac.uk/home/home.aspx</ext-link> Wellcome Trust (PhD studentship to MN] <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk">http://www.wellcome.ac.uk</ext-link>.

First discovered as critical regulators of developmental timing in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic><xref rid="pone.0104286-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, microRNAs have since been found to function in almost all cellular processes in animals and plants <xref rid="pone.0104286-He1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Reinhart1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. MicroRNAs are approximately 22 nucleotides in length, generated from large primary transcripts that form imperfect stem loop structures. MicroRNAs regulate gene expression by binding to target mRNAs and promoting transcript degradation or inhibiting translation <xref rid="pone.0104286-Bartel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>MicroRNA biogenesis is orchestrated by a well-conserved set of proteins and enzymes. In animals, the nuclear RNase III enzyme, Drosha, cuts the primary (pri-) microRNA to leave a &#x0223c;70 nt hairpin sequence called the precursor (pre-) microRNA <xref rid="pone.0104286-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104286-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Exportin-5 then exports the pre-microRNA out of the nucleus where it is cleaved by the cytoplasmic RNase III enzyme Dicer-1 and its partner Loquacious (Loqs) to form a &#x0223c;22 nt double-stranded duplex <xref rid="pone.0104286-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104286-Tsutsumi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In order to repress a target mRNA, the microRNA duplex associates with an Argonaute (Ago) family protein, which constitutes the core of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) <xref rid="pone.0104286-Kawamata1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The arm of the duplex that is incorporated into RISC mediates association with target mRNAs by complementary base pairing <xref rid="pone.0104286-Bartel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. MicroRNAs and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) share much of the same pathway, but differ to some degree in their use of specific Dicer and Argonaute protein paralogs. For example, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, Dicer-1 and Ago-1 are mainly associated with microRNAs, whilst Dicer-2 and Ago-2 are associated with siRNAs. However, some microRNAs have been found to be significantly associated with Ago-2 <xref rid="pone.0104286-Czech1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Both strands of the mature microRNA duplex have the potential to bind and regulate target transcripts <xref rid="pone.0104286-Okamura1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, in a given cell type or developmental stage, one strand will often accumulate at significantly higher levels. This is normally assumed to be the functional dominant microRNA <xref rid="pone.0104286-Khvorova1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The minor mature product, the so-called microRNA* sequence, is often assumed to be preferentially degraded. There are now several lines of evidence to support the notion that mature microRNA sequences derived from both arms of the hairpin precursor are functional. Firstly, studies in both human cell lines and <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos have demonstrated that some microRNA* sequences are able to repress target sequences <xref rid="pone.0104286-Okamura1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Secondly, presumed microRNA* strands have been shown to be more highly expressed in various organisms and at various developmental stages <xref rid="pone.0104286-Jagadeeswaran1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Ro1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. For example, both stands of miR-10 are expressed in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and the beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, with the dominant mature microRNA switched between the two species <xref rid="pone.0104286-GriffithsJones1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Marco1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The cellular concentration of a microRNA is commonly expected to closely relate to its repressive activity, and indeed is often used as a proxy for activity: a highly expressed microRNA will repress the translation of its target mRNAs more and therefore be more functionally important than a less well expressed microRNA. A common corollary is that the strand of the microRNA duplex that is seen to be more highly expressed is assumed to be the functional mature microRNA <xref rid="pone.0104286-Lau1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The presumption that high expression leads to high activity is also evident in studies that use differential expression to identify microRNAs important in processes such as development or disease, which usually concentrate on microRNAs that are both highly and differentially expressed <xref rid="pone.0104286-Bar1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Kadri1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This paradigm is supported by the observation that the over-expression of many microRNAs leads to dose-dependent decreases in the levels of target mRNAs <xref rid="pone.0104286-Lim2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Sood1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and that the expression of microRNAs and their mRNA targets shows a weak negative correlation <xref rid="pone.0104286-Arora1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>The relationship between microRNA activity and expression is not fully understood in any organism. Here we examine cellular levels of microRNAs and their repressive activities. Overall, we find that more highly expressed microRNAs repress their targets to a greater degree. However, microRNA* passenger strands are not less effective repressors than their dominant partner strands. We also identify microRNAs whose expression differ by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude and yet repress at the same level, and microRNAs with similar expression levels that exhibit a 30% difference in their repressive abilities. These findings demonstrate that microRNA cellular levels alone cannot be used as a reliable proxy for microRNA function, and that significant care is required when interpreting the likely functional consequences of a change in microRNA concentration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Small RNA quantification</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> S2-DRSC cells (Hillary Ashe, University of Manchester) using the Ambion miRvana kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.

To this end, we estimated the relative abundance of microRNAs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> S2 cells using three distinct technologies: Illumina and ABI SOLiD deep sequencing, and microarray hybridization, each with two biological replicates. Although we find differences in the estimates of microRNA abundance, we focus on the trends that are consistent across all three technologies (see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Discussion</xref>). We present the analysis based on the Illumina dataset in the main text, and SOLiD and microarray results are shown in Supplementary Information. The normalized read counts for individual microRNAs from Illumina small RNA deep sequencing spanned 5&#x02013;6 orders of magnitude. We chose a representative set of 16 pairs of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> microRNAs (both presumed guide and passenger strands) that sampled the full range of expression and possessed low sequence similarity to minimize shared targeting with other microRNAs.</p><p>To determine the repressive activity of our selected set of representative microRNAs on mRNA targets, we employed an <italic>in vivo</italic> assay to measure repression mediated by endogenous microRNAs in S2 cells.

B) Relationship of microRNA expression and target repression for 32 mature microRNAs. Repression of target mRNA was determined by dual luciferase reporter assay (see Methods).

Error bars represent standard deviation. The line of best fit was estimated by linear regression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0104286.g001"/></fig><p>As expected, normalized estimates of endogenous microRNA levels from Illumina deep sequencing were positively correlated with the level of repression of their targets, although the correlation is surprisingly modest (Pearson's correlation coefficient r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.43). The correlation between microRNA levels and target repression improves substantially (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.71) when log<sub>10</sub> transformed values of microRNA normalized read counts are used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104286-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104286.s001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104286.s002">S2</xref> for SOLiD and microarray data). We estimated the linear line of best fit between log<sub>10</sub> normalized read counts and target repression. The gradient of this fitted line (10.4; 95% CI 6.6&#x02013;14.2), suggests that, on average, a 10-fold increase in expression is needed to increase repression by approximately 10%. This relationship holds across microRNA expression levels that differ by 5&#x02013;6 orders of magnitude. The level of repression of five low abundance mature microRNAs (let-7-3p, miR-307a-5p, miR-970-5p, miR-1003-5p, miR-34-3p) is not significantly different from the empty control vector (paired t-test; p&#x0003c;0.05). This is unsurprising and consistent with the expectation and observation that target repression depends on microRNA abundance. When we discard these sequences and repeat the analysis, the correlation between microRNA levels and target repression is essentially unchanged (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.67; slope 8.7, 95% CI 6.7&#x02013;10.7).</p><p>However, the level of repression exhibited by specific microRNAs varies greatly from the general trend. For example, there are multiple examples of microRNAs that have similar levels of expression but exhibit very different repression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104286-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). For example, miR-996-3p and miR-986-5p are expressed at similar levels, yet the former represses its target by over 60% while the latter induces less than 25% repression. Conversely, some microRNAs repress targets to similar degrees despite large difference in expression levels; for example miR-1-3p and miR-252-5p repress similarly yet have a more than 100 fold difference in expression levels. We also observe that the most abundant microRNAs (bantam-3p, bantam-5p, miR-184-3p, miR-33-5p, miR-8-3p) repress their targets by similar amounts, despite representing a more than 30-fold difference in expression. Even with these extremely high expression levels, we see no repression of luciferase translation greater than 80%; we therefore suggest that this represents a maximum achievable level of repression by endogenous levels of microRNAs.</p><p>Minor mature products (so-called microRNA* sequences; open points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104286-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) are defined by having lower abundance than their dominant mature microRNA partners. Unsurprisingly, the repression induced by microRNA* sequences is generally lower than that for the guide strands (filled points). However, the repression they mediate exhibits the same concentration vs. repression relationship observed for dominant products. In other words, microRNA* sequences in general repress their targets at approximately the level that is expected given their cellular concentration. We do however note two cases where the minor microRNA* product represses the target more effectively than the dominant arm (bantam and miR-986; compare open and filled points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104286-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), despite lower concentration in the cell.</p><p>In summary, we observe that microRNAs that similarly repress their targets can be expressed at levels that vary over several orders of magnitude. The data therefore clearly show that expression level is not a consistent determinant of repressive activity. Furthermore, almost all investigated microRNA* species are found to exert a repressive effect equivalent to the dominant mature sequences and in proportion to their cellular concentration. In some cases microRNA* strands are better repressors. These findings add significant weight to the growing view that mature sequences derived from both arms of the hairpin precursor have the potential to regulate targets in the cell; in other words, the two alternate mature sequences are not fundamentally different in functional consequence for protein production. To investigate these observations further, we sought to evaluate the influence of factors that might affect microRNA repressive efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Additive repression of multiple microRNAs</title><p>We investigated the possibility that deviation from the expected repressive ability of a microRNA may be artifactual and due to additional microRNAs that target adventitious sites created at the boundaries of the engineered target site in the <italic>Renilla</italic> 3&#x02032;UTR. To this end, we predicted canonical seed-match 7 nt target sequences (as described in <xref rid="pone.0104286-Bartel1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>) for all <italic>Drosophila</italic> microRNAs in the region starting 6 nt upstream of the 5&#x02032; end of the inserted target sequence and ending at 6 nt downstream of its 3&#x02032; end in the luciferase vector, including the inserted sequence (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104286.s008">Table S4</xref>). We then summed the mean normalized read counts for all microRNAs that are predicted to repress the target site, and calculated the correlation with the observed target repression. Expression levels corrected to account for this additive effect correlate only marginally better with repression levels (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.44 vs. r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.40). In the majority of cases however, the cloned target sites are not predicted to be targeted by other expressed microRNAs. We identify 9 cases where the repression of the target could be enhanced by the additional targeting from other expressed microRNAs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104286.s008">Table S4</xref>). Just four of these cases (miR-307a-5p, miR-79-3p, miR-970-5p and miR-308-3p) are targeted by other microRNAs that are expressed at similar or higher levels than the microRNA for which the assay was designed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104286-g001">Figure 1B</xref> shows that miR-79-3p and miR-308-3p are repressed more than expected from the expression level of the specific targeting microRNA alone. We now suggest the increased repression is likely to be due to repression by other microRNAs targeting adventitious sites generated in cloning the target site into the vector.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Target abundance</title><p>It has been predicted that a typical microRNA has approximately 100 targets <xref rid="pone.0104286-Brennecke1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> but this number can vary hugely for different microRNAs. It is therefore conceivable that microRNA activity may depend on the number of target sites for a given microRNA in a cell. For example, a large amount of targeted mRNA could sequester microRNA/RISC, and other targets would therefore be less effectively repressed. Therefore, the levels of expression of targeted mRNAs could have an impact on the availability and consequently the level of microRNA repressive activity. To investigate this relationship, we calculated a measure of the number of target sites for a given microRNA in the cell, and compared with microRNA repressive ability. We predicted canonical seed microRNA targets in 3&#x02032;UTRs of all FlyBase transcripts and obtained expression levels of the target mRNAs from tiling array data <xref rid="pone.0104286-Cherbas1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The number of target sites was then approximated as the sum of the mRNA target abundances multiplied by number of predicted target sites within each mRNA. We find no significant correlation between number of target sites and the ratio between microRNA repression levels and expression levels (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.09) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104286.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We therefore find that target abundance does not significantly affect microRNA repression efficiency in this assay.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>MicroRNA/target duplex stability</title><p>In order to determine whether the stability of the microRNA/target duplex influences repression level, we predicted the free energy of each duplex using RNAhybrid. A number of microRNA/target duplexes display low stability and high repression per expressed copy, including let-7-5p, miR-79-3p, miR-1-3p, miR-308-5p and miR-308-3p. The microRNAs that exhibit the greatest duplex stability show very low repression. Indeed, there is a weak correlation (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.39) between free energy and expression-corrected microRNA repression, calculated as the ratio of microRNA repression and log transformed microRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104286-g002">Figure 2</xref>); i.e. duplex stability and expression-corrected repression are negatively correlated. The GC content of a microRNA highly influences duplex stability, therefore a correlation exists between microRNA GC content and repression relative to expression (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.35). The data therefore show that microRNA/target duplex stability influences but does not explain microRNA repressive ability.</p><fig id="pone-0104286-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0104286.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Relationship between predicted free energy of the microRNA:target duplex and expression-corrected microRNA repression.</title><p>The free energy of 32 chosen microRNA duplexes was predicted by RNAhybrid.

Differential RISC occupancy may therefore be the crucial step modulating target repression. To determine whether Ago-1 associated microRNAs are an improved determinant of microRNA activity, we performed two independent Ago-1 RNA immunoprecipitation experiments and estimated microRNA association using Illumina sequencing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104286-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows the relationship between normalized microRNA read counts from the Ago-1-RIP experiments and the microRNA cellular expression levels. Globally, cellular levels of microRNAs correlate extremely well with Ago-1 associated microRNA levels (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.98). However, there are numerous examples of microRNAs that are present in RISC more than expected from their expression levels (miR-14-3p, miR-317-3p, 275-3p) or less than expected (miR-13a-3p, miR-317-5p, miR-190-3p). MicroRNA association with Ago-1 therefore differs amongst microRNAs, suggesting that occupancy in the RISC is differentially regulated, and could account for some of the discrepancies observed in the repressive ability of individual microRNAs. However, we find that the correlation of Ago-1 microRNA association with microRNA repression is very similar (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.69; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104286-g004">Figure 4</xref>) to cellular microRNA levels versus microRNA repression (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.71; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104286-g001">Figure 1B</xref>); in other words, microRNA repression is not better explained by the amount of microRNA associated with the RISC. Furthermore, it has been shown that Ago association is influenced by many different factors, including the 5&#x02032; nucleotide of the microRNA, microRNA duplex stability, and stability of the microRNA/target duplex <xref rid="pone.0104286-Kawamata1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104286-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Ghildiyal1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104286-Diederichs1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

Although little is known about how the expression of an individual microRNA is related to its activity in vivo, it is a commonly-held view that microRNA expression levels can be used as a proxy of their activity <xref rid="pone.0104286-Lau1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Sood1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Cherbas1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The correct interpretation of all experimental work that uses the microRNA machinery to manipulate gene function requires an understanding of this relationship.</p><p>Overall, we find the relationship between microRNA expression and repression is reasonably well described by a log-linear fit, with a 10-fold increase in expression required for approximately 10% increase in repression. This relationship holds across the entire range of endogenous microRNA expression levels in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. Therefore, to achieve a fixed linear increase in repression of a microRNA target will require an exponential increase in microRNA concentration. This is consistent with the repeated observation that increases in microRNA concentration often have relatively mild effects on the repression of target mRNAs <xref rid="pone.0104286-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Baccarini1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Mullokandov1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Our observations suggest that a 2-fold change in microRNA expression (a common threshold used to identify significant changes in differential expression analysis) would lead to changes in microRNA target levels of only a few percent.</p><p>Our analysis depends on the accurate estimation of microRNA abundance and target repression. It has been previously reported that different expression technologies have different biases <xref rid="pone.0104286-Tian1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. We therefore estimated microRNA expression using three different platforms &#x02013; Illumina and ABI SOLiD sequencing, and a microarray hybridization &#x02013; on the same samples of S2 cell small RNAs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104286.s005">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104286.s006">S2</xref>). Illumina and SOLiD sequencing involve completely different chemistries &#x02013; the former is sequencing by synthesis and the latter by ligation. We might therefore expect any sequence-specific biases introduced by the methodologies to be different. As expected, we find the estimates of abundance of some microRNAs differ between the three platforms. However, the relationship between abundance and repression across a large number of microRNAs holds regardless of the technology used to estimate microRNA levels (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104286.s001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104286.s002">S2</xref>). Indeed, we find that the estimates of the repressive effects of a 10-fold increase in microRNA abundance from ABI SOLiD and microarray datasets fall within the 95% confidence interval calculated from the Illumina dataset. The reproducibility of expression estimates between replicate datasets also differs between technologies (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104286.s004">Figure S4</xref>), with the array data significantly more noisy than the two sequencing technologies. The Illumina data is the most reproducible between replicates, and so we chose to focus on that technology for the Ago ChIP-seq experiment and further analysis.</p><p>A number of factors are known to influence microRNA activity, including number of target sites per mRNA and the degree of complementarity <xref rid="pone.0104286-Mukherji1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Doench1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. For example, repression is affected by varying degrees of complementarity between the microRNA and its target, but to different extents with different microRNAs. Multiple copies of microRNA target sites in the UTRs of reporter constructs have been shown to enable greater levels of repression, and cooperativity has been demonstrated for closely positioned microRNA target sites <xref rid="pone.0104286-Broderick1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. We have attempted to remove the complexity and variability between different microRNAs and target contexts by examining a constrained case where targets have a single perfectly complementary site in a homogeneous cell population. The rate at which the microRNA binds to and dissociates from the target is likely to be slower with these perfectly complementary sites than for seed-match targets <xref rid="pone.0104286-Wee1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. However, it has been shown that reporter assays with fully complementary targets and mismatched targets exhibit similar patterns of repression <xref rid="pone.0104286-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Previous studies have investigated aspects of the relationship between microRNA abundance and microRNA activity in a variety of systems <xref rid="pone.0104286-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Baccarini1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Mullokandov1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Hafner1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. For example, Yang et al. over-expressed microRNAs in vertebrate cells to investigate the relationship between microRNA expression and repressive ability <xref rid="pone.0104286-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. We have chosen instead to study the repressive effects of endogenous levels of microRNAs to eliminate possible issues with differences in microRNA delivery and toxicity at high levels. Some previous studies have also concluded that a threshold level of a microRNA is required for the repression of a target, and that only the most abundant microRNAs effectively repress their targets <xref rid="pone.0104286-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Hafner1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Our data do not directly contradict this view, but we demonstrate clear and measurable repressive effects of microRNAs expressed at 3 to 4 orders of magnitude below the maximum observed endogenous microRNA levels in S2 cells. Indeed, on average, the log-linear relationship between repression and microRNA abundance appears to hold across microRNA expression levels covering 5&#x02013;6 orders of magnitude.</p><p>The log-linear relationship between microRNA expression and repression suggests that there are factors buffering the function of expressed microRNAs, acting on the saturation of a step or component of the overall reaction. There are two apparent candidates for that limiting step: the loading of the microRNA into the RISC complex, and the binding or association of the loaded RISC to the mRNA target. We show that microRNA expression and the levels of microRNAs associated with Ago-1 show a linear relationship across the entire range of microRNA concentrations, suggesting that in general the level of association of a microRNA with the RISC is determined by its cellular abundance; i.e. the association of a microRNA with the RISC is not limiting. We therefore speculate that the dynamics we observe suggest a bottleneck at the point of association and action of RISC with a target mRNA, either due to saturation of target sites on mRNAs, the rate of target site identification, or the proportion of binding events that result in repression. It has been shown that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ago-2 action is not limited by target site identification and initial RISC binding <xref rid="pone.0104286-Wee1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. If target sites of highly expressed microRNAs are nearly completely occupied, a moderate increase in repression would require a massive increase in the number of microRNA molecules in the cell. This may help explain how microRNAs fine tune protein production as well as buffering protein levels, yet still allowing transcriptional regulation to dynamically modulate mRNA levels <xref rid="pone.0104286-Mullokandov1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Mukherji1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Both microRNA and microRNA* sequences are effective repressors</title><p>For the majority of microRNAs, one arm of the microRNA duplex accumulates to a much greater level than the other <xref rid="pone.0104286-Lau1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This is exemplified by the bantam microRNA, which is highly expressed in S2 cells and is involved in a number of important cellular processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, development and the circadian clock <xref rid="pone.0104286-Brennecke2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Kadener1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. The two possible mature microRNAs are found at approximately 50-fold difference in abundance. However, both sequences are effective repressors, with the less abundant -5p sequence actually being the more active repressor. Indeed we observe two microRNAs in which the less abundant strand is a more active repressor of the target sequence, and on average, the less abundant microRNA* sequences tested repress their targets at levels consistent with their expression and similar to their partner dominant strand. The identification of functional capabilities of the non-dominant mature microRNA impacts on work on the identification of targets; for example, some of the observed function of bantam may be attributable to the non-dominant -5p sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Multiple factors influence microRNA activity</title><p>After controlling for the generation of adventitious target sites in the luciferase vector for other microRNAs expressed in S2 cells, only six microRNAs are found to repress their targets at levels greater than expected (bantam-5p, miR-33-5p, miR-8-3p, miR-307a-3p, miR-308-5p and miR-8-3p). However, our analysis identifies a number of microRNAs that repress their targets less than would be expected from their expression levels. We therefore suggest the existence of unidentified limiting factors or processes that down-regulate some microRNA activities, and that there is no evidence for increased microRNA activity above the observed abundance/repression relationship. Recent reports have suggested that target availability may influence microRNA activity in relation to expression, in that a microRNA that represses more abundant targets would be diluted from the pool of available microRNAs <xref rid="pone.0104286-Arvey1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. However, other work contradicts this observation as it has been shown that increasing concentrations of target do not easily saturate microRNA repressive ability <xref rid="pone.0104286-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Indeed, a recent study of the kinetics of target repression for the let-7 microRNA suggests that only microRNA/target pairs with a very narrow range of expression levels are susceptible to perturbation of their activity by decoy RNAs <xref rid="pone.0104286-Wee1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Our data for 32 mature sequences across the complete range of expression levels is in agreement with the latter observation, as we do not observe any correlation between microRNA repressive ability and number and expression levels of predicted targets. These two observations together suggest that the dynamics of target/RISC association is limiting across all concentrations.</p><p>Using our dataset of small RNA sequences from an Ago-1 IP experiment, we show that the efficiency of incorporation of microRNAs into the RISC is relatively consistent and mostly dependent upon microRNA expression levels. Repression correlates similarly with abundance in the Ago-1 dataset and microRNA expression level, and so the rate of Ago-1 association is unable to explain variations in microRNA repression. Argonaute association has been reported to be dependent upon a number of factors including microRNA nucleotide composition, and thermodynamic stability of microRNA duplexes and microRNA:target complexes <xref rid="pone.0104286-Kawamata1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104286-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104286-Ghildiyal1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104286-Diederichs1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Though these factors are undoubtedly relevant, our data do not support a significant correlation of any of these factors with microRNA repressive ability. We do, however, see a weak negative correlation between microRNA/target duplex stability and repressive ability. A single microRNA/RISC complex has been shown to be able to catalyse the cleavage of a number of target molecules <xref rid="pone.0104286-Hutvagner1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Lower stability of the microRNA/target duplex may therefore favour transient interaction with target mRNAs, thus enabling higher processivity of the microRNA and efficient down-regulation of multiple targets.</p><p>Our microRNA expression level measurements assess steady-state levels, which are obviously affected by the balance of production and degradation. Indeed, the half-life of a microRNA will likely have a significant effect on its activity. It has been reported that the stabilities of individual microRNAs are differentially regulated <xref rid="pone.0104286-Bail1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Translin, a DNA/RNA binding protein, has been shown to increase the stability of miR-122, but not other microRNAs, in mice testis. A subset of microRNAs may therefore be bound by RNA binding proteins to alter their stability and consequent repressive ability. Other factors that may influence microRNA stability and activity include methylation, 3&#x02032; nucleotide additions such as uridylation, and the expression of 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exonucleases <xref rid="pone.0104286-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104286-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>.</p><p>Our analyses show that microRNA abundance is positively correlated with repression, but that the relationship is not a straightforward one. We also show that microRNAs expressed at levels differing by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude may elicit similar repressive effects. The ability to predict the magnitude of repression solely from the abundance of a mature microRNA is therefore limited. In particular, we find that microRNA* products often repress targets just as well as, and sometimes better than, the dominant guide strand mature microRNAs. We demonstrate that microRNA/target duplex stability regulates microRNA activity, but it is not sufficient to explain discrepancies between cellular abundance and target repression. The differential association of microRNAs with Ago-1 does not better explain repressive ability, and so we suggest that target repression is subject to unknown factors that down-regulate microRNA activity. On average, the relationship between expression and repression suggests that a 10 fold increase in microRNA abundance is required to produce an approximately 10% increase in repression. This is consistent with a model where microRNA activity is subject to extensive buffering and the rate-limiting step in microRNA activity is at the level of association of the target mRNA with microRNA-loaded RISC complex.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0104286.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>MicroRNA expression (SOLiD read counts) positively correlates with mRNA target repression.</bold> Relationship of microRNA expression and target repression for 32 mature microRNAs.
