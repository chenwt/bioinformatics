Moreover, we find TE expression is highly dependent on the tissue context. This suggests that TE expression may be related to tissue-specific chromatin states or cellular phenotypes. We anticipate that TE-array will provide a scalable method to characterize transposable element RNAs.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Mobile DNA</kwd><kwd>Expression microarray</kwd><kwd>L1 LINE</kwd><kwd>Endogenous retrovirus</kwd><kwd>SINE</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>What fraction of mammalian genomes is transcribed has been the subject of intense debate in the scientific literature as different genome-scale platforms have availed themselves to the question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In analyzing the transcriptome, non-coding RNAs and products from interspersed genomic repeats have lagged in their characterization as compared to annotated genes. The latter highly repetitive sequences are copies of transposable elements (TEs). Though often dismissed as &#x02018;junk DNA&#x02019;, cap-selected RNA analyses have suggested that substantial portions of mammalian transcripts originate within these sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and so they may play significant roles in shaping the functional transcriptome.</p><p>While only about 5-10% of our DNA is attributed to coding sequences and putative functional elements, as much as two thirds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] is recognizable as TE derived. Mammal genomes have been hosts to several kinds of transposons, broadly classified by their method of propagation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). Retrotransposons transcribe an RNA intermediate which is then reverse transcribed into DNA inserted at a new location within the genome. Retrotransposons can be subdivided into autonomous and non-autonomous classes based on whether or not they encode proteins that mediate transposition. Major autonomous retrotransposon families include LINEs (Long INterspersed Elements) and ERVs (endogenous retroviruses). Although in modern mammalian genomes most retrotransposon copies reflect ancient insertions rendered incompetent for future transposition, active members exist and promote genetic diversity by generating new insertions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These include LINEs in humans and mice, and intracisternal A-particle (IAP) ERVs in mice. Major non-autonomous families use LINE-encoded proteins for transposition and include SINEs (Short INterspersed Elements) such as <italic>Alu</italic> elements in primates, and B1 and B2 in rodents. DNA transposons propagate through a DNA based &#x02018;cut-and-paste&#x02019; mechanism and are extinct in human and mouse. The genomic contribution of transposons varies between organisms. Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A shows the percentage of the &#x02018;mobilome&#x02019; owed to each major type of transposon in mouse and human genomes. These proportions reflect homologies of genomic sequence to a manually curated database of repeat consensus sequences, Repbase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Species-specific TE families.

In mouse, most probes are long terminal repeat (LTR) based TE sequences; these include intracisternal A particle (IAP) and VL30 elements. Long INterspersed Elements (LINE) probes make up the next largest category, although they comprise relatively fewer probes on the murine array as compared to the human array.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-14-869-1"/></fig><p>Hosts have evolved several lines of defense to curb the activity of transposons, including barriers to transcription and means to process transposon-encoded RNAs, though their effectiveness in curbing expression of specific TEs in different contexts are not well described. There are several reasons for researchers to survey TE expression. These include better characterizing pathologic states. For example, massive TE derepression is thought to be cytotoxic, and is associated with male germ cell loss in experimental models and retinal epithelium damage in macular degeneration in humans (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). Effects of repeat expression on perhaps a smaller scale may play roles in other diseases - for example, promoting genomic instability in tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Additionally, derepression of TEs in tumors can generate tumor specific antigens and chimeric transcripts with oncogenic or tumor suppressor activities. Thus, TE-encoded RNAs and proteins may have utility as diagnostic or prognostic markers or as targets for therapy, independent of the ability of the associated TE to promote its own transposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>To describe transposon expression in a variety of normal and diseased states, we developed a custom microarray, which we term TE-array. Traditional gene expression microarrays have proved capable of identifying altered TE expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], but most do not systematically survey numerous types of TEs. We developed platforms tiling all mouse and human TE sequences in both sense and antisense strands. The approach has the advantages of being fairly comprehensive and easily scaled with costs and turn-around times comparing favorably with RNAseq. We envision TE-array as an efficient modality for screening mouse phenotypes and human disease states for changes in patterns of TE expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Design of TE-array</title><p>To varying degrees, most gene expression microarrays and genomic tiling arrays used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip) studies &#x02018;mask&#x02019; repeat sequences from consideration in probe design or exclude probes without unique matches to the reference genome. Rationales for this include concern that these probes will not behave technically like unique sequence probes (<italic>i.e.,</italic> they will be a source of non-specific high signal) and that they will fail to provide desired information reflective of a specific gene or genomic locus. We are interested in studying transposon-derived sequences, and so we designed an array in which these repetitive probes are the main features.</p><p>We designed TE-array probes using annotated consensus sequences of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> or <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> specific repeats from Repbase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Probes were obtained using a custom PERL script to collect 60&#x000a0;bp sequences across the length of each repeat consensus. Overlapping probes were collected with offsets of 14-15&#x000a0;bp increments over short repeats, and every 30-45&#x000a0;bp for long repeats. For the sense strand arrays, the probes are the same strand (<italic>i.e.,</italic> the identical sequence) as the consensus sequence found in Repbase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We also created counterpart arrays for antisense strand detection by using the reverse complement of each probe sequence. We did not duplicate highly similar probe sequences, culling probes from the list with fewer than 3&#x000a0;bp mismatches to an already accepted probe using BOWTIE and un-gapped BLAST alignments. The contribution of different TE families to total genomic repeat content for the two species is shown (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). The representation of each family with respect to probes on TE-array mirrors these proportions (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). For all of the experiments described, we prepared labeled RNA samples for hybridization to TE-array in accordance with standard methods for gene expression arrays. A schematic of both TE-array design and RNA sample labeling is shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1.</p></sec><sec><title>Array reproducibility</title><p>To test the reproducibility of TE sequence probe behavior, we carried out a series of technical and biological replicates. Technical replicates involved multiple hybridizations of single RNA preparations. We used RNA from breast cancer cell lines derived from Balbc mice overexpressing rat Her2/Neu for these studies, N3D and N1G. Briefly, adherent cells were expanded, total RNA extracted, cDNA labeled in parallel Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP reactions, and sense strand TE-arrays hybridized for 17&#x000a0;hours. Variability in dye behaviors was normalized using the widely applied local regression (LOESS) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The M value, defined as the log<sub>2</sub> ratio of the normalized Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent intensities, was evaluated at each probe. As expected, the M values from technical replicate comparisons scatter at M value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0 (median M value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.00; s.d. = 0.21 for N1G). Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figures S2A and B show the pairwise correlation plots within each replicate type and cell line.</p><p>Two types of biological replicates were performed; the first compared different RNA preparations from independent cultures of the same cell line. In these studies, we labeled one RNA sample using Cy3 and its corresponding sample using Cy5; and hybridized these together (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Figure S2C and D; M value s.d. = 0.33 and 0.47, respectively). The second approach used RNA isolated from different dissections of the same mouse organ compared to RNA from a pool of different mouse organs; results of these studies are described further below. Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Table S1 describes the number of replicates used in each phase of this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of expressed genes and transfected transposons</title><p>We included gene-specific probes on the microarray as positive controls for reverse transcription and hybridization conditions. As expected, these probes showed previously described patterns of gene expression. Tissue specific expression was most striking for several testis genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>: Figure S3).</p><p>As a positive control for TE expression detection, we transfected human HeLa cells with a plasmid to exogenously express Long INterspersed Element 1 (LINE-1 or L1). L1 sequences account for about 17% of the human genome, and L1 is of special interest as a subset are active today in humans and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. There are an estimated 500,000 copies of L1 in the human genome, although most are small fragments. Endogenous L1 transcripts and splice products have been reported as a series of faint bands in Northern blots of HeLa cells using a 5&#x02032;UTR L1 probe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>To test the ability of TE-array to detect ectopically expressed L1, L1Hs (human-specific L1) and (negative control) GFP- expressing plasmids were transiently transfected into HeLa cells. Polyadenylated RNA was extracted from both cultures, and an RT-PCR was performed to verify L1 expression from the plasmid. This assay generates an amplicon only from the ectopically expressed L1 transcript, which includes non-L1 5&#x02032;UTR sequence before sharing the remainder of its sequence (including all protein coding sequences) in common with endogenous L1. Each RNA sample was then fluorescently labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5, and these were co-hybridized to the TE-array. Results are shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A-C. As expected, we detected L1 as the &#x0201c;top hit&#x0201d; in L1Hs plasmid transfected cells (<italic>i.e.,</italic> the TE type with the greatest probe M values) as compared to cells with the control plasmid. Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A shows an MA plot of all probes on the array. This graph plots a measure of the change in expression, the M value (a log<sub>2</sub> ratio of the dye signals), against the average of the log<sub>2</sub> of the fluorescence intensities, the A value. Probes with very high signals in the control changed relatively little (<italic>i.e</italic>., M values trended lower at high A values), while significant shifts in M values were seen for other L1Hs probes (red). While most non-L1 TEs and repetitive sequences did not change in this study (black dots, Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A), L1 transfection was also associated with downregulation of the spliceosomal U1 snRNA. This may be related to decreased L1-snRNA chimeric RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], though we have not tested this.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Exogenous L1 transfection experiment.

Overlaid is a graph depicting genomic copy number of L1Hs sequences relative to their position in the L1Hs consensus (black line). Copy number increases along the length of the L1 consensus sequence until the 3&#x02032; end; here, divergences of the 3&#x02032;UTR sequence that distinguish young L1 subfamilies from older L1 sequences occur, and the smoothed curve is drawn downward. <bold>C)</bold> This graphic shows how the M value is greatest in probes mapping to the 5&#x02032; end of the L1 (colored red). Since most L1 elements in the genome are 5&#x02032; truncated, 3&#x02032; end mapping L1 fragments (colored pink) can be incorporated into transcripts of other RNA species (multicolored lines). This is seen in both GFP and L1 transfected cells, whereas, full length L1 RNA copies (5&#x02032; is red and 3&#x02032; end is pink) are abundant in L1 transfected cells. The lengths of the horizontal red and pink bars below represent the abundance of 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; L1 RNAs respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-14-869-2"/></fig><p>To better understand why a subset of L1Hs probes showed changes in expression in this experiment, we plotted the M value of each probe verses its copy number in genomic DNA (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). Full length (6&#x000a0;kb) L1 genomic copies are infrequent, and most are 5&#x02032; truncated. This observation has been ascribed to interruptions in the reverse transcription (RT) and integration of new L1 sequences; RT initiates at the 3&#x02032; L1 end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus, the 3&#x02032; L1 end is present in several hundred thousand genomic copies, whereas the 5&#x02032; end occurs a few thousand times in our genome (probes mapping to regions 750&#x000a0;bp and upstream of an L1 human specific (L1Hs) element average at 6774 copies in the human genome) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B, black line). We saw the highest M value increments with L1 expression selectively at 5&#x02032; L1 probes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B, red line). The effect was pronounced; probes mapping to the 3&#x02032; end were not significantly different in the cells transfected with L1 as compared to control GFP-transfected cells. Since many of the latter probes showed high fluorescence intensity in both transfected and untransfected samples, we propose that these probes reflect chimeric transcripts or non-specific &#x02018;read through&#x02019; RNAs that incorporate the 3&#x02032; end of L1. A schematic of these presumptive products (present in L1-transfected and control cells) and the relatively greater increase in 5&#x02032; L1 RNA sequences with transfection is shown (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>TE-array &#x02018;top hits&#x02019; show concordance with nanoString<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and RNAseq analyses</title><sec><title><italic>(i) nanoString<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> concordance</italic></title><p>NanoString is an RNA quantification method based on the ability of RNA molecules to bridge complementary, sequence-specific &#x02018;capture&#x02019; and &#x02018;reporter&#x02019; probes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>To test concordance between this method and TE-array, we selected 30 TE regions found to be significantly differentially expressed in TE-array experiments in at least one tissue as compared to the somatic tissue pool.

In some cases, internal TE antisense promoters (ASP) are known and may be expected to reproducibly generate signal at corresponding probes. An example is an ASP in the 5&#x02032; end of human L1s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Exonization events, in which an intronic or gene proximal TE is expressed by &#x02018;read through&#x02019; and retention of TE sequence in a cellular transcript would map in a highly locus-dependent manner, with intervals of expression bounded by any functional splice sites along the length of the TE.</p><p>To compare global sense verses antisense profiles of TE expression, we ran testis, lung, breast, and brain samples on both antisense and sense detecting microarrays. Antisense array probes showed overall lesser intensities and far fewer examples of differential TE expression than did the sense arrays. The relative gap in intensities is illustrated by Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A. Probes corresponding to L1 and LTR retrotransposons in antisense showed average raw signal intensities of approximately 30-40% the values measured for sense probes of the same elements. For short interspersed repeat families (SINEs), this effect was more pronounced; average antisense signal intensities were only 5% of sense signals. The top 1000 probes as ranked by signal intensity detecting L1, LTR, and SINE RNA in sense had 5.2 fold, 3.4 fold, and 27.7 fold, respectively the average intensity of the top 1000 antisense probes. This suggests that the bulk of TE expression occurs in a sense strand specific manner relative to the TE. Alignments of ultra-high-depth, stranded RNAseq data to the mouse Repbase consensus sequences reflect a more modest overall (+) strand bias in our hands, most evident in species-specific repeat types as opposed to ancestral repeats in the mouse genome [56.2% (+) strand; data not shown].</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Strand bias of TE transcripts.

We saw no overrepresentation of differentially expressed genes as compared to randomly selected genes in these lists (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Measuring expression from highly repetitive genomic sequences is complex. Part of this is owed to inherent features of genomic repeats. Many TE families have populated mammalian genomes over evolutionary time, and members of each type have shown fragmentation and degenerating homology with aging. A second layer of complexity stems from variant transcript structures. Interspersed repeat sequences can be transcribed actively as well as passively as a part of a cellular pre-mRNA or other forms of cellular RNA, and can then be processed by RNA splicing machinery with a variety of outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Thus, though methods like Northern blots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], RNase protection assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], RT-PCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and RACE PCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] all suggest interesting patterns of repeat expression in human tissues and cells, they thus far have focused on a very minor subset of elements (often, those competent for transposition). They cannot be practicably scaled to capture the complexity of the &#x02018;mobilome&#x02019; in a variety of tissue types.</p><p>We thus approached the task of designing a TE expression microarray platform. For both human and mouse repeats, we have designed an 88,000 probe, two array set that is available for distribution to laboratories through the manufacturer. Probes have been designed against all annotated transposons - approximately 300 mouse and 500 human TE consensus sequences - in both sense and antisense orientations. Coverage is dense and deep (~10X on average), with probes sequences designed in overlapping intervals along the length of each TE consensus sequence. We address numerous technical concerns in this publication, showing that these probes do not generate arbitrary irreproducible signals and that there is agreement between TE-array and other state-of-the-art RNA detection modalities, including nanoString and RNA-seq.</p><p>Using TE-Array to profile transposon expression in a variety of normal mouse tissues, we make two encompassing observations. The first is that transposon expression is detectable most frequently from probes for sense strand transcripts. This expression is most often segmental or involving short series of contiguous probes along the length of longer repeat sequences. We interpret the strand bias as evidence that sequences intrinsic to the interspersed repeats themselves are directing much of this transcription, consistent with the observation that many transcripts originate in this portion of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In contrast, exclusively &#x02018;read through&#x02019; transcription of intronic TEs as directed by gene promoters would be expected to give comparable signals in sense and antisense for most element types where there is random orientation of each TE within its gene locus.</p><p>Our second major observation is that there are highly distinct patterns of retroelement expression in crosswise comparisons of different mouse tissues. Specific intervals of a broad complement of TE families appear differentially expressed in any given tissue. These patterns of sense strand repeat expression appear pervasive; they do not only typify testis, where specific TE repression pathways have been described or brain, where L1 LINE expression has been studied (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). Interestingly, although testicular samples adhere to the sense strand bias we describe above, examples of intense signals from antisense probes are more prevalent in this tissue. It is possible these signals reflect primary antisense transcripts from TEs or piRNA clusters which initiate piRNA biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. piRNAs in turn are critical for imposing TE silencing during gametogenesis. Spermatogenic tubule dissection experiments may demonstrate stage specificity for these antisense species and provide insights into their regulation.</p><p>Our work complements and extends observations made with the first generation of microarrays to detect interspersed repeats, RepArray, designed by Horard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Using 236 oligonucleotides, their design designates a single oligonucleotide target and its reverse complement for each type of transposable element. Each probe appears in duplicate on the array. The key advantage of our platform design relates to probe quantity; TE-array comprises in contrast 88,000 probes. A ten kilobase retrovirus is given a single sense-oriented and antisense-oriented probe pair on RepArray chosen to maximize specificity for that family. The same element is represented by more than 650 overlapping, sense and antisense oriented probes on TE-array. Given how TE expression can be seen over discrete intervals within a larger consensus sequence, this density of coverage appears vital to capture. Excitingly, RepArray has proven useful not only as an expression array, but also in transcription factor chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Although these applications may be highly sensitive to the lack of probe coverage on this platform, the experiments are a demonstration of how microarrays can give insights into TE regulation at multiple molecular levels.</p><p>Our discovery of regulated, differential TE expression in tissues &#x02013; from sequences incapable of transposition and in somatic cells where there is no consequence for TE propagation in the population &#x02013; might be viewed as an unexpected result from the perspective of transposon biology. Whether these are &#x02018;exapted&#x02019; elements with functional roles in tissues is unknown, though their discovery begins to make this question experimentally tractable. Moreover, outside of normal cell differentiation and function, profiling TE expression in cancers, infertilities, and degenerative conditions where repeat derepression has been described may suggest functional roles in disease or provide new markers of a disease state.</p><p>In summary, we show that a wide diversity of transposon sequences can be incorporated in expression microarray designs to provide more comprehensive profiles of TE expression. First applications of the technology suggest that control of TE expression is determined by repeat encoded sequence features and regulated in a highly tissue-specific manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>RNA extraction from cell lines and tissues</title><p>Normal tissue experiments used 12&#x000a0;week old C57BL/6 mice.
