    "Neonatal mouse cochlear supporting cells have a limited ability to divide and trans-differentiate into hair cells, but this ability declines rapidly in the two weeks after birth. This decline is concomitant with the morphological and functional maturation of the organ of Corti prior to the onset of hearing. However, despite this association between maturation and loss of regenerative potential, little is known of the molecular changes that underlie these events. To identify these changes, we used RNA-seq to generate transcriptional profiles of purified cochlear supporting cells from 1- and 6-day-old mice. We found many significant changes in gene expression during this period, many of which were related to regulation of proliferation, differentiation of inner ear components and the maturation of the organ of Corti prior to the onset of hearing. One example of a change in regenerative potential of supporting cells is their robust production of hair cells in response to a blockade of the Notch signaling pathway at the time of birth, but a complete lack of response to such blockade just a few days later. By comparing our supporting cell transcriptomes to those of supporting cells cultured in the presence of Notch pathway inhibitors, we show that the transcriptional response to Notch blockade disappears almost completely in the first postnatal week. Our results offer some of the first molecular insights into the failure of hair cell regeneration in the mammalian cochlea."
