With the development of sensitive molecular methods and deep-sequencing technology, it is now possible to robustly assess the global transcriptome of bacterial species in their human habitat. However, as the genomes of the colonizing strains are often not available compiling the pan-genome for the species of interest may provide an effective method to reliably and rapidly compile the transcriptome of a bacterial species. The pan-genome of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> and its associated core and accessory components were compiled based on 25 genomes and comprises a total of 65,557 proteins clustering into 4,198 Orthologous Groups (OGs). The generated gene catalogue was used to assign RNAseq-derived sequence reads to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> in a variety of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> samples. In all cases, the number of reads that could be assigned to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> was greater using the OG database than using a reference genome. Growth of two <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strains in synthetic nasal medium confirmed that both strains experienced strong iron starvation. Traits such as purine metabolism appeared to be more affected in a typical nasal colonizer than in a strain representative of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> USA300 lineage. Mapping sequencing reads from a metatranscriptome generated from the human anterior nares allowed the identification of genes highly expressed by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus in vivo</italic>. The OG database generated in this study represents a useful tool to obtain a snapshot of the functional attributes of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> under different <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. The approach proved to be advantageous to assign sequencing reads to bacterial strains when RNAseq data is derived from samples where strain information and/or the corresponding genome/s are unavailable.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bmbf.de/en/index.php">http://www.bmbf.de/en/index.php</ext-link>] BMBF project &#x0201c;Medical Infection Genomics&#x0201d; to DHP (0315832B) and in part by the BMBF project &#x0201c;Skin Staph&#x0201d; to DHP (01KI1009A).

The principle of RNAseq is to generate sequence reads from random locations along the individual RNA molecules within the total RNA pool [<xref rid="pone.0145861.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To obtain a detailed view of the transcriptional profile of different bacterial community members, the sequenced short-reads are then mapped against a reference genome or catalogue of sequences such as a meta-genome library. However, this method is unsuitable for samples lacking precise reference genomes and/or sequence catalogues. However, with the recent advent of whole-genome sequencing on a massive scale [<xref rid="pone.0145861.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], a large number of genomes are now available, with &#x0003e;2,800 finished bacterial genomes currently listed in the Integrated Microbial Genomes system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://img.jgi.doe.gov/">https://img.jgi.doe.gov</ext-link>). All this information enables the gathering and compilation of genes of a given species into unique databases that can then be used for assigning RNAseq transcripts as alternative to the use of a reference genome.</p><p>The entirety of a species gene repertoire, the &#x0201c;pan-genome&#x0201d; comprises a core of genes shared by all strains within a given species, and a dispensable or accessory genome composed of genes that are only present in some strains or that are strain-specific [<xref rid="pone.0145861.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145861.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Differences in the pan-genome are reflections of the lifestyle and evolutionary history of an organism and the pan-genome may be defined as being open or closed. As originally demonstrated for <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145861.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145861.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the pan-genome is suitable for ascribing a bacterial species. Thus it can be used for assigning genes to strains belonging to the same species for which the genomes are uncharacterised. This has become particularly relevant for assigning genes to individual bacterial strains originating from complex communities. The human anterior nares provide a good example since they are inhabited by commensals and often also by a suite of important opportunistic pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0145861.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] such as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Although RNAseq is an excellent tool for assessing the behaviour of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> in its natural niche, the precise reference genomes may not be available for the specific colonizing strains. Thus, an alternative approach for optimal assignment of transcripts must be undertaken, specifically as staphylococcal carriage can be highly dynamic with the concomitant acquisition and loss of different strains over the short and long-term [<xref rid="pone.0145861.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this regard, the pan-genome can constitute an attractive reference tool for assigning transcripts to specific organisms in complex metatranscriptomes. This method could be particularly suitable for those organisms like <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, which have been described as having seemingly bounded (or closed) genomes and where the majority of the gene content may be captured by a relatively small number of genome sequences [<xref rid="pone.0145861.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145861.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145861.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the current study was to compile and assess the &#x0201c;pan-genome&#x0201d; of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> and to create an <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> gene catalogue for assigning transcription reads derived from RNAseq analysis. This catalogue is based on Orthologous Groups or (OGs) of genes encoding proteins which share a common ancestor and probably biochemical function defined for the species of interest.

Genomes were compared in an iterative and additive manner; beginning with a comparison between the 2 genomes with the lowest protein counts. This group was subsequently compared to the next genome comprising the next lowest protein counts and the process repeated a total of 31 times adding one genome per iteration. The total numbers of unique and shared OGs comprised within the genomes per iteration was calculated and plotted as saturation (and fit to power) curves, representing the pan- and core-genomes respectively. A sub-set of 25 genomes, corresponding to a point of relative stability in the OG content, was used as a final group of representative genomes. An OG search was further conducted on this group of 25 genomes (comprising a total of 65,557 proteins) using the same methodology, yielding a total of 4,198 OGs.

The major differences between the transcriptome of cells growing exponentially in complex medium versus those growing exponentially in SNM were due to the limiting availability of iron in SNM (see <xref rid="pone.0145861.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).

These observations are in accordance with the previously described transcriptional response of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> in SNM using a microarray [<xref rid="pone.0145861.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

The transcription of other amino acid biosynthetic cluster such as <italic>his</italic>EFAHBCDGZ (USA300HOU_2673&#x02013;2681) was also found to be significantly increased in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> growing in SNM (2-42-fold).</p><p>Although the set of genes differentially expressed by the nasal isolate <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> IPL32 when growing in complex medium versus SNM was highly similar to that observed in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> USA300 strain LAC, some differences were also observed, which may reflect the better adaptation of IPL32 to the nasal environment. As an example, the genes encoding enzymes involved in purine metabolism (<italic>pur</italic>EKCSQLFMHD, USA300HOU_1009&#x02013;1018) were up-regulated up to 50-fold by strain IPL32, but only up to 4-fold by USA300 strain LAC. Purine metabolism is important for DNA synthesis as well as for energy production and it has been shown to be essential for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> to survive within the host [<xref rid="pone.0145861.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. All <italic>cap</italic>ABCEFHIKLMNOP genes (USA300HOU_0163&#x02013;0178) were found to be expressed to a high extent in strain IPL32 and were upregulated in SNM compared to complex medium (up to 26 fold for <italic>cap</italic>M USA300HOU_0175).
