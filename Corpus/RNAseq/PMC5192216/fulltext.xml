Absence of sterilizing immunity induced by TB vaccines may be due to delayed activation of mucosal dendritic cells (DCs), and subsequent delay in antigen presentation and activation of vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses. Here we show that pulmonary delivery of activated <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigen-primed DCs into vaccinated mice, at the time of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> exposure, can overcome the delay in accumulation of vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses. In addition, activating endogenous host CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs and the CD40&#x02013;CD40L pathway can similarly induce rapid accumulation of vaccine-induced lung CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses and limit early <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth. Thus, our study provides proof of concept that targeting mucosal DCs can accelerate vaccine-induced T-cell responses on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, and provide insights to overcome bottlenecks in TB vaccine efficacy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>A delay in T cell responses is postulated as a possible explanation for the limited efficacy of vaccines against tuberculosis.

TB is caused by aerosol exposure to the intracellular bacterium <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>), leading to either latent disease or active pulmonary disease. The only currently licensed vaccine against TB is <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> Bacille Calmette&#x02013;Guerin (BCG). Although BCG vaccination is effective against childhood forms of TB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, and in decreasing childhood TB morbidity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, it provides variable efficacy against adult pulmonary TB. Thus, over the past two decades, concerted efforts have been made to develop new vaccines for TB that will provide improved protection on <italic>Mtb</italic> exposure. Modern candidate TB vaccines have focussed on induction of T-cell responses, primarily CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells producing interferon gamma (IFN&#x003b3;)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. More recently, an important role for mucosal interleukin 17A (IL-17A) in vaccine-induced protection against TB disease has been shown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Thus, induction of lung-resident IL-17A-producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell populations by TB vaccines is also being explored<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Despite these efforts, most TB vaccines reduce the burden of lung <italic>Mtb</italic> by &#x0223c;0.5&#x02013;1.0 log in animal challenge models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Recombinant live mycobacterial vaccines confer improved protection (&#x0223c;2 log reduction), when compared with subunit and virally vectored TB vaccines. Examples of recombinant vaccines include the recombinant <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> vaccine, which induces sterilizing immunity in the liver, but not the lung<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>; recombinant BCG over-expressing <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> listeriolysin and lacking urease C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>; and the recombinant <italic>Mtb</italic> vaccine lacking <italic>PhoP</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Other work has highlighted the benefit of administering recombinant <italic>Mtb</italic> vaccines mucosally, showing that macaques vaccinated with the attenuated <italic>Mtb</italic> mutant lacking <italic>SigH</italic> had sterile protection in some TB lesions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Although these results are promising, considerable challenges are associated with the design and implementation of a recombinant <italic>Mtb</italic> vaccine to be delivered mucosally via the lungs, particularly in light of the TB&#x02013;HIV co-epidemic. Thus, it is critical to fully understand the early events occurring in the vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected lung.</p><p>After <italic>Mtb</italic> infection of naive mice, accumulation of activated lung CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells is delayed, occurring between 14 and 21 days post <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (dpi)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. This delay is thought to be due to <italic>Mtb</italic>-mediated inhibition of early antigen presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Even in the presence of an existing <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell population in the lung, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-memory cells do not accumulate in the lung until 12&#x02013;14 dpi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Priming of T-cell responses following primary <italic>Mtb</italic> infection requires trafficking of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected DCs from the lungs to the lymph nodes (LNs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Furthermore, <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected DCs do not efficiently present antigen directly to <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, but antigen is transferred from <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected DCs to uninfected bystander DCs in the LNs, for antigen presentation to naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. On <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, even vaccine-induced memory T cells accumulate in the LNs before mobilization to the lungs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Thus, in the current study, we hypothesized that the delay in accumulation of lung vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected hosts is due to a delay in antigen presentation by <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected APCs, thus resulting in a bottleneck and preventing sterilizing immunity to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. We show that we can overcome the delay in accumulation of vaccine-induced memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells by transferring exogenously primed activated DCs into the lungs of vaccinated mice at the time of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. DC transfer into vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected hosts results in rapid activation of vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses, substantial changes in the lung micro-environment, activation of lung alveolar macrophages and early <italic>Mtb</italic> control. Furthermore, these protective mechanisms are dependent on CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs and the CD40&#x02013;CD40L activation pathway, as host-directed therapeutics targeting these pathways in vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice can mimic the protective effects of pulmonary DC transfer. Thus, we have determined a key bottleneck for the failure of TB vaccines to induce sterilizing protection against <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. These results provide a roadmap for the type of immune responses that a sterilizing TB vaccine should induce, representing a milestone in our mechanistic understanding of TB vaccine-mediated immune responses.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>DC transfer confers superior vaccine-induced Mtb control</title><p>Following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses are delayed in vaccinated hosts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, and could be a likely reason for the failure of TB vaccines to induce sterilizing immunity. Therefore, we first assessed whether a delay in accumulation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell recall responses was due to an inherent deficiency in the ability of the vaccine-induced T cells to respond to antigen exposure. Thus, naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were isolated from <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific immunodominant antigen 85B (Ag85B) T-cell receptor transgenic (TCR) mice and adoptively transferred into congenic C57BL/6 (B6) mice, which were vaccinated subcutaneously (s.c.) with BCG, rested for 4 weeks followed by a mucosal boost with the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell epitope Ag85B<sub>240&#x02013;254</sub>. Following a period of rest for 4 weeks, lung CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were isolated and cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of Ag85B-pulsed DCs. Recall Ag85B-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells proliferated rapidly, underwent activation, produced cytokines and on co-culture with <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages could mediate <italic>Mtb</italic> control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a&#x02013;d</xref>). These data suggest that vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells can rapidly respond to <italic>Mtb</italic> antigen, but activation is delayed <italic>in vivo</italic> following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. This is not due to a limitation of <italic>Mtb</italic> antigen availability, as infection of vaccinated mice with high doses (&#x0223c;1,000&#x02009;c.f.u.) of <italic>Mtb</italic> did not improve vaccine-induced <italic>Mtb</italic> control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. T regulatory cells induced in response to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection are known to suppress early T-cell responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. As before<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, however, depletion of T regulatory cells in vaccinated B6 mice early following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection did not improve vaccine-induced <italic>Mtb</italic> control, instead increasing susceptibility to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Thus, although recall CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses are delayed <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected hosts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells can rapidly respond <italic>ex vivo</italic> to activate macrophages for <italic>Mtb</italic> control.</p><p>To overcome the delayed activation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell recall responses on <italic>Mtb</italic> infection <italic>in vivo</italic>, we addressed whether delivery of <italic>Mtb</italic> antigen-pulsed DCs into the lungs of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected-vaccinated mice could overcome this bottleneck and improve recall vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell immunity. B6 mice were thus vaccinated with BCG, rested for 4 weeks, followed by a mucosal boost with Ag85B<sub>240&#x02013;254</sub>. Mice were further rested for 4 weeks, after which they were challenged with a clinical W-Beijing <italic>Mtb</italic> strain, HN878 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). At the time of <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge, vaccinated mice received Ag85B<sub>240&#x02013;254</sub>-pulsed B6 bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDC) delivered intratracheally (i.t., DC transfer). While vaccination and mucosal boost reduced lung <italic>Mtb</italic> burden as before<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, B6 DC transfer into vaccinated mice reduced lung <italic>Mtb</italic> burden by &#x0223c;98.6&#x00025;, when compared with the burden in unvaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Pulmonary delivery of Ag85B<sub>240&#x02013;254</sub> peptide alone did not induce the superior protection seen with DC transfer in vaccinated mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>), further suggesting that antigen availability was not the major reason for delayed vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell recall responses. To further improve the ability of antigen-pulsed DCs to activate CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, we next stimulated DCs with the Dectin-1 agonist zymosan (Z-DC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> at the time of antigen pulsing. Activating Z-DC, induced proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-23, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a&#x02013;c</xref>), but also induced IL-10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). IL-10 induction can dampen vaccine-induced immunity to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, and we next tested whether use of B6 DCs or <italic>Il10</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> DCs treated with zymosan was more effective on transfer at conferring <italic>Mtb</italic> control in vaccinated hosts. B6 DC transfer into vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice as before reduced <italic>Mtb</italic> burden significantly, when compared with vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected hosts, while transfer of B6 Z-DCs had a small but significant improvement in <italic>Mtb</italic> control, when compared with vaccinated hosts receiving B6 DC transfer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). In sharp contrast, we found that vaccinated hosts receiving Z-DCs from <italic>Il10</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice resulted in far superior <italic>Mtb</italic> control, with <italic>Mtb</italic> burden-bordering limit of detection by plating assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>, limit of <italic>Mtb</italic> detection is &#x0223c;75&#x02013;100&#x02009;c.f.u. per lung, <italic>Mtb</italic> burden from three out of five mice were in this range, &#x0223c;99.97&#x00025; reduction in <italic>Mtb</italic> burden, when compared with unvaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice). The near-sterilizing protection in vaccinated mice receiving <italic>Il10</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> Z-DC transfer coincided with increased frequency of both activated IL-17-producing and IFN&#x003b3;-producing <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the lungs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c,d</xref>; gating strategy in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Indeed, B6 Z-DC transfer also resulted in increased frequency of lung IL-17-producing <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses, but failed to improve IFN&#x003b3;-producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses, when compared with responses in vaccinated hosts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c,d</xref>). These results together suggest that Z-DCs generated from <italic>Il10</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice on transfer into vaccinated hosts can overcome a TB vaccine bottleneck, and confer superior protection against <italic>Mtb</italic> infection by significantly accelerating the accumulation of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific cytokine-producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell vaccine responses. Thus, in all experiments in the remainder of the study, Z-DCs from <italic>Il10</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice (Ag85B-Z-DC) were used for DC transfer.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>DC transfer accelerates vaccine CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell activation</title><p>Having established the ability of Z-DC transfer to significantly reduce <italic>Mtb</italic> burden in the lungs of vaccinated mice, we then assessed the kinetics of immune responses in <italic>Mtb</italic> HN878-infected vaccinated mice receiving Z-DC transfer. Vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses and activation of lung myeloid cells are not detected in vaccinated hosts until 12&#x02013;14 dpi following <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In contrast, we observed significant early accumulation (8 dpi) of activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice receiving Z-DC transfer, when compared with vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>; gating strategy in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). In addition, increased numbers of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific CD44<sup>hi</sup>-activated cells producing the cytokines IL-17 and IFN-&#x003b3; accumulated early in lungs of vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice receiving Z-DC transfer, when compared with vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice or naive <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). As noted previously, activated T-cell responses in vaccinated mice not receiving Z-DC transfer accumulated later at 14 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, while T-cell responses between the different groups were comparable at later time points. These protective and early activation events in vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses coincided with increased early upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II expression on lung alveolar macrophages in Z-DC-recipient-vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice, when compared with levels expressed in unvaccinated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>; gating strategy in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). Importantly, the early and rapid activation of vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses, and concomitant activation of alveolar macrophages was associated with complete control of <italic>Mtb</italic> growth, maintaining burdens at levels of initial inoculum up to 20 dpi in vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice receiving Z-DC transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>). This is in contrast to naive and vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice, in which <italic>Mtb</italic> burden increased in the lungs over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Finally, Z-DC transfer at the time of <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge resulted in long-lasting protection up to 40 dpi, with Z-DC transfer-recipient mice still maintaining significantly lower bacterial burdens in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>). As expected, at later time points, vaccinated mice showed similar <italic>Mtb</italic> burden as unvaccinated mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, suggesting that while Z-DC transfer provides long-lasting vaccine-induced immunity in <italic>Mtb</italic> HN878-infected mice, endogenous vaccine-induced responses are not long-lasting and are lost over time. Furthermore, robust rapid formation of B-cell follicles-harbouring localized T cells could be detected in the lungs of vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice receiving Z-DC transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i</xref>), indicating early development of protective lung granulomas. Importantly, even on challenge with a Euro-American <italic>Mtb</italic> strain, H37Rv, we found that Z-DC transfer effectively conferred superior <italic>Mtb</italic> control by activating alveolar macrophages and accelerating accumulation of activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a&#x02013;d</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that DC transfer can effectively induce superior vaccine control on challenge with different <italic>Mtb</italic> strains.

This is especially concerning considering the status of TB, as one of the leading causes of death due to infectious diseases in the world today. In the current study, we hypothesized that our inability to develop a sterilizing vaccine against <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is not due to a failure of the vaccine to induce effective T-cell responses, but due to a delay in antigen presentation and subsequent delay in accumulation of vaccine-induced T-cell responses. Indeed, we show here that vaccine-induced T cells can respond to antigen exposure and induce mycobactericidal activity <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Transfer of exogenously primed DCs into lungs of vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice can directly activate vaccine-induced T cells <italic>in vivo,</italic> leading to accelerated formation of protective B-cell follicles, rapid and early alveolar macrophage activation, and early control of establishment of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. In addition, our results have identified novel mechanisms, involving CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs and the CD40 activation pathway that may be therapeutically targeted to improve vaccine-induced protection during TB.

In addition, lung-resident vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses are long lasting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and adoptive transfer of T cells isolated from <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected animals into newly infected animals confers protective immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. <italic>Mtb</italic> is a successful pathogen, known to inhibit MHC-II transactivator expression, MHC-II expression and antigen presentation in APCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Thus, the inability of TB vaccines to confer sterilizing immunity on <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge may be associated with delayed CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses due to delayed APC function, rather than just poor induction of vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Accordingly, targeting DCs in vaccinated hosts can substantially accelerate the activation and accumulation of cytokine-producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell recall responses in the lung, initiate rapid activation of alveolar macrophages and limit <italic>Mtb</italic> growth. Interestingly, pre-clinical vaccines that have come closest to inducing sterilizing immunity following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection have been recombinant mycobacterial vaccines delivered mucosally<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>.

Thus, it is possible that recombinant mycobacterial vaccines delivered mucosally target pathways similar to DC transfer through activation of lung-resident DCs and macrophages, thereby driving earlier activation of lung-resident T cells on <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge.

Our results show that use of Z-DCs as a mucosal vaccination tool as boost to BCG vaccination has a small protective effect on <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, but not as effective as use of Z-DC transfer at the time of infection. In contrast, only very few studies have therapeutically manipulated early innate responses following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Delivery of polyI:C, a TLR3 ligand, exacerbated inflammation and increased <italic>Mtb</italic> burden<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>.

To our knowledge, no published studies have manipulated early host responses in vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected hosts, with resulting complete early <italic>Mtb</italic> control. Furthermore, both CpG (reviewed in refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>) and CD40 agonists (reviewed in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>) have been safely tested in clinical human trials, predominantly for cancer treatment.

Furthermore, Z-DC transfer works in both standard BCG vaccinated as well as in mucosally vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected hosts, the route of vaccination may define the mechanisms of protection. In mucosally vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice receiving DC transfer, mucosal lung-resident CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, primarily IL-17-producing cells are activated and accumulate rapidly in the lung, thus mediating the superior protection associated with this model. In BCG-vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice receiving DC transfer, DC transfer can still prime a population of lung-resident IL-17-producing vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, but likely DC migration to LNs is required to mobilize IFN-&#x003b3;-producing vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses from the systemic pool, to provide enhanced <italic>Mtb</italic> control. Regardless, that we can target CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs and the CD40 activation pathway to limit <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in standard BCG-vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected hosts suggest that our strategy is effective in overcoming a bottleneck associated with delayed induction of vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses in vaccinated hosts. This is further supported by our results showing that DC transfer can protect vaccinated hosts on challenge with <italic>Mtb</italic> strains belonging to different lineages, suggesting that T-cell bottleneck for TB vaccines is universal. In addition, that Z-DC transfer into unvaccinated hosts can also accelerate naive T-cell priming and improve primary immunity, albeit not to the effectiveness seen in vaccinated hosts, suggest the DC transfer may be useful to enhance both primary and vaccine-induced pathways during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</p><p>DC transfer not only induces the rapid activation of vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses in vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice, but also has substantial downstream effects on activation of myeloid pathways in the lung. First, lung alveolar macrophages are rapidly activated in vaccinated hosts by 8 dpi, an event that does not happen until 14 dpi in vaccinated hosts and until 21 dpi in unvaccinated hosts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Accordingly, the early global transcriptional changes in the lungs of vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice receiving DC transfer mirror the transcriptional changes occurring in 21 dpi <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected lungs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Furthermore, we observe early accumulation of myeloid DCs, including CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs and an enhancement of DC activation pathways, in particular genes associated with CD40 activation in the lungs of vaccinated <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice. CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs are a tissue-resident DC subset, which have primarily been implicated in cross-presentation and induction of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. More recently, however, CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs have been shown to induce CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. In the lung, CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs represent a migratory DC subset, with the ability to migrate from the lungs to the LN and back again<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>, and induce both Th1 and Th17 cytokines by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>. Although antigen presentation by transferred DCs likely directly activates vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses, rapid activation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cell responses also modifies the lung micro-environment to improve subsequent antigen presentation by endogenous host APCs. We show here that targeting DC activation pathways through the TLR ligand amph-CpG, along with use of the CD40 agonist FGK4.5, similarly control <italic>Mtb</italic> growth. Treatment of DCs with granulocyte&#x02013;macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a by-product of TLR9 stimulation through CpG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref> has previously been shown to upregulate CD103 expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>. Thus, it is possible that CpG stimulates CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> expression on DCs indirectly through inducing GM-CSF by other lung-resident cells. Upregulation of CD103 as well as recruitment of CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs to the lung alone, however, are not sufficient for improved T-cell activation, suggesting that the activating signal delivered through the CD40 agonist FGK4.5 provides the second signal required for improved early antigen presentation to vaccine-induced CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Therefore, <italic>Mtb-</italic>infected individuals likely have a population of antigen-responsive T cells, and targeting DCs as a potential therapy, may provide the lung-resident T cells the necessary signals to proliferate and control <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</p><p>Thus, our data for the first time show that delayed activation of vaccine-induced T-cell responses is a critical bottleneck for TB vaccine efficacy.

These results provide a roadmap for the type of immune responses that a sterilizing TB vaccine should induce, representing an important milestone in our mechanistic understanding of TB vaccine-mediated immune responses.
