Eleven years after sequencing <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative TAGI <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), the genomes of two important Solanaceous crop plants, potato and tomato, were reported (Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium PGSC <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Tomato Genome Consortium TGC <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). A major challenge in the post-genome sequencing era is to obtain high-quality annotations of these genomes (Yandell and Ence, <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), so that the full potential of genome sequences can be realized for functional studies and comparative analysis (Loveland <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Whole-genome sequencing of crop plants facilitates studies on genome diversity, identification of genome-wide polymorphic markers and elucidation of complex traits (Cronn <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). When only a subset of the genome is likely to be of interest, target enrichment offers substantial reduction in genome size and complexity prior to comparative sequencing of coding regions such as exons or specific gene families (Albert <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Hodges <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Cronn <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Sequencing enriched samples has the advantage of yielding higher read depth for individual genes, and aids accurate identification of sequence polymorphisms in plants with large genomes and higher ploidy levels (Parla <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Saintenac <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>One important crop trait that is particularly suitable for target enrichment is disease resistance that is, in the vast majority of cases, conferred by dominant disease resistance (<italic>R</italic>) genes. R proteins typically contain nucleotide-binding (NB) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains and belong to the structural class of proteins known as NB-LRRs. These can be further divided into two main groups based on their N-terminal domains and sequence motifs within the NB-ARC domain (Meyers <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Dangl and Jones, <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Jones and Dangl, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Jupe <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The first group possesses a domain with homology to the intracellular signaling domains of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Toll and mammalian interleukin (IL)-1 receptors and is referred to as TIR-NB-LRRs or TNLs. The second, non-TNL, group is collectively known as CC-NB-LRRs or CNLs, based on the presence of a predicted N-terminal coiled-coil domain in some, but not all, members of this class. <italic>R</italic> gene-based resistance acts against diseases caused by diverse and taxonomically unrelated pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, nematodes, insects, filamentous fungi and oomycetes, and is also thought to contribute to non-host resistance (Schulze-Lefert and Panstruga, <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In the innate plant immune system, R proteins govern a specific layer of induced resistance by recognizing, directly or indirectly, effectors from pathogens in a process known as effector triggered immunity (Jones and Dangl, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). NB-LRR genes are key players in plant disease resistance and their presence, absence or allelic identity is decisive for functionality.</p><p>To further understand this important gene family and to make it available for breeding purposes, significant efforts have been made to identify the NB-LRR complements from sequenced plant genomes. However, these analyses are typically limited to the available computationally predicted gene models. Within the genome of the sequenced <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> Group Phureja clone DM1-3 516 R44 (DM), a very close relative to the important crop plant potato, between 408 and 438 NB-LRR genes were predicted previously amongst the postulated 39&#x000a0;031 protein-coding sequences. Many were found to reside in clusters comprising closely related paralogues (PGSC <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Jupe <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Similarly, in tomato, 356 genes were identified that contain domains typically associated with NB-LRRs (TGC <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The limitations of computational NB-LRR prediction in potato were described previously by Jupe <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and missing domains of partially predicted genes were identified.</p><p>We present the development and applications of a NB-LRR gene-specific <italic>R</italic> gene enrichment and sequencing (RenSeq) workflow. Using the potato and tomato genomes as examples, we demonstrate that this method can be used to reannotate the NB-LRR gene complements from fully or partially assembled genomes using targeted resequencing. Reference gene models are only required from a single member of the target species and do not need to be complete. In addition, we have used this method for the rapid identification of molecular markers that co-segregate with resistances towards the late blight pathogen <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> in two characterized wild potato populations. We developed a two-tiered SNP-calling pipeline to identify trait-linked polymorphisms that are available as easy-to-adopt Galaxy workflows. We conclude that RenSeq provides an opportunity to quickly map functional NB-LRR-type <italic>R</italic> genes to control important diseases in crop plants, and a method for improvement of existing plant genome annotations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>RenSeq in a proof-of-concept study</title><p>The <italic>R</italic> gene enrichment and sequencing (RenSeq) workflow was optimized for Illumina sequencing of genomic DNA libraries enriched for NB-LRR-encoding genes using the Agilent <italic>SureSelect Target Enrichment System</italic> (Agilent Technologies, USA). A customized target enrichment library comprising 48&#x000a0;549, 120-mer biotinylated oligos was designed based on 523 NB-LRR-like sequences that we identified from an early draft of the available potato genome annotation (PGSC <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and further 57 tomato NB-ARC domains and nine characterized NB-LRR-type <italic>R</italic> genes from tomato, tobacco and pepper (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>a and Data S1).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the <italic>R</italic> gene enrichment (RenSeq) experiment. (a) Genomic DNA from the <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> Group Phureja clone DM1-3 516 R44 was enriched for NB-LRR sequence fragments using a customized NB-LRR RNA bait-library (Agilent SureSelect). Standard Illumina PE 76 bp sequencing and BWA mapping enabled the identification of 331 additional NB-LRR loci in DM. For rapid identification of markers segregating for pathogen resistance, bulked genomic DNA of the most resistant (BR) and most susceptible (BS) phenotyped plants of segregating populations were subjected to the same workflow. Illumina reads were then applied to a &#x02018;quick mapping&#x02019; analysis to identify the approximate chromosomal position through mapping to the 755 predicted NB-LRRs from the <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> Group Phureja DM1-3 516R44 (this work) and plotting the number of BR unique SNPs per gene. A <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of NB-LRR enriched reads was used as genotype-specific reference to call BR unique SNPs. These were converted into markers and used to screen the segregating population. (b) A heat map was created to visualize the read coverage over the 755 reference NB-LRR loci. Illumina sequence information for the NB-LRR enriched DM sample was mapped against the 755 NB-LRR loci from this study with default BWA settings. Each line represents one locus that was normalized to a common length. Genes are in order as on the chromosomes. UM represents unmapped genes. Colors indicate coverage, from blue (lowest) to red (highest, over 250&#x000d7;).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="tpj0076-0530-f1"/></fig><p>To establish RenSeq as a genome annotation tool, the method was applied to genomic DNA of the sequenced <italic>S.&#x000a0;tuberosum</italic> Group Phureja clone DM (PGSC <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>a). We carried out quantitative PCR to determine the abundance of three CC-NB-LRR resistance gene homologues in DNA samples prior to and after enrichment. Normalized samples revealed approximately 290-fold enrichment (&#x00394;&#x00394;CT of 8.15) (Table S1). We sequenced the paired-ends of fragments in these enriched libraries on an Illumina GAII platform, and assessed NB-LRR capture efficiency by high-stringency mapping of 73 million quality-controlled 76-bp reads to the DM chromosomes that contained the predicted NB-LRR coding sequences used to design the bait-library and to the previously identified 438 DM NB-LRR sequences (Jupe <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). After enrichment, 31.5% of all reads corresponded to the genes that featured in the bait-library design and 29.8% mapped to the 438 DM NB-LRRs (Jupe <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). NB-LRR gene read depth was at least 20-fold over a minimum of 500 consecutive nucleotides, and on average 4.2-fold at all other genomic regions.</p><p>To measure potential off-target enrichment, we analyzed sequence coverage of non-NB-LRR genes that featured in the negative training set used to design discriminating amino acid motifs for NB-LRR genes (Jupe <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). All of these genes had read coverage similar to the background, suggesting a high specificity for NB-LRR gene sequences.</p></sec><sec><title>RenSeq enables reannotation of NB-LRR gene complements</title><p>Further analysis of chromosomal coverage showed that some regions within mainly unannotated sections of the genome displayed read depth patterns that could indicate the presence of NB-LRR genes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>). In total, we identified 5832 genomic fragments from the 12 DM chromosomes and unanchored superscaffolds using a cut-off of 20&#x000d7; RenSeq coverage over at least 500 consecutive bases as defined from the annotated NB-LRR coverage. We extracted these genomic regions and subjected them to our previously published NB-LRR identification approach using the established 20 NB-LRR-descriptive amino acid motifs in the motif alignment and search tool (MAST) to predict sequences with a motif composition similar to NB-LRR genes (Jupe <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Table S2). This process identified a total of 331 yet uncharacterized NB-LRR loci, of which 304 could be placed onto the established potato chromosomes leaving 27 in currently unanchored superscaffolds (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref> and Table S2). The majority (205) of the here identified NB-LRR loci resides within genomic regions for which no gene models are provided by the Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium (PGSC). Our analysis of the previously identified 438 DM NB-LRR genes (Jupe <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) confirmed 424 genes yielding a total of 755 NB-LRR loci in DM (Tables&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref> and S2 and Data S2). Seven previously annotated NB-LRR genes were absent in the current pseudomolecule arrangement, a situation that is probably due to re-arrangements of the genome scaffolds. Further seven partial NB-LRRs were revised to yield more complete NB-LRR genes using our RenSeq data.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Identification of

Using positional information of the first and last motifs, as well as predicted open reading frames, we were able to identify the putative start and stop codons for these genes (Data S2). The updated NB-LRR gene complement comprises over 2.06 Mb sequence (0.24% of the entire potato genome) assuming the previously established average length of 2.7 kb per putative gene (Jupe <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Overall, 54% of the Illumina reads (39.4 million) mapped to the 755 NB-LRR loci, a finding that indicated 225-fold enrichment and corresponds well to the qPCR data. To visualize read depth, we mapped all reads to the NB-LRR complement and created a heat map that showed that most NB-LRR loci displayed a uniform coverage of at least 250-fold, with lower coverage only at the very ends (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>b). All 755 NB-LRR loci were used in a blastn search (Altschul <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>) against the previously annotated 438 genes, and revealed that 584 sequences belong to the CNL group and 157 to TNLs, while 14 sequences could not be assigned to any group.</p><p>The potato genome still contains a number of regions with unknown sequence content, and among the NB-LRR genes we identified 39 with assembly errors presented as stretches of Ns of varying length. We randomly selected nine NB-LRR genes, and mapped <italic>de novo</italic> Velvet-assembled contigs of the DM RenSeq reads to their corresponding reference sequence under relaxed conditions. Sequence information spanning the entire gap regions allowed us to revise the length of these ambiguous fragments and we were able to close three gaps of up to 141 nt length (DMG 0032578, RDC0001NLR0038 and RDC0 001NLR0327). As an example, RDC0001NLR0038 is shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>(c,d). The results were confirmed by very stringent mapping of DM RenSeq reads, with polymorphism free sequence overhangs into available flanking regions. For further five putative NB-LRRs (RDC0001NLR0027, RDC0001NLR0286, DMG 0022785, DMG 2018576 and DMG 0007869), assembled contigs were not long enough to span the entire gap and, therefore, up to four rounds of iterative mapping of RenSeq reads followed by narrowing the gap using the overhanging sequencing reads was conducted. In the case of RDC0001NLR0295, we were unable to resolve the gap even after four rounds of mapping and iterative closing, and believe a genomic misassembly could be the cause. By mapping <italic>de novo</italic> assembled contigs, we were further able to identify and revise three deletions in two sequences (seven nt in DMG 0032578 and 35/41 nt in RDC0001NLR0027), which we again confirmed by stringent mapping of paired-end RenSeq reads.</p><p>Using the latest available DM chromosomal pseudomolecules version 4.03 (Potato Genome Mapping Group; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://solanaceae.plantbiology.msu.edu/">http://solanaceae.plantbiology.msu.edu/</ext-link>), we could position 704 NB-LRR loci (93%) on the 12 chromosomes, whilst 51 loci (6.7%) remain on currently unanchored superscaffolds. The current potato chromosomal pseudomolecules showed significant changes with respect to those used in our earlier analysis (Jupe <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), including inversions and translocations of chromosomal segments (Potato Genome Mapping Group, personal communication). Revised chromosomal locations for all NB-LRRs are depicted in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref> and in more detail in Figure S1.

In line with previous data (Jupe <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), 76% (577) of the chromosomal anchored NB-LRR loci reside within a total of 92 clusters (Tables S2 and S3). Next to the expansion of existing clusters (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>a), we observed the emergence of, among others, a CNL cluster on chromosome 11 (NLR0278 to NLR0280; three members; Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>b), and two TIR-NB-LRR clusters on chromosome 6 (NLR0145 to NLR0159; 17 members) and chromosome 12 (NLR0300 to NLR0310; 12 members; Figure S1 and Table S2), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Theoretical prediction of the tomato NB-LRR complement</title><p>We have shown that the RenSeq experiment and analysis significantly expanded the existing potato NB-LRR gene complement. To establish whether our bait-library could improve the annotation of the second sequenced important <italic>Solanum</italic> crop tomato, we applied an <italic>in silico</italic> version of this approach to the available tomato NB-LRR annotation. The tolerance for sequence diversity between baits and target genes was established bioinformatically through local alignments. We applied the blastn algorithm to search for sequence similarities between the reads and the bait-library, and produced a distribution of sequence identities. We included in this analysis RenSeq data that we obtained by NB-LRR-enrichment and Illumina sequencing from the reference DM and four diverse <italic>Solanum</italic> species, three potato (<italic>S.&#x000a0;ruiz-ceballosii, S.&#x000a0;berthaultii, S.&#x000a0;michoacanum</italic>) and a nightshade (<italic>S.&#x000a0;nigrum</italic>). The lowest sequence identity to any bait that we found <italic>in silico</italic> amongst the sequenced reads was 80.3%. This analysis, however, does not take into account any chemical or physical properties that would allow for more mismatches to occur during the hybridisation between RNA-baits and DNA fragments.</p><p>We used this empirically determined threshold to screen for sequence stretches within the assembled tomato chromosomes (TGC <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) <italic>in silico</italic> that contained bait matches with at least 80% sequence identity. An analysis of randomly selected tomato NB-LRRs (TGC <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) determined that at least four unique baits aligned to their predicted sequence. Applying these criteria, 531 regions were extracted including up to 2kb flanking regions and we subsequently analyzed these regions using blastn searches against the DM NB-LRR set and NCBI nr-database. This identified an additional 67 yet uncharacterized NB-LRR encoding regions and, similar to potato, most of these were within previously unannotated regions. For 29 tomato gene models that were annotated as NB-LRRs by the TGC, the sequence search did not retrieve any NB-LRR-like hit. Additional blastn searches against the NCBI nr-database also failed to confirm sequence similarity to NB-LRR genes and let us conclude that these are most likely annotation errors. Further sequence similarity searches suggested that several physically adjacent NB-LRR fragments could be combined to form complete coding sequences. In total, we identified 394 NB-LRR encoding loci from the tomato genome, and we were able to position 387 on the 12 chromosomes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref> and Table S4).

We used two established populations segregating for resistance towards the late blight pathogen <italic>P. infestans</italic>, derived from the outcrossing species <italic>Solanum berthaultii</italic> (<italic>Rpi-ber2</italic>; Park <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and <italic>Solanum ruiz-ceballosii</italic> (<italic>Rpi-rzc1</italic>; &#x0015a;liwka <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The underlying single dominant <italic>R</italic> genes <italic>Rpi-ber2</italic> and <italic>Rpi-rzc1</italic> have previously been mapped in F1 segregating populations to the long arm of chromosome 10, where several NB-LRR gene clusters are present (Park <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bakker <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Jupe <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref> and this work). Due to the outcrossing nature of these <italic>Solanum</italic> spp., the resistant parents are heterozygous at the resistance locus and the resulting F1-population segregates 1:1 for pathogen recognition. Prior to enrichment, we bulked susceptible (BS) and resistant (BR) gDNA samples (25 individuals for <italic>Rpi-ber2</italic>, 50 individuals for <italic>Rpi-rzc1</italic>) and sequenced post-enrichment samples on an Illumina GAII (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>a). A qPCR was carried out as described above and revealed an enrichment of NB-LRR sequences of &#x0223c;300-fold.</p><p>We further analyzed the enrichment efficiency and read depth over the established NB-LRR loci as described above. Similar to the high uniformity that we found for the DM enrichment (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>a), the read depth coverage for most NB-LRRs from <italic>S.&#x000a0;berthaultii</italic> and <italic>S.&#x000a0;ruiz-ceballosii</italic> was above 250-fold which reduced to below 100-fold in the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends (no single reads allowed, Figure S2). This confirms the ability to apply the bait-library-based NB-LRR gene enrichment to a divergent set of <italic>Solanum</italic> species at high efficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x02018;Quick mapping&#x02019; to the DM NB-LRR reference</title><p>We developed a two-tiered SNP-calling pipeline, using two reference genomes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>a). During the first &#x02018;quick mapping&#x02019;, we utilize the existing DM NB-LRR loci sequences as a reference to identify genomic regions enriched for sequence variations. For both diploid populations we separately mapped BS and BR paired-end reads using BWA (Li and Durban, <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Based on the genetically dominant nature of the mapped resistance, susceptible plants are expected to be homozygous at the functional resistance gene locus and resistant plants heterozygous, with an expected ratio of 1:1. However, our pipeline can be adjusted to detect SNPs in populations with other predicted ratios. To facilitate the analysis of short Illumina reads of very similar allelic and paralogous NB-LRRs, we searched for BR specific polymorphisms, where the alternate base was present in at least 25% of the reads at this position and &#x02018;absent&#x02019; in BS (cut-off 5%), and plotted the numbers of predicted SNPs for each of the 755 DM NB-LRR reference sequences (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>a,c). This mapping confirmed the previously reported position of both genes, <italic>Rpi-ber2</italic> and <italic>Rpi-rzc1,</italic> within the NB-LRR gene clusters C71 to C74. Therefore, this presents an important application of RenSeq and the re-annotated NB-LRR complement of DM to define more rapidly candidate resistant loci.</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>&#x02018;Quick&#x02019; and &#x02018;genotype-specific mapping&#x02019; analyses identify <italic>R</italic> gene candidate loci in <italic>S.&#x000a0;berthaultii</italic> and <italic>S.&#x000a0;ruiz-ceballosii</italic>. &#x02018;Quick mapping&#x02019; (a,c) was carried out for NB-LRR enriched Illumina reads of BS and BR DNA of <italic>S.&#x000a0;berthaultii</italic> and <italic>S.&#x000a0;ruiz-ceballosii</italic> segregating populations to the 755 DM NB-LRR loci followed by SNP calling.

Subsequent <italic>de novo</italic> assembly and &#x02018;genotype-specific mapping&#x02019; to the resulting contigs (b,d) further reduced the background of SNPs and allowed a more specific resolution of variations that are unique to the BR individuals. These variations were further used to create genetic markers that were used to analyze the segregating populations. Genotyping the populations resulted in a physical linkage map (e) for the <italic>Rpi-ber2</italic> population with closely linked markers derived from NB-LRR homologues within clusters C73 and C74 (Table S2).

In conjunction with a bulked segregant analysis (BSA), this approach allows us to detect polymorphism co-segregating with, or closely linked to, functional <italic>R</italic> gene alleles.</p><p>The various analyses of NB-LRR genes of potato and tomato described so far (Jupe <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Lozano <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Andolfo <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) were solely based on the existing automated gene and protein predictions of the Potato and Tomato Genome Sequencing efforts (PGSC <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; TGC <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Here, we used experimentally derived sequence data to identify 331 previously unannotated NB-LRR sequences in the potato clone DM. Furthermore, by mapping the bait-library sequences under experimentally verified stringencies to the tomato genome, we were able to verify current NB-LRR gene models, eliminate wrong annotations and reannotate existing models. The NB-LRR gene complements for both important crops have increased to 755 in DM and 394 in tomato, revealing further NB-LRR clusters. Of the genes described in this study, 75% reside in poorly or previously unannotated regions of the potato and tomato genome.</p><p>The limitation of gene or gene fragment identification requires alternative approaches to annotate gene families of interest. We previously demonstrated that many NB-LRR genes that were annotated as partial (PGSC <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) were actually full length, with the missing sequences residing in the flanking regions (Jupe <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Many of the NB-LRRs that are identified and presented in this study were found to reside within previously identified clusters of genes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>). Furthermore, most genes are putatively full length and many have putative RNAseq coverage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://solanaceae.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/potato/">http://solanaceae.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/potato/</ext-link>). There is thus no obvious reason arising from the sequence information why the gene prediction software failed to annotate them. That we were able to identify these genes validates RenSeq as an annotation tool.</p><p>NB-LRR gene sequences are highly conserved among plant species, and thus RenSeq relies initially on a partially annotated genome of a relative to the species of interest to design the bait-library. Therefore, without relying on gene models of poorly or unannotated genomes, RenSeq provides a valid tool to discover NB-LRR loci rapidly. The sequence similarity among NB-LRR genes enables deep coverage over all NB-LRR domains. These regions can be verified further using our NB-LRR gene-specific MEME motifs and MAST search pipeline (Jupe <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and, if necessary, annotated through further predictions of open reading frames or through alignments to other NB-LRR sequences.</p><p>RenSeq-derived sequence data allow not only the identification of the NB-LRR gene complements, but also the revision of gene models provided by the sequencing consortia of the respective organisms. We provide examples of RenSeq data being used to close gaps, identify deletions within NB-LRR sequences of the DM reference genome and to correct misassembled sequences. This approach is especially relevant for heterozygous species, including most wild potato relatives.</p><p>Here we show that short RenSeq Illumina reads can be assembled <italic>de novo</italic> with high accuracy to generate contigs, representing the majority of the NB-LRR loci. Although these assemblies in most cases do not span whole gene models, they can still be used as genotype-specific references to study NB-LRRs across species or genotypes. This approach eliminates the necessity to sequence whole genomes, and allows also the exploration of allelic diversity. We show that BSA combined with targeted short read sequencing of NB-LRR sequences enables SNP calling within members of this gene family, using a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of BSA derived RenSeq data as a reference. The presented computational analysis enables the identification of NB-LRR alleles that co-segregate with the underlying resistance in hitherto unsequenced species. In comparison with DArT, another high-throughput genotyping technique (Jaccoud <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), RenSeq aided the development of the closest markers for the <italic>Rpi-rzc1</italic> resistance (&#x0015a;liwka <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>., <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) within a cluster of candidate resistance genes.</p><p>One drawback that we encountered is that although all NB-LRR genes are highly covered with RenSeq reads it is difficult to assemble full-length genes with a high degree of confidence from Illumina 76-bp sequences. This situation is mainly due to the number of large gene sub-families and the high sequence similarity between paralogs and alleles. However, emerging sequencing technologies that are compatible with RenSeq such as single molecule PacBio RS (Pacific Bioscience, Ltd.) sequencing, which can potentially yield 20 kb long DNA fragments, provide suitable alternatives for overcoming this current limitation of the approach.</p><p>The here presented method can be designed for, and applied to, any multigene family, both to improve the annotation and to identify polymorphisms between parental lines and populations that segregate for a specific trait.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec><title>Design of a customized NB-LRR enrichment library</title><p>Capture of NB-LRR like sequences was carried out using a solution-based customized Agilent SureSelect Target Enrichment kit (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), using the first draft of the potato NB-LRR gene complement.

For &#x02018;quick mapping&#x02019; quality controlled (as described above) BS and BR PE reads were mapped separately to 755 NB-LRRs (this work) using BWA with default settings. The resulting SAM files were filtered for mapped reads and PCR/optical duplicates, and further converted into BAM files. An MPileup file was created from the BAM information and subsequently filtered for base quality (&#x0003e;20) and nucleotide coverage of higher than 50. The percentage of the variant allele was calculated for each position and those with an alternative allele &#x0003e;25% in BR and &#x0003c;5% in BS were used further. Next, BR and BS positions matching the above criteria were compared and common ones kept as BR unique SNPs. The number of SNPs per NB-LRR reference sequence was calculated and plotted in chromosomal order using R (R Core Developers, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</ext-link>).
