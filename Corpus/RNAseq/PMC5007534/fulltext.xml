In this study we aimed to clarify the CcpA regulon by determining the impact of CcpA-inactivation on the virulence and transcriptome of three distinct serotypes of the major human pathogen Group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (GAS). CcpA-inactivation significantly decreased GAS virulence in a broad array of animal challenge models consistent with the idea that CcpA is critical to gram-positive bacterial pathogenesis. Via comparative transcriptomics, we established that the GAS CcpA core regulon is enriched for highly conserved CcpA binding motifs (i.e. <italic>cre</italic> sites). Conversely, strain-specific differences in the CcpA transcriptome seems to consist primarily of affected secondary networks. Refinement of <italic>cre</italic> site composition via analysis of the core regulon facilitated development of a modified <italic>cre</italic> consensus that shows promise for improved prediction of CcpA targets in other medically relevant gram-positive pathogens.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>It is being increasingly appreciated that efficient acquisition and metabolism of nutrients are key aspects of bacterial pathogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Adaptation to various nutritional niches depends critically on the ability of bacteria to respond to diverse environmental stimuli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Perception of these stimuli is relayed by regulatory proteins to effect changes at transcriptional and translational levels leading to adaptive changes at the cellular level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Not surprisingly, therefore, regulatory proteins that affect basic bacterial physiology and metabolism have been found to be intimately linked to virulence in several infectious bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is one of the most fundamental and highly conserved mechanisms which ensures optimal utilization of energy resources<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In many gram-positive bacteria, CCR is primarily mediated by the highly conserved catabolite control protein A (CcpA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> which interacts with pseudo-palindromic <italic>cis</italic>-acting DNA motifs known as catabolite responsive elements (<italic>cre</italic>) to alter target gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In the presence of its phosphorylated co-effector histidine-containing protein HPr (HPr-Ser46-P), CcpA binds target DNA with increased affinity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The production of HPr-Ser46-P by HPr kinase/phosphorylase (HPrK/P), in turn, is determined by the intra-cellular energy status, and thus the CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P) interaction links CcpA-mediated transcription to changing nutritional conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated a connection between CcpA and the virulence of major gram-positive pathogens such as <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, <italic>Staphylococccus aureus</italic>, <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>, <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, and <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In light of the tremendous burden of gram-positive bacterial infections, CcpA is one of the most influential regulatory proteins modulating the virulence landscape of pathogenic bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Despite being extensively investigated for over 20 years, there remains numerous, critical knowledge gaps regarding CcpA function and its impact on bacterial pathogenesis. For example, although CcpA is known to affect expression of ~15% of the genomes of numerous bacterial species, the contribution of direct vs. indirect CcpA-mediated effects on transcription remains unclear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Similarly, the role of CcpA in gram-positive bacterial virulence has primarily been studied in bacteremia models, which only represent a fraction of the types of infections that CcpA-containing bacteria cause<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Further information regarding the contribution of CcpA to gram-positive bacterial pathogenesis is needed given the potential role of the CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P)-HPrK/P axis as a novel antimicrobial target<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p><p>The majority of knowledge regarding CcpA-mediated effects on gene expression has occurred in the avirulent <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> which is distantly related to most organisms in which a role for CcpA in pathogenesis has been established<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In contrast, Group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (GAS) causes a wide range of infections in humans for which animal models are established<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, is rendered less virulent by CcpA-inactivation, and is closely related to other organisms whose infectivity is affected by CcpA-deletion such as <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus suis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Thus, GAS can be used to assess the nature of the regulatory impact of CcpA on the infectivity of gram-positive pathogens. We previously established that CcpA-inactivation in a serotype M1 GAS strain affects the expression of ~15% of the genome and reduces lethality in a bacteremia infection model. There are &#x0003e;140 distinct M serotypes of GAS and inactivation of a regulatory protein can have dramatically different effects depending on the GAS serotype being studied<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Thus, we sought to study CcpA-inactivation in multiple GAS serotypes to test the hypotheses that the effect of CcpA-inactivation on GAS virulence is not serotype dependent and that comparative transcriptomics of GAS strains lacking CcpA would facilitate identification of the core GAS CcpA regulon.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>CcpA</italic> deletion has serotype-specific effects</title><p>To improve understanding of the contribution of CcpA to the broad pathophysiology of GAS infections, we sought to analyze CcpA function in M serotype strains that are leading causes of GAS infections and are distantly related based on whole-genome phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. We also used parental strains that are fully sequenced and known to lack mutations in the control of virulence (CovRS) two component system which affects the CcpA transcriptome because CovR and CcpA co-regulate numerous GAS genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Thus, we chose strains MGAS2221 (M1), MGAS10870 (M3), and MGAS6180 (M28) for our study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. The CcpA protein sequence in these three strains is identical (data not shown). Inactivation of CcpA in these three backgrounds resulted in a substantial growth defect in rich medium only for the serotype M3 strain MGAS10870 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Although why only the MGAS10870&#x00394;<italic>ccpA</italic> strain shows a growth defect is not known, importantly, this growth defect is recovered in the <italic>ccpA</italic>-complemented strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>) attributing the absence of <italic>ccpA</italic> as the primary cause of the growth defect. Consistent with previous observations for serotype M1 strains, CcpA-inactivation reduced colony size in strain MGAS10870<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Conversely, MGAS6180 colonies were uniformly small and unaffected by the loss of <italic>ccpA</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>CcpA affects GAS virulence in multiple infection models</title><p>The major disease manifestations of GAS in humans are bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, skin/soft tissue infection, and pharyngitis, each of which have corresponding mouse models of infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Thus, we next assessed the contribution of CcpA to GAS virulence in each murine challenge model. Compared to their parental strains, all <italic>ccpA</italic>-inactivated strains caused significantly less mortality in the bacteremia model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We confirmed the lack of spurious mutations causing the observed differences by showing that complementation of the mutant strains with <italic>ccpA in trans</italic> restored virulence to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Similarly, in the myositis model, which mimics necrotizing fasciitis in humans, <italic>ccpA</italic>-inactivation significantly decreased mortality for all serotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Moreover, in the subcutaneous challenge model of skin/soft tissue infection, all three parental strains formed significantly larger ulcers than their <italic>ccpA</italic>-inactivated derivatives (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Finally, following oropharyngeal challenge, a model for human pharyngitis, <italic>ccpA</italic>-inactivation caused a significant decrease in organism recovery for the M1 and M3 strains. However, we observed a significant increase in organism density over time for strain 6180&#x00394;<italic>ccpA</italic> compared to MGAS6180 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). One possible explanation for these discordant results is the known inability of MGAS6180 to produce the broad-spectrum cysteine protease SpeB, which inactivates innate effector molecules present in human saliva<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Indeed, we found that CcpA-inactivation significantly decreased SpeB activity in MGAS2221 and MGAS10870, but did not affect the absence of SpeB production in MGAS6180 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Thus, in 11 of 12 animal challenge studies, CcpA-inactivation significantly decreased GAS virulence consistent with the idea that CcpA is critical to GAS pathogenesis across a diverse array of serotypes and infection models.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Using a multi-serotype approach to define the core GAS CcpA regulon</title><p>Given that the CcpA regulon includes numerous transcription factors, the CcpA transcriptome consists of genes that are directly regulated by CcpA and those that are secondarily affected by CcpA-inactivation, but there is limited understanding of the relative contribution of direct vs. indirect CcpA-mediated regulation which in turn obscures precise characterization of CcpA-DNA interaction. We sought to better define genes that are directly regulated by CcpA by determining the CcpA transcriptome in multiple GAS serotypes with the idea that deletion of a highly conserved regulator should impact a core set of genes across multiple serotypes. Thus, we expect the &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; to consist mostly of conserved <italic>cre</italic>-bearing primary targets of CcpA, and genes that are modulated by conserved CcpA-affected regulators. To this end, we performed RNAseq analyses in quadruplicate for the three serotype representatives and their &#x00394;<italic>ccpA</italic> mutants grown to mid-exponential phase in THY. RNAseq data has been deposited in GEO repository under the accession #GSE84641. Consistent with the reproducibility of the data, principal component analysis proved the transcriptomes of the wild-type and their <italic>ccpA</italic>-inactivated strains to be distinct in each serotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). We defined differentially expressed genes as those with a minimum mean transcript level difference of 2-fold and a corrected <italic>P</italic> value of &#x02264;0.01. When analyzing genes that have homologs in all three serotypes, we observed significantly different transcript levels for 310, 386 and 307 genes in the <italic>ccpA</italic> mutants compared to their parental M1, M3 and M28 serotype strains respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This amounted to an average of 19% of ORFs in each serotype being differentially expressed, which is comparable to the observed CcpA regulon in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (16%) and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (14&#x02013;19%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. 173 genes were differentially expressed in all three serotypes thereby defining the core GAS CcpA regulon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Importantly, the core genes account for only 32% of the genes differentially expressed among the three serotypes indicating that our multi-serotype approach helped to remove serotype-specific genes that are unlikely to be directly regulated by CcpA. Supporting our hypothesis that the GAS CcpA core regulon was enriched for primary CcpA target genes, nearly 90% of the core genes were CcpA-repressed. This contrasted with an average of 63% repressed : 37% activated ratio when a particular serotype was studied (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 by &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Of the 250 genes differentially regulated in only a single serotype, which accounted for 46% of all genes affected by CcpA-inactivation, only 35% were repressed by CcpA while 65% were activated. These findings suggest that much of CcpA-mediated activation, which has accounted for up to 40% of CcpA-influenced genes in previous investigations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, is unlikely to be a direct effect of CcpA, but rather to strain-specific regulatory circuits influenced by CcpA-inactivation. These data are in concert with those published in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> which identified only three operons as activated by CcpA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.</p><p>To better understand the functional impact of the CcpA regulon across serotypes, we assigned genes into cluster of orthologous groups (COGs). Five COGs were consistently enriched in all three serotypes of which carbohydrate transport and metabolism [G] comprised the largest number of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Two of these COGS, G and S, have also been reported to dominate the CcpA-influenced genes in other gram-positive pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. However, several COGs, such as M (Cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis), R (General function prediction only) and E (Amino acid transport and metabolism), that had previously been identified as part of the CcpA regulon in other species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> were only enriched in one or two of the GAS serotypes studied here suggesting that these particular COGs may be part of the strain-specific CcpA regulon rather than a core aspect of CcpA physiology.</p><p>Given the critical impact of CcpA on GAS pathogenesis, we determined how CcpA-inactivation affected known virulence gene transcript levels. Interestingly, only the nine gene operon encoding the cytolysin, streptolysin S (<italic>sagA-sagI</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, was influenced by CcpA in every serotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). CcpA-dependent serotype-specific variation was observed for the IL-8-degrading <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> cell envelope proteinase (SpyCEP) and the immunoglobulin cleaving endoglycosidaseS (EndoS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. The promoter regions of the <italic>spyCEP</italic> and <italic>endoS</italic> genes contained no clear distinctions to account for the serotype-specific differences. Taken together, we conclude that the multi-serotype transcriptomic approach allowed for clarification of the core CcpA regulon.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Functional <italic>cre</italic> sites are highly conserved across GAS serotypes</title><p>Although we postulate that serotype-specific CcpA-affected genes primarily represent indirect effects, it remains formally possible that the observed differences could be due to heterogeneity in <italic>cre</italic> site composition between homologs in the various serotypes (e.g. while the promoter of a gene specifically regulated in MGAS2221 contains a <italic>cre</italic> site, this site is absent in MGAS10870 and MGAS6180). We searched for <italic>cre</italic> sites within 150&#x02009;bp upstream and 50&#x02009;bp downstream of predicted translation start sites for all genes (only the first gene for operons) in MGAS2221, MGAS10870 and MGAS6180. We identified 72, 71 and 75 <italic>cre</italic> sites respectively, of which 68, 82 and 74% were differentially regulated by CcpA as demonstrated by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Of the 173 core genes, 103, 95 and 90 genes in serotypes M1, M3 and M28 respectively were present in operons with <italic>cre</italic> operators. In contrast, only 4, 10 and 11 of the 250 genes that displayed serotype-specific alteration in M1, M3 and M28 strains had <italic>cre</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Consistent with our core transcriptome data indicating that CcpA mainly functions as a repressor, 92, 84 and 90% of the regulated <italic>cre</italic>-bearing genes were derepressed in the <italic>ccpA</italic> mutants of M1, M3 and M28 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). These data support the idea that serotype-specific variation as well as CcpA-mediated gene activation in GAS is primarily driven by indirect targets of CcpA.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Comparison of <italic>cre</italic> and <italic>cre2</italic> sites in the GAS CcpA regulon</title><p>Although the vast majority of CcpA-DNA interaction has focused on <italic>cre</italic> sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, a recent study assessing the targets of CcpA in <italic>S. suis</italic> reported a second CcpA-binding DNA motif, designated as <italic>cre2</italic>&#x02009;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Given that the CcpA protein in GAS and <italic>S. suis</italic> is highly conserved (79% identity), we next sought to determine the occurrence of <italic>cre2</italic> sites in our representative GAS strains. A consensus motif developed from 45 <italic>cre2</italic> sites reported in <italic>S. suis</italic> was used to search the regulatory region of the first genes of operons in MGAS2221, MGAS10870 and MGAS6180.

Moreover, genes with <italic>cre2</italic> operators had a significantly lower frequency of CcpA-dependent repression than <italic>cre</italic>-containing genes (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). The core GAS CcpA regulon has only 19 <italic>cre2</italic>-bearing operons compared to 35 <italic>cre</italic>-bearing operons, with 12 operons containing both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Thus, although <italic>cre2</italic> sites might be involved in mediating CcpA-based regulation in a different growth phase or metabolic status of the cell, our data suggest that <italic>cre</italic> sites predominate in determining the CcpA regulon under the tested conditions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Developing an improved <italic>cre</italic> motif</title><p>To this point, we had more clearly defined the core GAS CcpA regulon through our multi-serotype transcriptomic approach which facilitated removal of off-target effects that pervaded previous single strain studies. Thus, we next sought to use these data to optimize a <italic>cre</italic> consensus for GAS in particular and pathogenic gram-positive bacteria in general. Importantly, the <italic>cre</italic> site consensus derived from our GAS CcpA core regulon had several key differences from the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). A recent study reported a near absolute occurrence of Cytosine (C) and Guanine (G) at positions 8 and 9 in <italic>B. subtilis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. In GAS, the occurrence of C8 is also nearly absolute, but position 9 shows more flexibility, with almost 20% of the regulated genes coding for a nucleotide other than G at this position. The predominance of G at position 7 for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is not observed for GAS, which showed greater variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). There is also increased flexibility at position 3 in terms of its requirement of a G in GAS. In contrast, the requisite of a Thymine (T) at positions 11 and 12 is much more stringent in GAS compared to <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. The amino acid residues in the CcpA protein identified as interacting with these specific <italic>cre</italic> base pairs in a crystallographic analysis are highly conserved within the CcpA subfamily<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> and show no differences between <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. However, there is increased amino acid variation between CcpA from GAS and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> in the C-terminal region, which has been shown to interact with the N-terminal DNA binding domain, that may account for the observed heterogeneity in <italic>cre</italic> site composition.</p><p>Next we sought to determine whether the GAS-optimized <italic>cre</italic> consensus (denoted as <italic>cre</italic><sub>GAS</sub> for the remainder of this manuscript) improves the ability to identify CcpA-regulated genes in major pathogenic gram-positive bacteria with published CcpA transcriptomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. To this end, <italic>cre</italic><sub>GAS</sub> sites were predicted for <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and then compared to their published CcpA regulons to determine how many of our predicted <italic>cre</italic><sub>GAS</sub> sites have experimental evidence of CcpA-dependent gene expression changes. We then performed a similar comparison for the <italic>cre</italic> sites of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. pneumonia</italic> predicted by the RegPrecise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> database, which uses <italic>in sillico</italic> methods to curate regulons of various transcription factors. In <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, we predicted 60 sites in concert with RegPrecise, of which 39 (65%), have been confirmed to be regulated experimentally<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). We identified 68 sites not called by RegPrecise, of which 24 (35%) had reported CcpA-dependent regulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Among these were genes encoding an arginine deiminase and a neuraminate lyase, both of which contribute to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> virulence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. In contrast, of the 18 cre sites predicted by RegPrecise alone, only 3 (17%) were affected by CcpA-inactivation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Similarly, in <italic>S. aureus</italic> we identified 17 <italic>cre</italic><sub>GAS</sub> sites that are present in CcpA-affected genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> but were not predicted by RegPrecise whereas RegPrecise alone identified only 4 such sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Hence, our <italic>cre</italic><sub>GAS</sub> consensus derived from our multi-strain approach proved to be a powerful tool to refine understanding of the CcpA regulons of pathogenic gram-positive organisms.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Herein, we employed a multi-serotype approach to clarify the core GAS CcpA regulon, which we found to mainly consist of repressed genes that are likely to be directly affected by CcpA given the presence of <italic>cre</italic> elements. The power of this method is exemplified by the fact that only 173 of the 540 genes (32%) differentially regulated in the three serotypes were affected in all three strains. Thus, our data suggest that many of the previously published CcpA transcriptomes are likely to contain strain-specific, secondary effects of CcpA-inactivation. Our improved <italic>cre</italic><sub>GAS</sub> motif derived from the multi-strain transcriptome data should facilitate more accurate <italic>in sillico</italic> prediction of CcpA-regulated genes in a broad array of pathogens.</p><p>Interestingly, we observed that a significant proportion of the CcpA core regulon (55%) is non-<italic>cre</italic>-bearing. This observation could indicate an undiscovered, non-<italic>cre</italic>-based mode of CcpA regulation, such as the <italic>cre2</italic> motif recently proposed in <italic>S. suis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. However, even incorporation of the <italic>cre2</italic> motif accounted for only 15 additional genes in the core regulon. It remains possible that the core GAS CcpA regulon genes that lack <italic>cre</italic> or <italic>cre2</italic> sites are part of the transcriptional regulatory network of a CcpA-affected regulator, given that the core CcpA regulon includes at least two TCSs, eight stand-alone regulators, and two transcriptional antiterminator proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p><p>The concept of metabolic regulators as virulence determinants is supported by the fact that the ability of a pathogen to thrive requires the capacity to exploit food sources in the host, which in turn relies on control of metabolic pathways. Thus, further understanding of CcpA function could assist in the development of novel preventive or therapeutic strategies applicable to numerous gram-positive pathogens.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Mouse experiments were conducted as per protocols approved by the MD Anderson Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol Number: 00000808).

The throats of all mice were swabbed before inoculation and daily after to determine GAS CFU density over time. For skin/soft tissue infections, immunocompetent hairless SKH1-hrbr female mice (Charles River BRF) were used, because the lack of hair facilitates lesion monitoring and excision.

All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software. To ensure that observed phenotypic differences were not due to spurious mutations, we included the complemented strains in the bacteremia model.
