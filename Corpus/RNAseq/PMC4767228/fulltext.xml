We previously identified relatively greater success culturing dura-derived fibroblasts than scalp-derived fibroblasts from postmortem tissue. We hypothesized that these differences in culture success were related to epigenetic differences between the cultured fibroblasts by sampling location, and therefore generated genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome data on 11 intrinsically matched pairs of dural and scalp fibroblasts from donors across the lifespan (infant to 85 years). While these cultured fibroblasts were several generations removed from the primary tissue and morphologically indistinguishable, we found widespread epigenetic differences by sampling location at the single CpG (N = 101,989), region (N = 697), &#x0201c;block&#x0201d; (N = 243), and global spatial scales suggesting a strong epigenetic memory of original fibroblast location. Furthermore, many of these epigenetic differences manifested in the transcriptome, particularly at the region-level. We further identified 7,265 CpGs and 11 regions showing significant epigenetic memory related to the age of the donor, as well as an overall increased epigenetic variability, preferentially in scalp-derived fibroblasts&#x02014;83% of loci were more variable in scalp, hypothesized to result from cumulative exposure to environmental stimuli in the primary tissue. By integrating publicly available DNA methylation datasets on individual cell populations in blood and brain, we identified significantly increased inter-individual variability in our scalp- and other skin-derived fibroblasts on a similar scale as epigenetic differences between different lineages of blood cells. Lastly, these epigenetic differences did not appear to be driven by somatic mutation&#x02014;while we identified 64 probable de-novo variants across the 11 subjects, there was no association between mutation burden and age of the donor (p = 0.71). These results depict a strong component of epigenetic memory in cell culture from primary tissue, even after several generations of daughter cells, related to cell state and donor age.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Regenerative medicine specialists have been using a type of cell commonly found in the skin called the fibroblast because it is easily obtained from skin samples, grows well in culture, and can be manipulated in the laboratory to de-differentiate into a primordial state known as the induced pluripotent stem cell. These primitive stem cells can then be transformed into mature tissues, such as liver or pancreas cells. Here we show that fibroblasts, coming from different locations in the same individual, vary significantly in epigenetic marks called DNA methylation, which are involved in the regulation of gene expression. In addition to location-specific patterns of DNA methylation, we also find that fibroblasts from different anatomical locations respond differently in epigenetic patterns related to aging. As the field of regenerative medicine advances, our study demonstrates that deciding upon the source of fibroblasts from an individual to generate new tissues and organs may be an important consideration.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by funding from the Lieber Institute for Brain Development.

For example, DNAm levels at particular genomic loci can accurately classify different tissues [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and even underlying cell types within tissues [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These stable cell type- and tissue-discriminating loci appear to represent only a subset of "dynamic" CpGs, approximately 21.8%, actively involved in regulation of gene expression [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Changes in these epigenetic patterns across aging have been extensively studied [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], particularly in large studies of whole blood [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but subsets of these age-associated CpGs appear tissue-independent [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>These epigenetic barcodes also play an important role in cellular reprogramming (the conversion of somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells), a powerful and promising experimental system in biology, genetics and personalized medicine [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This epigenetic reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) induces demethylation [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] followed by specific patterns of subsequent DNA methylation that can reflect the original somatic tissue [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Fibroblasts are one of the most popular cell types for generating iPSCs [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], particularly from skin, given the relative ease of access to these cells, although other skin-derived cell types such as keratinocytes from the same individual generate similar iPSC lines [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Skin, however, is perhaps the most susceptible tissue source in the body to environmentally induced insult, particularly through sunlight and chemical exposures, which can induce changes in epigenetic patterns [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The epigenetic &#x0201c;memory&#x0201d; of source tissue for iPSC characterization has been well characterized [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In our previous work, we successfully cultured fibroblast lines from the dura mater of postmortem human donors, a source location largely protected from environmental insult with slowly dividing cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We compared these cultured fibroblast lines to those derived from scalp samples from the same individuals, and found that the rate of culture success was higher for dura-derived fibroblasts; in some cases only the dura fibroblasts from an individual would culture. While the resulting cultured cells from these two sampling locations were largely morphologically indistinguishable (see Figure 1 in Bliss et al, 2012 [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]), we hypothesized that increased culture success might have a strong epigenetic component. Previous research has shown that dermal fibroblasts from different locations in the body have distinct gene expression profiles [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], including compared to some non-dermal sources [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and previous reports have indicated that cultured cells have largely stable epigenomes, with the exception of a small number of loci [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We therefore sought to characterize the methylomes and transcriptomes of fibroblasts from these two sampling locations&#x02013;scalp and dura&#x02013;from donors across the lifespan.</p><p>Here we identify several components of epigenetic &#x0201c;memory&#x0201d; in cultured fibroblasts after multiple passages (i.e. splitting and continuing to grow) where primary tissue originated from two locations in the body. The strongest epigenetic memory was related to sampling location in the body, as we identified widespread DNAm differences at local and regional spatial scales preserved through identical culturing processes. We further find increased stochastic epigenetic variability in cultured fibroblasts from the scalp compared to dura. This increased variability manifested in significant increased quantitative pairwise methylome-wide distances in a combined analysis with publicly available DNAm data on skin fibroblasts [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], pure cell populations from peripheral blood [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and cells from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Another component of epigenetic memory was related to the age of the donor, including a subset of CpGs that displayed location-dependent changes through aging. The epigenetic differences between these fibroblasts appear to occur largely through epigenetic-dependent mechanisms, as there were few differences in coding sequence across the fibroblasts from the two locations within the same individual. These results demonstrate the effect of epigenetic memory in cultured fibroblasts by sampling location and donor age in morphologically indistinguishable cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>We measured DNA methylation (DNAm) levels from scalp- and dura-derived cultured fibroblasts in 11 postmortem donors (22 samples) from across the lifespan, ranging from early infancy to 85 years (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005819.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005819.s011">S1 Table</xref>), using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 microarray (Illumina 450k) [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

The majority of significant DMPs (76,971/101,989, 75.47%) were inside or near (within 5kb of) a UCSC annotated gene, and 28.2% (21,742/76,971) were significantly associated with gene expression levels (at p &#x0003c; 0.05). This percentage of DMPs with significant expression readout was elevated (34.9%) among those DMPs with larger DNAm differences by sampling location (greater than 10% difference in DNAm levels). These DMPs were strongly significantly enriched among the CpG sites that associated with expression levels at the p &#x0003c; 0.05 (48,062 probes within 5kb of genes, odds ratio, OR = 3.99, p &#x0003c; 2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>) and FDR &#x0003c; 0.05 (6,559 probes within 5kb of genes, OR = 19.54, p &#x0003c; 2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>) significance thresholds. Surprisingly, we found that the DNAm levels at the majority of these expression-associated differentially methylated CpGs tended to be positively associated with gene expression, regardless of overall methylation levels (un-, partially-, or highly-methylated) or their location in the gene (islands, shores and shelves)&#x02013;these biases towards positive associations were statistically significant for many of these comparisons (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005819.s015">S5 Table</xref>, panels A and B).

The 33,247 transcripts proximal to the DMRs corresponded to 18,699 genes, the majority of which (84.3%, 15,761/18,699) contained more than one transcript.

For instance, a DMR overlapping an intronic sequence of the <italic>SIM1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005819.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) was unmethylated with low corresponding expression of the gene in the cultured fibroblasts from dura, and highly methylated with corresponding high expression levels of the gene in the scalp-derived fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005819.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005819.s012">S2 Table</xref>). This is in line with previous reports suggesting that gene body methylation levels positively associate with local gene expression [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], unlike CpG island shore methylation that tends to be negatively associated with gene expression levels [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Of the 478 unique genes in or within 5kb of DMRs, the expression of 235 (49.2%) of them was significantly correlated with DNAm (p &#x0003c; 0.05). These 235 unique genes tended to exhibit stronger differential expression between the scalp- and dura-derived fibroblasts (median fold change = 1.59, IQR = 1.23&#x02013;2.68) than individual CpG results, in line with previously published findings [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

These enrichments were relatively conserved across the four Roadmap fibroblast samples, further suggesting distinct epigenetic states in scalp- compared to dura-derived fibroblasts.

The age-associated CpGs identified here therefore suggest that altered regulation of DNAm levels across aging occurs primarily in fibroblasts derived from scalp but not from dura, perhaps through altered cell proliferation and apoptosis, and possibly reflecting greater exposure to environmental agents that can affect the methylome.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Epigenetic memory related to sampling location and age do not implicate genetic mosaicism</title><p>Lastly, we characterized the expressed sequences of the scalp- and dura-derived fibroblasts within each individual to examine the extent of genetic mosaicism, which may contribute to differences in DNAm through changing the underlying genetic sequence in the fibroblasts taken from scalp. <italic>De novo</italic> variants were called directly from the RNAseq data, and after filtering by many quality metrics (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Methods</xref>) we identified 64 high-confidence candidate variants that were discordant by sampling location in at least a single individual (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005819.s019">S9 Table</xref>), including 22 annotated coding variants (13 synonymous and 9 non- synonymous) [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We found no association between coding variant burden and subject age (p = 0.71, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005819.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). These results suggest that many of the location- and age-associated DNAm differences are not due to somatic mosaicism and likely arise through epigenetic mechanisms that are maintained through cell culture and multiple passages.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec008"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we interrogated the methylomes and transcriptomes of pairs of fibroblasts cultured from scalp and dura mater taken from the same individual, in a subject cohort that ranges in age across the human lifespan. These cultured fibroblasts, generations removed from the primary tissue of origin, and with indistinguishable morphology, still maintained strong components of epigenetic &#x0201c;memory&#x0201d; related to sampling location (scalp versus dura) and differential changes in DNAm levels across aging. The widespread differences in DNAm levels by sampling location were identified at many spatial scales, including single CpGs, differentially methylated regions, blocks, and globally. Furthermore, many of these differences in DNAm levels manifested in the transcriptome, showing significant corresponding differences in expression for genes most proximal to these epigenetic changes. The genes with differences in expression and DNAm levels by sampling location were previously implicated in processes relating to cell proliferation and apoptosis, which likely relate to the function of the fibroblasts in the primary tissue. One might have predicted this outcome, as fibroblasts in the scalp, including those that are cultured, turnover much more rapidly than those in the dura mater [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which we confirmed here with increased FSP-1 expression in the scalp-derived fibroblasts.</p><p>Another component of epigenetic memory in these cultured fibroblasts was related to ages of the donors, where age-related changes occurred differentially by sampling location. These age-associated loci can be clustered into general patterns of epigenetic changes by age and location, all showing significant interaction between donor age and sampling location. While some patterns were expected, such as divergence in DNAm levels from similar levels at birth (clusters 1, 4, 5, and 7), several other clusters showed an unexpected convergence in DNAm across aging (clusters 2 and 3). We do note that the elderly donor (age 85) is influential in both the statistical discovery at individual loci and in some of the subsequent clusters&#x02013;larger sample sizes can hopefully further define and replicate these observations. Also, while the fibroblasts were analyzed from some subjects with psychiatric disorders, almost all comparisons between scalp and dura sampling locations, and differential changes with age were naturally matched within an individual, reducing the potential impact of diagnostic confounding. Furthermore, a larger sample size would likely identify significant age-related divergence in DNAm at the region level&#x02013;while we found 7,265 individual CpGs, we found very few DMRs at global significance (6 and 11 DMRs at FWER &#x02264; 10% and 20% respectively). The region-finding approach has been shown to be statistically conservative [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and the identification of these differential age-related changes by sampling location was based on number of donors (N = 10), not the number of observations (N = 21). Lastly, while proliferation rates were not measured for these particular fibroblast samples, analyses in a much larger skin biopsy sample (N = 298) showed no association between proliferation rates and donor age [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which was our sampling location with the greater number of age-related changes in DNAm levels.</p><p>These age-related changes in cultured fibroblasts are one of the first examples, to our knowledge, of genome-wide significant age-related changes in a pure cell population that is many mitoses and passages from the original donor cells. Many papers have identified widespread age-related changes in heterogeneous cell populations, like blood [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], brain [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and other tissue types [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which may result in false positives when the underlying cellular composition changes across aging [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Other papers have used individual cell populations to validate age-associated loci identified in homogenate tissue at marginal significance [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] or have identified age-related changes in targeted approaches at limited numbers of loci [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, these fibroblasts cultured from the scalp and dura mater were the first example, again to our knowledge, of morphologically indistinguishable cells with vastly different epigenomic profiles. Using epigenomic distances, these two cohorts of fibroblasts were more different in their DNAm patterns than different lineages of blood cells, while less different that neuronal versus non-neuronal cells from the frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005819.g004">Fig 4</xref>); the cells underlying each comparison have very different morphologies and cellular function. Furthermore, the majority of differences in DNAm levels between scalp- and dura-derived cultured fibroblasts appeared to be determined early in development, prior to early infancy in this sample, and remained stable throughout the lifespan. Of the 101,989 significant DMPs for sampling location, 98,461 (96.5%) were not associated with differential age-related changes. These findings demonstrate strong components of epigenetic memory related to cell location and aging in fibroblasts cultured from the scalp and dura mater from postmortem human donors.</p><p>There are important implications from this study for the field of regenerative medicine. If fibroblasts are going to be the source for iPSCs, and ultimately differentiated tissues, the source of these fibroblasts, and their epigenetic characteristics, may be an important consideration. For example, these differences in cellular states in cultured fibroblasts may relate to the number of cell divisions, as skin and scalp fibroblasts have a much quicker turnover than fibroblasts in the dura [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The extent of cell division could relate to the epigenomic distances between and across the diverse cell types we have analyzed. Analyses in larger samples of skin biopsy-derived fibroblasts suggest that while donor age does not appear to associate with proliferation rates of fibroblasts, the cultured cells derived from younger donors reprogrammed more readily [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which presumably has a strong epigenetic component. Further research may better determine the extent of epigenetic memory of cell state of fibroblasts cultured from different locations after the generation of iPSCs and subsequent differentiation into new cell types. As the field of regenerative medicine advances, our study demonstrates that deciding upon the source of fibroblasts from an individual to generate new tissues and organs may be an important consideration. While it was shown that transcriptional variability by tissue of origin was low in iPSCs (13), it was also demonstrated that the DNAm landscape in iPSCs differs greatly by tissue or origin, and this phenomenon may explain the propensity of iPSCs derived from different somatic tissues to differentiate into different lineages (11).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Human tissue collection</title><p>Human dural and scalp fibroblasts on which the methylation and gene expression studies were performed were obtained from fibroblast lines derived from human post mortem scalp and dura mater tissues.

Prior to carrying out the enrichment analysis, the sex chromosomes and the mitochondrial chromosome were dropped.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Processing of public data and distance calculations</title><p>We performed a second larger data processing and normalization procedure on our scalp- and dura-derived fibroblasts after adding data from skin fibroblasts (GSE52025) [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], pure populations of blood [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and prefrontal cortex cells [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] from the <italic>FlowSorted</italic>.<italic>Blood</italic>.<italic>450k</italic> and <italic>FlowSorted</italic>.<italic>DLPFC</italic>.<italic>450k</italic> Bioconductor packages respectively, and then melanoma data from TCGA [<xref rid="pgen.1005819.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

We filtered out the 101,989 genome-wide significant probes showing mean methylation differences by sampling location, as there is a strong mean-variation relationship in DNAm data due to being constrained within 0 and 1 (e.g. gaining methylation from an unmethylated state or losing methylation from a fully methylated state increases variance).</p><p>We tested for probes that showed differential age-related divergence in DNAm by fibroblast sampling location. First, we calculated the difference in DNAm between scalp- and dura-derived fibroblasts from the same individual at every probe (creating a 456,513 probe by 10 individual matrix). We then computed 3 surrogate variables (the number estimated by the SVA algorithm) for a statistical model with donor age, and fit the following linear model:
