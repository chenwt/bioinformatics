Here, we identified 3844 long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNA) in <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic>, which is a notorious pest of cruciferous plants that has developed field resistance to all classes of insecticides, including <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (Bt) endotoxins. Further, we found that some of those lincRNAs may potentially serve as precursors for the production of small ncRNAs. We found 280 and 350 lincRNAs that are differentially expressed in Chlorpyrifos and Fipronil resistant larvae. A survey on <italic>P. xylostella</italic> midgut transcriptome data from Bt-resistant populations revealed 59 altered lincRNA in two resistant strains compared with the susceptible population. We validated the transcript levels of a number of putative lincRNAs in deltamethrin-resistant larvae that were exposed to deltamethrin, which indicated that this group of lincRNAs might be involved in the response to xenobiotics in this insect. To functionally characterize DBM lincRNAs, gene ontology (GO) enrichment of their associated protein-coding genes was extracted and showed over representation of protein, DNA and RNA binding GO terms. The data presented here will facilitate future studies to unravel the function of lincRNAs in insecticide resistance or the response to xenobiotics of eukaryotic cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Metazoan genomes encode a large number of regulatory and housekeeping noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Regulatory ncRNAs include small RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are mainly involved in regulation of gene expression. RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides, which do not contain an open reading frame of longer than 100 amino acids, are simply defined as lncRNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Although several lncRNAs have been identified and characterized in the last decade, genome-wide identification of this class of ncRNAs has only recently become possible with the advent of whole transcriptome sequencing technologies.</p><p>Generally, they are classified by their location relative to their neighboring protein-coding genes and include the long intergenic ncRNA (lincRNA), intronic lncRNA, antisense lncRNA and enhancer RNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. However, some other nomenclature has been suggested in the light of the rising amount of deep sequencing data, which provides more information on lncRNA function and mechanism. Bonasio and Shiekhattar (2014) classified lncRNAs to promoter-associated RNA (pRNA), enhancer-associated RNA (eRNA), intervening RNA (iRNA) and gene body associated RNAs which included sense (gsRNA) and antisense overlapping non coding RNA (gaRNA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p><p>RNA polymerase II is responsible for the transcription of lncRNA and usually some of these transcripts are precursors for small regulatory RNAs, but a large number of them have no distinguishable purpose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, understanding the biology of lncRNAs is still at an early stage and there are disagreements regarding their functionality and classification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Although it has been suggested that lncRNAs are merely products of inaccuracy in transcription machinery or transcriptional noise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, their involvement in several biological pathways has been demonstrated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Considering all possible scenarios, even if only 10% of identified lncRNAs have a biological role, more than a thousand human loci would generate functional lncRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>Recent findings have demonstrated that lncRNAs take part in genomic imprinting, cancer, cell differentiation, regulation of gene expression and development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Databases have also been developed that facilitate exploring interactions of ncRNAs, including lncRNAs, with proteins, RNAs and viruses, but mainly in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. While studies on insect lncRNAs are limited, they suggest that lncRNAs could be involved in various functions. For example, it has been shown that <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> lncRNAs, which are highly expressed in ovaries, are probably involved in the fine tuning of developmental processes underlying phenotypic plasticity related to social life histories in honey bees<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. It has also been reported that heterochromatin formation in insects is correlated with lncRNA expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Overexpression of lncRNA in certain developmental stages of <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> produced a variety of lncRNA associated small RNAs, such as repeat associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs), which appeared to correlate with subsequent accumulation of a heterochromatic histone mark<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Recently, it was shown that lncRNAs also coordinate sex determination in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>Previous work has indicated linRNAs&#x02019; quick response to different stimuli and stress factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Up-regulation of some lncRNAs by genotoxic agents such as mitomycin C or doxorubicin has been reported in a few mammalian cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Some lincRNAs act as suppressors of the p53 transcriptional response and they were induced by DNA damage caused by doxorubicin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Stress can also change the lincRNA expression profile in plants and in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, the expression level of a lincRNA (At5NC056820) increased by 22-fold when plants were treated with elf18 (EF-Tu), which triggers pathogen-associated molecular pattern responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The involvement of lncRNAs in pathways associated with responses to cellular stress makes them interesting candidates to investigate when organisms are exposed to insecticides and other toxicants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><p>lncRNAs demonstrate low evolutionary sequence conservation even among closely related species. However, significant improvement in RNAseq technologies and reproducibility-based bioinformatics strategies for genome-wide screening have uncovered thousands of lncRNA sequences in the genomes of both lower living organisms, such as yeasts, as well as higher eukaryotes. For instance, more than 14,000 lncRNA genes in human<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, 6480 in <italic>A. thaliana</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, 4000 in bovine muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and 1133 multi-exonic lncRNA transcripts from zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> have been reported in the last few years. Among these, only a few genes have been annotated as lncRNA in insects, which are mostly in model species such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>A. mellifera.</italic> It has been estimated that more than 5000 loci potentially encode non-coding transcripts in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, however, only seven loci (<italic>bxd, Hsr&#x003c9;, pgc, roX1, rox2, sphinx</italic> and <italic>yar</italic>) have been experimentally annotated as functional regulatory lncRNAs in the insect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. A recent study conducted by Padron <italic>et al.</italic> (2014) demonstrated that 43% of total midgut transcripts of <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> are lncRNAs and 32% of them showed some level of homology to other species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p><p>Diamondback moth (DBM), <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> L (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) is a notorious pest of cruciferous plants that has developed resistance to all groups of insecticides, including <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> endotoxins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. This has contributed towards <italic>P. xylostella</italic> becoming one of the world&#x02019;s most destructive insect pests and its estimated cost to global economy has been estimated to be US$ 4&#x02013;5 billion annually<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. This emphasizes the necessity for the continued development of innovative alternative control measures and resistance management strategies.</p><p>The current study provides a glimpse of the lincRNA profile of this important agricultural insect pest. This catalog, as the first list of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> lincRNAs, is a complement to the list of other ncRNAs that have already been discovered in this species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, and therefore will help to better annotate the genome of DBM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. There is an ever-growing number of reports, which illustrate the role that lncRNAs play in cellular defence mechanisms against a wide range of toxic agents. In this study, we hypothesized that insect lncRNAs may regulate detoxification genes and act as important mediators in the development of insecticide resistance in <italic>P. xylostella.</italic> To support our hypothesis, we produced the expression profile of putative lincRNAs in four insecticide-resistant populations and found that a number of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> lincRNAs were considerably altered in resistant populations. Speculation regarding the biological functions of this class of ncRNAs is increasing and these data will facilitate future studies to unravel the function of lincRNAs in insecticide resistance and other detoxification responses in eukaryotic cells.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>RNA-seq Data preparation</title><p>Previously sequenced RNA-seq raw data for <italic>P. xylostella</italic> were downloaded from NCBI Sequences Read Archive with accession number SRA034927 and SRP059463<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.

We implemented strict mapping criteria (mismatch, insertion and deletion costs: 2: 3: 3 respectively). The minimum similarity and length fraction of 0.9 between a mapped segment and the reference were allowed in mapping criteria. The large gap mapper algorithm also requires that each mapped segment must comprise at least 10% of the read and must be of minimum length 17&#x02009;bp. We considered a gap with maximum 50&#x02009;Kbp distance between mapped read segments to span the introns from RNA-seq data. The annotations are generated by examining the read mapping and identifying likely regions of genes, their exons and splice sites. The algorithm scanned each gap in the read mapping to see if the gap is assigned to a valid splice site or can be moved to a valid splice site without cost.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>lincRNA identification pipeline</title><p>A stringent filtering pipeline was developed to discard transcripts with evidence for protein coding potential.

The genes that were annotated as known <italic>P. xylostella</italic> genes were discarded and 35,425 potential genes were also checked for any exon or intron overlap with other known <italic>P. xylostella</italic> genes. We selected 14,663 sequences, which were located more than 1&#x02009;kb away from any other known transcripts, for finding putative open reading frames (ORF). All possible six frames were produced for all selected sequences and then the translated sequences were subjected to a domain search to identify any putative conserved protein domains through Pfam v27.0 database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. We discarded 4,746 sequences with potential ORF above 100aa or conserved protein domains. Any possible similarity with other known proteins was found by using BLASTx algorithm against nr and Swiss port database (E-value cut off 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) for 9,917 of sequences. We also implemented an expression threshold on our data to strengthen the identification pipeline. Sequences with more than 10 mappable reads in at least three out of eight RNA-seq libraries were considered as valid sequences and were kept for the next step. 4,522 sequences were subjected to Coding Potential Calculator (CPC) tool, which is publically available on http://cpc.cbi.pku.edu.cn to check for any other potential coding regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. CPC is a Support Vector Machine-based classifier, which is able to assess the protein-coding potential of a transcript based on six biologically meaningful sequence features. Sequences with the score of above &#x02212;1 were determined as putative protein coding genes and removed from the list. The data were also submitted to another coding potential assessment tool (CPAT), which uses a logistic regression model built with four sequence features: ORF size, ORF coverage, Fickett TESTCODE statistic and hexamer usage bias<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. We applied the coding probability threshold of 0.3, which led to discarding 27 sequences as putative coding RNAs.

Lack of conservation among identified lincRNAs is one of the challenges in their comparative sequence analysis and functional studies among non-model organisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>.</p><p>In a recent annotation of DBM genome in NCBI, 707 loci were predicted as lncRNAs with Gnomon, a NCBI eukaryotic gene prediction tool<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. In the current study, we recalled 250 of those sequences in the <italic>P. xylostella</italic> lincRNA repertoire with BLAST E-value cutoff of 10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup> and minimum bit score of 100, which share some conserved or repetitive regions. Nevertheless, only 78 newly predicted lincRNAs overlapped with the recently annotated <italic>P. xylostella</italic> lncRNAs and were located in the similar locus. Several <italic>P. xylostella</italic> lincRNAs also share repetitive sequences or previously identified microsatellite sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. It has been shown that many repetitive elements such as telomeric RNAs, satellite RNAs and even some retrotransposons are among lncRNAs. There is significant evidence of similar repetitive non-coding sequences in mammals, whose expressions are altered by external stimuli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. For example, transcripts of satellite RNA repeats within the chromatin could act as <italic>cis</italic> regulators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. lincRNAs also play a role in the regulation of the neighbouring genes and act as <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, however, they also have the ability to act in <italic>trans</italic> and regulate distantly located genes.</p><p>In general, lincRNAs are co-expressed with their neighbouring genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Typically they are transcribed from the chromosome that they are regulating<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. To functionally characterize <italic>P. xylostella</italic> lincRNAs, gene ontology (GO) enrichment of their associated protein-coding genes was extracted. The GO terms enrichment in molecular function category indicate that <italic>P. xylostella</italic> lincRNAs are likely to play an important role in binding associated activity because most of the overrepresented GO terms are linked to protein binding, zinc ion binding and even DNA and RNA binding functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Proteolysis and metabolic process were the most abundant GO terms among Biological Process. The GO term of &#x0201c;Regulation of transcription&#x0201d; was also overrepresented among the Biological Process category, which is a common and the most abundant term among other species of lncRNA GO analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>.</p><p>Our results suggest that a small number of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> lincRNAs are involved in the production of small RNAs or serve as primary miRNAs. Previous studies also reported that the majority of lincRNAs are processed by small RNA-independent machinery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. We identified 10&#x02009;miRNA precursors in our lincRNA profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The pre-miRNA sequences of recently annotated <italic>P. xylostella</italic> miRNAs miR-8497, miR-8517 and miR-8546<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> were identified in more than 20 potential lincRNAs, which shows that these miRNAs originate from repetitive elements in the genome.</p><p>The different proposed scenarios on the interaction of small RNAs, such as miRNAs, with lncRNAs, have been reviewed by Yoon <italic>et al.</italic> 2014<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Long non-coding RNAs can be regulated by some miRNAs. It has been revealed that miRNA let-7b contributed to lowering lincRNA-p21 stability in human cervical carcinoma cells and overexpression of this miRNA may facilitate degradation of the lincRNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. In a recent study, miR-CLIP technology identified lincRNA H19 as a target of miR-106a. Surprisingly, the miRNA overexpression through ectopic delivery of miR-106a into cells caused an approximately 6-fold increase in human lincRNA H19<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. In other cases, lncRNAs can act as miRNA decoys and also compete with them to bind to mRNAs. Those lncRNAs, which are involved in regulation of gene expression, may compete with miRNAs to control their target genes. As we have shown here, some miRNAs may originate from lncRNAs. It has been shown that human lincRNA MD1 generates miR-206 and miR-133b from an intron and an exon, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. To date, most studies have been done in human cells, and mainly on miRNA and lncRNA interactions. More studies are required to fully understand the complexity of interaction between small and long ncRNA and their link to various biological conditions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>DBM lincRNAs differentially expressed in insecticide resistance larvae</title><p>The RNA-seq data of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> insecticide-resistant populations were available on public databases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.

The expression profiles of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> lincRNAs in insecticide-resistant larvae to two classes of insecticides, Fipronil (FR, from the phenylpyrazole family) and Chlorpyrfos (CR, an organophosphate), showed noticeable alteration when compared with those of susceptible larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). We also reanalyzed the <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larval midgut transcriptome data in two resistant strains (MK and GK) to <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (Bt) endotoxin Cry1Ac to explore alterations in the expression profiles of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> lincRNAs in comparison with those of susceptible larvae (MM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Using strict criteria (Fold change above 4, <italic>P</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and presence of at least 10 reads in resistance or susceptible strains&#x02019; libraries), we found 358, 280, 169 and 191 lincRNA genes differentially expressed (DE) in CR, FR, GK and MK groups, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref>). The majority of DE lincRNAs were overexpressed (~70%) in insecticide-resistant populations; however, in Bt resistant strains almost 50% of DE lincRNAs were up-regulated. There were only three lincRNAs (lincRNAs 538, 3727 and 1382), which were noticeably altered in all the four resistant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>). We found that distinct sets of lincRNAs were commonly altered between the two insecticide and Bt endotoxin resistant strains, which suggests that this class of RNAs may act differently in cellular defense mechanisms against individual xenobiotic agents. In a previous study, it was shown that two genotoxic drugs, mitomycin C and doxorubicin, altered lncRNA expression profiles in HeLa cells but there were no commonly altered lncRNAs between these two genotoxic components due to their different mode of action<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p><p>There is a growing body of evidence indicating that ncRNAs play significant roles in toxicogenomics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>.

The majority of putative lincRNAs (lincRNA 93, 1046, 3128, 3380, 3727) showed significant overexpression in deltamethrin-resistant (Delta-R) larvae in comparison with the insecticide susceptible (Waite) larvae. All these up-regulated lincRNAs, except lincRNA 3128, showed considerable overexpression in other insecticide resistant populations based on transcriptome analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Files 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">3</xref>). The overexpression of lincRNA 3727 was not only observed in all insecticide-resistant populations (<italic>ie.</italic> those resistant to deltamethrin, fipronil and chlorpyrifos), but also considerable enhancement was detected in both populations resistant to Bt endotoxins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Deep sequencing data analysis showed that lincRNA 623 was dramatically down-regulated in resistant larvae and we also found significant suppression of the lincRNA in Delta-R larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p>Response to insecticide exposure was also detected in some lincRNAs. When the deltamethrin-resistant (Delta-R) population was examined the transcript levels of lincRNA 1046 drastically dropped in deltamethrin treated larvae in comparison with larvae that were not exposed to the insecticide. Also significant overexpression response to direct treatment was observed in lincRNA 2998 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). Although the roles of the identified lincRNAs remain unknown, these genes have the potential to be involved in insecticide resistance development or detoxification pathways. Insecticide exposure may produce heritable modifications in gene expression that occur without a change in the DNA sequence, which are defined as epigenetic effects. Several epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, can be caused by pesticides through lncRNA-mediated pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>.

In addition, we observed significant alteration in expression of lincRNAs in insecticide-treated <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae, which we speculate may have direct or indirect links to detoxification pathways or stress responses. The general knowledge of the biological functions of lincRNAs in insecticide resistance and detoxification pathways is still limited, but when taken together these results provide further evidence to support the hypothesis that lincRNAs may play a role in insecticide resistance development. We believe, it is important to analyze the lincRNA&#x02019;s responses in different species to a wider range of insecticides or other xenobiotics, which may help to explain some unknown role(s) of this class of ncRNAs in detoxification or other toxin related metabolisms.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Etebari, K. <italic>et al.</italic> Genome wide discovery of long intergenic non-coding RNAs in Diamondback moth (<italic>Plutella xylostella</italic>) and their expression in insecticide resistant strains. <italic>Sci.
