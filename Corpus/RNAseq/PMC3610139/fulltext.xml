Currently, large-scale <italic>D. ponderosae</italic> outbreaks have resulted in unprecedented economic losses and turned North American forests into major sources of carbon release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The olfactory sense drives bark beetle behaviors that are important for fitness, such as the localization of suitable hosts and mates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the search for suitable host material, bark beetles respond to volatiles that emanate from both host and non-host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, most individuals locate trees by means of an aggregation pheromone that is released by beetles that have already attacked the tree. This signal is responsible for coordinated mass-attacks, which often lead to the death of the host tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and large-scale forest destruction. Due to their ecological and economic impact, an extensive knowledge base on bark beetle chemical ecology and olfactory physiology has been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, information on the molecular aspects of odor detection has been lacking until now.</p><p>In insects, volatile molecules are detected by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that are housed within special structures (sensilla) predominantly on the antennae, and to a lesser extent on the maxillary palps. The cell membrane of OSNs contains receptor proteins that bind odor ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The binding of a ligand to a receptor protein is the key event in olfactory transduction, as it converts a chemical signal in the environment into an electrical signal that can be interpreted by the insect nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Receptors from three large and divergent multigene families are expressed in insect OSNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], namely the odorant receptors (OR), ionotropic receptors (IR), and gustatory receptors (GR), the latter group notably containing carbon dioxide-detecting receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, most GRs are expressed in gustatory receptor neurons in taste organs and are involved in contact chemoreception. These GRs typically detect different sugars, bitter compounds, and contact pheromones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Insect ORs are seven-transmembrane domain proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] with a reversed membrane topology (intracellular N-terminus) compared to vertebrate ORs, which are G-protein coupled receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Insect ORs and GRs are distantly related members of the same superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In general, ORs (and GRs) show little sequence homology to each other and they are unrelated to vertebrate ORs. The conventional exchangeable OR that determines ligand specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] forms heteromers of unknown stoichiometry with a conserved co-receptor, known as Orco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Orco is ubiquitously expressed in OSNs that express ORs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and necessary for olfactory responses and for localization of the conventional OR in the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Putative insect ORs have been identified mainly in species with sequenced genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Recently, however, studies on antennal transcriptomes have led to the identification of OR sets in several moth species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and one beetle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The ORs respond to a variety of volatile chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], including pheromones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and plant or microbe-derived compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Some ORs are highly defined in their response specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], whereas others appear more broadly tuned, especially at high stimulus concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>IRs were recently discovered as another class of receptors involved in chemoreception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. They are related to ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) that function in synapse communication, but have atypical binding domains. IRs have been identified throughout protostome lineages (including arthropods, mollusks, annelids and nematodes) and, thus, constitute a far more ancient group of receptors than the ORs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. IRs form complexes with up to three subunits, including odor-specific receptors and one or two broadly expressed co-receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In insects, the IRs are divided into two major groups: the &#x0201c;antennal IRs&#x0201d; that have an olfactory function and are conserved across insect orders, and the species-specific &#x0201c;divergent IRs&#x0201d;, some of which have been assigned a tentative role in taste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Antennal IRs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have different odor specificity compared to the ORs and respond to nitrogen-containing compounds (e.g. ammonia and amines), acids, and aromatics (i.e. phenylacetaldehyde) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the receptor genes, other multigene families encode proteins with critical roles in olfaction. Odorant binding proteins (OBP) are small soluble proteins (generally 135&#x02013;220 amino acids long) with two or three disulfide bridges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. OBPs are highly abundant in the sensillar lymph of insects and are thought to solubilize hydrophobic molecules and deliver them to the receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Studies have shown conflicting results whether or not OBPs affect the response specificity of OSNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. At least in some studies, the specificity of pheromone receptors was improved by the presence of OBPs (i.e. a class of OBPs called pheromone binding proteins, PBPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Some evidence suggests that OBPs might undergo odor-induced conformational changes, with a change in the OBP itself triggering the response of the OSN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In insects with sequenced genomes, the number of OBP coding genes normally ranges from ca. 40&#x02013;60 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Chemosensory proteins (CSP) constitute another class of small binding proteins (ca. 130 amino acids long). They are more conserved than OBPs and are characterized by the presence of 4 cysteines that form two disulfide bridges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. CSPs may have shared a common ancestor with the OBPs near the origin of the arthropods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Like OBPs, CSPs are present in high concentration in chemosensory sensilla (outer sensillum lymph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]). However, the majority of them are also expressed in various non-sensory tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and they seem to play a role in development, moulting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and leg regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Some CSPs bind pheromone compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], but their exact role in chemosensory systems remains uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Most <italic>Drosophila</italic> genomes contain only 4 CSP coding genes and <italic>T. castaneum</italic> has 20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The genome of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes contains 43 members of this family, the largest number found in insects so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]<italic>.</italic></p><p>Finally, the sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMP) are proteins of the CD36 family that associate with pheromone-responding OSNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Their functional significance is still poorly understood, but SNMP is crucial for proper pheromone detection in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and also required for activation of a pheromone receptor in <italic>Heliothis virescens</italic> moths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In contrast, SNMP was dispensable for responses of a fly receptor (DmelOR22a) to fruit-related esters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Insects generally have two representatives of SNMPs (SNMP1 and SNMP2), although copy numbers of each orthologue seem to vary somewhat across species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>In the largest insect order, Coleoptera, ORs have been identified from only two species: from the genome of the red flour beetle, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], and recently from the antennal transcriptome of the cerambycid beetle, <italic>Megacyllene caryae</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Members of the other olfactory gene families have been identified only in <italic>T. castaneum</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Consequently, additional beetle species need to be investigated to reach a better understanding on the molecular biology of coleopteran and insect olfaction.</p><p>In this study, we assembled and analyzed bark beetle antennal transcriptomes from next-generation sequencing.

From this transcriptome dataset originating from several tissue types, sequences originating only from a non-normalized antenna-specific cDNA library were re-assembled for the analyses presented in the present study. This included 12,142 paired-end Sanger reads, 1,147 single-end Sanger reads and 1,048,708 Roche 454 reads. Newbler (version 2.6, Roche) was used for assembly using the "-cdna" switch for transcriptome assemblies and a 45 bp cutoff to eliminate short reads. For identification of OBPs, CSPs, and SNMPs in <italic>D. ponderosae</italic> we also used a combination of Sanger-specific (CAP3 assembly) data and transcriptome assemblies from other tissues and life stages, since these proteins may have sensory or non-sensory functions in non-antennal tissues.

The numbers of OBPs identified in the bark beetles (15 in <italic>I. typographus</italic> and 31 in <italic>D. ponderosae</italic>) are clearly lower than the 49 OBP-encoding genes reported in the genome of <italic>T. castaneum</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]<italic>.</italic> The same is true for the CSPs, for which we identified 6 transcripts in <italic>I. typographus</italic> and 11 in <italic>D. ponderosae</italic> compared with 20 putative CSP encoding genes in the <italic>T. castaneum</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, it might be misleading to compare the number of genes identified in a genome with the number of transcripts in a specific tissue at a specific life stage.

Indeed, many of the identified OBPs and CSPs (ca. one third of the transcripts) in <italic>D. ponderosae</italic> were not identified from the antennal library, but seem to be expressed only in non-olfactory tissue.

In addition, it is likely that some bark beetle ORs have been missed in our transcriptome analysis (especially in <italic>Ips</italic> due to the lower sequencing depth), underestimating the true number of antennal-expressed bark beetle ORs.</p><p>Species (or taxon)-specific expansions of OR lineages are seen in most insects studied e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>], and some of the largest expansions have been found in Hymenoptera, particularly in the jewel wasp, <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]<italic>.</italic> The pattern of OR lineage expansion and conservation observed in the present study likely reflects the evolutionary and ecological relatedness among the four beetle species. The beetle taxa analysed here all belong to the more derived part of Coleoptera (Cucujiformia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. However, the Curculionidea (with <italic>Ips</italic> and <italic>Dendroctonus</italic>) and Tenebrionidea (with <italic>Tribolium</italic>) superfamilies are the two furthest separated clades within Cucujiformia, sharing a common ancestor ca. 230&#x02013;240 Mya. Thus, it may come as no surprise that the ORs of these two taxa largely fall into different subgroupings in the tree. On the other hand, the Curculionidea is a sister group to the Chrysomeloidea (including the longhorns) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>] and, likewise, the closer relatedness of these taxa seems to be reflected in the OR subgroupings. Within Scolytinae, the <italic>Ips</italic> and <italic>Dendroctonus</italic> genera are separated by ca. 80 Mya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. However, despite the fact that <italic>Culex</italic> and <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes are separated by only ca. 40 Mya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>], they show more distinct species-specific OR lineage expansions than the bark beetles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>], indicating that ecological adaptation and life cycle also play important roles in shaping the OR repertoire of a species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. On this note, the bark beetles and the cerambycid utilize similar types of host material, i.e. conifer trees and hardwood, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>], whereas <italic>T. castaneum</italic> has been associated with human populations and stored products, for at least a few thousand years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>].</p><p>However, not all ORs were grouped in taxon-specific expansions; some subfamilies contained ORs from all four species. This might indicate preservation of ancestral functional patterns within Coleoptera, but since non-coleopteran ORs were left out from the analysis we are careful to draw any conclusions based on this finding (i.e. the clades might contain receptors also from insects outside Coleoptera).</p><p>The close clustering of OR sequences from the two bark beetles raises the question about how similar the semiochemical environment is for <italic>I. typographus</italic> and <italic>D. ponderosae</italic>. They both live in conifers and would thus be expected to share several biologically relevant compounds. Due to their status as very serious forest pests, the plant- and beetle-produced compounds that they respond to are well studied in these two species. Mainly based on a set of review papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>], we compiled a table of all compounds that have been shown to be physiologically and/or behaviorally active in <italic>I. typographus</italic> and <italic>D. ponderosae</italic> (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). For 29 (54%) of the 54 listed compounds, there is evidence of shared bio-activity. Not surprisingly, the host compounds show a large overlap (61%), but there is also a large overlap (56%) among pheromone compounds of beetle origin. For the non-host volatiles, the overlap is lower (40%). One might speculate that the extent of this shared &#x0201c;chemosphere&#x0201d; of semiochemicals could account for the low degree of species-specific diversifications among the bark beetle ORs and the other proteins studied here. However, functional data is required to test this hypothesis.</p><p>We identified only a small number of putative GR<italic>-</italic>encoding transcripts (6 in <italic>I. typographus</italic>; 2 in <italic>D. ponderosae</italic>) from the antennal transcriptomes. The identified bark beetle GRs included transcripts for carbon dioxide receptors, suggesting that the antennae of bark beetles detect carbon dioxide. In addition, the presence of GR1-3 in <italic>I. typographus</italic> indicates that carbon dioxide is detected by a heterotrimer receptor, like in mosquitoes, <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, and <italic>T. castaneum</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>]. However, GR2 was not found in the analyzed transcriptome of <italic>D. ponderosae</italic>. Hence, it is possible that <italic>D. ponderosae</italic> uses a heterodimer receptor for carbon dioxide detection (like <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>], but it seems unlikely that expression of GR2 would have been lost in only one of the bark beetle species analyzed here.</p><p>All the conserved antennal IRs that previously were found in <italic>T. castaneum</italic> were also identified in <italic>D. ponderosae</italic>. However, some of them were missing in the <italic>I. typographus</italic> data. As IRs are associated with coeloconic sensilla that are relatively rare on the <italic>Ips</italic> antenna [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>], it is possible that the missing IR transcripts are expressed only in a few neurons. A lower expression level results in a higher probability that these transcripts were missed during the random sequencing of the <italic>Ips</italic> cDNA, which had a lesser depth than for <italic>D. ponderosae</italic>. Generally in insects, the antennal IR subfamily constitutes only a portion of the total number of IRs. The others belong to the divergent IRs, a subfamily that shows species-specific expansions that are particularly large in Diptera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, expression of divergent IRs was detected only in gustatory organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This is consistent with the scarcity of divergent IRs in the bark beetle antennal transcriptomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have carried out comprehensive analyses of the antennal transcriptomes of two major tree-killing bark beetle species. At an abstract level, the prevalence of transcript types with respect to associated GO terms was highly similar in the two beetles. In addition, we annotated members of six major gene families that encode proteins with crucial roles in chemoreception. Thus, these proteins have now been identified in three coleopteran species (four species considering the ORs). In combination with the previously published data, the gene sets identified here now allow for improved evolutionary analysis of coleopteran olfaction. We found clear expanded bark beetle-specific lineages mainly among the ORs, suggesting that in comparison to the other analyzed protein families ORs are more tightly linked to sensory specialization and adaptation to specific ecological niches and a shared space of semiochemicals.</p><p>The results from the present study will also be fundamental for future functional studies. Functional characterization is needed in order to connect the available physiological and ecological knowledge with the molecular information presented here. Identification and de-orphanization of receptor proteins in bark beetles is especially relevant, since they may represent new targets for integrated pest management strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MNA and EGW contributed equally to this work, by carrying out lab work (MNA) and assemblies (EGW) for <italic>I. typographus</italic>, as well as bioinformatic analysis, sequence alignment, sequence editing, and data analysis for ORs, GRs, and IRs of both species.
