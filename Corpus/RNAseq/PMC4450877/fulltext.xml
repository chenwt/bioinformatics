It is thought to drive tumorigenesis by repressing division, stemness, and/or developmental regulators. Cancers evade immune detection, and diverse immune regulators are perturbed in different tumors. It is unclear how such cell-specific effects are coordinated. Here, we show a profound and cancer-selective role for PRC2 in repressing multiple cytokine pathways. We find that PRC2 represses hundreds of IFN&#x003b3; stimulated genes (ISGs), cytokines and cytokine receptors. This target repertoire is significantly broadened in cancer vs non-cancer cells, and is distinct in different cancer types. PRC2 is therefore a higher order regulator of the immune program in cancer cells. Inhibiting PRC2 with either RNAi or EZH2 inhibitors activates cytokine/cytokine receptor promoters marked with bivalent H3K27me3/H3K4me3 chromatin, and augments responsiveness to diverse immune signals. PRC2 inhibition rescues immune gene induction even in the absence of SWI/SNF, a tumor suppressor defective in ~20% of human cancers. This novel PRC2 function in tumor cells could profoundly impact the mechanism of action and efficacy of EZH2 inhibitors in cancer treatment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by RB: 703079 Canadian Cancer Society (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.ca/research">http://www.cancer.ca/research</ext-link>), RB: MOP 74570 Canadian Institutes of Health Research (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html">http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html</ext-link>), RB: KF12-02 Krembil Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.krembilfoundation.ca/">http://www.krembilfoundation.ca/</ext-link>), JJ: R01GM103893 National Institutes of Health (US) NIH (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov/">http://www.nih.gov/</ext-link>).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="19"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are available from the GEO database, under the accession number GSE67766.

Notably, the type, location, and degree of immune infiltrate in a tumor (the &#x0201c;Immunoscore&#x0201d;) predict outcome better than a multitude of traditionally utilized tumor-centric pathology parameters, such as tumor grade [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The factors that control immune surveillance vary contextually and the details are complex, because agents that promote immune clearance in one situation promote immune suppression in another (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). An appealing notion is that tumors might utilize a common mechanism to manipulate expression of immune regulators, and that each tumor tailors this strategy to suit their individual environment. Disrupting such a higher level regulatory network could provide a general strategy to increase immune detection and clearance of many cancers. However, the mechanisms that control the myriad of immune genes that influence surveillance are not well understood.</p><p>Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is the epigenetic regulator that deposits repressive histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) marks on chromatin. Two of its major components include the catalytic subunit EZH2, and SUZ12, the scaffold protein required for complex stability [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. PRC2 is part of the Polycomb family of regulators that counter the positive transcriptional effects of Trithorax family members during development, such as the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. PRC2, which is often overexpressed in cancer, is thought to promote tumorigenesis through regulation of the cell cycle, DNA replication, survival, senescence and/or stemness [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Whether and to what extent PRC2 might influence the immune program in tumors is unclear.</p><p>Previously, we and others showed that BRG1, the ATPase engine that drives SWI/SNF, is required for responsiveness of IFN&#x003b3; stimulated genes (ISGs) [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. At the <italic>CIITA</italic> locus, we found that BRG1 coordinates the action of many distal enhancers. However, despite being essential at the endogenous locus and a large 190 kb reporter, BRG1 is dispensable for IFN&#x003b3; induction of short <italic>CIITA</italic> reporters, leading to the notion that it may temper the effects of a remote repressor. In recent work, parallel to the current study, we showed that PRC2 and H3K27me3 decorate the <italic>CIITA</italic> locus, both at the promoter and between remote enhancers [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Removing PRC2 alleviated the requirement for BRG1, and poised a remote -50 kb enhancer, exactly as seen with BRG1. We wondered if this antagonism between BRG1 and PRC2 might extend to other IFN&#x003b3; targets. IFN&#x003b3; plays a vital role in immune surveillance [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. 20% of human cancers lack functional SWI/SNF [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and this defect or up-regulation of PRC2 could provide a general mechanism for immune escape in cancer. Moreover, targeting of PRC2 to distinct loci could help sculpt the specific immune program required in different cancers.</p><p>Here, we show that PRC2 has a broad role in repressing ISGs, and unexpectedly that it also has a dramatic and cancer-selective role in regulating many other cytokine pathways. Inhibiting PRC2 with RNAi or small molecule EZH2 inhibitors reactivated ISG responsiveness, even in SWI/SNF-deficient cancer cells. Moreover, extensive RNAseq analysis revealed that disrupting PRC2 activates multiple cytokine and cytokine receptor pathways. This function was considerably expanded in cancer <italic>vs</italic>. non-cancer cells, and could be blocked through pharmaceutical means. PRC2 is thus a higher order regulator of immune pathways in cancer, targeting cytokines, their receptors, and downstream targets, and it tailors this program according to cancer type.

To compare targets genome-wide, BRG1-deficient SW-13 cells were transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing BRG1 (Ad-BRG1) or GFP (Ad-GFP), or transfected with siCtrl or siSUZ12, left untreated or IFN&#x003b3;-stimulated for 6 hrs, and microarrays used to assess mRNA levels. SUZ12 is a core subunit of PRC2 and its loss results in degradation of the enzymatic subunit, EZH2 [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We focused on genes at which AdBRG1 or siSUZ12 induced expression &#x02265; 2-fold (for an overall data summary, see pie charts in <xref rid="pone.0126466.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). A detailed discussion of the data and gene classes is provided in <xref rid="pone.0126466.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref> (see the first section of Supplementary Results); the latter provides extensive details on the degree to which BRG1 and PRC2 regulate basal and IFN&#x003b3; induced gene expression. Strikingly, BRG1 reconstitution or siSUZ12 treatment enhanced induction of 87% (95/109) of ISGs, but affected basal expression of only ~2% of all genes (<xref rid="pone.0126466.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Moreover, of the 2% of all genes whose basal expression was affected, 14% (48/342) were co-regulated by SWI/SNF and PRC2, whereas 34% (32/95) of ISGs were co-regulated. The effect of SWI/SNF and PRC2 on co-regulated genes was antagonistic. Real time PCR analysis of 52 ISGs confirmed the predominant BRG1-dependency in this gene class (Fig A in <xref rid="pone.0126466.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>), and siSUZ12 rescued responsiveness at 5/7 BRG1-dependent ISGs, while BRG1-independent ISGs or control genes were unaffected (Fig B, Panel B in <xref rid="pone.0126466.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). A second SUZ12 siRNA also rescued BRG1-dependent ISGs (Fig C in <xref rid="pone.0126466.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). PRC2 depletion marginally induced the BRG1-related protein BRM (Fig B, Panel A in <xref rid="pone.0126466.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). To assess whether this slight induction might explain induction of some ISGs we knocked down BRM.

Westerns revealed that SUZ12, EZH2 and/or H3K27me3 levels were typically elevated in cancer lines compared to non-cancer lines (Fig H in <xref rid="pone.0126466.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). BRG1/BRM levels varied between cancer and non-cancer lines with the lowest in A549, AsPC1, Panc.04.03 and 184A1 (Fig H in <xref rid="pone.0126466.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). EZH2 and SUZ12 levels correlated with each other but not with bulk H3K27me3, and PRC2 and BRG1 or BRM levels were uncorrelated (Fig H, Panel B in <xref rid="pone.0126466.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).

SUZ12-depletion reduced H3K27me3 in all cell types, and increased H3K27ac in some (HeLa, MDA-MB-231, PC3), but did not affect SWI/SNF subunits (Fig I in <xref rid="pone.0126466.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). Next RNA-seq assays were run to assess the effect of SUZ12 knockdown on basal or IFN&#x003b3;-induced gene expression (44 assays, 4 conditions x 11 lines), and the results were validated using principle component analysis and correlation analysis.

Among the two most abundant ISG categories (ZR-ISGs and ISGs <underline>n</underline>ot affected by SUZ12 (N-ISGs)), there were cell-specific differences in absolute numbers of ZR-ISGs (range 13&#x02013;152, mean 70, median 43), but siSUZ12 enhanced induction of between 13% and 77% (average 45%, median 43%) in 7/8 cell lines (<xref rid="pone.0126466.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). These values are conservative, as there were other more complex lower abundance gene classes where SUZ12 affected ISG expression (<xref rid="pone.0126466.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Most N-ISGs (68%) and ZR-ISGs (72%) were specific to each cell type (Fig O in <xref rid="pone.0126466.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>), indicating that, in addition to a core set, each line induces a distinct ISG cocktail.

Thus, PRC2 altered CCRI pathways significantly in 6/8 cancer cell lines, but 0/4 non-cancer contexts. PRC2 depletion up-regulated some CCRI genes in non-cancer derived cell lines, but fewer than in cancer cells, insufficient to achieve significance in GSEA, and the affected genes were distinct in cancer vs non-cancer lines from matching tissues (<xref rid="pone.0126466.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>).

Unlike mRNA induction, PRC2 inhibition alone did not enhance protein levels but when cells were exposed to one of the four immune signals, siSUZ12 or UNC1999 augmented cytokine protein induction (<xref rid="pone.0126466.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126466.g007" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>, Fig T in <xref rid="pone.0126466.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126466.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). These data are in line with the well-established, post-transcriptional regulation of cytokine production to prevent adverse immune reactions, such as chronic inflammation. For example, in addition to gene transcription (within the direct control of PRC2), cytokines are also tightly regulated at the level of mRNA stability and/or translation through motifs such as the AU-Rich Element (ARE), Constitutive Decay Element (CDE), Coding Region Determinant of Instability (CRD) and several others [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our results suggest that PRC2 regulates the transcriptional component, but not the post-transcriptional control, which requires an additional signal from the immune system. To expand this analysis we used a multiplex laser bead assay to assess the effect of UNC1999 on LPS or TNF&#x003b1; induced production of multiple cytokines in A549 lung cancer cells. Fourteen of the tested proteins were induced in at least one condition, and for 10/14 PRC2 inhibition significantly boosted basal, LPS-induced, and/or TNF&#x003b1;-induced cytokine production, while in 4 cases there was a trend towards augmented cytokine induction (<xref rid="pone.0126466.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). Together, our combined gene and protein analysis demonstrate that PRC2 inhibition is a potent strategy to augment both cytokine responsiveness (Figs <xref rid="pone.0126466.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0126466.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) and cytokine secretion (<xref rid="pone.0126466.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>, Fig T in <xref rid="pone.0126466.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>) in cancer cells.</p><fig id="pone.0126466.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0126466.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Pharmacological inhibition of PRC2 boosts multiple immune pathways.</title><p>A549 cells treated with UNC1999 (green) or DMSO (blue) were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of TNF&#x003b1;, IFN&#x003b3;, IL1&#x003b2; or LPS for 24 h and ELISA was performed for secreted IL6 <bold>(A)</bold>, IL8 <bold>(B)</bold> and CXCL10 <bold>(C)</bold>.

Our data now reveal a profound and cancer-selective role for PRC2 in repressing multiple immune pathways. These data have important implications both for our understanding of the role of PRC2 in tumorigenesis, and for the mechanism of action and potential efficacy of EZH2 inhibitors in treating human cancer.</p><p>IFN&#x003b3; is critical for immune surveillance [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and depleting PRC2 reactivated numerous ISGs. Moreover, PRC2 also repressed multiple cytokines and cytokine receptors. Thus, cancers co-opt PRC2 to alter both the cytokine cocktail to which they and cells in their environment are exposed, and to alter cytokine gene targets. An EZH2 inhibitor rescued ISG expression and augmented cytokine secretion in response to several immune signals. While IFN&#x003b3; blocks tumorigenesis in multiple scenarios, many other cytokines have context dependent positive and/or negative effects on cancer (<xref rid="pone.0126466.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>)[<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Indeed, cytokines regulate many processes that affect tumorigenesis, such as immunity, proliferation, survival, senescence, invasiveness, angiogenesis, and drug resistance [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. There is excitement over the potential of EZH2 inhibitors to treat cancer, and their ability to augment protective cytokine pathways (e.g. IFN&#x003b3;) could boost efficacy. Equally, however, the release of some cytokines could be detrimental. Thus the result of the putative &#x0201c;immune bomb&#x0201d; detonated upon PRC2 inhibition is difficult to predict. Moreover, in view of the distinct immune genes targeted by PRC2 in different cancer types, the effects are likely to be highly cancer-specific. Our results should stimulate studies in syngeneic models to deduce the context-specific effects of PRC2 inhibition on different cancers, in the presence or absence of an immune system. It will also be critical to track immune parameters in clinical trials on EZH2 inhibitors, as the effect of these drugs on cytokine production and immune cell infiltration could have dramatic effects on outcome.</p><p>A few reports have linked PRC2 to individual immune genes [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and it regulates the differentiation of normal immune cells [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], but the alteration and augmentation of this function to a considerable extent in cancer cells is unexpected. Previous work assessed the basal effects of PRC2 inhibition, which would miss the prominent effect on gene induction by immune signals such as IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1;, IL1&#x003b2;, or LPS reported here. Moreover, many prior studies on PRC2 targets focused on non-cancer cells (especially embryonic stem cells), and as our results show, the prominent effect on immune genes is cancer-selective. Studies on PRC2 in cancer cells have generally focused on recruitment rather than effects on transcription, and as we note here, only a subset of PRC2/H3K27me3 marked targets are alleviated upon PRC2 inhibition. Immune and other gene targets that had the bivalent H3K27me3/H3K4me3 mark were induced upon PRC2 depletion, which is consistent with other analyses [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. A recent study linked a non-enzymatic effect of EZH2 to regulation of the innate response to virus infection [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, we observe a direct link with H3K27me3 and a potent effect of pharmaceutical inhibitors, indicating that methyl transferase activity is critical for PRC2 regulation of cytokine pathways in cancer cells.</p><p>Our results here and in a complementary study [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] suggest that PRC2 directly represses many ISGs and CCRI genes. While we did not examine PRC2 subunit recruitment in this paper, we provide extensive data showing that the genes rescued by PRC2 depletion are marked with H3K27me3. This work included ChIP-qPCR analysis of 25 ISGs (Fig E in <xref rid="pone.0126466.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>), genome wide ChIP-chip (<xref rid="pone.0126466.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, Figs F and G in <xref rid="pone.0126466.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>), and analysis of ENCODE Chip-seq data (<xref rid="pone.0126466.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). In each of these analyses, genes affected by PRC2 exhibited H3K27me3, whereas most genes that were unaffected lacked this mark. Since PRC2 is the only enzyme that deposits this mark, it is logical to conclude that these loci are direct PRC2 targets. Moreover, in parallel work we find that SUZ12 and EZH2 bind multiple locations across the <italic>CIITA</italic> locus in a pattern almost indistinguishable from that of H3K27me3 [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Altogether, these extensive data provide a strong case for the notion that PRC2 directly targets ISG and cytokine pathway genes. Not every gene that is marked with H3K27me3 is induced upon PRC2 depletion. Repression of these genes in the absence of PRC2 may be mediated by redundant repressive complexes such as PRC1 [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and/or the absence of active chromatin marks. Indeed, our analysis of Chip-seq data revealed that CCRI genes that respond to PRC2 depletion are marked not only with H3K27me3, but also with H3K4me3 (<xref rid="pone.0126466.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Thus, &#x0201c;bivalent&#x0201d; promoters are responsive to PRC2 inhibition, which is consistent with literature indicating that active chromatin marks are required for gene activation when repressive chromatin marks are removed [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Our work reveals an intriguing cancer-selective role for PRC2 at cytokine pathway genes, thus raising the issue as to how this functional shift is achieved. While the level of PRC2 subunits was elevated in some cancer cell lines this was variable (Fig H in <xref rid="pone.0126466.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>), and we thus favor the hypothesis that it is the mechanism of PRC2 recruitment that is altered in cancer cells to down-regulate ISGs and CCRI genes. Many factors can influence PRC2 recruitment [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] such as Jarid2 [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], ATRX [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]), PHF1/PCL1 [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], KDM2B plus PCGF1/PRC1 [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and long non-coding RNAs [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Elucidating whether these and/or other mechanisms influence PRC2 recruitment to cytokine pathway loci is beyond the scope of the current work, but will be an important topic for future research. SUZ12-depletion induced some CCRI genes in non-cancer lines (<xref rid="pone.0126466.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Recent work in a non-human cell line also suggested a potential role for PRC2 in immune modulation in the gut [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. It will be important to discover how this normal role is expanded and altered in cancer as it may reveal strategies to modulate this activity in a tumor-specific manner.</p><p>Blocking PRC2 rescued IFN&#x003b3; induction even in the absence of BRG1, normally essential for ISG activation [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Indeed, whereas only 2% of all genes were affected by BRG1 or PRC2, almost 90% of ISGs were BRG1-dependent and/or PRC2-repressed, and H3K27me3 was prominent at ISGs genome-wide. This result exposes a new immune role for the antagonistic Trithorax (e.g. SWI/SNF) and Polycomb (e.g. PRC2) regulators. SWI/SNF defects and/or PRC2-induction are common in human cancer [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], thus our results raise the hypothesis that multiple cancer types could modify immune signaling and possibly immune surveillance through such perturbations.</p><p>While the current work exposes a genome wide role for SWI/SNF and PRC2 in affecting ISG responsiveness, it does not reveal the underlying mechanism of their antagonism. However, in parallel work, we have obtained insight into this issue by focusing on the <italic>CIITA</italic> locus [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Like many other ISGs, either BRG1 reconstitution or PRC2 depletion in BRG1-deficient cells facilitates IFN&#x003b3; responsiveness at this locus and both factors are recruited to the locus. BRG1 is targeted to a remote upstream enhancer, while PRC2 and H3K27me3 exhibit an undulating pattern across the locus, peaking at promoter and inter-enhancer locations. Notably, reconstituting cells with BRG1 did not reduce SUZ12 or EZH2 binding across the locus, suggesting that BRG1 does not compete with PRC2 for chromatin binding, a mechanism proposed before to explain SWI/SNF-PcG antagonism [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The most obvious effect of reintroducing BRG1 was the addition of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac marks at the remote -50 kb enhancer where BRG1 is recruited, which are well known to poise enhancers. Strikingly, depleting PRC2 caused induction of the same marks, arguing that SWI/SNF and PRC2 do not directly antagonize each other, but rather antagonize the recruitment and/or action of histone acetyl and methyl transferases required to poise the locus for IFN&#x003b3; responsiveness. It seems likely that this mechanism may operate at other ISGs, and additional genome wide analyses will be required to test this notion.</p><p>PRC2-depletion augmented specific cocktails of ISG and CCRI genes in distinct cancers. This observation suggests how a single factor could sculpt differential immune responses in each tumor. To escape elimination by the immune system, tumors first enter a period of equilibrium followed by escape [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. PRC2 could regulate both stages, thus EZH2 inhibitors should be assessed in cancer prevention as well as therapy of advanced tumors. Some tumors have inactivating PRC2 mutations [<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126466.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and must utilize a PRC2-independent mechanism to modify the immune response. Conceivably, these inactivating mutations could result in up-regulation of cytokines that promote tumorigenesis. We studied cell lines from solid tumors, all with intact functional PRC2, and inhibiting the repressor boosted ISG-induction in 7/8 lines, and CCRI gene induction in 6/8 lines. Of the two cancer lines where CCRI gene-set induction did not reach significance, one of the lines (SW-13) lacks SWI/SNF activity, providing an alternative means to quench immune pathways and possible anticancer immunity. Notably, PRC2 repressed multiple ISGs in both these lines. In summary, SWI/SNF and PRC2 regulate a broad range of cytokine pathway genes in human cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126466.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supplementary Figures A-T.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126466.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126466.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Type and frequency of gene classes identified through RNAseq analysis.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126466.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126466.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Summary of how various PRC2-repressed cytokine and cytokine receptor gene targets were validated at the RNA and/or protein level.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126466.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126466.s004"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Antibodies.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126466.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126466.s005"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Primers.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126466.s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126466.s006"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Supplementary Text</title><p>Includes Supplementary Results (more details on the microarray and RT-PCR data in <xref rid="pone.0126466.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> and Supp Figs A-D, as well as a detailed description of RNAseq data validation), and Supplementary Methods.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126466.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Y.
