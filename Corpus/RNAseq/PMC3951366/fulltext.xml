While a consensus has yet to be reached on their global importance, an increasing number of examples have been shown to be functional, regulating gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Here, we use RNA sequencing data from the ABI SOLiD platform to identify lncRNA and NATs obtained from samples of the filamentous fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> grown under different light and temperature conditions. We identify 939 novel lncRNAs, of which 477 are antisense to annotated genes. Across the whole dataset, the extent of overlap between sense and antisense transcripts is large: 371 sense/antisense transcripts are complementary over 500 nts or more and 236 overlap by more than 1000 nts. Most prevalent are 3&#x02032; end overlaps between convergently transcribed sense/antisense pairs, but examples of divergently transcribed pairs and nested transcripts are also present. We confirm the expression of a subset of sense/antisense transcript pairs by qPCR. We examine the size, types of overlap and expression levels under the different environmental stimuli of light and temperature, and identify 11 lncRNAs that are up-regulated in response to light. We also find differences in transcript length and the position of introns between protein-coding transcripts that have antisense expression and transcripts with no antisense expression. These results demonstrate the ability of <italic>N. crassa</italic> lncRNAs and NATs to be regulated by different environmental stimuli and provide the scope for further investigation into the function of NATs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of The Leverhulme Trust (RPG-091, to SKC and SG-J) and a BBSRC project grant awarded to CH (BB/F012055/1).

For example, the ENCODE project has annotated transcription originating from around three quarters of the human genome <xref rid="pone.0091353-Birney1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091353-Bernstein1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091353-Djebali1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Similarly, the majority of the mouse genome has also been shown to be transcribed <xref rid="pone.0091353-Carninci1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Novel transcribed regions may represent extensions of known protein-coding genes, novel protein-coding transcripts, and transcripts that do not appear to have protein-coding capacity <xref rid="pone.0091353-vanBakel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. An ever-increasing number of classes of non-protein-coding RNAs have been discovered and annotated, from the well-known housekeeping small RNAs (including ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA), and regulatory small RNAs (such as small interfering RNA, microRNAs, and piwi-associated RNAs), to long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs, or lincRNAs; reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0091353-Ponting1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0091353-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>). In particular, high-throughput technologies have highlighted thousands of lncRNAs in a range of eukaryotic organisms, from yeast to humans <xref rid="pone.0091353-Okazaki1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091353-Ravasi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091353-Guttman1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091353-McKinlay1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. A handful of examples have been well-characterised and shown to have roles in the transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of gene expression via RNA-protein, RNA-DNA and RNA-RNA interactions. For instance, lncRNAs have been shown to be involved in chromatin modification, cell fate determination, and &#x000d7; chromosome inactivation (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0091353-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091353-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>). However, the function of the vast majority of lncRNAs remains a mystery.</p><p>A subset of long non-coding RNAs is a class of so-called Natural Antisense Transcripts (NATs), containing transcripts with sequence complementarity to other RNAs. NATs can be divided into <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>-NATs. <italic>Cis</italic>-NATs arise from the same genomic region as their complementary sense transcript, whereas <italic>trans</italic>-NATs are complementary to transcripts from remote loci. Specific antisense transcripts have been shown to regulate the expression of their sense transcripts via a range of mechanisms including: inhibition of transcription due to steric clashes of the transcriptional machinery; repression of expression due to competition for transcription factors; silencing the expression of the sense protein by RNAi; disruption of post-transcriptional modification and translation of the sense transcript by forming RNA/RNA duplexes; and masking of specific signals on the sense RNA necessary for splicing, stability or degradation (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0091353-Munroe1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091353-Faghihi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0091353-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>). In eukaryotes, antisense transcripts have been found to be prevalent in the human genome <xref rid="pone.0091353-Engstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, other mammalian genomes <xref rid="pone.0091353-Katayama1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, plant <xref rid="pone.0091353-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and fungal genomes (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0091353-Donaldson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>).</p><p>Fungi provide a simple eukaryotic model in which to understand important and widespread mechanisms of gene regulation. The few genome-wide searches for antisense transcription in fungi have indicated that <italic>cis</italic>-NATs are expressed from the opposite genomic strand of 15-50% of protein-coding loci. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, antisense transcripts associated with more than a thousand genes are expressed <xref rid="pone.0091353-David1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091353-Yassour1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and evolutionarily conserved <xref rid="pone.0091353-Yassour1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091353-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091353-Rhind1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Genes with antisense expression overlapping the sense transcript at the 3&#x02032; UTR were more likely to involved in regulatory functions <xref rid="pone.0091353-David1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, whilst genes that had antisense transcripts spanning more than 75% of their length were found to be enriched for genes induced during stress, growth, meiosis and sporulation <xref rid="pone.0091353-Yassour1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, 2409 protein-coding genes were found to have <italic>cis</italic>-NAT expression. Again, genes involved in meiosis were more likely to be associated with <italic>cis</italic>-NAT transcription <xref rid="pone.0091353-Ni1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The association of NATs with loci in certain ontology categories and their differential expression during development and in response to external stimuli suggests a regulatory role. In the pathogen <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>, differentially regulated NATs are found antisense to genes involved in temperature-sensitive morphogenesis and aflatoxin biosynthesis <xref rid="pone.0091353-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Of the filamentous fungi, resources for investigating gene function are most advanced in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>.

This pipeline predicts 29,605 transcribed regions (termed transfrags here). 69.8% (6922 of 9907) of transcripts annotated in the BROAD <italic>N. crassa</italic> database are represented by transfrags with 50 or more mapped reads. In addition, we identify 3,765 transfrags that are represented by more than 50 reads in one of the combined datasets (WT or <italic>quad<sup>&#x025b5;</sup></italic>) and that do not overlap an annotated gene. However, 2,652 of these transfrags are located within 500 nts of the ends of annotated protein-coding genes on the same genomic strand, and may therefore represent unannotated terminal exons. Since 92% of annotated protein-coding genes are separated by more than 500 nts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091353.s001">Figure S1</xref>) the 2,652 transfrags lying within 500 nts of an annotated gene were discarded from subsequent analyses.

We first tested CPC on the dataset of all annotated protein-coding transcripts in the BROAD database <xref rid="pone.0091353-Neurospora1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. CPC predicted over 96% (9,559 of 9,907) of the annotated genes to have protein-coding potential. Of the 348 annotated genes predicted to have no coding potential, only 10 are annotated as proteins of known function, 7 of which have an ORF of less than 100 amino acids. In contrast, CPC reported only 78 of our putative non-coding transcripts as having protein-coding potential (7%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091353.s004">Table S2</xref>). The transcripts that were predicted to have coding potential were discarded. We further discarded 96 putative non-coding transcripts that have high-scoring matches to models of annotated non-coding RNA families from the Rfam database &#x02013; the majority of these sequences are predicted tRNAs and snoRNAs. This left 939 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091353.s004">Table S2</xref>). A size distribution of our lncRNA set is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091353-g001">Figure 1A</xref>. In common with most other lncRNA sets, the sequences of our lncRNAs are not well-conserved in other fungal genomes. We find that only 9 of the 462 lncRNAs that are not antisense to annotated protein-coding transcripts display extended regions of sequence similarity in Sordariomycetes genomes outside of the <italic>Neurospora</italic> clade, of which only 2 are conserved in other Pezizomycotina, and none in more distant Ascomycetes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Methods</xref>).

From the collection of annotated sense/antisense pairs, 324 pairs (76%) have evidence for expression of both sense and antisense transcripts (&#x0003e;50 reads) in our combined RNAseq datasets, and a further 92 transcripts have evidence for either the sense or antisense transcript. Almost all of the annotated sense/antisense transcript pairs (419; 98%) are convergently transcribed, with overlap of the 3&#x02032; ends of the transcripts, 9 pairs represent divergent genes with 5&#x02032; overlaps, and there is only one example of overlapping sense/antisense ORFs.</p><p>In our dataset, 513 annotated protein-coding transcripts, representing over 5% of all annotated genes, display evidence of antisense lncRNA transcription (&#x0003e;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50 antisense reads). Eleven of these protein-coding transcripts have two antisense lncRNAs separated by more than 200 nts.

Hence, we combined the two fragmentary lncRNAs that are antisense to <italic>frq</italic> to form one single transcript. Conversely, there are 36 cases where a single lncRNA is antisense to multiple annotated transcripts, including 8 lncRNAs antisense to multiple isoforms of the same gene. In total, we annotate 477 lncRNAs antisense to 513 known genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091353.s006">Table S4</xref>).

To eliminate the possibility that the antisense lncRNAs could be annotated based on reads that are mapped to the incorrect genomic strand (for example, due to PCR errors in the library preparation), we examined the mapped reads for splice junctions. 315 of our antisense lncRNAs (66%) have consensus splice junctions (GT-AG, GC-AG and AT-AC) supported by reads spanning the intron. We identified 5 occurrences of the nonconsensus splice junction CT-AC, which could represent incorrectly orientated reads. However, the same predicted lncRNA transcript also contained other consensus splice sites supported by read data, indicating the correct orientation of the antisense transcript. The remaining 162 antisense transcripts have no evidence of introns.</p><fig id="pone-0091353-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0091353.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Genomic distribution of annotated and lncRNA transcripts.</title><p>Annotated genes from the BROAD database are depicted in blue and those that are expressed above a threshold of &#x0003e;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50 reads in our combined datasets are depicted in black.

There are 43 cases of antisense lncRNAs nested within the bounds of the sense protein-coding gene, and 149 annotated sense genes nested within antisense lncRNAs. Almost 97% of our antisense lncRNAs (461) overlap the ORF of the annotated protein-coding transcripts. We also identify 38 pairs of sense/antisense lncRNAs originating from previously unannotated loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091353.s008">Table S6</xref>). 36 of these pairs overlap by more than 200 nts, and we again observe an excess of convergently transcribed sense/antisense pairs (14 of these pairs overlap at the 3&#x02032; end, and 9 at the 5&#x02032; end).</p><p>We next assessed whether the transcripts with antisense expression (coding or non-coding) exhibit any particular characteristics. The lengths of transcripts with associated antisense RNAs are present at a greater proportion in the 1&#x02013;2 kb size range, however there was no significant difference between the distributions of lengths between transcripts with and without antisense RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091353-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

In our dataset, 355 lncRNAs, including 233 antisense lncRNAs, are located upstream (within 1 kb) of annotated genes on the opposite strand. Without detailed experimental characterisation of a promoter region, it is difficult to determine whether or not a bidirectional promoter is responsible for the expression of divergently transcribed transcripts. However, we find 2 examples, NCU07267/NCU07268_AS and NCU01107/NCU01106_AS, where the divergently transcribed gene and lncRNA are both significantly up-regulated in response to light (see below).</p><p>It has previously been suggested that the terminators of protein-coding genes could act as promoters for antisense transcripts <xref rid="pone.0091353-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Using the same criteria as Murray <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0091353-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, we find that 42% of antisense long non-coding transcripts have their start sites between 100 nts upstream and 600 nts downstream of the stop codon of protein-coding ORFs, and therefore may arise from terminator regions of sense genes. In order to avoid confusing potential terminator-derived antisense transcripts with transcripts arising from nearby bidirectional promoters, this analysis ignored all pairs of protein-coding genes that lie closer than 500 nts on the same strand.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Differential expression of transcripts following light and temperature pulses</title><p>Our datasets further allowed us to identify lncRNAs under the direct or indirect control of light- or temperature.

Both NCU04182 (splicing factor 3 b subunit 4) and NCU07268 (a hypothetical protein with a PAS domain) are associated with convergently-transcribed antisense transcripts. The antisense transcript partially complementary to NCU07268 is significantly up-regulated on exposure to light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091353-g004">Figure 4</xref>; RNASeq, <italic>p</italic><sub>adj</sub> 6.54&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>; qPCR, <italic>p</italic>-value 0.0084).

In addition, we confirm the expression of an antisense transcript within which NCU07915 (integral membrane protein) is nested. The antisense transcript overlaps all the introns of the sense transcript and interestingly reads antisense to the third intron of the sense transcript are most abundant. We note that exons 3 and 4 of NCU07915 encode the Mpv17/PMP22 family domain, which is predicted to have pore-forming activity. We also confirmed expression of a known snoRNA that is complementary to the 3&#x02032; end of NCU09135 (predicted to code for phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C) and the 5&#x02032; end of NCU09136 (predicted to code for a hypothetical protein), and a second antisense lncRNA that is nested within NCU09136 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091353-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0091353-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0091353.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Examples of sense/antisense transcript pairs annotated from RNA sequencing data and validated by qPCR.</title><p>Panels display the locations and distribution of RNAseq reads of sense protein-coding (black) and antisense lncRNA (pink) transcripts.

Genome-wide studies have shown that a large portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed while only a small fraction codes for proteins <xref rid="pone.0091353-Birney1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091353-Carninci1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. van Bakel <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="pone.0091353-vanBakel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> argue that most transcription outside of protein-coding regions is accounted for by the presence of reads in introns and on either side of annotated genes that could be a result of alternative promoter usage, alternative exons, and unannotated terminal exons and UTRs. In order to minimise the possibility that our lncRNAs are unannotated extensions of known genes, we focused on transcribed fragments that are distant from annotated genes on the same genomic strand. In total, we report 939 lncRNAs, of which 477 are antisense to annotated genes. Across the whole dataset, the extent of complementary overlap between the protein-coding sense and antisense lncRNAs is large &#x02013; 371 sense/antisense pairs overlap by more than 500 nts and 236 overlap by more than 1 kb.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Functions of antisense lncRNAs</title><p>The possible modes of action of antisense transcripts are many and varied, and include inhibiting synthesis of their sense transcript, regulating splicing, and controlling the levels of sense RNA via RNAi pathways. It seems likely that features of antisense transcripts, such as the extent and nature of the overlap between sense and antisense transcripts and their expression, may indicate their function. Osato <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0091353-Osato1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> have shown in human and mouse that the expression level of transcripts decreases as the region of overlap between the sense and antisense pairs increases. This is consistent with reports that steric clashes of the transcriptional machinery lead to lower expression levels of the transcripts <xref rid="pone.0091353-Hobson1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Here we identify 100 antisense transcripts expressed in our datasets with no accompanying expression of their sense transcripts. This is most often the case when the sense transcript is nested within the antisense, and less common in sense/antisense pairs with 3&#x02032; end overlap. This may be due to the absence of specific transcriptional activators of sense transcripts under our growth conditions and/or stronger antisense promoters resulting in steric clashes of the transcription machinery and abortion of all transcription from the sense promoter. Annotated transcripts with dominant antisense expression are enriched for functional categories such as extracellular metabolism, extracellular/secretion proteins, disease and virulence factors.</p><p>We find that convergently transcribed sense/antisense pairs overlapping at their 3&#x02032; ends predominate, as previously observed in other organisms (see for example <xref rid="pone.0091353-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>). Almost all previously annotated <italic>N. crassa</italic> sense/antisense transcript pairs (97% of those in the BROAD database) also overlap each other at their 3&#x02032; ends. A number of signals required for post-transcriptional modifications are located in 3&#x02032; UTRs and we might therefore expect that antisense transcripts play roles in regulating modification of their sense counterpart <xref rid="pone.0091353-Munroe1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. On average across all <italic>Neurospora</italic> genes, the locations of introns are skewed towards the 5&#x02032; end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091353-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, our data show that there is an additional significant decrease in the number of introns at the 3&#x02032; end for transcripts that have antisense expression. Since most of the sense/antisense pairs overlap at their 3&#x02032; ends, interference from antisense transcripts is minimized for splicing of introns at the 5&#x02032; end. Antisense transcripts that overlap the introns of protein coding genes, and particularly splicing enhancer signals, have been found to influence alternative splicing of the sense transcript <xref rid="pone.0091353-Jen1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091353-Salato1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. However, in the light and temperature conditions analysed here we found no evidence of alternative splicing occurring in transcripts with antisense expression.</p><p>Some of the NATs that we report here may be required for the production of regulatory siRNAs. Small RNA species, including siRNA, QDE-2-interacting RNA (qiRNA), microRNA-like RNAs (milRNA) and dicer-independent siRNAs, have previously been identified in <italic>N. crassa</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0091353-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. To examine whether our sense/antisense transcripts might form duplexes recognised by DICER-like proteins, we compared the expression of several of our sense/antisense pairs in a <italic>ddicer</italic> mutant strain. Sense and/or antisense transcripts arising from each of the six loci tested were up-regulated in at least one condition of darkness, light or temperature pulse in the <italic>ddicer</italic> strain. However, the sense and antisense transcripts of NCU09135 in temperature-treated samples and NCU09136 in light-pulsed samples were both significantly up-regulated, as might be predicted if they are DICER substrates. It is worth noting that the expression levels of transcripts between experiments in both the <italic>ddicer</italic> and <italic>nmd</italic> strains are relatively large, most likely as a result of the disruption of the associated regulatory pathways, and that we cannot currently distinguish whether the effects of gene deletion on transcript expression are direct or indirect. Recently, small RNAs of 25 nts that do not require DICER for their biogenesis, <italic>dicer</italic>-independent small interfering RNAs (disiRNAs,), have been found associated with regions of convergent transcription and linked to dynamic DNA methylation especially prevalent around promoters of the <italic>disi</italic>-loci <xref rid="pone.0091353-Dang1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Comparison of small RNA RNAseq data obtained from wild-type and <italic>ddicer</italic> strains should throw light on the presence or absence of disiRNAs mapping to the location of sense/antisense transcript pairs.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Bidirectional promoters and transcriptional terminators as promoters</title><p>Recently, two novel classes of non-coding RNA transcript were annotated in yeast: CUTs (cryptic unstable transcripts) and SUTs (stable unannotated transcripts). CUTs are short (&#x0003c;800 nts) and have a very short half-life in the cell, suggesting that their role is achieved via transcription itself <xref rid="pone.0091353-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, for example, by recruiting histone-modifying enzymes or via transcriptional interference <xref rid="pone.0091353-Prescott1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. SUTs, on the other hand are longer, have a longer half-life, and arise from nucleosome-free regions at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of actively transcribed genes. Both CUTs and SUTs are found close to the ends of genes suggesting transcription from bidirectional promoters or terminators acting as promoters. The Protein Initiation Complexes (PICs) and Nucleosome Depleted Regions (NDRs), features essential for transcription and found at the 5&#x02032; end of protein-coding genes, have also been found to be highly represented at the 3&#x02032; end of genes that showed antisense expression <xref rid="pone.0091353-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In our dataset, 42% of antisense lncRNAs have start sites between 100 nts upstream and 600 nts downstream of the end of sense transcripts ORFs, and may therefore arise from terminators that also act as promoters. The short half-life of CUTs is attributed to their recognition and degradation by the NMD pathway <xref rid="pone.0091353-Neil1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Although the novel transcripts we report more closely resemble SUTs, three of the antisense lncRNAs in our datasets showed an increased expression in the <italic>NCU04242</italic><sup>&#x00394;</sup> strain, suggesting that they could be potential substrates for the NMD pathway.</p><p>While the majority of lncRNAs in <italic>N. crassa</italic> appear to be transcribed independently of neighbouring genes, we identify examples of potential bidirectional promoters. Seila <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the transcripts formed from bidirectional promoters in mouse are shorter and are less abundant than the sense RNA <xref rid="pone.0091353-Seila1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In contrast, we find that, of the 355 lncRNAs that have their start sites &#x0003c;1 kb upstream of annotated genes on the opposite strand, 95% of these transcripts were &#x0003e;500 bp in length and there was no evidence that they are less abundant than their sense counterparts on average. Indeed, the transcribed lncRNA is significantly more abundant than the sense transcript in approximately a quarter of the bidirectional pairs. A handful of divergent transcript pairs show a modest positive correlation in their expression in response to light, consistent with their origin from bidirectional promoters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Several studies have highlighted the expression of NATs in fungal genomes (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0091353-Donaldson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>).

The expression profiles of the lncRNAs and antisense transcripts indicate that a variety of mechanisms regulate their expression. However, few examples of antisense transcription have been functionally characterised in any organism.

The 50 nt reads were filtered for quality <xref rid="pone.0091353-Sasson1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> using the following thresholds: minimum count for polyclonal analysis (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3), minimum QV for polyclonal analysis (p_QV&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22), maximum errors permitted (e&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10), maximum QV to consider an error (e_QV&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9). The resulting reads were then mapped to the <italic>N. crassa</italic> OR74A (NC10) genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/neurospora">http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/neurospora</ext-link>) <xref rid="pone.0091353-Neurospora1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> using the splice-aware Tophat tool (version 1.4.1) <xref rid="pone.0091353-Trapnell1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The mappings were visualised using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) <xref rid="pone.0091353-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Raw sequencing datasets are deposited in the Sequence Read Archive, with accession number SRP035869.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Annotation of novel transcripts</title><p>To annotate novel transcribed regions, all 12 sequencing datasets were merged, and reads that overlap on the same genomic strand were clustered together. Novel transcripts could be made up of several such clusters that do not overlap due to low expression levels, low read coverage <xref rid="pone.0091353-Yassour1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, or the presence of introns. Analysis of intron size in <italic>N. crassa</italic> revealed a median intron length of 76 nts and 88% of annotated introns are less than 200 nts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091353.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, non-overlapping read clusters closer than 200 nts were further joined together to form larger transcribed fragments (transfrags). Transfrags containing &#x0003e;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;50 reads summed across all WT or quad<sup>&#x025b5;</sup> RNAseq datasets were classified as novel transcripts. The genomic locations of transfrags were cross-referenced with the locations of annotated transcripts from the BROAD <italic>N. crassa</italic> genome annotation (NC10) in a strand-dependent fashion. Transcript sequences were searched for coding potential using Coding Potential Calculator <xref rid="pone.0091353-Kong1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Transcripts with no coding potential were searched against the library of Rfam 11.0 RNA families <xref rid="pone.0091353-Burge1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> using INFERNAL 1.1 <xref rid="pone.0091353-Nawrocki1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, and for tRNAs using tRNAscan-SE 1.23 <xref rid="pone.0091353-Lowe1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.

Read counts for both previously annotated protein coding genes and our lncRNA set were used for the differential expression analysis. The read counts for either WT and light- or WT and temperature-treated samples were normalised and analysed using DESeq <xref rid="pone.0091353-Anders1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> at a 5% FDR (adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction: <italic>p</italic><sub>adj</sub>-value reported by DESeq).

After 48 hours of light-dark cycle, cultures were either kept at 25&#x000b0;C in the dark, exposed to a pulse of light for one hour at 25&#x000b0;C, or transferred to 30&#x000b0;C in the dark for one hour (temperature pulse). RNA was extracted from the tissues using TRizol. The RNA (100 &#x003bc;g) obtained from the tissues was DNase-treated (New England Biolabs) for 2 hours at 37&#x000b0;C and then the enzyme was heat-inactivated at 75&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes. The RNA was further purified using the RNeasy Plant mini kit (Qiagen). 1 &#x003bc;g of RNA was used to perform strand-specific reverse transcription using the primers shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091353.s009">Table S7</xref>. Reverse transcription was performed using the RevertAid Reverse Transcriptase kit (Thermo Scientific) using the conditions suggested by the manufacturer, followed by RNase treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on the cDNA using the custom Taqman gene expression assays (Life Technologies). The TaqMan probes were designed to target the region of overlap between the sense and antisense transcript (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091353.s009">Table S7</xref> for primers and probe sequences). The use of strand-specific RT and the same probe to detect both sense and antisense enables us to confirm the presence of sense and antisense transcripts independently. cDNA was diluted 5 fold and then serially diluted to obtain the standard curve. cDNAs were used at different dilutions based on their expression levels and were quantified using the standard graph. For each sample there were three technical replicates. The cDNA for U2 RNA was used to normalise the expression of the sense/antisense transcript.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0091353.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>A.
