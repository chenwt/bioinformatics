These sRNAs act by sequestering the RNA binding protein CsrA (RsmA) away from lower affinity mRNA targets. In this study, we used ChIP-exo to identify, at single nucleotide resolution, genomic sites for UvrY (SirA) binding in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>. The <italic>csrB</italic> and <italic>csrC</italic> genes were the strongest targets of crosslinking, which required UvrY phosphorylation by the BarA sensor kinase. Crosslinking occurred at two sites, an inverted repeat sequence far upstream of the promoter and a site near the -35 sequence. DNAse I footprinting revealed specific binding of UvrY <italic>in vitro</italic> only to the upstream site, indicative of additional binding requirements and/or indirect binding to the downstream site. Additional genes, including <italic>cspA</italic>, encoding the cold-shock RNA-binding protein CspA, showed weaker crosslinking and modest or negligible regulation by UvrY. We conclude that the global effects of UvrY/SirA on gene expression are primarily mediated by activating <italic>csrB</italic> and <italic>csrC</italic> transcription. We also used <italic>in vivo</italic> crosslinking and other experimental approaches to reveal new features of <italic>csrB/csrC</italic> regulation by the DeaD and SrmB RNA helicases, IHF, ppGpp and DksA. Finally, the phylogenetic distribution of BarA-UvrY was analyzed and found to be uniquely characteristic of &#x003b3;-Proteobacteria and strongly anti-correlated with <italic>fliW</italic>, which encodes a protein that binds to CsrA and antagonizes its activity in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. We propose that BarA-UvrY and orthologous TCS transcribe sRNA antagonists of CsrA throughout the &#x003b3;-Proteobacteria, but rarely or never perform this function in other species.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, Award Number: R01GM059969 to TR, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to TR, the University of Florida Foundation, Inc., Award Number: Alumni Graduate Fellowships Fund to TRZ, Guangxi Scholarship Fund of Guangxi Education Department to DT, the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a, Award Number: 178033 to DG, the Direcci&#x000f3;n General Asuntos del Personal Acad&#x000e9;mico, Universidad Nacional Aut&#x000f3;noma de M&#x000e9;xico, Award Number: IN209215 to DG, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Award Number: F32AI100322 to CAV, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Award Number: R01AI097116 to BMMA and TR.

The Csr (carbon storage regulator) or Rsm (repressor of stationary phase metabolites) system is a post-transcriptional regulatory system of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and other &#x003b3;-proteobacteria that is extensively interconnected with transcriptional regulatory circuits [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Its centerpiece, CsrA, is a small dimeric RNA binding protein that regulates mRNA translation, turnover and transcription termination [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. CsrA activity in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (hereafter referred to as <italic>Salmonella</italic>) is regulated by CsrB and CsrC sRNAs, which utilize multiple CsrA binding sites to sequester CsrA away from its lower affinity mRNA targets [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. CsrB/C levels are regulated by factors affecting both their synthesis and turnover [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>CsrB and CsrC transcription is directly regulated by the BarA-UvrY or BarA-SirA two-component signal transduction system (TCS) in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and <italic>Salmonella</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], respectively. The BarA protein belongs to a family of membrane-associated tripartite sensor-kinases and UvrY belongs to the FixJ family of response regulators [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. BarA is required for sensing the presence of acetate, formate and other carboxylate compounds by an undetermined mechanism [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This leads to autophosphorylation at a conserved histidine residue (His<sup>302</sup>), and transphosphorylation of UvrY/SirA through a His<sup>302</sup>&#x02192; Asp<sup>718</sup>&#x02192; His<sup>861</sup>&#x02192; Asp<sup>54</sup> phosphorelay [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Phosphorylated UvrY-P/SirA-P, in turn, binds to its DNA targets and regulates their transcription. For instance, <italic>in vitro</italic> binding studies suggest that the SirA protein (SirA-P) binds to DNA sequences located upstream of target genes for Csr sRNAs and activates their transcription in <italic>Salmonella</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>BarA-UvrY and its orthologs in other &#x003b3;<italic>-</italic>proteobacteria, including GacS/GacA (<italic>Pseudomonas</italic>), VarS/VarA (<italic>Vibrio)</italic>, ExpS/ExpA (<italic>Pectobacterium)</italic> and LetS/LetA (<italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>) have been reported to regulate virulence, metabolism, biofilm formation, stress resistance, quorum sensing and secretion systems [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Transcriptomics studies of UvrY and its orthologs have shown effects on the expression of numerous genes [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. An understanding of which of these effects represents direct regulation vs. indirect regulation via effects on the Csr sRNAs is necessary for modeling of the complex genetic circuitry that underpins the systems biology of these species. This question has been examined in only one case, which used ChIP-on-chip analysis to conclude that only the genes for Csr sRNAs (RsmY, RsmZ) in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> are direct targets for GacA binding [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Here, we used ChIP-exo, an advanced procedure for determining genome-wide DNA-protein interactions with single nucleotide resolution [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] to map the UvrY and SirA DNA binding sites across the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> genomes. The <italic>csrB</italic> and <italic>csrC</italic> genes were by far the strongest direct targets of binding in both species. These genes exhibited crosslinking at two distinct locations. By comparing the results of <italic>in vivo</italic> crosslinking with <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding assays, an 18 NT palindrome or inverted repeat sequence (IR) located far upstream of the promoter was found to serve as a specific binding site for UvrY at <italic>csrB</italic> and <italic>csrC</italic>. Disruption of <italic>barA</italic> eliminated UvrY binding <italic>in vivo</italic>. IHF (integration host factor) was required for optimal UvrY binding to and transcriptional activation of <italic>csrB</italic> but not <italic>csrC</italic>. In addition to the <italic>csrB/C</italic> genes, weaker genomic binding sites of UvrY were identified by ChIP-exo. Several genes associated with the weaker binding sites were tested and found to exhibit negligible or only modest regulation by UvrY, suggesting that diverse effects of this TCS are mediated through Csr circuitry.</p><p>In addition to BarA-UvrY, other factors activate <italic>csrB/C</italic> transcription in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, such as CsrA [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], DksA and ppGpp of the stringent response [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and the DEAD-box RNA helicases DeaD and SrmB [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The stringent response describes a regulatory network of eubacteria that responds to amino acid starvation and other stresses [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Activation of this system is characterized by a rapid downshift in synthesis of stable RNAs, such as rRNA and tRNA and stimulation of the expression of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and transport, although these processes represent a fraction of its global regulatory role [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The effector of this response is the nucleotide secondary messenger guanosine tetraphosphate, ppGpp, also known as &#x0201c;magic spot&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Complexed with RNA polymerase, ppGpp positively or negatively affects transcription [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In most cases, regulation by ppGpp requires the RNA-polymerase associated transcription factor DksA [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which acts together with ppGpp to synergistically regulate expression of a number of global regulators and other genes. The DEAD-box RNA helicases are enzymes that utilize ATP energy to alter RNA structure or RNA-protein interactions [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Their roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of bacterial gene expression are presently underappreciated. DeaD regulates <italic>uvrY</italic> translation by altering mRNA structure, while SrmB uses a distinct, but incompletely understood mechanism. We used a combination of <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches to refine our understanding of how these regulatory factors affect <italic>csrB/C</italic> transcription.</p><p>Bioinformatics analyses revealed that BarA-UvrY orthologs are strongly anti-correlated with the <italic>fliW</italic> gene, which encodes a protein that binds to and antagonizes CsrA of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], indicating that few if any species use both FliW and BarA-UvrY transcribed sRNAs as CsrA antagonists. These studies advance our understanding of this global regulatory circuitry and highlight the importance of including post-transcriptional regulation along with transcriptional control when modeling bacterial regulatory networks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><p>Bacterial strains, plasmids and primers used in this project are listed in <xref rid="pone.0145035.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><p>LB medium (1% [w/v] Tryptone; 1% [w/v] NaCl and 0.5% [w/v] yeast extract) was used for culture of bacteria unless stated otherwise.

To determine whether UvrY regulates <italic>cspA</italic> indirectly through its effects on CsrB/C, and therefore CsrA activity, we conducted an epistasis analysis (<xref rid="pone.0145035.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). A strain that was disrupted in both <italic>uvrY</italic> and <italic>csrA</italic> was transformed with plasmids expressing <italic>uvrY</italic> or <italic>csrA</italic> from the plasmid cloning vector pBR322, and CspA-FLAG protein levels were determined in the resulting strains.

In contrast, the <italic>uvrY</italic>-expression plasmid (pUY14) led to modest decrease in CspA-FLAG levels in this strain. These results are consistent with a model in which UvrY inhibits <italic>cspA</italic> expression by binding to the <italic>cspA</italic> promoter, while the effect of CsrA may be mediated indirectly. Also consistent with this model, <italic>in silico</italic> analyses did not reveal typical CsrA binding sequences (GGA) in the 160 NT 5&#x02019;-UTR of the <italic>cspA</italic> transcript (data not shown) and an RNA-seq analysis conducted previously did not reveal <italic>cspA</italic> mRNA among the 721 different transcripts that copurified with CsrA [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Based on all of these observations, we conclude that, under the growth conditions tested, the BarA-UvrY TCS directly exerts its global effect on gene expression primarily through the Csr system by activating the transcription of the CsrB and CsrC sRNAs, with <italic>cspA</italic> representing a likely exception. This raises the question of why UvrY-FLAG crosslinked <italic>in vivo</italic> (though weakly) to the regulatory regions of 286 genes <italic>in E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and 301 genes in <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0145035.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>), but exerted little or no regulatory effect in the examples that were tested. To explain these observations, we propose three possible hypotheses: (i) Perhaps other unknown activator(s) are required along with UvrY/SirA for the expression of these genes, but were not available or functioning under the chosen growth conditions. Thus, UvrY/SirA might activate some of these genes under other growth conditions. (ii) Perhaps one or more repressors overrides the influence of UvrY/SirA on the expression of these genes under the conditions tested [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. To address these two hypotheses, we searched for factors known to regulate the expression of the putative UvrY target genes. This analysis revealed several DNA binding proteins including CRP, FNR and IHF appear to regulate the greatest number of potential UvrY targets (<xref rid="pone.0145035.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). Hence, it is conceivable that such factors may mask the effects of UvrY on the expression of these genes under our growth conditions. (iii) Because the putative UvrY targets from the ChIP lack the 18nt-long IR sequence found in the regulatory regions of <italic>csrB/C</italic>, it is also possible that some of these genes have degenerate UvrY/SirA binding sites with no functional relevance or perhaps serving as nonspecific holding sites for UvrY/SirA [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>UvrY expression is activated by CsrA via a putative posttranscriptional mechanism that does not involve the RNA helicase DeaD, a known regulator of <italic>uvrY</italic> translation</title><p>In addition to BarA-UvrY, the transcription of CsrB/C is also strongly activated by CsrA [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] by mechanisms that are yet to be determined.

Moreover, CsrA is required for switching BarA from a protein possessing phosphatase activity to kinase activity on UvrY [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, we tested the effect of CsrA on the expression, stability and phosphorylation of UvrY-FLAG. The results showed that while CsrA does not affect UvrY-FLAG protein stability (<xref rid="pone.0145035.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A Fig</xref>), it has a strong positive effect on UvrY-FLAG expression (<xref rid="pone.0145035.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B</xref>).

When we compared the respective DNA binding motifs of each factor with the IR binding motif of UvrY, we found an overlap in all of them (<xref rid="pone.0145035.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>), supporting the possibility that undiscovered direct target sequences for UvrY binding might have gone undetected in our experiments.

To test this hypothesis, we examined the phylogenetic distributions of CsrA, BarA-UvrY and FliW across fully-sequenced bacteria (<xref rid="pone.0145035.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). We found that, for species encoding at least one readily identifiable CsrA ortholog, the presence of BarA-UvrY and FliW were strongly anti-correlated at species level (Spearman correlation = -0.97, p = 1.10x10<sup>-205</sup>) and genus level (Spearman correlation = -0.95, p = 7.31x10<sup>-74</sup>) (<xref rid="pone.0145035.g015" ref-type="fig">Fig 15</xref>).

Although difficult to detect, any strong biases in the methodology we used to identify orthologous genes could affect our results. To address this concern, we used two additional and widely-used methods to identify alternative ortholog sets: KEGG orthology database (KO) [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and UniProt reference clusters of orthologs (UniRef) [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].

In addition, we applied sequence similarity filtering and manual curation to reduce false positives and false negatives in the NCBI orthologs data set.</p><p>After the sequence similarity filtering and manual curation, we found several false positives for CsrA in the Streptococcus genus, such as misannotated heavy metal stress response proteins (NCBI identification numbers (GI): 15675047, 13622200, 21904470), peptide methionine sulfoxide reductases (GI: 222114035, 134272076, 209540564, 24638057, 342165139, 342165138), and putative CsrA homologs that lack the N-terminal and C-terminal conserved regions of CsrA (GI: 895760047, 882844105, 882819224).

We discovered that the <italic>csrB</italic>/C genes are by far the strongest direct targets of UvrY in these species. UvrY binds specifically to an 18 nt palindromic sequence in the promoter regions of <italic>csrB/C</italic> and exhibited an almost absolute requirement for phosphorylation by BarA for this binding <italic>in vivo</italic> under growth conditions examined. UvrY-P requires IHF for optimal binding to and activation of <italic>csrB</italic> but not <italic>csrC</italic>. CsrA activates <italic>csrB/C</italic> transcription by activating <italic>uvrY</italic> expression by an undefined mechanism, which may require the noncoding mRNA leader, but does not involve the other known posttranscriptional regulator of <italic>uvrY</italic>, the DeaD-box RNA helicase DeaD [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The RNA DEAD-box helicase SrmB, which also activates <italic>csrB/C</italic> transcription in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], promoted binding of UvrY to <italic>csrB</italic> DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> without affecting the expression of other factors known to activate <italic>csrB</italic> expression. This suggests that SrmB may regulate unknown factor(s) involved in <italic>csrB</italic> transcription. The stringent response factors ppGpp and DksA activate CsrB/C expression <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and were found to modestly activate <italic>csrB</italic> expression <italic>in vitro</italic> in S-30 extracts.

Hence, we conclude that, under the growth conditions that we have examined, UvrY-P exerts its global effects on gene expression almost entirely by activating the transcription of CsrB and CsrC. We suspect that most of the genes that have been found to respond to BarA and UvrY in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and their orthologs in other species [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] are indirect targets of UvrY, which are regulated by CsrA.</p><p>The BarA-UvrY/Csr signaling pathway has been studied in the commensal bacterium <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, the pathogen <italic>Salmonella</italic>, and a number of other &#x003b3;-proteobacterial pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>, the only Gram-positive bacterium in which CsrA has been studied to date, uses FliW as an &#x003b1;-CsrA protein, which binds to and inhibits CsrA activity [<xref rid="pone.0145035.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145035.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. While this is only the first such example, FliW is present in diverse species, where it may act as an inhibitor of CsrA.
