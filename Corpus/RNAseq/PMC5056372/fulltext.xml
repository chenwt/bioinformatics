Here, we have examined the expression of several tumor suppressors upon fasting in mice. Interestingly, <italic>p21</italic> mRNA is uniquely induced in all the tissues tested, particularly in liver and muscle (&#x0003e;10 fold), and this upregulation is independent of p53. Remarkably, in contrast to wild-type mice, <italic>p21</italic>-null mice become severely morbid after prolonged fasting. The defective adaptation to fasting of <italic>p21</italic>-null mice is associated to elevated energy expenditure, accelerated depletion of fat stores, and premature activation of protein catabolism in the muscle. Analysis of the liver transcriptome and cell-based assays revealed that the absence of p21 partially impairs the transcriptional program of PPAR&#x003b1;, a key regulator of fasting metabolism. Finally, treatment of <italic>p21</italic>-null mice with a PPAR&#x003b1; agonist substantially protects them from their accelerated loss of fat upon fasting. We conclude that p21 plays a relevant role in fasting adaptation through the positive regulation of PPAR&#x003b1;.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Fasting has been thoroughly studied regarding the metabolic adaptations that it triggers. These adaptions basically consist in the sequential mobilization of internal nutrient stores, starting with hepatic glycogen, then triglycerides from the adipose tissue, and finally proteins from muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. However, the implications of fasting adaptation go further beyond metabolism. For example, fasting strongly diminishes the toxic effects of chemotherapy on normal cells and tissues, both in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> and humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, and this has substantially increased the interest in understanding the link between stress responses and fasting.</p><p>Many tumor suppressors participate in stress signaling pathways, and this has been extensively studied in the context of cellular damage conducive to cancer, such as DNA damage and oncogenic stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, the possible role of tumor suppressors in response to fasting has remained largely unexplored. Previous researchers have identified p21 (also known as p21<sup>Cip1</sup> or CDKN1A) as a fasting-induced factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, but nothing was known about the relevance and role of p21 in fasting adaptation.</p><p>The best understood functions of p21 are inhibition of the cyclin dependent kinases (primarily CDK2) and inhibition of the DNA replication processivity factor PCNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, thereby efficiently blocking cell proliferation. In addition to this, p21 has a growing list of interacting partners including the binding and inhibition of transcription factors, such as E2F1, STAT3 and MYC, all of them involved in cell proliferation and survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The levels of p21 are regulated transcriptionally by p53, as well as by important negative regulators of proliferation, such as TGF&#x003b2;-activated SMAD complexes and FOXO proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>In this work, we report that p21 is a critical factor for fasting adaptation and we present evidence for an unprecedented role of p21 as a positive regulator of PPAR&#x003b1;, a key transcription factor that orchestrates multiple aspects of fasting adaptation, including fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Characterization of fasting-induced <italic>p21</italic> upregulation</title><p>Previous investigators have reported that <italic>p21</italic> mRNA is upregulated in many tissues upon fasting through a mechanism that is independent of p53 and partly mediated by FOXO1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. We wanted to confirm and extend these findings and, for this, we began by analyzing whether other cell cycle inhibitors and tumor suppressors are also upregulated by fasting. Interestingly, only <italic>p21</italic> mRNA was strongly induced upon fasting in the liver, while <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>Ink4a</italic></sup>, <italic>p19</italic><sup><italic>Arf</italic></sup>, <italic>p27</italic><sup><italic>Kip1</italic></sup>, or <italic>p53</italic> mRNAs were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We found that this upregulation is present across all tissues tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>), being more prominent in the liver and muscle. Also, fasting-induced <italic>p21</italic> upregulation was independent of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>) and p19<sup>Arf</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>). The sirtuin SIRT1 is involved in many responses to nutrient deprivation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, but <italic>p21</italic> upregulation by fasting was not affected in <italic>Sirt1</italic>-heterozygous mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p>The induction of <italic>p21</italic> by nutrient deprivation was also recapitulated in cultured cells. In particular, we observed that <italic>p21</italic> was significantly induced when human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells or mouse immortalized primary hepatocytes were starved (no serum and no glucose, for 24&#x02009;h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Nutrient deprivation, among many other effects, decreases PI3K activity and elevates cAMP, both being important for metabolic adaptation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. To explore the contribution of these pathways to the upregulation of <italic>p21</italic>, cells were treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K or with forskolin (to increase cAMP levels). Interestingly, forskolin, but not PI3K inhibition, further enhanced the upregulation of <italic>p21</italic> by nutrient deprivation in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>). These observations suggest that cAMP, possibly through the transcription factor CREB, is involved in the upregulation of <italic>p21</italic> upon starvation. Together, these observations reinforce the concept that p21<sup>Cip1</sup> is induced by nutrient deprivation both at the organism level and in isolated cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Impaired adaptation to prolonged fasting in p21<sup>Cip1</sup> deficient mice</title><p>To test the role of p21 in metabolic adaptation to fasting, <italic>p21</italic>-null (p21KO) mice were fasted for 48&#x02009;h. We did not observe obvious differences after 24&#x02009;h of fasting, which is consistent with a previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Remarkably, at 48&#x02009;h, p21KO mice presented important differences compared to their controls (WT). In particular, p21KO mice were extremely stressed or lethargic, although their weight loss was comparable to that of WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1A</xref>). Upon necropsy, all WT mice still retained white adipose tissue (WAT) and interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In contrast, p21KO mice had remnants of WAT and BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Histologically, the size of p21KO adipocytes was dramatically reduced compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Mice deficient in p21 presented a remarkable drop in body temperature (rectal) upon 48&#x02009;h of fasting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p>A number of metabolic adaptations were significantly altered in fasted p21KO mice. In particular, serum free fatty acids (FFA), triglycerides (TG) and ketone bodies (KB) were much lower than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1B; Table S1</xref>), which suggest that p21KO mice exhaust lipid stores prematurely compared to WT mice. The levels of IGF1, insulin and leptin were also significantly decreased in p21KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>). The above alterations were accompanied by hepatic damage, as reflected by the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Regarding the serum levels of amino acids, fasted p21KO mice presented higher levels of histidine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine and valine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed higher levels of expression of <italic>Murf1</italic> in skeletal muscle, which encodes a key ubiquitin ligase for muscle protein degradation during fasting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2F</xref>). We interpret that the enhanced muscle proteolytic activity of p21KO mice compensates their premature loss of lipid stores.</p><p>The above observations suggest that p21KO mice exhaust their energetic reserves prematurely during fasting. To directly evaluate this, we measured energy expenditure (EE) in WT and p21KO mice during 48&#x02009;h of fasting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Notably, p21KO mice presented higher levels of EE during the total period of fasting, and particularly during the first dark and second light periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). No significant differences were observed in EE under normal feeding conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S2A</xref>). Fasting induces behavioral changes that reflect in elevated locomotor activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Interestingly, p21KO mice showed a significant increase in activity during the entire period of fasting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>), while no differences were observed under feeding conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S2B</xref>). Together, we conclude that in the absence of p21, mice do not adapt efficiently to energy deprivation and exhaust prematurely their nutrient stores.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Global transcription changes in p21<sup>Cip1</sup> deficient mice</title><p>To gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for the defective adaptation of p21KO mice to prolonged fasting, we obtained the liver RNAseq profiles of WT and p21KO mice under standard feeding conditions and after 24&#x02009;h of fasting (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2&#x02013;3 per group). We chose 24&#x02009;h of fasting to capture early defects in p21KO mice, prior to the severe phenotypes observed at 48&#x02009;h. A total of 451 genes (128 UP and 323 DOWN) were differentially expressed (FDR <italic>q</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) between p21KO and WT livers after 24&#x02009;h of fasting and 96 of these genes (8 UP and 88 DOWN) were already differentially expressed under <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S2</xref>). Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of pathways (KEGG) indicated an abundance of downregulated pathways related to inflammation in fasted p21KO livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S3</xref>). One of the major consequences of fasting and dietary restriction is a general decrease in the number of infiltrating leukocytes and markers of inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. To directly measure this, we quantified leukocyte (CD45<sup>+</sup> cells) infiltration in the liver and we observed a significant reduction in fasted p21KO livers compared to fasted WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>). This was further substantiated by measuring the mRNA levels of genes related to the immune system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S3A</xref>), and by staining liver infiltrating macrophages with F4/80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Of note, the relative proportion of leukocyte sub-populations was not altered in p21KO livers relative to WT controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S3B</xref>). We interpret that the reduced inflammation observed in p21KO mice further reflects the aggravated consequences of fasting in these mice.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Decreased PPAR&#x003b1; activity in the liver of p21<sup>Cip1</sup> deficient mice</title><p>We took note of the fact that &#x0201c;PPAR signaling&#x0201d; was one of the gene sets downregulated in fasted p21KO mice compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). PPAR&#x003b1; is a critical hepatic transcription factor activated in response to nutrient deprivation and required for fasting adaptation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Indeed, GSEA using a PPAR&#x003b1; signature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> further suggested a reduction in PPAR&#x003b1; activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). To validate the RNAseq data, we measured directly the mRNA levels of well-established PPAR&#x003b1; transcriptional targets. Interestingly, some PPAR&#x003b1; targets were significantly downregulated in fasted p21KO livers compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). A similar situation was observed in immortalized primary hepatocytes upon nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Moreover, after 48&#x02009;h of serum and glucose starvation, cultures of immortalized p21KO primary hepatocytes underwent massive cell death, whereas WT control hepatocytes remained largely viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p><p>To directly address the impact of p21 on the functionality of PPAR&#x003b1;, we used the PPAR&#x003b1; agonist WY-14,643. Interestingly, the induction of some WY-14,643-responsive genes was impaired in the absence of p21, both in primary hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5E</xref>) and in overnight fasted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5F</xref>). We wondered if the observed partial activation of PPAR&#x003b1; by WY-14,643 in p21KO mice would be sufficient to normalize their fasting response. Remarkably, p21KO mice treated with WY-14,643 were protected from severe fat depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5G</xref>) and serum FFA depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S4</xref>) after 48&#x02009;h fasting. We conclude that p21 contributes to the metabolic adaptation to fasting acting in part as a positive regulator of PPAR&#x003b1;.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we have addressed a general question regarding the involvement of tumor suppressors in the response to fasting. On one hand, fasting is a physiological stress that triggers complex metabolic adaptions. On the other hand, some of the most important tumor suppressors participate in stress signaling pathways that are activated to prevent proliferation under stressful conditions. To explore the possible role of tumor suppressors in fasting, we began by asking if their mRNA levels respond to fasting. Interestingly, <italic>p21</italic>, but not other tested tumor suppressors tested, was highly upregulated in multiple tissues upon fasting and independently of p53.</p><p>Of note, <italic>p21</italic>-null (p21KO) mice manifested profound defects in the adaptation to fasting. This was particularly evident after 48&#x02009;h of fasting, when p21KO mice showed clear signs of energy exhaustion, including lower serum levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids, and ketone bodies, together with a dramatic reduction of IGF1 and leptin levels, and a significant reduction in body temperature. In addition, fasted p21KO mice presented elevated levels of amino acids in the serum and a significant upregulation of the ubiquitin ligase MURF1 implicated in the degradation of muscle proteins. Finally, we observed that p21KO mice had higher energy expenditure during the first 36&#x02009;h of fasting. All these alterations are consistent with a premature exhaustion of nutrient stores.</p><p>Unbiased examination of the transcriptome of p21KO livers upon 24&#x02009;h fasting, when the severe defects of fasting have not been manifested yet, further supported the idea that the absence of p21 results in an accelerated onset of the effects of fasting. In particular, fasting reduces the levels of tissue infiltrating leukocytes present under normal feeding conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, but this reduction was more profound in the case of p21KO livers. This analysis also pointed out a defective activation of some PPAR&#x003b1; transcriptional targets in fasted p21KO livers. This was particularly interesting because PPAR&#x003b1; is critical for fasting adaptation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In fact, PPAR&#x003b1;-deficient mice present an abnormal response to fasting with some similarities to p21KO mice, such as lower body temperature and lower serum ketone bodies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The defective activation of a subset of PAPR&#x003b1; transcriptional targets was confirmed in fasted p21KO livers, as well as, in p21KO hepatocytes upon nutrient starvation or treatment with a PPAR&#x003b1; agonist (WY-14,643). To test the role of defective PPAR&#x003b1; in the misadaptation of p21KO mice to fasting, treatment of these mice with the PPAR&#x003b1; agonist prevented their premature depletion of fat stores. We conclude that the tumor suppressor p21 contributes to fasting adaptation by acting as a positive regulator of PPAR&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the CNIO-ISCIII Ethics Committee for Research and Animal Welfare (CEIyBA) and the Community of Madrid, and conducted in accordance to the recommendations of the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA) and the institutional guidelines.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mouse experimentation</title><p>Mice were housed under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions, at 22&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and with 12&#x02009;hours dark/light cycles (light cycle from 8 am to 8 pm).
