A comprehensive resetting of the miRNA profile occurs during reprogramming; however, analysis of miRNA co-expression patterns yields only a few patterns of change. Dlk1-Dio3 region miRNAs dominate the large pool of miRNAs experiencing small but significant fold changes early in reprogramming. Overexpression of Dlk1-Dio3 miRNAs early in reprogramming reduces reprogramming efficiency, suggesting the observed downregulation of these miRNAs may contribute to reprogramming. As reprogramming progresses, fewer miRNAs show changes in expression, but those changes are generally of greater magnitude.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The broad resetting of the miRNA profile during reprogramming that we observe is due to small changes in gene expression in many miRNAs early in the process, and large changes in only a few miRNAs late in reprogramming.

Sequencing at the RNA level quantifies the transcriptome in a non-biased manner and, when applied to a temporal series of cellular transitions, can detect co-expression networks that suggest functional modules. Reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is one such series of cellular transitions and is of enormous interest to biologists. Reprogramming can be staged as an epigenetic series of gene expression changes that begins with downregulation of fibroblast genes followed by induction of temporally controlled mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell markers, activation of endogenous mES self-renewal genes, and the establishment of mES gene regulation networks
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Reprogramming epochs can be marked by the loss of the membrane glycoprotein Thy1 immunoreactivity as fibroblasts shed their identity, followed by activation of the pluripotency markers alkaline phosphatase (AP) and SSEA1
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and then activation of embryonic stem cell factor genes such as <italic>Oct4</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Klf4</italic>, <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Sall4</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Failure to suppress differentiation-associated genes or block differentiation signals leads to incomplete reprogramming
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>More detailed analyses have shown that the immediate response to the reprogramming factors includes upregulation of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) genes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and proliferation genes, consistent with both <italic>c-Myc</italic> expression
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and the requirement to overcome the barrier of cell-cycle arrest early
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These and other studies highlight the patterns of mRNA expression induced by single or multiple reprogramming factors; however, microRNA (miRNA) expression patterns have received less attention. Polo <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] used microarrays to investigate miRNA expression patterns in later stages of reprogramming, but the role of miRNAs early in reprogramming remains incompletely defined.</p><p>miRNAs are highly accurate markers of cell identity (reviewed in
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). Their profiles unambiguously distinguish cell types, including embryonic stem cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], a vast variety of precursor cells, terminally differentiated cells, and tumor types, even among closely related cancers
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. miRNAs play important functional roles in stem cells, including the regulation of pluripotency, self-renewal and reprogramming of somatic cells (reviewed in
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]).</p><p>To investigate the overall pattern of miRNA expression during reprogramming, we deeply sequenced the small RNA population of mouse embryonic fibroblasts during reprogramming. These datasets were analyzed by two complementary statistical techniques - one to identify differentially expressed miRNAs and the other to detect putatively co-regulated modules. The analysis identified unique miRNA expression signatures among reprogramming intermediates as well as the cell lines that failed to achieve pluripotency. Deep sequencing&#x02019;s large dynamic range and ability to detect all expressed miRNAs demonstrated with high resolution that large numbers of miRNAs undergo significant changes in expression during reprogramming. We have identified sets of miRNAs that undergo expression changes at transition points and show that these miRNAs appear to be expressed as modules with unique expression patterns, some with annotated functional assignments. A staged expression pattern was observed in which small fold changes among a large number of miRNAs occur at the earliest time point in reprogramming and this pattern shifts to large fold changes among a small number of miRNAs as reprogramming progresses. A recent report analyzed reprogramming at the single-cell level and found that gene expression between sister cells varied greatly
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. They proposed that stochasticity was characteristic of the early stage of reprogramming. Following this phase, cells destined for pluripotency demonstrated a more uniform and predictable sequence of gene expression changes referred to as a 'hierarchical mechanism'
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The pattern of lower magnitude changes in miRNA levels observed during the very early phase of reprogramming followed by later stages characterized by large changes in only a few miRNAs coincides with a stochastic early phase followed by a later deterministic phase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>miRNAs identify distinct reprogramming stages</title><p>Intermediates of four factor reprogramming (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, abbreviated OSKM)

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A-C; Figure S1 in Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The intermediary transitions analyzed were the loss of the fibroblast marker Thy1 (44.6% of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted cells at day 5) followed by the appearance of the SSEA1 marker (5.5% of cells at day 10), followed, in turn, by expression of endogenous <italic>Oct4</italic> (also known as <italic>Pou5f1</italic>; 3.7% of cells at day 14). Eight cell populations were chosen for deep sequencing: (1) Oct4-GFP MEFs; (2) FACS-sorted Thy1- cells from cultures at day 5 after OSKM (4F) transduced MEFs; (3) sorted SSEA1+ cells harvested at day 9 to 10 post-OSKM; (4) Oct4-GFP+&#x02009;cells at day 14 post-OSKM; (5) an established iPSC line (iPSC93-2

<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), which can capture miRNA expression in low-dimensional space. As observed in Polo <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], this non-biased analysis revealed clusters that corresponded to each of the cell types. Thus, miRNAs have the property of defining cell identity among reprogramming intermediates. Furthermore, the profiles from the reprogramming intermediates (MEF, Thy1-, SSEA1+, Oct4-GFP+) were spread along a trajectory that corresponded to the progression of reprogramming.</p></sec><sec><title>A miRNA profile can distinguish the state of partially reprogrammed lines</title><p>Partially reprogrammed iPSCs (piPSCs) are stable cell lines trapped at intermediate stages of reprogramming that have silenced the somatic program but failed to activate the pluripotency program
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. By PCA, piPSCs clustered most closely to the SSEA1+ intermediates (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D). To identify miRNAs that were differentially expressed between the piPSC lines compared to fully reprogrammed iPSC lines and embryonic stem cells, the entire data set was statistically analyzed by edgeR
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. edgeR identified 87 miRNAs that were differentially expressed between the piPSC lines compared to fully reprogrammed iPSC lines and embryonic stem cells. The pluripotency-associated 106a&#x02009;~&#x02009;363 and 290&#x02009;~&#x02009;295 clusters were among the most significantly differentially expressed miRNAs between these two clusters, and were all elevated in stem cells compared to piPSCs, indicating that basic changes necessary for establishing pluripotency have not been established in the piPSC lines. miRNAs associated with the MET (miR-200a, b, c-3p, miR-141-3p, miR-429-3p, miR-205-5p)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] were not differentially expressed between the piPSC lines and the stem cell lines, with the exception of miR-200c-3p. In agreement with their placement in the PCA, these piPSC lines appear stuck in the vicinity of the SSEA1+ stage, as the MET miRNAs are significantly upregulated between Thy1- and SSEA1+ stages (see below), and the pluripotency-associated 106a&#x02009;~&#x02009;363 and 290&#x02009;~&#x02009;295 clusters do not exhibit a pronounced increase in expression until the transition from SSEA1+ to Oct4-GFP+.</p></sec><sec><title>miRNA expression changes at key reprogramming transition points</title><p>To assess miRNA changes at successive stages of reprogramming, the re-programmed series alone (MEFs versus Thy1-, Thy1- versus SSEA1+, or SSEA1+ versus Oct4-GFP+) was analyzed by edgeR; 543 miRNAs had at least 4 cpm in at least one of the reprogramming libraries in each replicate. Many (325 at an FDR of 5%) of the 543 miRNAs included in the edgeR analysis were differentially expressed either over the entire MEF to Oct4-GFP+&#x02009;time series (MEF versus Thy1-, MEF versus SSEA1+, MEF versus Oct4-GFP+), or in the individual stage-to-stage transitions (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E). This observation again points to the massive resetting of miRNA levels associated with reprogramming. The largest number of differentially expressed miRNAs occurred during the MEF to Thy1- transition, with 81 miRNAs downregulated and 72 upregulated (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). In the Thy1- to SSEA1+ transition, 52 miRNAs were downregulated, and 39 were upregulated. From SSEA1+ to Oct4-GFP+&#x02009;cells, no miRNAs were downregulated and 17 were upregulated.</p><p>While the MEF to Thy1- transition had the highest number of differentially expressed miRNAs, the fold changes, albeit significant, were all relatively modest whereas the Thy1- to SSEA1+ and SSEA1+ to Oct4-GFP+&#x02009;transitions had a larger fraction of miRNAs with large, positive log<sub>2</sub> fold changes (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>F). This pattern of multiple miRNAs with small fold changes early in reprogramming followed by a much lower number of miRNAs with large fold changes later in reprogramming could contribute to the transition from stochastic to deterministic behavior

The miRNAs may be processed from only one or a few transcripts
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. During the earliest transition in reprogramming, the transition from MEF to Thy1-, most of the downregulated miRNAs lie within the <italic>Dlk1</italic>-<italic>Dio3</italic> gene region. Of the 81 miRNAs significantly downregulated at an FDR of 5%, 66 were in the <italic>Dlk1</italic>-<italic>Dio3</italic> cluster, out of a total of 85 miRNAs in that region in the dataset.

The 19 <italic>Dlk1</italic>-<italic>Dio3</italic> miRNAs that were not differentially expressed during this transition were generally poorly expressed. As reprogramming proceeds, five of these miRNAs from the <italic>Dlk1</italic>-<italic>Dio3</italic> region were then upregulated at the Thy1- to SSEA1+ and/or SSEA1+ to Oct4-GFP+&#x02009;transitions (Figure&#x000a0;

By the Oct4-GFP+&#x02009;stage, only 35 of the <italic>Dlk1</italic>-<italic>Dio3</italic> miRNAs were still significantly downregulated when compared to starting MEFs. Transient expression changes such as those that occurred with the five <italic>Dlk1</italic>-<italic>Dio3</italic> miRNAs were not common during reprogramming. Only 10 miRNAs underwent significant up- or downregulation during one of the early stage-to-stage transitions of reprogramming, followed by a significant change in expression in the opposite direction in one of the later stages of reprogramming (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Six miRNAs were temporarily downregulated during reprogramming, five of which are encoded in the <italic>Dlk1</italic>-<italic>Dio3</italic> locus.

<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). This subset consisted of 125 miRNAs differentially expressed between MEFs and iPSCs or mES cells in mice or humans (KR dataset; Additional file

We then carried out the same network analysis with the larger number of miRNAs with unknown functions that were differentially expressed during reprogramming (at FDRs of 5% and a more stringent 1%) to assess whether they clustered in the same modules as the more thoroughly annotated miRNAs or whether they formed new modules with unique expression patterns. Of the 221 miRNAs differentially expressed during reprogramming with an FDR of 1% (FDR1 dataset), and 325 miRNAs differentially expressed at an FDR of 5% (FDR5 dataset), 66% and 69%, respectively, are miRNAs that were previously unknown to be differentially expressed during reprogramming.</p><p>Interestingly, the addition of the large number of poorly annotated miRNAs to the network did not greatly alter the modular structure (Figure&#x000a0;

While transfection of miRNAs could potentially result in non-specific interactions that could cause a reduction in reprogramming efficiency, the different response of the three pools suggests that this is not the case here.

Among the observed expression patterns are sets of miRNAs that gradually increase or decrease across reprogramming and other patterns that show sharper, more transient spikes in expression. Constitutive miRNAs are rare. To reveal the details of these complex changes we have analyzed reprogramming intermediates with two statistical techniques - edgeR to detect differentially expressed miRNAs and community detection to identify putative co-regulatory modules. These statistical techniques applied to deep sequencing data provide unprecedented detail concerning stage by stage miRNA expression changes during reprogramming.</p><p>Sampling at each reprogramming transition simply delineates the constellation of miRNA changes across a bulk sample associated with achieving the next step in reprogramming, and not those changes sufficient to achieve pluripotency. The barrier across the initial MEF to Thy1- transition is not high, as indicated by the large number of cells that become Thy1- after OSKM (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). The barrier to each subsequent stage coincides with a reduced number of differentially expressed miRNAs, a larger fraction of which undergo large fold changes.</p><p>miRNAs from the imprinted <italic>Dlk1</italic>-<italic>Dio3</italic> region on chromosome 12qF1 dominated the miRNAs downregulated at this transition. In MEF reprogramming the long non-coding RNA <italic>Meg3</italic> (also known as <italic>Gtl2</italic>), which is expressed on the same imprinted maternal strand as the <italic>Dlk1</italic>-<italic>Dio3</italic> miRNAs, was also downregulated by the time reprogrammed MEFs became SSEA1+, but before the upregulation of pluripotency-associated <italic>Nanog</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Our data further localize the downregulation of the maternally expressed, non-coding RNAs at this locus to the MEF to Thy1- transition. While miRNAs at the <italic>Dlk1</italic>-<italic>Dio3</italic> locus underwent a broad downregulation (66 of 85 miRNAs) of modest fold change at the MEF to Thy1- transition, only five were upregulated at either of the later stage-to-stage transitions. Nevertheless, comparing the initial downregulated <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> miRNA levels to the levels of these miRNAs in Oct4-GFP+&#x02009;cells, a broader trend toward gradual re-expression was observed, with only 35 miRNAs still downregulated compared to their starting levels in MEFs.</p><p>Interestingly, a re-analysis of the microarray data in Polo <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] also suggested a decrease in expression of <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> region miRNAs during reprogramming of MEFs to iPSCs (Figure S3 in Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Polo <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] did not sample a Thy1- intermediate, and did not detect downregulation of <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> miRNAs in their samples. In our re-analysis, we could detect downregulation of the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> miRNAs when comparing our MEF and SSEA1+ samples (our first and third time points, comparable to Polo <italic>et al.</italic>&#x02019;s first and second time points), although it was not as strong across this wider interval. In our data between MEF and SSEA1+ stages, 58 of the 66 miRNAs downregulated at the MEF to Thy1- transition, as well as four additional <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> miRNAs, were significantly downregulated. Reanalysis of Polo <italic>et al</italic>.&#x02019;s data showed that 23 of 32 <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> miRNAs in their single replicate have a negative log<sub>2</sub> fold change in the transition from MEF to SSEA1+ (Figure S3B in Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>; compared to 100 of 220 non-<italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> miRNAs).</p><p>The pattern of abrupt downregulation and gradual upregulation was almost exclusively a feature of miRNAs in the <italic>Dlk1</italic>-<italic>Dio3</italic> cluster and readily observable in the analysis of co-regulatory modules (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This suggests one of two possibilities. First, that the majority of cells were downregulated at the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> locus during the MEF to Thy1- transition, but some maintained higher, MEF-level expression at this locus, leading to a net modest downregulation of these miRNAs. As reprogramming progressed, cells that downregulated <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> miRNAs were reprogrammed less efficiently and therefore made up a decreasing proportion of the total cells, thereby minimizing the role of the miRNA downregulation. Second, that nearly all cells in the ensemble population undergo a transient downregulation of <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> miRNAs early in reprogramming, with the expression of these miRNAs increasing as reprogramming progresses. This alternative is supported by overexpression of miRNA mimics from this locus. Some of these miRNAs decreased reprogramming efficiency. In particular, pool 1 mimics increased Thy1 expression, while decreasing the proportion of AP&#x02009;+&#x02009;and Oct4-GFP+&#x02009;cells, and therefore reduced reprogramming efficiency. No pool of miRNA mimics increased reprogramming efficiency. Although single cell analyses will likely reveal additional details, the downregulation of <italic>Dlk1</italic>-<italic>Dio3</italic> miRNAs at the earliest stage of reprogramming, particularly those in pool 1, appear to be beneficial for reprogramming efficiency, although not essential for reprogramming success (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>A possible function of <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> miRNAs that would increase reprogramming efficiency may be their role in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). A recent study
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] demonstrated that reprogramming efficiency in MEFs and several other cell types is improved by inducing EMT at the initial stage of reprogramming before MET occurs, via either TGF&#x003b2; or the sequential introduction of reprogramming factors. They suggest that since MEFs are usually not uniformly mesenchymal (as they are generally derived from day 13.5 embryos, as is the case here), an initial EMT serves to convert MEFs to a more consistently mesenchymal state before MET initiation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Seven <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> miRNAs target <italic>Twist1</italic> and other EMT-associated genes, and their downregulation has been shown to induce EMT
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Of these seven, six were downregulated at the MEF to Thy1- transition in our dataset. The seventh, which was not significantly downregulated, had low abundance. Interestingly, the <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> miRNAs miR-369-5p and -3p are able to reprogram MEFs when transfected with miR-200c-3p and miR-302a/b/c/d-3p, albeit at lower efficiency than OSKM
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Although the specific role of miR-369 has not been shown experimentally, it has been predicted to target the TGF&#x003b2; pathway, indicating it may contribute to reprogramming by promoting MET at the Thy1- to SSEA1+ transition
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. We speculate that early downregulation of these MET miRNAs may help induce an initial EMT at the MEF to Thy1- transition, as in Liu <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], though via a different mechanism.</p><p>miR-369-3p and two of the seven miRNAs recognized as affecting MET by Haga and Phinney
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], miR-543-3p and miR-494-3p, were in pool one of the miRNA mimics, whose overexpression resulted in a decrease in both AP+&#x02009;and Oct4-GFP+&#x02009;cells (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The overexpression of these mimics may, therefore, have reduced reprogramming efficiency by preventing an early EMT. Interestingly, pools 2 and 3 contained only one and zero, respectively, of the EMT-targeting miRNAs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and had less effect on reprogramming efficiency.</p><p>The patterns of miRNA expression described here are more complex than the 'two waves' described by Polo <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] using microarrays.

Buganim <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] investigated patterns of gene expression in single cells undergoing reprogramming and found variation in the order of gene expression among sister cells of initial colonies early in the process, but a clear sequence of gene expression once core stem cell circuitry was activated. These data led to Buganim <italic>et al.</italic>&#x02019;s
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] hypothesis that stochastic gene expression changes early in reprogramming are followed by a deterministic 'hierarchical' gene expression pattern responsible for the activation of the endogenous pluripotency circuitry. The sweeping small fold changes at the earliest stage of reprogramming may arise from heterogeneity within the population of cells or may represent sample-wide small fold changes. In either case, such phenomena are subject to greater stochastic behavior because noise in the system will have a greater proportional impact. Coinciding with the shift from a stochastic phase to a more hierarchical phase, the overall miRNA expression pattern shifts to larger magnitude changes among a smaller number of deterministic miRNAs as reprogramming progresses (Figure&#x000a0;

We identified key clusters of putatively co-regulated miRNAs, identifying patterns of coexpression during the reprogramming process. <italic>Dlk1-Dio3</italic> miRNAs were downregulated at the earliest stage of reprogramming, and functional experiments suggest this downregulation may improve reprogramming efficiency. While many miRNAs experienced small changes in expression at the earliest stages of reprogramming, only a few miRNAs experienced large changes in expression later in reprogramming, coinciding with the previously proposed shift from a stochastic to a hierarchical phase of reprogramming.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell isolation</title><p>We seeded 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> Oct4-GFP MEFs (derived from Jackson Lab stock number 008214) in 10-cm dishes and one day later transduced these with 10 ml 4 F virus supernatant (encoding Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc; see Additional file

<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Several partially programmed iPSCs (piPSC or pre-iPSCs) with similar morphology and proliferative capacity as embryonic stem cells were derived, but remained reliant on transgene expression, and were GFP-negative, indicating they had not yet initiated the endogenous embryonic stem cell self-renewal regulation network. Libraries were prepared from these fractions and deep sequenced (Additional file

Reads were mapped uniquely allowing 0 or 1 color space mismatch. miRNA 5p and 3p arms were considered separately, and multi-copy miRNAs with identical mature miRNA sequences in several genomic loci were collapsed into single miRNAs (for example, miR-9-1-5p, miR-9-2-5p and miR-9-3-5p were combined into miR-9-5p). The first replicate was prepared with the Small RNA Expression Kit (Applied Biosystems, part number 4399434), which yielded 14.9 to 17.4 million reads per sample. The second replicate used a more efficient library preparation (SOLiD Total RNA-Seq Kit, Applied Biosystems, part number 4445374), to increase the read number (24.4 to 29.5 million reads per sample). An average of 3.8 million reads (1.9 and 5.6 million in each replicate, respectively) matched known mouse miRNA precursors from miRBase and an additional average of 4.5 million (2.3 and 6.6 million reads in each replicate, respectively) matched exons, introns and intergenic regions in the mouse genome. Reads for all samples (MEFs, Thy1-, SSEA1+, Oct4-GFP+, iPSCs, mES cells, piPS4, piPS5, both replicates) were previously combined into a single bulk sample and analyzed for isomiRs and isomoRs

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] on the most variant top half (290) of miRNAs, using TMM-normalized data centered and scaled across each miRNA.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. edgeR was used to investigate (a) which miRNAs showed differential expression over the whole course of reprogramming (MEF&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Thy1-, MEF&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;SSEA1+, MEF&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Oct4-GFP+), and over each transition between consecutive stages (MEF&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Thy1-, Thy1-&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;SSEA1+, and SSEA1+&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Oct4-GFP+), and (b) which miRNAs were differentially expressed in the piPSC lines compared to MEFs, stem cells (Oct4-GFP+, iPSCs and mES cells) and/or intermediate reprogramming stages (Thy1-, SSEA1+). For edgeR analyses, data were filtered to remove all miRNAs with fewer than 4 cpm in at least one library in each replicate, and all comparisons utilized a Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple tests.
