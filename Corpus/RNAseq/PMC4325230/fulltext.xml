Using a coculture system containing human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived progenitors and endothelial cells, we found that endothelial cells play a stage-dependent role in pancreatic development, in which they maintain pancreatic progenitor (PP) self-renewal and impair further differentiation into hormone-expressing cells. The mechanistic studies suggest that the endothelial cells act through the secretion of EGFL7.

The animal studies suggested that endothelial cell niche provides both supportive and inductive roles throughout pancreas development (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Eberhard et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Early studies showed that signals from endothelial cells are essential for the induction of pancreatic organogenesis (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Lammert et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>). Endothelial cells specifically promote early dorsal pancreas development by inducing Ptf1a<sup>+</sup> pancreatic progenitors (PPs) by activating FGF10 signaling (<xref rid="bib16 bib6" ref-type="bibr">Yoshitomi and Zaret, 2004; Jacquemin et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, some groups recently reported that the endothelial cell niche could restrain epithelium branching and endocrine development. One group shows that blood vessel ablation results in increased pancreatic organ size (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Sand et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Another group showed that elimination of endothelial cells increases the size of pancreatic buds (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Magenheim et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, another group showed that overexpressing vascular endothelial growth factor A increases embryonic endothelial cell populations and perturbs pancreatic endocrine differentiation (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Cai et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). However, a complete understanding of the role of endothelial cells in human pancreatic development is still missing.</p><p>Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) provide an in&#x000a0;vitro platform to study human development. To better understand the signaling from the endothelial cell niche in pancreatic differentiation, we have developed a coculture system of endothelial cells with hESC-derived progenitors under serum-free, chemical-defined conditions. By using the coculture system, we found that endothelial cells maintain PP self-renewal and impair further differentiation into hormone-expressing cells by secreting EGFL7.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Endothelial Cells Promote the Proliferation of PDX1<sup>+</sup> Cells in the Chemically Defined Environment</title><p>To systematically probe the role of an endothelial cell niche in human pancreatic development, we set up a coculture system using endothelial cells and hESCs-derived progenitors. The coculture system is established in a chemically defined culture condition to mimic the serum-free environment during embryonic development. The endothelial cells used in this study were AKT-HUVECs (AKT-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells) (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Kobayashi et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>) or MPECs (mouse pancreas islet endothelial cells). BJ cells, which are human skin fibroblasts, were used as a control for cell-type specificity. To explore the stage-dependent effect of endothelial cells, HUES8 cells were differentiated into three different stages: definitive endoderm (DE), foregut endoderm (FE), or PP populations using a previously established strategy (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). The hESC-derived populations were cultured together with MPECs or AKT-HUVECs at different ratios and examined for their capacities to self-renew or differentiate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). The self-renewal ability was determined by immunostaining with antibodies against a proliferation marker (Ki67) and stage-dependent self-renewal markers, including SOX17 for DE, HNF4&#x003b1; for FE, and PDX1 for PPs. The differentiation ability was determined by immunostaining with antibodies against differentiation markers, including HNF4&#x003b1; for DE, PDX1 for FE, and insulin/glucagon/somatostatin for PPs.</p><p>In the coculture condition of MPECs or AKT-HUVECs with the hESCs-derived DE population, neither the number of SOX17<sup>+</sup>/Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells nor the number of HNF4&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> cells changed significantly (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>A available online), suggesting that endothelial cells do not affect either self-renewal or differentiation of DE. In the coculture condition with the hESC-derived FE population, the number of PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells was significantly increased in the presence of MPECs and AKT-HUVECs, but not BJ cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B). In addition, when the hESCs-derived PP population was cultured with MPECs and AKT-HUVECs, the number of PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells was significantly elevated as compared with BJ cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C). The results suggest that endothelial cells, not fibroblasts, promote the generation of PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells at the FE and PP stages.</p><p>Next, we asked whether the generation of PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells is due to cell proliferation, by examining the proliferation marker Ki67. In cocultures using the HUES8-derived PP population, the number of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells is significantly higher in the presence of MEPCs and AKT-HUVECs than control conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C). To further validate that endothelial cells promote PP proliferation, we generated a transgenic <italic>Pdx1</italic>-EGFP HUES8 cell line, which contains the mouse <italic>Pdx1</italic> promoter driving expression of EGFP. The <italic>Pdx1</italic>-EGFP HUES8 cell line was validated by flow cytometry. After 14&#x000a0;days of differentiation, about 45% of cells were EGFP<sup>+</sup>, most of which were positively stained by PDX1 antibody (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>B). <italic>Pdx1</italic>-EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells were sorted and cocultured with MPECs, AKT-HUVECs, or BJ cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>C). The result confirmed that endothelial cells can support the isolated PDX1<sup>+</sup> cell proliferation. Interestingly, when we cocultured the PP population with endothelial cells, we observed that the differentiation of PPs to hormone-expressing cells was impaired (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>D and S1E). In addition, endothelial cells show similar capacities to increase the number of PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells and PDX1<sup>+</sup>/Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells when cocultured with H1-derived PP population (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>F), suggesting that the effect of endothelial cells is not hESCs line dependent. These data together suggest that endothelial cells provide a niche to&#x000a0;maintain proliferation and impair differentiation of PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells toward hormone-expressing cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>PDX1<sup>+</sup> Cells after Coculture with Endothelial Cells Retain PP Signature Gene Expression</title><p>To determine the cellular identity of PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells after coculture with endothelial cells, cells were stained with other antibodies against progenitor markers. Immunocytochemistry suggested that most PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells grew in the presence of endothelial cells expressed PP markers, HNF6, SOX9, and FOXA2 and endocrine marker, NKX6.1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A). The quantified results suggest that the number of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/NKX6.1<sup>+</sup> cells, PDX1<sup>+</sup>/FOXA2<sup>+</sup> cells, PDX1<sup>+</sup>/HNF6<sup>+</sup> cells, and PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells were higher in the endothelial cell coculture conditions than in control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B).We further tested the mRNA expression of PP markers (<italic>FOXA2</italic>, <italic>HNF6</italic>, and <italic>SOX9</italic>) and endocrine progenitor markers (<italic>NKX6.1</italic>, <italic>NKX2.2</italic>, and <italic>NGN3</italic>) in the purified <italic>Pdx1</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) suggested that the expression of PP markers (<italic>FOXA2</italic>, <italic>HNF6</italic>, and <italic>SOX9</italic>; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>B, S2D, and S2E) and endocrine progenitor markers (<italic>NKX6.1</italic>; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>C) in sorted <italic>Pdx1</italic>-EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells was elevated in MPEC coculture condition, but the expression of endocrine progenitor markers (<italic>NGN3</italic> and <italic>NKX2.2</italic>; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S2</xref>F and S2G) did not significantly differ between BJ and MPEC coculture conditions (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>F, at day 4, p&#x000a0;= 0.1274 for none versus MPECs; p&#x000a0;= 0.8968 for BJ versus MPECs). It suggested that PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells after coculture with endothelial cells bias to endocrine fate, but have not expressed the endocrine progenitor markers yet. Next, we investigated whether the increased PP population under coculture conditions was due to cell proliferation by measuring the number of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/Ki67 cells that are also positive for other PP markers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C). When cocultured with MPECs and AKT-HUVECs, the number of proliferating PPs increased about 5-fold and 6- to 8-fold, respectively, compared with noncoculture conditions. Sometimes, the number of the proliferating PPs in the presence of BJ cells is lower than noncoculture condition. This might due to the high cell density in coculture condition, which might affect PP proliferation.</p><p>Transcriptome profiling provides a way to systematically compare gene expression in different cell populations. PPs before or after coculture with endothelial cells were profiled by RNA-seq. To purify the PDX1<sup>+</sup> PPs, EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells were sorted from the <italic>Pdx1</italic>-EGFP HUES8 cell-derived cells before or after coculture with MPECs or AKT-HUVECs. The global gene expression of PPs before and after coculture with endothelial cells showed very high similarity (R<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;= 0.9611 in the presence of AKT-HUVECs; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D left; and R<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;= 0.9378 in the presence of MPECs, <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>A). In addition, the global gene expression pattern of PPs expanded in the presence of either AKT-HUVECs or BJ cells showed high similarity (R<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;= 0.9692; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D, right). The data confirm that PPs maintain cellular identity after expansion by endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Endothelial Cells Maintain Human PP Self-Renewal by Secreting EGFL7</title><p>In the coculture system, endothelial cells might function through a secreted factor(s) or by direct cell-cell contact. To test these possibilities, HUES8 cell-derived PP populations were treated with conditioned medium (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Hebrok et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>) collected from MPECs (MPEC-CM) or from AKT-HUVECs (AKT-HUVEC-CM). CM retained similar, but slightly lower, activity compared with intact cells for promoting PP self-renewal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A). These data suggest that endothelial cells function, at least in part, through a secreted factor(s). We further analyzed the gene expression profiles of AKT-HUVECs, MPECs, and BJ cells to identify candidate secreted factors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S3</xref>A). Genes encoding secreted proteins, whose expression in endothelial cells is at least 30-fold higher than in the BJ cells, were selected for further analysis. Among the genes encoding secreted molecules (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>), we tested the abilities of recombinant proteins ANGPT2, EGFL7, CCL13, IL24, PLAU, DHH, and PDGFB to expand human PPs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C). Only EGFL7 was able to promote PP proliferation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>C&#x02013;3E). To determine whether EGFL7 was required for the endothelial cell effect, we used shRNA to knockdown EGFL7 expression in AKT-HUVECs. <italic>EGFL7</italic> mRNA expression level was decreased by about 63.5% in AKT-HUVECs infected with <italic>EGFL7</italic> shRNA lentivirus as compared with a scrambled control lentivirus (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>B). When cocultured with <italic>EGFL7</italic>-shRNA-treated AKT-HUVECs, hESC-derived PPs showed significantly lower proliferation activity as compared with those cocultured with untreated (p&#x000a0;= 0.0324) and scrambled-shRNA-treated AKT-HUVECs (p&#x000a0;= 0.0387; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>F and 3G). These results indicate that EGFL7 is both sufficient and necessary for endothelial cells to maintain PP self-renewal.</p><p>Since EGFL7 has been shown to modulate the NOTCH pathway (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Nichol et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>), we tested whether the NOTCH pathway is involved in endothelial cell-dependent PP expansion. HUES8-derived PP populations were treated with five different NOTCH inhibitors, including DAPT, XX, compound E, III-31-C, and Sulindac sulfide. None of them mimics EGFL7 effect to promote PP proliferation (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>C). In addition, qRT-PCR analysis showed that EGFL7 treatment did not alter the expression of NOTCH target genes, such as <italic>Hes-1</italic> and <italic>Hey-1</italic>, in <italic>Pdx1</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>D).</p><p>Recent studies suggested that EGFL7 might also activate EGF receptor pathway (<xref rid="bib10 bib15" ref-type="bibr">Luo et&#x000a0;al., 2014; Wu et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>).&#x000a0;Several experiments were performed to determine whether&#x000a0;EGF receptor is a downstream signal of EGFL7. Immunocytochemistry suggests that the EGF receptor is expressed in hESC-derived PDX1<sup>+</sup> PPs (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>E). In addition, microscale thermophoresis binding assay suggested that EGFL7 directly binds to the EGF receptor in&#x000a0;vitro (K<sub>d</sub>&#x000a0;= 384 &#x000b1; 76.5&#x000a0;nM; <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>F). Furthermore, we found that addition of an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (EGFRi) blocks the effect of endothelial cells and EGFL7 to expand PDX1<sup>+</sup> PPs (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>G). Finally, we found that&#x000a0;mRNA expression level for <italic>EGF</italic> is much lower in AKT-HUVECs (0.09 &#x000b1; 0.02) and MPECs (0.09 &#x000b1; 0.02) than BJ fibroblasts (0.6 &#x000b1; 0.1), as determined by RNaseq (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>H). Since endothelial cells, but not BJ fibroblasts, promote PPs self-renewal, this suggests that endothelial cells do not promote PP proliferation by secreting EGF. Together, these results indicate that endothelial cells promote PP self-renewal through the secretion of EGFL7 and through activation of the EGF receptor signaling pathway.</p><p>To determine whether EGFL7 treatment is capable of promoting PP proliferation in long-term cultures, we tested the expansion and differentiation capacity of PDX1<sup>+</sup> PPs to the endocrine lineage following the pulsed expansion with recombinant EGFL7. HUES8-derived PP populations were treated with EGFL7 for different periods of time. One set of samples was fixed and stained with PDX1 and Ki67 antibodies to determine cell proliferation rates. The other set of samples were further differentiated in the absence of EGFL7 for additional 7&#x000a0;days and stained with antibodies against endocrine markers to determine the differentiation potential. The percentage of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells increased during the first week of EGFL7 treatment (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>I). After 1&#x000a0;week, the percentage of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells started decreasing in all conditions no matter whether EGFL7 was present. However, the percentages of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells treated with EGFL7 are higher than those of under control condition at all time points (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>I). Consistent with the increase in cell proliferation, the percentage of insulin<sup>+</sup>, C-peptide<sup>+</sup>, and somatostatin<sup>+</sup> cells increased in PPs cultured under EGFL7 treatment and peaked at 1&#x000a0;week. The percentage of hormone-expressing cells under EGFL7-treated conditions is higher than that under control condition at all time points (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S3</xref>H&#x02013;S3L). Together, these results suggest that one week of EGFL7 treatment can expand PDX1<sup>+</sup> PPs in&#x000a0;vitro, resulting in significantly increased differentiation efficiency toward the endocrine cell lineages.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Endothelial Overexpression of Egfl7 In&#x000a0;Vivo Increases Proliferation of PPs</title><p>To determine the effect of EGFL7 on the PP cell population in&#x000a0;vivo, we analyzed pancreatic development in a transgenic mouse model, Tie2:Egfl7. In this strain, the <italic>Egfl7</italic> transgene is under the control of the endothelial-specific <italic>Tie2</italic> promoter, resulting in a 2- to 3-fold overexpression of EGFL7 (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Nichol et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committtee at Weill Cornell Medical College.

A CD31-positive capillary plexus surrounds the developing pancreatic bud in&#x000a0;vivo, demonstrating the proximity of endothelial cells and implicating them as a potential source of EGFL7 to signal to the PDX1<sup>+</sup> PP population (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>A). Quantification of the vascular coverage at E10.5 demonstrated no significant difference in blood vessel density surrounding the developing pancreatic bud between WT and TG mice (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>B, p&#x000a0;= 0.299).</p><p>At E9.5 and E10.5, the pancreatic buds of TG mice appear larger with less defined edges as compared with WT mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>B&#x02013;4F). To determine whether the larger pancreatic buds in the TG embryos resulted from increased proliferation of PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells, we performed EdU injections of pregnant E10.5 WT and TG mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>G and 4H). We analyzed the percentage of EdU<sup>+</sup> PP (PDX1<sup>+</sup>) cells in sections of pancreatic buds (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>I). The percentage of proliferating PPs (EdU<sup>+</sup>/PDX1<sup>+</sup>) in TG mice is significantly higher than WT mice (<sup>&#x02217;</sup>p&#x000a0;&#x0003c; 0.05; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>I).

Together, these data suggest that PP proliferation was stimulated by endothelial-specific overexpression of EGFL7 in&#x000a0;vivo.</p><p>In addition, WT E11.5 pancreatic buds were isolated from surrounding mesenchyme and cultured in&#x000a0;vitro in the presence or absence of recombinant mouse EGFL7 for 2&#x000a0;days. The explants were pulsed for 4&#x000a0;hr with BrdU prior to fixation. The percentage of proliferating PPs (BrdU<sup>+</sup>/PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells) out of the total number of PPs (PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells) was significantly increased in the presence of mouse recombinant EGFL7 (<sup>&#x02217;&#x02217;</sup>p&#x000a0;&#x0003c; 0.01, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>J and 4K).</p><p>To determine the effect of EGFL7 in&#x000a0;vivo on differentiation into hormonal-expressing cells, we analyzed the percentage of insulin<sup>+</sup> cells and PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells in E15.5 pancreatic buds (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>L). The percentage of insulin<sup>+</sup> cells over PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells in E15.5 pancreatic buds is significantly decreased in TG mice (<sup>&#x02217;</sup>p&#x000a0;&#x0003c; 0.05, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>M). Consistently, the ratio of insulin<sup>+</sup> area over E-cadherin<sup>+</sup> area in E15.5 TG pancreatic buds shows a trend toward decrease compared with WT controls (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S4</xref>G and S4I, p&#x000a0;= 0.396), although it does not reach significance. We also examined the total number of PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells and the percentages of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/NKX6.1<sup>+</sup> cells, PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells and PDX1<sup>+</sup>/NKX6.1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells in total PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells at E15.5. Consistent with our results for E9.5 and E10.5 embryos, the total number of PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells in E15.5 TG pancreatic buds is significantly higher than that of WT controls (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>H, <sup>&#x02217;&#x02217;&#x02217;</sup>p&#x000a0;&#x0003c; 0.001). The ratios of PDX1<sup>+</sup>/NKX6.1<sup>+</sup> cells (p&#x000a0;= 0.385), PDX1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells (p&#x000a0;= 0.200), and PDX1<sup>+</sup>/NKX6.1<sup>+</sup>/SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells (p&#x000a0;= 0.495) in PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells do not differ significantly between TG and WT pancreatic buds (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S4</xref>J and S4K). Importantly, less than 6% of total PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells coexpress NGN3 in both WT and TG pancreatic buds (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S4</xref>L and S4M, p&#x000a0;= 0.053), suggesting that these PPs have not yet fully committed to endocrine progenitors. Together, these data suggest that EGFL7 suppresses PP differentiation into pancreatic endocrine cells, which is consistent with our results using hESC-derived cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figures S1</xref>D and S1E).</p><p>To determine the effect of EGFL7 overexpression in adult beta cell function, we performed a glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) test and a glucose tolerance test (GTT) in 8-week-old male TG and WT mice. Strikingly, all four TG mice showed significantly less insulin secretion at both fasting and after glucose stimulation compared with WT controls (fasting, <sup>&#x02217;</sup>p&#x000a0;= 0.048; after glucose stimulation, <sup>&#x02217;</sup>p&#x000a0;= 0.027, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>N). Furthermore, the TG mice showed consistently impaired glucose tolerance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>O). The data suggest that adult TG mice have less functional beta cells than WT control mice.</p><p>Stepwise differentiation of hESCs provides a useful platform to study human development. Using a stepwise pancreatic differentiation system, we found that an endothelial cell niche plays a stage-dependent role in human pancreatic development, promoting PP self-renewal and impairing differentiation from PPs toward hormone-expressing cells. Our finding could explain the results from previous animal studies: removing endothelial cells before the PP stage blocks pancreatic development (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Lammert et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>), while forced hypervascularization at the PP stage negatively impacts the later endocrine differentiation (<xref rid="bib1 bib11 bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cai et&#x000a0;al., 2012; Magenheim et&#x000a0;al., 2011; Sand et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). During pancreatic development, the endothelium pattern changes dramatically over time; this might affect the local concentration of paracrine factors, such as EGFL7, which will contribute to the cell fate decision. On the other hand, a recent study proposed that the endothelial cell niche could stimulate PPs to differentiate into insulin-secreting cells (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Jaramillo and Banerjee, 2012</xref>). In contrast to our coculture conditions, in which MPECs and AKT-HUVECs survive well after 4&#x000a0;days of coculture (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>N), the rat microvascular endothelial cells in that study do not survive well in differentiation conditions and could not be detected after 6&#x000a0;days in culture (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Jaramillo and Banerjee, 2012</xref>). Although increased insulin expression was detected in the cocultures, we can speculate that the rat microvascular endothelial cells might provide a transient amplifying signal to expand PPs. If the endothelial cells start to die, the block on differentiation of PPs would be relieved. To test this hypothesis, we cultured hESC-derived PPs in endothelial cell CM for 4&#x000a0;days. The medium was then removed to induce spontaneous differentiation. Consistent with our&#x000a0;hypothesis, the hESC-derived cells treated with CM show better differentiation toward insulin-expressing cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>O).</p><p>EGFL7 is a secreted protein that acts as a chemoattractant for endothelial cells, binds to the extracellular matrix, and promotes endothelial cell adhesion (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Here, we identified the role of EGFL7 as the molecular handle involved in the crosstalk between endothelium and pancreatic epithelium, which play as a gatekeeper to maintain PP self-renewal. In this context, it is interesting to note that the developmental stage of pancreatic bud formation (E9.0&#x02013;E11.5) coincides with the peak in EGFL7 expression in the embryonic vasculature (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Fitch et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Our data also suggested that EGFL7 might function through EGF signaling pathway. Consistently, it has been shown that activation of EGF signaling facilitates the PDX1<sup>+</sup> cells expansion (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Although our data strongly support our conclusion that EGFL7 promotes PP proliferation, we cannot exclude the possibility that EGFL7 may also promote foregut epithelium differentiation. In addition, recombinant EGFL7 protein was less efficient for expansion of PDX1<sup>+</sup> progenitors compared with coculture with endothelial cells. To explain this discrepancy, we considered two possibilities. First, the recombinant EGFL7 protein may lack posttranslational modifications and might not be as functionally active as native EGFL7 secreted by endothelial cells. Second, we cannot exclude the possibility that endothelial cells secrete additional factors that boost the effect of EGFL7. Finally, since <italic>Egfl7</italic> transgene is overexpressed in all endothelia, we cannot fully rule out the possibility of systemic effects.</p><p>The pancreatic development is a highly dynamic process controlling by multiple pathways. Additional work is needed to unravel the dynamic interaction of pancreatic endoderm with endothelial and mesenchymal cell niches. A complete understanding of the underlying mechanism may lead to the development of more efficient strategies to differentiate hESCs/iPSCs into mature glucose-responding cells in&#x000a0;vitro.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec3"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>hESC Culture and Differentiation</title><p>HUES8 and H1 cells were routinely cultured on irradiated MEF feeders in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM)/F12 supplemented with 20% KnockOut Serum Replacement, 2&#x000a0;mM GlutaMAX, 1&#x000a0;mM nonessential amino acids, 1.1&#x000a0;mM &#x003b2;-merceptoethanol, 10&#x000a0;ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, and 50&#x000a0;ng/ml normacin.
