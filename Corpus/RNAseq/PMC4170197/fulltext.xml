Survivors possess an array of somatic and germline clinical characteristics. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an opportunity for insight into genetic requirements of the X chromosome linked to Turner syndrome. We derived iPSCs from Turner syndrome and control individuals and examined germ cell development as a function of X chromosome composition. We demonstrate that two X chromosomes are not necessary for reprogramming or maintenance of pluripotency and that there are minimal differences in gene expression, at the single cell level, linked to X chromosome aneuploidies. Formation of germ cells, as assessed <italic>in vivo</italic> through a murine xenotransplantation model, indicated that undifferentiated iPSCs, independent of X chromosome composition, are capable of forming germ-cell-like cells (GCLCs) <italic>in vivo.</italic> In combination with clinical data regarding infertility in women with X chromosome aneuploidies, results suggest that two intact X chromosomes are not required for human germ cell formation, qualitatively or quantitatively, but rather are likely to be required for maintenance of human germ cells to adulthood.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Turner syndrome occurs with complete or partial loss of the second sex chromosome (45,X) in 1&#x02013;2% of all female conceptions. In more than 90% of cases, pregnancies are not carried to term<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Diverse somatic characteristics are associated with surviving Turner syndrome females, including short stature and cardiovascular abnormalities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In addition, most Turner syndrome females are also infertile, establishing a link between the X chromosome and germ line formation and/or maintenance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Only the lack of a second sex chromosome results in infertility as females with an additional X chromosome (Triple X syndrome) have normal fertility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>Females have two X chromosomes, one active and one inactive in somatic cells. However, large regions of the silenced X chromosome, including the pseudoautosomal regions (PAR) and loci scattered across the chromosome, escape X chromosome inactivation (XCI)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Thus, loss of one X chromosome in Turner syndrome females is hypothesized to lead to haploinsufficiency of genes that escape XCI, which may be required in two copies for normal development, including formation and/or maintenance of germ cells. For example, haploinsufficiency of <italic>SHOX</italic>, located in PAR1, is known to contribute to the short stature of Turner syndrome females<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Reproductive phenotypes of a murine model of Turner syndrome have been examined, and although XO mice are fertile, they have approximately half the number of oocytes as XX mice postnatally and a shortened reproductive lifespan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The species-specific difference in severity of germ cell defects has been linked to the ability of the single X chromosome in XO mouse germ cells to form non-homologous associations with an autosome or itself, while human XO germ cells are more likely lost early in meiosis before pairing has started<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Another hypothesis for the species differences may be linked to the fact that 15% of genes escape XCI in humans, in comparison to only a few in mouse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Indeed, the majority of Turner syndrome females are infertile with greatly impaired germ cell development.</p><p>The differences in fertility phenotypes between mouse and human, and the inaccessibility and difficulty of obtaining human germ cells during fetal development, suggested a need for alternative genetic tools to probe the genetic requirements of the X chromosome in human germ cell development. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a source of patient-specific stem cells that can be used to study germ cell development <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Studies using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) have revealed key transcription factors for germ cell specification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Furthermore, the overexpression of these transcription factors can direct primed epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs), but not mESCs, to functional primordial germ cell (PGC)-like cells that contribute to spermatogenesis and offspring<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In other studies <italic>in vitro</italic>-derived germ cell-like cells were matured within the gonadal environment to provide evidence for germ line contribution through production of offspring<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>In the last two decades, methods of germ cell transplantation and xenotransplantation have been developed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Murine seminiferous tubules can maintain autologous spermatogonial stem cells as well as those from different species, including humans; this suggests that many factors necessary to support and maintain proliferation and differentiation of human spermatogonial stem cells are conserved among species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. However, the fate of germ cells following xenotransplantation depends on evolutionary distance such that meiotic initiation and progression is not observed in transplanted spermatogonial stem cells if there is a large evolutionary distance between donor and host<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The duct and seminiferous tubule system of the male murine testis has been demonstrated to offer a permissive somatic environment for xenotransplantation of human male pluripotent stem cells from various genotypes to form germ-cell-like cells (GCLCs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The ovarian stroma does not offer a similar advantage for study due to inability to sequester the pluripotent stem cells within the germ cell niche resulting in teratoma production. Because of this limitation, and given that male pluripotent cells produced early GCLCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, we investigated the ability of normal female and X aneuploid pluripotent stem cells to form early GCLCs within the murine seminiferous tubules.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reprogramming of fibroblasts from Turner syndrome and control females</title><p>We obtained fibroblasts from a 30-year-old female (Control with normal fertility) and a 32-year-old female with premature ovarian failure (POF) as well as four Turner syndrome female fibroblast lines &#x02014; TSN from a 1-day-old, TSF from an 18-week-old, TSC1 from a 3.5-year-old and TSC2 from an 8-year-old (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) analysis confirmed the presence of two X chromosomes in the Control and POF fibroblasts, whereas all Turner fibroblast lines had only one X chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In addition to SKY, we used a whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to examine the X chromosome at a higher resolution. Array analysis demonstrated that Control fibroblasts had biallelic X-linked SNPs, while Turner fibroblasts had monoallelic SNPs from the single X chromosome, except for TSC1, which had biallelic SNP expression from the centric portion (p11.1 &#x02013; q13.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p>We reprogrammed fibroblasts through either retroviral transduction with four transcription factors separately (<italic>OCT4, SOX2, KLF4</italic> and <italic>CMYC)</italic> or lentiviral transduction of the STEMCCA cassette carrying all reprogramming factors in a polycistronic vector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Fig. S1A</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.

In one case, with TSC1 fibroblasts, reprogramming required addition of valproic acid (VPA). VPA is a histone deacetylase that was previously shown to increase the efficiency of reprogramming primary human fibroblasts to iPSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. We confirmed that all iPSC lines and subclones demonstrated the same karyotype as the original fibroblast lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Fig. S1B</xref>). Moreover, all iPSC subclones expressed the cell surface pluripotency markers, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81 and SSEA4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and the nuclear pluripotency marker OCT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Fig. S1C</xref>). We also demonstrated the formation of the three germ layers after embryoid body spontaneous differentiation, showing that cells formed endoderm (&#x003b1;-fetoprotein), mesoderm (Smooth Muscle Actin) and ectoderm (&#x003b2;III Tubulin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Fig. S1D</xref>).

We examined whether genes that escape XCI are expressed at a lower level in Turner syndrome iPSCs relative to H9 (46,XX) human embryonic stem cells (hESCs); for this purpose, we analyzed single cells of all iPSC subclones, including a Triple X iPSC line with an additional X chromosome.</p><p>To measure gene expression in single cells, we sorted hESCs and iPSCs for single cells positive for SSEA4 and TRA-1-60, two antigens that characterize pluripotent stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The percentage of double-positive cells ranged from 73.5&#x02013;97%, and all single cells were sorted from a &#x0003e;95% pure double-positive population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Fig. S2A</xref>). We first assessed pluripotency gene expression in subclones of all iPSCs and compared them to H9 hESCs. We identified a few subclones with a significant difference in expression of multiple pluripotency genes (p-value &#x0003c; 0.01); however, this was not consistent across all subclones of an iPSC line or across more than two pluripotency genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Additionally, we identified low or no expression of common germ layer genes, except for <italic>KDR,</italic> a common mesodermal associated gene; however, <italic>KDR</italic> was also highly expressed in H9 hESCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Fig. S2B</xref>). We also identified single cells positive for germ cell related genes including <italic>CKIT</italic> and <italic>GDF3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Fig. S2C</xref>).

We confirmed this finding by analyzing Histone H3 Lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), which also marks the inactive X chromosome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Fig. S3B</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.

We then analyzed all iPSC subclones and Control and POF fibroblasts for <italic>XIST</italic> expression at a single cell resolution. Control and POF fibroblasts had expression of <italic>XIST</italic> in 100% of single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>) whereas single pluripotent cells from a male (XY) iPSC line did not demonstrate any <italic>XIST</italic> expression as expected. H9 hESC, subclones from Control and POF iPSCs demonstrated mosaic expression of <italic>XIST.</italic> However, Triple X iPSCs expressed high levels of <italic>XIST</italic> in 100% of single cells. The majority of subclones from all Turner syndrome iPSC lines did not express <italic>XIST</italic>, however each line did have few cells that did express low levels of <italic>XIST</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>).

Because of the mosaicism of <italic>XIST</italic> in female XX pluripotent cell lines, we focused our attention on genes that escape XCI, and are likely not to be influenced by the presence or absence of <italic>XIST.</italic></p><p>Next, we examined X-linked genes for differences in expression in subclones of all Turner syndrome iPSC lines by analyzing nine genes found within PAR1 and one within PAR2. First, most genes within the PAR regions had low expression within single cells, with Log<sub>2</sub>Ex expression values (fold change above background) ranging from 1.10 to 9.24, or were undetectable in many single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Both subclones of TSC1 iPSCs, in addition to TSC2 iPSC subclone 2, and TSF iPSC subclone 9 had significantly lower expression of <italic>CD99</italic> (p-value &#x0003c; 0.01), but not all Turner syndrome iPSC subclones had lower expression of <italic>CD99</italic> than H9 hESCs. Six other PAR genes had subclones with significant differences in Log<sub>2</sub>Ex values compared to H9 hESCs (p-value &#x0003c;0.01), but this was not seen amongst multiple subclones of one iPSC line.</p><p>We also analyzed genes that are found throughout the X chromosome but have demonstrated escape from XCI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. We first observed that the Log<sub>2</sub>Ex values from this set of X-linked genes was higher than those found within PAR regions, with an average Log<sub>2</sub>Ex value of 4.90 to 16.99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Again, we found individual clones that did have significant differences (p-value &#x0003c;0.01) in Log<sub>2</sub>Ex values for 11 of the 12 escape XCI genes in comparison to H9 hESCs. However, only TSC2 iPSCs had both subclones with significantly lower expression (p-value &#x0003c; 0.01) than H9 hESCs when analyzed for <italic>ZFX</italic> transcript. One clone from TSC1, TSF and TSN iPSCs also had lower expression of <italic>ZFX</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>). We identified significantly higher expression of <italic>PRKX</italic>, <italic>NLGN4X, USP9X</italic> and <italic>RBMX</italic> within Triple X iPSCs relative to to H9 hESCs. Overall, single cell expression analysis revealed subclonal variations in PAR and escape XCI X-linked genes in TSC iPSCs in comparison to H9 hESCs. However, none of the genes analyzed demonstrated reduced expression levels across all subclones of the four TSC iPSC lines, indicating X-linked expression levels were independent of X chromosome number.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Single cell analysis of <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of control and X chromosome aneuploid pluripotent cells with BMP4/8 and retinoic acid</title><p>To compare <italic>in vitro</italic> PGC differentiation across genotypes, we used a VASA:GFP reporter, which has previously been used to isolate primordial germ cells from both female and male hESCs and iPSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, to identify single GFP+ cells daily throughout a seven-day germ cell differentiation with BMP4/8 and retinoic acid (RA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Fig. S4A</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.

We analyzed the expression of a panel of 15 germ cell-related genes within single cells throughout the seven-day directed differentiation of H9 hESC, Control, TSC1 and Triple X iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>).

Although the differentiated Control lines clustered separately from the other differentiated populations, this result was not based on chromosomal composition, as H9 GFP+ and GFP- populations clustered closely with TSC1 and Triple X differentiated populations. In agreement with single cell analysis of pluripotent cells, we saw minimal differences in gene expression levels between H9 hESC, Control, TSC1 and Triple X iPSCs regardless of the position on the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). After directed differentiation, there were minimal expression differences for genes located along the length of the X chromosome between all lines analyzed, independent of X chromosome composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p><p>To verify single cell results, we examined RNA-Seq data for some germ cell-related genes probed using qRT-PCR.

We assessed the possibility of using this xenotransplantation assay as an experimental system to test the ability of X chromosome aneuploid and female pluripotent stem cells to form early GCLCs <italic>in vivo.</italic></p><p>A total of six female pluripotent stem cell lines &#x02014; H9 hESC, Control (subclone 7 and 8), TSC1 (subclone 1 and 2) and Triple X iPSCs &#x02014; were transplanted into the seminiferous tubules of recipient testes (52 in total) of immunodeficient nude mice whose endogenous spermatogonial stem cell population has been disrupted by busulfan treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Fig. S6A</xref>). The recipient mice were sacrificed eight-weeks post-transplantation, and testis were weighed, and fixed for serial sectioning for further analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Table S4</xref>). The weight of testis xenografts at the time of harvesting and analysis of H&#x00026;E staining of testis cross sections indicated that all pluripotent lines produced at least one sample with teratoma-like proliferation outside of the seminiferous tubules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Fig. 6B and C</xref>). Teratoma formation was most marked in TSC1 subclone 2 injected testis, with four out of six testis weighing above 150&#x02005;mg and structures indicating teratoma formation in serial sectioned testis stained with H&#x00026;E (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Fig. B and C</xref>). However, reinjection of TSC1 subclone 2 (4246L &#x00026; R, 4247L &#x00026; R and 4248L &#x00026; R) and TSC1 subclone 1 did not produce teratoma-like structures, suggesting that teratoma formation was not specific to the patient from which the cells were derived and could be due to the particular injection. As teratoma-like proliferation occurred outside the seminiferous tubules, these results emphasize the importance of the somatic environment upon pluripotent stem cell differentiation and cells that expand inside the seminiferous tubules and rupture the tubule receive signals to form teratoma-like structures rather than GCLCs.</p><p>Next, we used immunostaining to further examine serial sections from injected mouse testis for human donor cells. To detect human cells, we used the human-specific antibody, NUMA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. NUMA staining was detected in all cells within a cross-section of a 20-week human fetal testis; in contrast, NUMA antibodies had no reactivity in cells from the un-injected mouse testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig 5B</xref>). Male XY iPSC injected testis cross sections contained GCLCs as previously described that are readily identified as NUMA positive<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> with cytoplasmic expression of VASA, a germ cell specific marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). We observed cells with similar morphology and positive staining for both NUMA and VASA proteins in the seminiferous tubules of testis that were injected with H9 hESC and Control iPSC as well as iPSCs with X chromosome aneuploidies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Thus, the xenotransplantation assay results demonstrated that H9 hESCs, Control, TSC1 and Triple X iPSCs all form GCLCs within mouse seminiferous tubules. We observed that the female pluripotent stem cell lines showed varying potential to form NUMA/VASA positive cells within the seminiferous tubules after xenotransplantation. All H9 hESC (4/4) and Triple X iPSCs (5/5) xenotransplants analyzed contained NUMA/VASA positive cells. Nine out of 15 testis with Control iPSCs contained double positive cells (60%) and TSC1 iPSCs had 12 out of 18 (66.7%) testis containing NUMA/VASA positive cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Fig. S7A and S7B</xref>). To further quantify our immunohistochemistry analysis across genotypes, we first counted the number of tubules that contained NUMA+/VASA+ cells to determine the percentage of total tubules that had early GCLC formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Fig. S7C</xref>). We observed a wide range of in the percentage of tubules with NUMA+/VASA+ cells, ranging from 2.59% up to 44.95% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Table S4</xref>). No significant difference was observed amongst any of the xenotransplanted pluripotent stem cell lines, even when control female and X aneuploid pluripotent lines were compared to male hESC and iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Next, we counted the number of NUMA+/VASA+ cells within a positive tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplemental Fig. S7D</xref>). Only two transplants, H9 hESC and Triple X iPSCs, showed a significant difference (p-value = 0.017) in the number of NUMA+/VASA+ cells per positive tubule. Results indicate that the formation and specification of GCLCs within the <italic>in vivo</italic> xenotransplantation model are independent of sex chromosome number.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Human germ cells express STELLA, DAZL and the methylation mark H3K27me3</title><p>We extended our analysis of sections from H9 hESC, Control, TSC1 and Triple X iPSC xenotransplants to additional germ cell-related genes.

All xenotransplant results were compared to cross-sections of a 20-week old human fetal testis and un-injected mouse testis section. Human fetal testis, which typically contain gonocytes and undifferentiated spermatogonia, contained cells positive for OCT4, CKIT and H3K27me3 proteins within the seminiferous tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A&#x02013;E</xref>). Uninjected mouse testis contained cells positive for DAZL and H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B&#x02013;E</xref>).</p><p>We found no evidence for human-derived cells that expressed OCT4 in any of the transplanted testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>), indicating that the cells observed post-xenotransplantation are not simply hESCs or iPSCs. We identified few NUMA+ cells that were also DAZL+ for each line transplanted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D</xref>). In contrast, all NUMA+ cells within the xenotransplants were also STELLA+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6E</xref>). Because of this finding, we used STELLA is a marker of human-derived cells within xenotransplants and co-stained with cKIT and observed that STELLA+ cells were not CKIT+. Lastly, we analyzed STELLA+ human-derived cells within the xenotransplants for presence of H3K27me3 and found that all human derived cells were positive for H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6G</xref>). Taken together, results indicate that human cells that engrafted within the seminiferous tubules of recipient mouse testis expressed VASA, STELLA and H3K27me3, with only a small subset expressing DAZL; these results were consistent across all genotypes further indicating that the human GCLCs are likely at a gonocyte stage of development. Results demonstrate that the formation of GCLCs is independent of X chromosome composition, as Turner and Triple X iPSCs formed GCLCs comparably to Control pluripotent cells.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To develop a model for Turner syndrome, we generated four Turner syndrome iPSC lines in addition to a POF and Control female iPSC line. We observed that all iPSC lines, independent of genotype, were capable of differentiating <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> into cell types representative of all three germ layers and the germ cell lineage. This demonstrates that two X chromosomes are not necessary for reprogramming or formation of somatic and germ cell lineages and is in agreement with a previous study that demonstrated that Turner Syndrome iPSCs differentiated into specific lineages indistinguishably from those produced from hESC and control iPSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Moreover, our results indicate that the expression of <italic>XIST</italic> RNA is mosaic even within a single subclone. Only a small group of escape-XCI X-linked genes were expressed more highly in Triple X iPSCs (<italic>PRKX, NLGN4X, USP9X</italic> and <italic>RBMX</italic>), but there were few differences in X-linked gene expression at the single cell level compared to the control and X chromosome aneuploidy iPSCs to female H9 XX hESCs.</p><p>Investigations of germ cell differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> indicated that the greatest similarity of cells, to germ cells, was observed on Day 0 (undifferentiated) indicative of inefficient differentiation. Thus, we used murine xenotransplantation to further examine germ cell development. Previous studies in the mouse used epiblast-like cells to explore formation of germ cells, also relying upon transplantation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Thus, it is clear that transplantation of cells with germ cell differentiation potential into the correct somatic environment is able to promote germ cell development. Because multiple germ cell-related genes, especially <italic>PRDM14</italic>, are expressed in control female and X chromosome aneuploidy iPSCs prior to differentiation, we hypothesized that xenotransplantation of these cells into murine seminiferous tubules would enable germ cell development <italic>in vivo</italic>. Xenotransplantation was previously demonstrated to promote formation of GCLCs from male iPSCs including iPSCs derived from azoospermic men<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>; similarly, there is evidence that mouse PGCs have the potential to develop and progress through spermatogenesis or oogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Nonetheless, while mouse XX germ cells can enter spermatogenesis, they do not progress through meiosis, indicating the necessity of Y-specific transcription for further spermatocyte maturation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>.</p><p>When XX human female pluripotent cells were transplanted into murine testes, the seminiferous tubules provided an environment to promote GCLC differentiation as anticipated. In addition, we also demonstrate formation of germ cells from Turner syndrome and Triple X iPSCs. Human-derived GCLCs migrate to the basement membrane within the seminiferous tubules and express the germ cell markers <italic>VASA, STELLA</italic> and <italic>DAZL</italic> and maintain the H3K27me3 mark suggesting the <italic>in vivo</italic> differentiated GCLCs are early in development and likely gonocytes. In addition Control female and Turner syndrome pluripotent stem cell transplants were quantitatively similar in terms of NUMA+/VASA+ tubules and NUMA+/VASA+ cells per positive tubules. Only Triple X xenotransplants contained fewer NUMA+/VASA+ cells per positive tubule when compared to H9 hESCs. These results indicate that the loss of an X chromosome does not affect germ cell formation, but suggest that an additional X chromosome may lead to decreased early GCLC formation within the seminiferous tubule environment which normally promotes XY germ cell formation.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic> derivation of GCLCs from patient-specific iPSCs opens the door to further studies on genetic mechanisms underlying female infertility. Human Control or X aneuploid derived GCLCs can be isolated for further use in single cell studies of X-linked gene expression. Indeed, here our single cell studies focused on genes that escape XCI. However, there are two stages of development where both X chromosomes are active -- in the cleavage stages of preimplantation embryo development and in female primordial germ cells. If Turner syndrome females are able to produce germ cells to the stage of X chromosome reactivation, then it is possible that haploinsufficiency of genes found throughout the entirety of the X chromosome may lead to germ cell loss. If similar xenotransplantation studies are to be accomplished with ovarian stroma, alternative methods are required to limit the dispersion of pluripotent cells while maintaining signals from the ovarian stroma. Previous studies have used aggregation of pluripotent cells with fetal or neonatal ovarian somatic cells prior to transplanting them under the mouse ovarian bursa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Future studies with aggregation may allow examination of differences in later stages of development, on a female somatic background.</p><p>Overall, we demonstrate that undifferentiated iPSCs have expression of multiple germ cell associated genes, and upon directed <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation, this expression is lost and most cells are pushed to a somatic fate. Via xenotransplantation, we demonstrate that all pluripotent lines were capable of forming GCLCs, independent of X chromosome composition. These results indicate that infertility in Turner syndrome females is unlikely to be linked to defects in formation of germ cells in Turner syndrome women, but rather is likely to be linked to defective maintenance and/or further differentiation of germ cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Retroviral and lentiviral production, transduction and iPSC generation</title><p>Retroviral and lentiviral production was conducted as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>.
