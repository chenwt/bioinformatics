In recent years, stem cell technology has provided an <italic>in vitro</italic> tool to recapitulate human development, permitting also the generation of human models for many diseases. The correct differentiation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) into specific cell types should be evaluated by comparison with specific cells/tissue profiles from the equivalent adult <italic>in vivo</italic> organ. Here, we define by a quantitative high-throughput gene expression analysis the subset of specific genes of the whole ganglionic eminence (WGE) and adult human striatum. Our results demonstrate that not only the number of specific genes is crucial but also their relative expression levels between brain areas. We next used these gene profiles to characterize the differentiation of hPSCs. Our findings demonstrate a temporal progression of gene expression during striatal differentiation of hPSCs from a WGE toward an adult striatum identity. Present results establish a gene expression profile to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the telencephalic hPSC-derived progenitors eventually used for transplantation and mature striatal neurons for disease modeling and drug-screening.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The study of human neurodevelopment is essential to understand the physiological function in both normal brain development and during disease processes. The important discovery that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be generated from human somatic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> allows the study human development and modeling of human diseases <italic>in vitro</italic> using iPSCs derived from patients and healthy individuals. However, the challenge is to efficiently and correctly differentiate human iPSCs to the desired cell type or types. Many human stem cell differentiation protocols are based on mouse developmental data despite the various differences that exist between mouse and human development. The ideal method to differentiate iPSCs would be to specifically recapitulate human development <italic>in vitro</italic> by activating, inhibiting, and tuning specific biochemical pathways in the correct temporal manner. In addition, many human fetal studies do not analyze and/or compare the levels of expression with the adulthood, missing critical information about the relative expression levels.</p><p>Gene expression profiling during human development is crucial for defining stage-related changes for specific anatomical regions, and these data could subsequently be applied to <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation protocols. In the last decade, many transcriptomic approaches have been used to analyze gene expression in the human brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> While these techniques produce large amounts of data, they do not provide quantitative gene expression information and the results that are obtained require validation. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is the gold standard for producing quantitative and validated gene expression data.</p><p>For neurodegenerative diseases, differentiation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) into neural cells should be evaluated by comparison with specific profiles from the equivalent <italic>in vivo</italic> nervous system area. For example, the generation of hPSC-derived medium spiny neurons (MSNs) to study Huntington&#x02019;s disease is on the state of the art. In fact several efforts have been made to generate human PSC-derived MSNs with varying degrees of success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7">4&#x02013;7</xref></sup> However, while some papers compare to the fetal gene expression profiles of the whole ganglionic eminence (WGE; the striatal primordium),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> none of them compare to the adult caudate-putamen profile. Therefore, it is necessary to further characterize the WGE human development and its relative levels with the adult caudate-putamen in order to efficiently and correctly differentiates human iPSCs to MSNs.</p><p>In the present work, we focus on the generation of quantitative genetic profiles in human fetal and adult brain by low-cost high-throughput qRT-PCR. We identified specific genes and their expression levels that allow determining the developmental stage of the hPSC-derived striatal cells. Our results provide a detailed dataset of genes involved in striatal development that can be used to assess the quality and efficiency of current and future protocols that differentiate hPSCs to striatal neurons, thereby improving and refining MSN differentiation protocols for cell transplantation, disease modeling, and drug-screening.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>A selected gene set distinguishes human subpallial derivatives from fetal pallium and adult motor cortex during development</title><p>We defined a panel of 106 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) that are known from the literature to be involved in mammalian brain development, with an enrichment for genes implicated in subpallial specification. Expression of this gene set in dissected human brain samples was quantitatively analyzed using OpenArray nanoscale real-time PCR technology. Samples included WGE and cortex dissected from fetal tissues (between 49 and 63 pcd) as well as adult caudate, putamen, and motor cortex (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob1">Supplementary Figure S1a</xref> for complete details of tissue sources and specimens).</p><p>Unbiased hierarchical clustering of gene expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) from the 106 genes grouped human samples according to their developmental stage. Subclusters A, B, and C identified the adult samples with subcluster B containing the adult motor cortex samples and subcluster C containing all the striatal samples. Interestingly, the caudate and putamen samples clustered together and a gene-by-gene analysis did not identify any statistical differences between them. This indicates that our gene set does not distinguish between these two nuclei of the adult striatum. For this reason, the samples from both regions were combined and referred to as striatum. Subcluster A clustered outside of the main group analysis indicating a distinct gene expression pattern. Since this subcluster was mainly composed of samples dissected from the same brain (both cortical and striatal tissues), this suggests a donor-related issue, inaccurate dissection, or poor postmortem preservation. However, we could not exclude these samples from our whole gene set analysis on a statistical basis, since they were not identified as biological group outliers by the multivariate Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test. Gene expression differences between striatum and cortex are clearly evidenced on the heat map.</p><p>The fetal samples were clustered into two subclusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, groups D and E). Subcluster D contained all the WGE samples and subcluster E contained the fetal cortical samples. Again, gene expression differences between WGE and cortical primordia are clearly shown in the heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p>Having determined that our customized gene expression assay can identify different human brain samples as distinct biological groups, we were then interested in identifying those genes that specifically characterized each biological group. To identify groups of genes that are specifically associated with each sample cluster, we performed a k-means analysis on the gene expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This approach generated three clusters for the fetal samples (clusters 2, 4, and 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">b</xref>). Clusters 2 (27 genes) and 5 (9 genes) contained genes that are expressed in both fetal cortex and WGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Cluster 4 (14 genes) contained those genes that result specific for WGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p>K-means genes clustering of adult cortical and striatal samples produced four clusters (clusters 1, 3, 6, and 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">c</xref>). Cluster 1 contained nine genes (<italic>CDX2, FOXA2, GATA4, HOXB9, NANOG, NKX6-2, PAX2, PDX1, and TLX1</italic>) that were expressed in cluster A samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), with these samples showing unexpected higher expression of certain genes that was not present in the other tissue donors. Clusters 3 (13 genes) and 7 (3 genes) contained genes that are commonly expressed in the adult motor cortex, putamen, and caudate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), while Cluster 6 contained 12 genes that are highly expressed in caudate and putamen, identifying adult striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p><p>Thus using these approaches, we have demonstrated that our quantitative gene expression assay can generate subsets of genes that identify brain subregions at specific developmental stages.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative expression of a discrete number of genes distinguishes WGE from fetal cortex</title><p>After rostral-caudal patterning <italic>in vivo</italic>, progenitor cells must commit to a dorsal or ventral fate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Similarly, stem cells differentiating toward striatal neurons must be directed to a subpallial (ventral telencephalon) fate following telencephalic commitment for the subsequent specification to MSNs. With this in mind, it is important to determine the gene expression signature that distinguishes human fetal cortex from WGE. We compared the gene expression profiles that we obtained from the fetal cortex and WGE samples (7&#x02013;9 postconception weeks (p.c.w.)) with their total gene expression signatures being represented by a spike graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) to facilitate the visual comparison with the 106 genes being grouped according to biological relevance (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of the fetal cortex and WGE gene expression data revealed opposing gene expression signatures between the two areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The WGE was characterized by high expression of the early neural gene <italic>SIX3</italic> and genes involved in lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE), medial ganglionic eminence, and caudal ganglionic eminence specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, groups F, G, I, and J), while the fetal cortex showed increased expression of <italic>OTX1</italic> and <italic>DACH1</italic> and pallial markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, groups D and E). Furthermore, expression of calretinin (<italic>CALB2</italic>) and <italic>PENK</italic> was also observed in fetal cortex.</p><p>A set of 19 statistically significant differentially expressed genes distinguished WGE from fetal cortex. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> shows the mRNA expression levels of the 14 genes that were upregulated (red bars) and the 5 that were downregulated (green bars) in WGE compared to fetal cortex.

While the fetal cortex was best identified by two out of the five genes that were downregulated in WGE compared to fetal cortex, namely <italic>TBR1</italic> and <italic>SLC17A7</italic> (<italic>P</italic> value of 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). To define the best list of WGE predictor genes, we selected those genes that were upregulated in the WGE compared to the fetal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">c</xref>) that were also present in the specific WGE cluster obtained by k-means clustering analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; cluster 4). This selection process identified seven genes (<italic>DLX1</italic>, <italic>DLX5</italic>, <italic>DLX6</italic>, <italic>EBF1</italic>, <italic>LHX6</italic>, <italic>NKX2-1,</italic> and <italic>SIX3</italic>), and to ensure that these genes were developmentally specific for WGE, we determined if they were also significantly downregulated in adult striatum. Hence, we compared these seven shortlisted genes with those genes significantly downregulated in the adult striatum compared to the WGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">c</xref>). This analysis produced a list of gene gene markers for WGE that showed a decrease in gene expression in adult striatum compared to the WGE (<italic>SIX3</italic> 10.5-fold decrease, <italic>LHX6</italic> 11.3-fold decrease, <italic>DLX1</italic> 11.0-fold decrease, <italic>DLX5</italic> 12.7-fold decrease, <italic>DLX6</italic> 2.8-fold decrease, and <italic>EBF1</italic> 12.9-fold decrease). Finally, to establish the statistical significance and the relative quantitative mRNA expression levels of our WGE marker genes among pallial and subpallial derivatives, we performed a gene-by-gene one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) between WGE, fetal cortex, and adult tissues (striatum and motor cortex) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Using this approach we have validated six genes whose expression together can be used to identify WGE at this developmental stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of a specific gene set to quantitatively distinguish human WGE from adult striatal nuclei</title><p>Having identified the critical genes that distinguish human WGE from fetal cortex, next, we characterized the specific quantitative gene expression profile during human striatal development. We studied how the expression of our gene set varied in adult human striatum compared to WGE in order to identify mature striatal gene markers and to observe how these markers change their expression relative to WGE.</p><p>An overview of the gene expression data revealed a clear shift of expression from early WGE genes toward mature striatal markers in adult striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). A change in neuronal markers&#x02019; expression was observed between the two stages. Doublecortin (<italic>DCX</italic>), &#x003b2;-III-tubulin (<italic>TUBB3</italic>), and N-cadherin (<italic>CDH2</italic>) were expressed at high levels in the WGE but were downregulated in the striatum, while NeuN (<italic>RBFOX3</italic>) displayed the opposite behavior with its expression positively correlating with tissue maturity (group N, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Glial marker gene expression (<italic>S100B</italic> and <italic>GFAP</italic>, group O, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) was higher in adult tissue than in the WGE, indicating the multicellular complexity that is established in the brain parenchyma.</p><p>Thirty-seven statistically significant differentially expressed genes defined a quantitative gene expression profile for the adult striatum compared to the WGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Eighteen of these genes were more highly expressed in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, red bars) with 12 of them (<italic>ADORA2A, ARPP21, CHRM4, DRD1, DRD2, CALB1, GPR6, GRP88, PENK, PPP1R1B, TAC1,</italic> and <italic>TH</italic>) being considered from the literature to be specific for striatal neurons (MSNs and interneurons). Furthermore, four oligodendrocyte-associated genes (<italic>S100B, CNP, NKX6-2,</italic> and <italic>OLIG1</italic>) were also significantly upregulated in the striatum. The final two genes that were more highly expressed in the striatum (<italic>RBFOX3</italic> and <italic>RARG</italic>) are associated with the general maturation of brain parenchyma as also shown by the Human Brain Transcriptome project (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hbatlas.org">www.hbatlas.org</ext-link>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup></p><p>The remaining 19 statistically significant differentially expressed genes were downregulated in the adult human striatum compared to the WGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, green bars). Early neural genes (<italic>SOX2, MSI1, OTX2,</italic> and <italic>SIX3</italic>), <italic>MASH1</italic> (also known as <italic>ASCL1</italic>) and ganglionic eminence-related genes (<italic>MEIS2, BCL11B, EBF1, LHX6, NR2F2</italic>) were expressed at higher levels in the WGE than in the striatum as were the early neuronal markers <italic>CDH2</italic>, <italic>DCX</italic>, and <italic>TUBB3</italic>. Notably, while the expression of all <italic>DLX</italic> family members (<italic>DLX1, 2, 5,</italic> and <italic>6</italic>) was downregulated compared to striatal nuclei, each family member was downregulated to a different extent. The pallial marker <italic>TBR1</italic> is hardly detectable in adult striatum, while retinoic acid receptor A (<italic>RARA</italic>) expression decreases as development progresses as described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup></p><p>Upregulated genes represented 48.6% of all differentially expressed genes but their average fold change of gene expression was 28.4 compared to an average fold change of 14.7 for the downregulated genes. In addition, the upregulated genes in the adult striatum showed a higher statistical significance (0 &#x02264; <italic>P</italic> value &#x02264; 0.02) than the downregulated genes (0 &#x02264; <italic>P</italic> value &#x02264; 0.04). The expression analysis indicated that the most reliable predictor genes (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) for striatal maturation were two genes of the G protein-coupled transmembrane receptors family, <italic>GPR6</italic> and <italic>GPR88</italic>, and the adenosine receptor <italic>ADORA2A</italic>. Other reliable but less statistically significant predictors for mature striatum were the upregulation of <italic>PPP1R1B, PENK, DRD1, CALB1, DRD2</italic>, and <italic>TAC1</italic> (<italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c; 0.01), and the downregulation of <italic>BCL11B</italic>, <italic>MSI1, LHX6, DLX5, DLX1, EBF1, NR2F2</italic>, and <italic>DLX2</italic> (<italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c; 0.01). Volcano scatter plot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>) confirmed the importance of this specific set of striatal upregulated genes as well as the downregulation of subpallium- and WGE-related genes in order to distinguish between these two developmental stages. Thus, we have defined a quantitative gene expression profile for the developmental transition from WGE to adult striatum, which enhances our understanding of the human striatal differentiation process.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative gene expression signature of human striatal development</title><p>Having used quantitative gene expression to define marker gene sets that distinguish between two coexisting developmental areas and two striatal developmental stages, we next identified the marker genes that can be used to recognize fully mature striatal neurons.</p><p>To achieve this, we first considered those genes that were differentially expressed between the WGE and the adult striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">c</xref>), and then from this gene set, we excluded those genes that were also expressed in the adult cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) or have a glial-related function. The genes with increased striatal expression that were identified using this method were only considered as genuine upregulated striatal marker genes if they were also present in the adult striatum cluster that was generated in the unbiased k-means clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">b</xref>; cluster 6). This filtering process identified six upregulated striatal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>; <italic>ADORA2A, CALB1, DRD1, DRD2, PENK,</italic> and <italic>TAC1</italic>). The downregulated striatal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) were the six genes (<italic>DLX1, DLX5, DLX6, EBF1, LHX6, and SIX3</italic>) that we previously identified as WGE specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) and downregulated in adult striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">c</xref>).</p><p>Further to the up- and downregulated striatal markers, we identified two genes (<italic>GAD2</italic> and <italic>OPRM1</italic>) that are expressed at similar levels in the WGE and striatum (<italic>i.e.</italic>, not present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) and they were defined as constant markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

To confirm these results at the protein level, we analyzed CTIP2 protein by western blot in human fetal and adult striatal samples. We observed that although CTIP2 protein was expressed in the oldest of the fetal WGE samples (pcd 61 and 63), no protein was detected in any of the adult striatal samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>).

We differentiated human PSC lines using a previously published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> and extracted RNA at 0, 4, 8, 16, 23, and 28 days <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) to quantify the expression levels of our panel of 106 selected genes using the same high-throughput quantitative PCR method that we used to evaluate gene expression during striatal and cortical development.

Overall, the 16 DIV to 28 DIV samples clustered closer to the WGE group than the striatum group indicating that at these differentiation stages, the samples were more similar to the WGE. However, an interesting time-dependent clustering pattern was observed. The 16 DIV samples (DLX1-positive neural progenitors&#x02014;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>) clustered closer to the WGE than did the 23 DIV samples (&#x003b2;-III tubulin-positive neurons&#x02014;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). The 28 DIV samples were the most peripheral of this subcluster and the closest to the adult striatal sample cluster.

At 23 DIV, practically all cells expressed &#x003b2;-III tubulin and showed a neuronal morphology.

Furthermore, stem cell-derived tissues and differentiated cells have great potential in drug discovery and cell therapy for the treatment of a range of neurological disorders. However, the possibility of modeling specific human diseases <italic>in vitro</italic> or the generation of cells suitable for transplantation relies on the efficacy and efficiency of the differentiation protocols used. It is generally agreed that it is necessary to recapitulate <italic>in vitro</italic> the critical <italic>in vivo</italic> developmental stages of the cell type of interest to produce a robust differentiation protocol. Thus, it is necessary to develop tools to compare the gene expression profiles of cells derived by <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation with the equivalent target tissues derived from normal human developmental samples. The differentiation of stem cells to MSNs is important to model system for many diseases that affect the basal ganglia, most notably Huntington&#x02019;s disease. With this in mind, the characterization of human striatal development is fundamental for understanding <italic>in vivo</italic> MSN specification for its subsequent recapitulation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here we have determined the gene expression profile of a defined set of developmentally regulated genes in fetal and adult human striatal tissue by qRT-PCR. We demonstrate that the expression of this set of genes can be used to discriminate different developmental stages, and that the levels of expression of these genes are also relevant to the temporal maturation of the region. Subsequently we show that these tissue-specific gene expression signatures can be used to evaluate a protocol that differentiates PSCs to striatal neurons.</p><p>To establish a qRT-PCR array for use with OpenArray technology,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> we selected 106 genes relevant to neural induction and telencephalic and subpallial lineage specification and differentiation. Use of this gene array was then first validated from the perspective of human development. We analyzed human fetal WGE and adult striatal samples to establish quantitative gene expression signatures of specified neural progenitors and mature neurons. Unbiased hierarchical clustering revealed that this set of genes did indeed distinguish between areas (WGE and cortical primordia) and developmental stages (fetal and adult). Our findings indicate that our gene set is sufficiently stringent to distinguish between pallial and subpallial derivatives. We used a qRT-PCR based analysis method; therefore, we could establish gene expression signatures based not only on whether or not certain genes were expressed but also on the size and statistical significance of changes in expression of individual genes in different tissues and at different developmental stages. Furthermore, as we simultaneously analyzed the quantitative expression of 106 genes, we can also consider the overall gene expression profile as part of the signature.</p><p>Relatively few transcriptomic studies of human forebrain and more specifically striatal development are currently available, which highlights the importance of comparing our results with previous published data. We compared our developmental quantitative gene expression data with microarray data present in the Human Brain Atlas (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hbatlas.org">www.hbatlas.org</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> and similar gene expression profiles were observed in both data sets (see <italic>CTIP2</italic> below as an example). The genes that we identified as highly specific markers for adult striatal neurons are also conserved during primate evolution as shown by transcriptomic analysis of adult human, chimpanzee, and macaque telencephalon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> This reinforces the accuracy of the adult striatal gene expression signature that we generated.</p><p>Multiple levels of analysis has allowed us to identify a gene expression signature, which consists of the following four classes of genes: (i) WGE genes, which show higher expression in the WGE than in the striatum (<italic>DLX1, DLX5, DLX6, EBF1, LHX6,</italic> and <italic>SIX3</italic>); (ii) striatal genes, which show higher expression in the adult striatum than in the WGE (<italic>ADORA2A, CALB1, DRD1</italic>, <italic>DRD2, PENK,</italic> and <italic>TAC1</italic>); (iii) constitutively expressing genes, that do not change their expression levels between WGE and adult striatum (<italic>GAD2</italic> and <italic>OPRM1</italic>); and (iv) low expression genes, that are expressed at much lower levels in the adult striatum compared to the other tissues tested (<italic>TBR1, TLX1, SLC17A6,</italic> and <italic>HOXB4</italic>).</p><p>The WGE gene cluster identifies genes that are highly expressed in the 7&#x02013;9 p.c.w.

(<bold>a</bold>) Developmental scheme for the 106 genes selected for quantitative gene expression analysis in human adult and fetal forebrain pallial and subpallial derivatives. Panel shows the selected gene set as markers during mammalian central nervous system (CNS) development. Genes to monitor pluripotency and to determine germ layer identity are represented outside of the Cartesian diagram. Inside the diagram, the genes are grouped into colored boxes. The x-axis represents the Rostro-Caudal axis of human brain development. According to these criteria, the genes are located depending mainly on their expression during CNS development. Early neural genes are shown on the left side of the diagram. Below the diagram general neuronal and glial gene markers are indicated. Subpallial genes are over-represented in this gene set since we focus on striatal development. (<bold>b</bold>) Hierarchical clustering with complete linkage clustering groups the samples into five clusters. Subcluster A (red) contains a mix of adult cortical and caudate-putamen nuclei samples, suggesting technical bias (see text for details). Subcluster B (yellow) corresponds to adult cortical samples. Subcluster C (green) contains solely adult striatal samples. Subclusters D (light blue) and E (dark blue) contain all of the fetal samples with D containing the whole ganglionic eminence (WGE) samples and E containing the cortical tissue samples.

(<bold>a</bold>) Differentiation phases from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Stem cell differentiation protocols translate <italic>in vivo</italic> development into an <italic>in vitro</italic> system. PSC-derived neurons are obtained via a three-step protocol. The first step is neuroectodermal induction (neuralization) that generates neural progenitors. The second step confers rostro-caudal and dorso-ventral patterning occurs and the final step involves the neurogenesis and differentiation of neuronal subtypes. This is a representation of how this three-step process mimics subpallial and then striatal development to generate MSNs. (<bold>b</bold>) Unbiased hierarchical clustering of differentiated hPSCs with human whole ganglionic eminence (WGE) and adult striatum. We isolated RNA from differentiating human PSCs at six time points (shown in panel <bold>a</bold>) to analyze the progress of the differentiation protocol by high-throughput quantitative real-time PCR. We compared the gene expression profile of differentiated hPSCs (H9 and hiPSC) to human WGE and adult striatal tissue in order to establish the spatio-temporal gene expression pattern of iPSC-derived neural progenitors and neurons.

At 8DIV, a neuroepithelial morphology was observed with the cells organizing in rosettes, expressing nuclear marker PLZF and displaying polarized ZO1 distribution. At 16 DIV, subpallial progenitors expressed DLX1 and give rise to &#x003b2;-III tubulin positive neurons at 23 DIV.
