But the increasing use of silica nanoparticles (SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs) in many different industrial fields has prompted the careful investigation of their toxicity in biological systems. In this report, we describe the effects elicited by SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs on animal and cell physiology. Stable and monodisperse amorphous silica nanoparticles, 25&#x02009;nM in diameter, were administered to living <italic>Hydra vulgaris</italic> (Cnidaria). The dose-related effects were defined by morphological and behavioral assays. The results revealed an all-or-nothing lethal toxicity with a rather high threshold (35&#x02009;nM NPs) and a LT50 of 38&#x02009;h. At sub lethal doses, the morphophysiological effects included: animal morphology alterations, paralysis of the gastric region, disorganization and depletion of tentacle specialized cells, increase of apoptotic and collapsed cells, and reduction of the epithelial cell proliferation rate. Transcriptome analysis (RNAseq) revealed 45 differentially expressed genes, mostly involved in stress response and cuticle renovation. Our results show that <italic>Hydra</italic> reacts to SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs, is able to rebalance the animal homeostasis up to a relatively high doses of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs, and that the physiological modifications are transduced to gene expression modulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>amorphous silica nanoparticles</kwd><kwd><italic>Hydra</italic></kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix homeostasis</kwd><kwd>GSH response</kwd><kwd>RNAseq</kwd><kwd>nanotoxicity</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="40"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="8440"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Silicon is an abundant element in the earth&#x02019;s crust and biota. Starting from the prehistoric flints, humans have used materials containing natural silicon and its compound to build artifacts. Today, silica-based components are present in every digital devices that enhance the modern human activities. In the near future, nano-biotechnological approaches will deliver many nanoscale smart sensors and drugs to solve biomedical issues and there is a great expectation on silica-based nanostructures. Amorphous silica can be of natural origin (Diatoms) or synthetic (silica-gel, colloidal). Aggregates of amorphous silica of micrometer size have been used for years in oral and dermatological formulations, medicines, food, and cosmetics; hence, new nanomaterials containing SiO<sub>2</sub> are considered low toxic and moderately biocompatible. However, the fast growing knowledge in the nanoscience fields has confirmed that, at nano-dimension, materials can acquire new features (Napierska et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). This is true also for the amorphous silica: in fact, if nanoparticle aggregates ranging from a few micrometers up to millimeter are rather irritant but non-toxic, on the other hand, SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs) show a dose-related toxicity in <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments (Napierska et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In water, SiO<sub>2</sub> surface exhibits silanol groups (Si&#x02013;O&#x02013;H). At nanoscale, the high density of silanol groups on SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs form several siloxane framework architectures making SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs extremely reactive and prone to be modified by environmental factors. These architectures are combinations of closed siloxane rings, along with the spatial arrangement, pattern, and degree of hydrogen bonding that terminate the siloxane rings at the silica NP surface; in addition, some scientists have also hypothesized surface-associated radicals inducing ROS species (Gazzano et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, many new synthetic routes to produce amorphous silica stabilized nanoparticles have been developed and a few publications describe that even the synthetic procedure can influence their effects on cells (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and living systems, therefore, the assessment of the structure&#x02013;activity relationships for amorphous silica is problematic. While crystalline silica is structurally well-defined, amorphous silica lack long-range order, and, due to a flat energy landscape, their structures are strongly dependent on synthetic procedures. Therefore, it is necessary to associate to each synthetic procedure an exhaustive description of the effects produced in living organisms: (i) to explain the mechanism of action of new materials, (ii) to open new ways on novel material application potentialities, (iii) to create a database of material/living-systems interactions.</p><p>The aim of this study is to investigate the possible toxicity of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs at animal level. Malvindi et al. (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) synthesized, through the microemulsion methodology, stable and monodisperse silica nanoparticles, and accurately characterized their physico/chemical properties. Through an <italic>in vitro</italic> approach, they described (within the picomolar&#x02013;nanomolar range) the cellular uptake and the absence of toxic effects. Here, we describe the effects of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs, synthesized following the same procedure, on a small model organism, the coelenterate <italic>Hydra vulgaris</italic>.</p><p><italic>Hydra</italic> is a freshwater invertebrate; organized in two epithelia (ectoderm, endoderm) whose cells originate from three cell lineages that differentiate in more than 15 types of specialized cells (armed, secretory, digestive, nervous, myoepithelial) (Hobmayer et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>). Cell type composition follows defined proportions and can be analyzed by macerating the animals in fixed cell suspensions (David, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1973</xref>). <italic>Hydra</italic> anatomy can be summarized as a hollow tube with a tentacles crown. As for many other animals, <italic>Hydra</italic> is covered by a cuticle, an extracellular matrix secreted by ectodermal cells that forms the distal interface with the environment. It has been shown that <italic>Hydra</italic> cuticle proteins from the PPOD and SWT families are associated with chondroitin and chondroitin 6-sulfate (Bottger et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The behavior of <italic>Hydra</italic> is well characterized; the gastric region expands and contracts spontaneously with a defined pace (Ruggieri et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). <italic>Hydra</italic> undertakes active feeding, and this behavior that can be mimicked by Glutathione (GSH) (Lenhoff, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1961</xref>; Westfall and Kinnamon, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>). These two peculiar aspects of <italic>Hydra</italic> biology are considered in this work in the context of interaction with new nanomaterials; traditionally used in developmental, regenerative, and evolutionary research contexts (Galliot et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bode, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) <italic>Hydra</italic> is actually a good biological indicator for environmental studies (Karntanut and Pascoe, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). In addition, stress response genes are conserved and at least in part characterized (Martinez and Bridge, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In previous works, we have successfully exploited the potential of <italic>Hydra</italic> to describe the mechanisms of action underlying the interaction of nanoparticles with living organisms and the animal toxicity of new materials establishing reliable methods to evaluate at multiple levels their toxic effect (Tortiglione et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Malvindi et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Ambrosone et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ambrosone and Tortiglione, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Marchesano et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we determined a wide array of toxicity endpoints caused by SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs, spanning from behavior, morphology, population growth rate, cell proliferation/apoptosis balance up to gene expression profiling. <italic>Hydra</italic> transcriptomic changes further suggested that even in absence of severe alterations, treatment with SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs causes effects that can be transduced to the nucleus and influence gene expression to ultimately modify principal cell functions such as cuticle renovation and response to stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Synthesis of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs in a ternary w/o microemulsion (25&#x02009;nm)</title><p>SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs were prepared by following recently optimized synthesis procedure (Malvindi et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).

The ultrasonic treatment was used to completely disperse the SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs before the treatments. The surface of the nanoparticles was modified with amine groups using 5% (v/v) solution of aminopropyltrietoxysilane (APTES, Sigma Aldrich) and 1&#x02009;mM acetic acid (99.7%, Sigma Aldrich) and stirring for 60&#x02009;min.

A well annotated <italic>Hydra</italic> transcriptome, which has recently been deposited at the ENA under the project number PRJEB445 and with accession numbers from HAAC01000001&#x02013;HAAC01045269 (Wenger and Galliot, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) was used as reference to calculate transcript coverage. Specifically, the coverage of each transcript (i.e., the number of reads mapped to it) was computed using BEDtools software. Counting the number of aligned reads per transcript per sample was performed BEDTools &#x0201c;multicov&#x0201d; tool with the &#x02212;D flag, thus enabling counting of reads that were mapped to more than one transcript with the same primary alignment score. Raw read counts and normalized counts were extracted from files using the multicov option of BEDtools (Quinlan and Hall, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The count data produced from mapped reads were then processed with the DESeq R package (Anders and Huber, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), which tests for differential expression based on the negative binomial distribution while normalizing the raw counts to account for variable library sizes. Differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified through comparison of a SiO<sub>2</sub>NP-treated sample to an untreated control as reference group. Comparisons were kept at a significance level cut-off of &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 adjusted to match a 20% false discovery rate using the Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg procedure. An additional minimum threshold of fold change of two was also used. A consensus list of DE genes was generated from the latter. The Blast2GO software suite (Gotz et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) was then used to predict transcript function and assign Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Ashburner et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Gene Ontology, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) for significantly up and down regulated transcripts without annotation.

The feeding behavior starts with the prey capture by cnidocytes-armed tentacles followed by mouth opening and insertion of the prey-loaded tentacle into the mouth (Movie M1 in Supplementary Material). This multistep behavior can be mimicked by the tripeptide GSH. Within the 1&#x02013;10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M range, <italic>Hydra</italic> undergoes the GSH-response: during first step (10&#x02009;s), a characteristic tentacles-writhing toward the central vertical axis of the animal takes place, followed by the second step when the tentacles bend toward the mouth culminating in mouth opening (30&#x02009;s) (Movie M3 in Supplementary Material) (Lenhoff, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1961</xref>; Pierobon et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Tortiglione et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Treated <italic>Hydra</italic> (25&#x02009;nM, 24&#x02009;h) were challenged either with food (swimming <italic>Artemia salina nauplii</italic>) or GSH. In the presence of living <italic>nauplii</italic>, polyps thought paralyzed at gastric region and presenting the inverted-cone morphology, were still able to capture the prey; nevertheless, tentacles could not bend and mouth opening was prevented (Movie M2 in Supplementary Material). Similarly, the GSH response was impaired showing a slow tentacle-writhing activity, tentacle rigidity, and inhibition of mouth opening (Movie M4 in Supplementary Material). These results besides showing the feeding behavior impairment, revealed through the untangling of the prey capture from mouth opening that, as previously suggested by <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments (Thurm et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), the nematocysts discharge (the ability to catch the prey) is not sufficient to induce mouth opening. In addition, here we show that the ability of gastric region to contract must have a role in the accomplishment of feeding behavior. Since battery cell complexes are considered as the cellular correlates to food recognition, we analyzed the morphology of these cells in treated polyps by toluidine-blue staining and visualization of their nematocytes content and spatial distribution.</p><p>In normal <italic>Hydra</italic>, Toluidine-blue contrast highlights transversal punctuated stripes around the tentacles (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A,D), treated animals (inverted-cone stage corresponding to score 5) revealed a severe depletion of nematocytes, and a disorganization of the battery cells throughout the tentacles see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B,E.

Here, we translated the study of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs effects on an animal model analyzing the effects from 10&#x02009;nM onward: a range reasonably higher in respect to <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments due to the required mode of NP administration, i.e., in addition to the animal culture medium. Dose response experiments indicated low toxicity up to 10&#x02009;nM SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs; additionally, optical microscopy observation and ICP, indicated the ability of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs to be internalized by ectodermal cells. Taken together, these results confirm the data produced <italic>in vitro</italic> (Malvindi et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). On the other hand, in the same experimental conditions (10&#x02009;nM SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs), although in the absence of morphophysiological traits of toxicity, an increase in the apoptotic cell number and an impairment of the ability to regenerate amputated body region was observed. Nowak et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), in a recent paper, described as the internalization of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs may activate survival mechanisms in cultured cells and how this reaction was mediated by augmented autophagy and not by apoptosis. These results suggest, for accurate toxicological investigations, that SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs can elicit effects even at sub lethal doses. Above 10&#x02009;nM SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs, we observed worsening morphophysiological traits. Previous works, to measure the impact of toxicants on <italic>Hydra</italic>, used a score key based on progressive morphological alteration of animal anatomy that was employed to test water pollution, estrogens, and metal contamination (Wilby and Tesh, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Ambrosone et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Taking into account the new morphophysiological traits produced by SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs on <italic>Hydra</italic>, here we defined a new score key. The scores formed the raw data to obtain median values and LT50 and consequently delineate the lethal and sub-lethal incubation and concentration ranges. Through this analysis, we defined two frames of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs toxicity in <italic>Hydra</italic>. At intermediate concentration (25&#x02009;nM), sub lethal reversible effects were recorded as anatomical changes, impairment of feeding behavior, alterations of specialized cell morphology and organization, and global gene expression modulation. We set the inverted-cone (similar to a party hat) morphology as symptom of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs sub-lethal toxicity. Remarkably, this condition resulted independent from the incubation time suggesting a low bioaccumulation of amorphous silica nanoparticles in <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments as described by other groups in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (Gazzano et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). At higher concentration (35&#x02009;nM) and after prolonged exposure (44&#x02009;h), we observed irreversible effects and lethality. Interestingly, the sub-lethal toxicity traits do not show a linear correlation with the amount of internalized SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs. The discrepancy between morphophysiological effects and limited amount of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs in <italic>Hydra</italic> tissues can be explained assuming that the nanoparticles interact with outer animal surface. Recent evidences report that the SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs <italic>in vitro</italic> toxicity is mediated by adsorption of nanoparticles to extracellular components as serum proteins (Napierska et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). It has been demonstrated that the enormous nanoparticles surface area and their concentration of silanol groups enhance the binding of large quantities of proteins and other biomolecules (Izak-Nau et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Here we suggest that, this interaction in the case of <italic>Hydra</italic>, takes place with the external cuticle, a thick multilayered extracellular matrix that selectively protect <italic>Hydra</italic> tissues from external agents. The subtraction of cuticle components by SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs, triggers the impairment of the homeostasis of <italic>Hydra</italic>/environment interface producing the inverted-cone condition described into results, this alters the equilibrium with external environment and influences basic functions as, for example, the effectiveness of feeding behavior and the hydrostatic pressure that mediate the spontaneous <italic>Hydra</italic> gastric region contractions. Nonetheless, the rather long LT50 could mean that, for about 38&#x02009;h of continuous exposure to 35&#x02009;nM SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs, <italic>Hydra</italic> can renew the cuticle components replenishing the cuticle components necessary to prevent the direct access of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs to ectodermal epithelial cells. Anyway, prolonged exposition to high SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs concentration (44&#x02009;h, SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs above 35&#x02009;nM), acts irreversibly on <italic>Hydra</italic> tissue with extensive cell lysis and subsequent reduction of polyps size and irregular shape. Finally, as already described in cell culture experiments (Costantini et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and paralleling the effects at the base of the hemolysis activity (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), once extinguished the homeostatic potential of extracellular matrix machine, the direct contact of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs with ectodermal epithelial cells, induces the rupture of the plasma membrane resulting in massive cell loss and animal death.</p><p>Notwithstanding the widespread use of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs in cosmetics, medicine, and foods, a few experimental data are available to date on the effects of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs on gene expression modulation (Nowak et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We were interested to find at what extent the observed reversible effects elicited by SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs in <italic>Hydra</italic> had an echo on global gene expression levels. Transcriptome analysis showed a moderate effect of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs treatment on gene expression confirming the overall low toxicity of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs. Remarkably, among the genes whose expression was modulated by SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs treatment, we found out the <italic>ppod</italic> gene encoding the <italic>Hydra</italic> protein PPOD a well-known cuticle component (Bottger et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Both RNAseq and qRT-PCR showed that the <italic>ppod</italic> gene transcript level decreases after SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs treatment. This secreted protein, shows hemagglutination activity and is supposed to be involved in organizing the cuticle glycosaminoglycans. This is a first evidence of <italic>ppod</italic> gene expression modulation in response to an external stimulus, and suggests a molecular counterpart of the observed morphophysiological modifications. Further studies will also clarify the mechanism underlying the down regulation of the ppod gene transcript as, for example, a putative negative feedback to the stress induced by SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs treatment. Since the transcriptome analysis was carried out after 24&#x02009;h of treatments, the gene expression modulation can be considered a hallmark of early response to the toxic stimulus that form a first example of genes involved in dynamic regulation of <italic>Hydra</italic> with the aquatic environments in mild toxic condition (Nowak et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). To verify the robustness of RNAseq results, we further validated the expression level changes of the <italic>HSP20</italic> and <italic>ascorbate peroxidase-like</italic>. These genes with other DE genes as, for example, the <italic>guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-2-like1</italic> and <italic>lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein-2-like</italic> genes are connected with cellular response to chemical stimuli, toxicants, and apoptosis, reinforcing the hypotheses of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs-induced cellular stress. Finally, in our RNA-seq analysis, a sizeable number of genes remain unknown, providing a valid source of functional information to be further investigated. Future experiments and data analysis will be necessary to place these genes in functional pathways as molecular correlates of the morphophysiological traits reported in this work.</p><p>Our results describe new biological impacts from nanoscale materials and the data provide useful evidences for the development of novel atlas for the prediction of effects of nanomaterial interaction with living organisms. These results suggest the necessity to screen multiple experimental models and to apply a wide range of tests to better describe the toxicity endpoints of any new nanomaterial.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S6"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>The Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fbioe.2014.00037/abstract">http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fbioe.2014.00037/abstract</uri></p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><media xlink:href="Video1.MOV"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM2"><media xlink:href="Video2.MOV"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM3"><media xlink:href="Video3.MOV"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM4"><media xlink:href="Video4.MOV"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM5"><media xlink:href="Data_Sheet1.DOCX"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Mario Guarracino for helpful suggestions and Giuseppe Marino for technical support.
