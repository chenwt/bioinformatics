Such fusion proteins, including ETV6-RUNX1 and TCF3-PBX1, and those involving PAX5, KMT2A (MLL) and tyrosine kinases such as BCR-ABL1, are typically acquired early in leukaemogenesis and drive tumour formation by perturbing cellular pathways including haematopoietic development, tumour suppression, kinase signalling and chromatin remodelling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Identification of these rearrangements is important in the management of ALL, as several are associated with treatment outcome and/or may serve as therapeutic targets.</p><p>The prevalence of recurring rearrangements varies significantly according to age and in part explains the inferior outcome of ALL in older individuals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. For example, rearrangements associated with favourable outcome such as <italic>ETV6-RUNX1</italic> are frequent in younger children compared with older children, whereas <italic>BCR-ABL1</italic> and rearrangements involving <italic>CRLF2</italic> and tyrosine kinases observed in Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) ALL are more common with increasing age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. However, the genetic basis of up to 30&#x00025; of ALL cases is unknown.</p><p>To identify chromosomal rearrangements in B-ALL cases lacking a known recurring sentinel alteration, we performed transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing (RNAseq)) of 560 cases and recurrence testing in a cohort of 1,164 cases. We identified multiple new targets of rearrangement, with rearrangements of <italic>MEF2D</italic> and <italic>ZNF384</italic> defining subtypes with distinct transcriptional signatures. In total, a group of 42 cases are discovered with <italic>MEF2D</italic> rearranged to <italic>BCL9</italic>, <italic>CSF1R</italic>, <italic>DAZAP1</italic> (DAZ (deleted in azoospermia)-associated protein 1), <italic>HNRNPUL1</italic> (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U-like 1), <italic>SS18</italic> (synovial sarcoma translocation, chromosome 18) or <italic>FOXJ2</italic> (Forkhead Box J2). These rearrangements dysregulate expression of <italic>MEF2D</italic> target genes and, by increasing expression of <italic>HDAC9</italic>, create a vulnerability to targeting with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>RNAseq identifies <italic>MEF2D</italic> fusions in a novel B-ALL subgroup</title><p>The 560 cases examined by RNAseq enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group (COG) trials included AALL0232 (<italic>N</italic>=216), AALL0331 (<italic>N</italic>=65), AALL0932 (<italic>N</italic>=61), AALL1131 (<italic>N</italic>=92), P9906 (<italic>N</italic>=1) and adults (age of diagnosis &#x02265;18, <italic>N</italic>=122) or children (age of diagnosis &#x0003c;18, <italic>N</italic>=3) with B-ALL enroled on various non-COG protocols (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>).</p><p>This analysis identified multiple new recurring targets of rearrangement, including <italic>MEF2D</italic>, <italic>NUTM1</italic> and <italic>ZNF384</italic>, and new partners of rearrangement with known genes such as <italic>PAX5</italic> and <italic>IGH</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>).

Thus, each fusion partner stabilizes and augments MEF2D transcriptional activation.
