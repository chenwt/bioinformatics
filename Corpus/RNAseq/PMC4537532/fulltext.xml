The comprehension of controls for carbon partitioning and oil accumulation in nonseed tissues is essential to generate oil-rich biomass in perennial bioenergy crops. <italic>Persea americana</italic> (avocado), a basal angiosperm with unique features that are ancestral to most flowering plants, stores&#x02009;~&#x02009;70 % TAG per dry weight in its mesocarp, a nonseed tissue. Transcriptome analyses of select pathways, from generation of pyruvate and leading up to TAG accumulation, in mesocarp tissues of avocado was conducted and compared with that of oil-rich monocot (oil palm) and dicot (rapeseed and castor) tissues to identify tissue- and species-specific regulation and biosynthesis of TAG in plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>RNA-Seq analyses of select lipid metabolic pathways of avocado mesocarp revealed patterns similar to that of other oil-rich species. However, only some predominant orthologs of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway genes in this basal angiosperm were similar to those of monocots and dicots. The accumulation of TAG, rich in oleic acid, was associated with higher transcript levels for a putative stearoyl-ACP desaturase and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated acyl-CoA synthetases, during fruit development. Gene expression levels for enzymes involved in terminal steps to TAG biosynthesis in the ER further indicated that both acyl-CoA-dependent and -independent mechanisms might play a role in TAG assembly, depending on the developmental stage of the fruit. Furthermore, in addition to the expression of an ortholog of WRINKLED1 (WRI1), a regulator of fatty acid biosynthesis, high transcript levels for <italic>WRI2-like</italic> and <italic>WRI3-like</italic> suggest a role for additional transcription factors in nonseed oil accumulation. Plastid pyruvate necessary for fatty acid synthesis is likely driven by the upregulation of genes involved in glycolysis and transport of its intermediates. Together, a comparative transcriptome analyses for storage oil biosynthesis in diverse plants and tissues suggested that several distinct and conserved features in this basal angiosperm species might contribute towards its rich TAG content.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our work represents a comprehensive transcriptome resource for a basal angiosperm species and provides insight into their lipid metabolism in mesocarp tissues. Furthermore, comparison of the transcriptome of oil-rich mesocarp of avocado, with oil-rich seed and nonseed tissues of monocot and dicot species, revealed lipid gene orthologs that are highly conserved during evolution. The orthologs that are distinctively expressed in oil-rich mesocarp tissues of this basal angiosperm, such as WRI2, ER-associated acyl-CoA synthetases, and lipid-droplet associated proteins were also identified. This study provides a foundation for future investigations to increase oil-content and has implications for metabolic engineering to enhance storage oil content in nonseed tissues of diverse species.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12870-015-0586-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Basal angiosperms are the first and oldest families of flowering plants that originated well over 100 million years ago and are represented by only a few hundred species compared with hundreds of thousands of species of monocot and eudicot angiosperms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Avocado (<italic>Persea americana</italic>) belongs to the family <italic>Lauraceae</italic>, one of the largest basal angiosperm families with over 50 genera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and has been used extensively as a model system to understand the early evolution of angiosperm flower development from the gymnosperms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Avocado is also an advantageous system in which to study the evolution of mechanisms underlying the synthesis of storage reserves such as starch or lipids in fruit tissues other than seed. Interestingly, avocado fruit growth, unlike most angiosperm fruits, is characterized by an unrestricted period of cell division, which continues through the entire period of fruit development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. During its development, the fleshy edible part accumulates by dry weight 60 to 70 % oil and 10 % carbohydrates. The oil is stored in the form of triacylglycerol (TAG) and is predominantly composed of oleic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. About 60 % of the total carbohydrates are seven-carbon sugar derivatives such as D-mannoheptulose and its sugar alcohol, perseitol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The high nutritional value and the usefulness of avocado&#x02019;s monounsaturated oils in promoting health raised its current world-wide production value to ~3.8 billion US dollars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The avocado fruit, like oil palm and olive, is one of a few examples in which the mesocarp, a nonseed tissue, accumulates copious amounts of TAG. In general, TAG biosynthesis in plant tissues primarily involves synthesis of fatty acids in the plastid and their transfer to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) followed by sequential esterification to a glycerol-3-phosphate backbone in an acyl-CoA-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or -independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although biosynthesis of TAG in plants is generally understood and considered to be a highly conserved process, the molecular and biochemical details are mostly limited to oilseeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Recently, greater attention is being given to plants that store oil in tissues other than seeds, which has revealed important differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For example, in avocado and oil palm mesocarp, lipid-droplet associated proteins (LDAP), which may play a role in stabilization of lipids, have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Typically, storage proteins such as oleosins<italic>,</italic> caleosins, and steroleosins were shown to play a role in stabilization and regulation of the size of the oil bodies in angiosperm seeds and pollen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, several studies, including comparative transcriptome analysis of nonseed oil-rich tissues, consistently point to the absence or reduced transcript levels for genes encoding for these integral lipid-body proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Transcriptome studies of oil palm and olive have also indicated key differences in the transcriptional control of TAG biosynthesis in nonseeds from that of seed tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In seed tissues, many of the master regulators of embryogenesis and seed maturation, such LEAFY COTYLEDON (LEC) genes <italic>LEC1</italic>, <italic>LEC1</italic>-like (<italic>L1L</italic>), <italic>LEC2</italic> and FUSCA3 (<italic>FUS3</italic>), and abscisic acid (ABA)-insensitive3 (<italic>ABI3</italic>) regulate TAG synthesis directly or indirectly through the downstream transcription factor WRINKLED1 (<italic>WRI1</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]). The WRI1 protein, a member of the APETALA2 (AP2)-ethylene responsive element binding proteins, regulates late glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthetic genes by binding to their promoter sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, along with WRI1, WRI3 and WRI4 were also shown to play a role in fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in floral and other nonseed tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Interestingly, high transcript levels for homologs of WRI1, but not WRI3 and WRI4, were noted in coordination with oil accumulation in developing mesocarp of oil palm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Successful complementation of <italic>Atwri1</italic> with <italic>EgWRI1</italic> further suggested that WRI1 is not only conserved between dicots and monocots but also regulates fatty acid biosynthesis in both seed and nonseed tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>While there has been major progress in our understanding of lipid biosynthesis in various plants and tissue types, gaps still remain with regard to how carbon partitioning is regulated and the oil content and composition is dictated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Additional transcription factors that may play a role in controlling the enzymes, such as the acyltransferases, needed in later steps of TAG accumulation, also remain elusive. In this study we have asked which genes associated with lipid biosynthesis are predominantly expressed and how their expression patterns in the oil-rich mesocarp tissue of a basal angiosperm vary compared to those of monocot and dicot tissues. To address these questions and to further examine the evolutionary relationship of lipid biosynthesis genes across plants, we conducted quantitative analysis of RNA from developing mesocarp of avocado. Because of the distinctive position <italic>P. americana</italic> occupies in plant evolution it serves as an excellent system in which to probe conservation of regulatory mechanisms in lipid synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Basal angiosperms, to which <italic>P. americana</italic> belongs, originated before the separation of monocots and dicots and contain features that are common to both groups. Transcriptome analysis of fatty acid biosynthesis in oil-rich nonseed fruit tissue has been previously reported for mesocarp of olive, a dicot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and oil palm, a monocot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]; similar studies of the more highly diverged basal angiosperms have not been reported. In this study, avocado mesocarp was selected for investigation of lipid biosynthesis in oil-rich tissue of an early angiosperm lineage. The mesocarp tissue from five stages of avocado fruits (I-V), with fresh weights ranging from&#x02009;~&#x02009;125 to 200&#x000a0;g (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), was used to generate temporal transcriptome data, using next-generation sequencing methods (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). In order to associate expression patterns of lipid biosynthesis genes with temporal oil accumulation, the fatty acid content and composition of mesocarp was also analyzed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). Details of the avocado RNA-Seq datasets available are summarized in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1 and in NCBI BioProject PRJNA253536. Predicted functional annotation of contigs represented by at least 10 reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) was based on BlastP alignment to lipid biosynthetic pathway proteins of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and is provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2, along with the contig sequences (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Data S1). It must be noted that although transcript levels may not always reflect protein abundance or enzyme activity, similar transcriptome data has been successfully used previously to identify crucial steps in biochemical pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Typically, early stage fruits, harvested at about 50&#x000a0;days after full bloom (DAFB) weigh&#x02009;~&#x02009;10&#x000a0;g and their weight is increased by ten-fold when harvested at 88 DAFB and more than 20-fold by 230 DAFB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The stage I &#x02018;Hass&#x02019; fruits utilized in this study were harvested ~100 DAFB and weighed about 125&#x000a0;g, while the mature fruits in stage V reached an average weight of 230&#x000a0;g. The mesocarp of fruit contributed to about two-thirds of the total fruit weight and continued to increase with development (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The increase in fruit weight was highly correlated with the accumulation of lipid content in the mesocarp tissue (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.978; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S1). The stage V fruits, with about 12 % oil by fresh weight, contained three-fold higher oil content, relative to stage I fruits (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). About one-fourth of the total oil content of the mesocarp was already accumulated in stage I fruits used in this study, which suggests that the lipid synthesis was initiated at an earlier stage of development. Based on the lipid content and fruit weight, the fruits harvested during October to February are estimated to represent mid to mature stages of fruit development (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Interestingly, unlike mature oilseeds, mature &#x02018;Hass&#x02019; avocados are capable of maintaining oil accumulation up to 18 % even after harvesting, until ripening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In contrast to the mesocarp, avocado seed oil content was much lower and changed little throughout the development (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).</p><p>The fatty acid composition was tissue-specific and varied with development for mesocarp (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Among the major fatty acids, oleic acid (18:1) was most abundant in mesocarp while in seeds linoleic acid was predominant throughout the development (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The variation in mesocarp composition for 16:0, 16:1 and 18:0, during mid to late stage of development was small; a steady increase in 18:1 and concurrent decline in 18:2 proportion was notable (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Seeds showed almost no variation in composition during the development and unlike in mesocarp, they contained a higher proportion of linolenic acid and lower 16:1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Overall, the data indicate that the rate of mesocarp oil accumulation and changes in its composition were directly correlated with fruit development and increase in its biomass (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S1). Fruit development and growth, including accumulation of its storage metabolites, are highly coordinated processes that are regulated by cross talk between various hormones. Several studies, indeed, have shown that exogenous ABA treatment enhances TAG accumulation by inducing the expression of various lipid biosynthesis genes as observed in developing seeds of <italic>B. napus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and castor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The hormone-mediated mechanisms by which fruit development and lipid accumulation are coordinated in avocado, however, remain to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Transcript analysis of select lipid metabolic pathways of avocado mesocarp revealed patterns similar to that of other oil-rich species</title><p>The conversion of sucrose to TAG involves degradation of sucrose, generation of pyruvate in the plastid, which involves glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and plastid transporters, fatty acid synthesis in the plastid and TAG assembly in the ER (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). These six metabolic pathways require expression of over 200 genes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). In avocado mesocarp, about 45 % of the transcripts corresponded to genes involved in glycolysis and 34 % to those in plastidial fatty acid biosynthesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The analyses we undertook were designed to discover conserved functions in lipid biosynthesis and regulation in avocado, without regard to separation of close paralogs or allelic transcripts in the RNA datasets. Therefore, multiple transcripts encoding for genes of the same protein family or protein complex were summed and represented as RPKM/protein (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). More detailed analyses using whole genome assemblies will aid in further gene family member resolution. Overall, the average RPKM/protein, based on conserved protein annotation, across the five developmental stages of the mesocarp, were also abundant for those genes involved in glycolysis or the generation of pyruvate and subsequently fatty acid synthesis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Gene expression pattern for select pathways (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). <bold>a</bold> Schematic of the pathways involved in conversion of sucrose to triacylglycerol (TAG). <bold>b</bold> The distribution of transcripts among the six pathways. <bold>c</bold> The number of reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) per protein in each pathway.

In fact their relative abundance remained the lowest among the six metabolic pathways that were analyzed and the transcript levels did not vary among developmental stages of the mesocarp (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>).

The expression of a single ortholog in avocado was also noted for other enzymes that are typically encoded by more than one gene in angiosperms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In the case of biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) of heteromeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), only the ortholog for BCCP1 (AT5G16390) was represented in the avocado mesocarp transcriptome. Both BCCP1 and 2 orthologs were detectable in oil palm, rapeseed and castor but BCCP1 was the predominant isoform in oil palm mesocarp, while BCCP2 was predominant in castor and rapeseed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

A phylogenetic tree generated from WRI homologs, from various plant families including dicots, monocots, and a basal angiosperm, revealed a possible gene duplication event of WRI early in land plant evolution as the WRI2 proteins formed a monophyletic group and separated from all other WRI homologs.

Consistent with this notion, the transcript levels for the orthologs of RBC, phosphoribulokinase and PEPC were high and on average 183, 195 and 216 RPKM, respectively (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3).

It remains to be determined if in avocado mesocarp the hexoses from vacuoles might also undergo glycolysis. Starch is also a principal substrate for glycolysis in the plastids and in avocado mesocarp, transcripts for starch synthesis and degradation gene orthologs were abundant throughout mesocarp development (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S3c). In the early stages of fruit set (June), about 44 % of the flesh weight is contributed by the sugars, which continue to increase during the rapid growth period of the fruit (until late October) and then begin to decline during the period of oil accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].

Sedoheputlose-7-P is produced by the activity of transketolase (TK) and is further converted to mannoheptulose by transaldolase (TA); it is not clear if mannoheptulose is exclusively derived from translocated sugars or is also synthesized in the mesocarp. Both TK and TA orthologs showed higher expression levels in mesocarp plastids, with TA being two-fold higher than TK (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S3c), suggesting a possibility for their synthesis in mesocarp as well. The higher levels of C7 sugars in early stages of fruit growth might therefore play a role in regulating the initiation of oil biosynthesis.

Additionally, the high expression levels for several orthologs that likely encode for plastid transporters also indicate that the intermediates, hexoses and triose carbons or PEP, and pyruvate generated by the cytosolic glycolytic pathway may be transported to the plastid (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S3b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Decarboxylation of imported malate by a plastidial NADP-dependent malic enzyme (NADP-ME) is also an alternate route for generation of pyruvate, as reported in castor endosperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] and maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Although the expression levels for ortholog of cytosolic malic acid dehydrogenase (MDH) were fairly abundant (&#x0003e;60 RPKM, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3), transcripts for NADP-ME were poorly represented in the plastid (&#x0003c;10 RPKM, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). These data suggest that malate synthesis in cytosol and its import to plastid for further decarboxylation might not generate substantial pyruvate in the plastids of avocado mesocarp (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3).</p><p>Comparing the transcript levels for the orthologs of glycolytic enzymes in the plastid and cytosol revealed features that support the generation of pyruvate in the plastid necessary to drive fatty acid synthesis during mesocarp development (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). In both cytosol and plastid, the orthologs for glycolysis enzymes were highly represented (&#x0003e;600 RPKM/enzyme; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), with putative fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) being the most abundantly expressed gene (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). Glycolysis is, however, primarily regulated by those enzymes that catalyze the reactions involved in the conversion of hexose to hexose-P, fructose-6-P to fructose-1,6-diP, and PEP to pyruvate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. The abundance of transcript levels for orthologs of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase), fructokinase, and pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase in the cytosol (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S4 and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), along with high transcript levels for SuSY and invertases (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S3a) suggest that cytosolic glycolysis is highly active and might rely more on UGPase generated fructose as a substrate. Interestingly, the higher abundance of transcript levels for the orthologs of hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, which catalyzes the conversion of glucose-6-P to fructose-6-P and ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase in the plastid than in the cytosol (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S4 and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>), suggests the early glycolysis is highly active in plastid as well and perhaps relies primarily on glucose as the substrate. Furthermore, the abundant gene expression levels for the orthologs of plastidial transporters for glucose (GLT), glucose-6-P (GPT), and nucleotide (NTT) through out the mesocarp development (&#x0003e;100 RPKM; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S3) suggests the scope for transport of glycolysis precursors and intermediates to the plastid. The high expression levels for pyruvate kinase in the plastid (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) additionally suggests that late glycolysis in oil-rich tissues of avocado might be under plastidial control. Overall, the means to generate pyruvate for fatty acid synthesis in plastid in a basal angiosperm species appears to be a synergistic outcome of active glycolysis in both the cytosol and plastid and transport of intermediates to the plastid, similar to those observations made with oil-rich dicot and monocot tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Avocado, as a basal angiosperm with highly nutritious fruit that is rich in oleic acid in its nonseed tissue, serves as an elegant system for comparing TAG biosynthesis functions among oil-rich tissues of diverse angiosperms. In this study, avocado mesocarp gene expression was examined with a focus on pathways and regulators responsible for the supply of carbon and its conversion to oil in nonseed tissue. We also addressed overall evolutionary conservation of genes required for oil synthesis across multiple oil-rich species. In general, genes expressed in processes from sucrose degradation to TAG assembly that are known to be upregulated in oil-rich tissues of monocots and dicots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], were also upregulated in avocado mesocarp (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Furthermore, consistent with other studies for oil-rich tissues, the expression of transcripts for fatty acid biosynthesis was several fold higher than those of transcripts encoding later steps of TAG assembly in the ER (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Plastid genes and transporters, necessary for pyruvate generation, were also highly expressed in the mesocarp tissue (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Most notably, transcripts for orthologs of multiple WRI isoforms were also abundant in the oil-rich tissues of avocado (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the supply of carbon and perhaps regulation of oil biosynthesis may primarily occur in the plastid in basal angiosperms as well. Further complementation studies are essential to establish the function of various isoforms of WRI in nonseed tissues. Comparative analysis of transcription factors, expressed across various oil-rich tissue types and species, is necessary to identify potential candidates that may play the role of upstream regulators to WRI.</p><p>Quantitative analysis of avocado mesocarp transcriptome also revealed certain unique features that suggest further studies using avocado to address several gaps in our understanding of TAG synthesis in nonseed tissue, such as regulation and determination of oil composition. For example, it is noteworthy that within the ER, the most abundant transcripts, relative to GPAT9 in avocado mesocarp, were of LACS orthologs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4) suggesting the potential for acyl activation in the ER and/or the junction of ER and plastid. Oil-rich nonseed tissues of avocado may therefore offer an invaluable system to determine roles for plastid versus ER associated LACS activity and/or if a direct contact between the plastid and ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] exists in basal angiosperms. Furthermore, avocado mesocarp could be used to determine the preference for PDAT1 and to explore its overlapping function with DGAT1 in TAG synthesis. This oleaginous species also is suitable to address if acyl editing occurs in mesocarp, where there is little flux to desaturation, and if it either involves phospholipase 2 and LACS or is mediated by LPCAT. With the absence or poor expression of oil storage protein such as oleosins, if or how TAG is packaged in nonseed tissues has remained a mystery; the identification of LDAP1 and LDAP2 in avocado mesocarp, however, offers an alternative means to study the stabilization of TAG.</p><p>Avocado fruit is distinctive among angiosperms in its development and growth, particularly in aspects that include the nature of storage metabolites it accumulates. The role of 7-carbon sugars and starch, in the early stages of mesocarp development, in regulation of fruit ripening and possibly in initiation of lipid synthesis remains elusive. Comprehensive profiling of carbohydrate, lipid and hormone content, concurrent with transcriptomics of mesocarp and seed tissues, is expected to provide a more in-depth understanding of the coordinated process of fruit development and carbon partitioning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Plant material</title><p>Avocado fruits (cv.
