Here, we infect a commercially important pest moth species <italic>Plodia interpunctella</italic> with its naturally infecting DNA virus. We sequenced, assembled and annotated the complete transcriptome of the moth, and a partial transcriptome of the virus. We then tested for differential gene expression between moths that were exposed to the virus and controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found 51 genes that were differentially expressed in moths exposed to a DNA baculovirus compared to controls. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that cuticle proteins were significantly overrepresented in this group of genes. Interestingly, 6 of the 7 differentially expressed cuticle proteins were downregulated, suggesting that baculoviruses are able to manipulate its host&#x02019;s response. In fact, an additional 29 of the 51 genes were also downregulated in exposed compared with control animals, including a gram-negative binding protein. In contrast, genes involved in transposable element movement were upregulated after infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We present the first experiment to measure genome-wide gene expression in an insect after infection with a natural DNA virus. Our results indicate that cuticle proteins might be key genes underpinning the response to DNA viruses. Furthermore, the large proportion of genes that were downregulated after viral exposure suggests that this virus is actively manipulating the insect immune response. Finally, it appears that transposable element activity might increase during viral invasion. Combined, these results provide much needed host candidate genes that respond to DNA viral invaders.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Differential gene expression</kwd><kwd>DNA virus</kwd><kwd>de novo transcriptome assembly</kwd><kwd>host-pathogen interaction</kwd><kwd>RNA-Seq</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Hosts are constantly challenged by the ubiquitous presence of pathogens and understanding the genetic architecture of these interactions is critical to developing tools to prevent infection. Within insects, characterization of innate immune system genes and pathways has primarily focused on responses to bacterial and fungal pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In contrast, the genes that respond to viruses are less well understood, with the vast majority of research limited to work with RNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Our understanding of insect immune responses to DNA viruses is poor and is a critical void that needs to be filled. Two studies that have quantified gene expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> after exposure to a DNA virus (Invertebrate iridescent virus 6) demonstrated that the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway can be effective at removing DNA as well as RNA viruses, although how this occurs is unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, the evolutionarily conserved immune pathway JAK-STAT may play a role in both DNA and RNA viral defence, but only against a subset of viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>However, these two studies, like many of the functional studies elucidating the roles of invertebrate immune system genes, do not challenge the host with a natural pathogen. Since the immune response to a novel pathogen is unlikely be equivalent to the product of an antagonistic co-evolutionary relationship, it is imperative to also probe the immune response in naturally-occurring host-parasite systems. Additionally, these studies were carried out in a single species of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and therefore the generality of their findings are unclear. Finally, comparative genomics of fully sequenced insect genomes reveals that not all immune system genes are present in all taxonomic groups. For example, the pea aphid, <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic>, does not have key genes involved in recognition and signalling in the IMD immune pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, in order to build a comprehensive understanding of innate immune systems, it is important to survey a wide variety of taxonomic groups exposed to different pathogen types. Given our lack of understanding of the immune responses to DNA viruses, it is particularly important to examine natural DNA viral infections of non-model hosts.</p><p>To this end, we exposed a moth species, <italic>Plodia interpunctella</italic>, to its naturally infecting DNA virus <italic>Plodia interpunctella</italic> Granulosis Virus (PiGV). <italic>P. interpunctella</italic>, the Indian meal moth, is a major pest of stored dry food products around the world, causing significant economic losses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. We sequenced the complete transcriptomes of exposed and control moths using RNA-Seq (Illumina), and assembled them using and comparing two different commonly used assemblers (SOAP<italic>denovo-Trans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and Trinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). The chosen transcriptome assembly of the moth and a partial transcriptome assembly of the virus are available as a public resource at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://afterparty.bio.ed.ac.uk/">http://afterparty.bio.ed.ac.uk/</ext-link>. Finally, we characterized the virally-induced transcriptome of the moth, therefore adding much needed information on the genetic architecture of insect- DNA virus interactions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>De novo transcriptome assembly assessments</title><p>After filtering for high quality sequences, a total of 488,010,769 sequences (per sample average&#x02009;=&#x02009;27,111,709 sd 5,923,264) were used to construct four assemblies using alternate methods.

Overall, the Trinity assemblies contained more and longer contigs than the SOAP assemblies, and seemed to have slightly better coverage of highly conserved, single copy orthologous genes. In addition to recovering 95% of the ultra-conserved orthologs (60% of which were present as a single copy), gene candidates were identified from all canonical immune gene pathways (e.g. RNAi, Jak/STAT, Toll, IMD), supporting the relative completeness of the assembly. As expected for biological samples that were not controlled for life-history stage, experimental conditions or tissue type, when broken down into functional categories through the use of GO terms, the <italic>P. interpunctella de novo</italic> assembly differs from other lepidopteran transcriptomes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Differential expression</title><p>Forty-seven <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> genes were differentially expressed 24&#x000a0;hours after exposure to PiGV compared to exposure to a control solution. The observed changes in expression could have several mechanistic origins, including defence, tolerance and repair. The differentially expressed genes were enriched for cuticle proteins (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;7), 6 of which were virally downregulated and 1 was upregulated. To our knowledge, cuticle proteins have not been implicated previously from studies examining mRNA levels in cell cultures after infection with a baculovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Cuticle proteins could play a role in defence in at least the following three ways. First, cuticle proteins form a large proportion of the peritrophic membrane (PM). The PM lines the gut and provides the first line of defence against ingested pathogens, such as PiGV and has been strongly implicated in antiviral defence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For example, the PM of more susceptible velvetbean caterpillars, <italic>Anticarsia gemmatalis</italic> had a lower chitin content and provided a less efficient barrier against its baculovirus (AgMNPV) than more resistant larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, changes in the peritrophic membrane are correlated with changes in the risk of pathogen infection. For example, the thickness of the PM is also well known in <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes to increase after the ingestion of a blood meal, which is the primary source of infective pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The change in expression of cuticle proteins in <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> could reflect similar processes. Generally, cuticle proteins in the peritrophic membrane have a distinctive molecular signature, which is not present in any of the significantly differentially expressed cuticle proteins identified. However, since studies characterizing PMs have only been conducted in a limited number of species, which are not closely related to the lepidopteran <italic>P. interpunctella</italic>, it is possible that the molecular signature is too divergent to recognize. Furthermore, not all proteins of the PM have been characterized. For example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] recently identified a new PM protein in the meadow moth that is able to bind chitin, but does not contain the conserved binding domain. Secondly, expression of cuticle proteins has been monitored in insects and been shown to change when moulting takes place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In <italic>Plodia</italic>, moulting includes shedding the gut lining, to which the PiGV particle may attach prior to penetration into the haemolymph. Thus, the differentially expressed cuticle proteins might correspond to <italic>Plodia</italic> moulting. Finally, the cuticle proteins may directly inhibit viral replication. For example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] demonstrated that a mosquito cuticle protein (AAEL011045) binds to a viral envelope and thus inhibits infection. Furthermore, they discovered that this protein was <italic>down</italic>regulated in virally exposed mosquitoes, raising the possibility that the virus was actively suppressing the expression of this molecule.</p><p>In order to discover if the degree of sequence identity amongst the 7 differentially expressed cuticle-proteins in this study could be used to explain their opposing pattern of regulation (i.e. up versus down), we aligned them with mosquito cuticle protein AAEL011045 in BioEdit v.7.2.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and built a neighbour-joining tree using CLUSTAL v1.2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This phylogenetic analysis shows that the seven moth genes cluster into three major clades; two clades of three genes each and a singleton. The singleton is the only cuticle protein that is upregulated after viral exposure. The moth genes in the clade containing the mosquito cuticle protein AAEL011045 are all candidate immune system genes that may be able to bind to the envelope of PiGV and thus inhibit its infectivity.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Neighbour-joining tree of 7 differentially expressed cuticle proteins from <italic>Plodia interpunctella</italic> and a cuticle protein from <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. All genes marked &#x02018;cuticle protein&#x02019; are of <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> origin. Genes marked with a blue dot are downregulated after exposure to a pathogen, will the gene with a red dot (cuticle protein 5) was upregulated after exposure to a pathogen.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2015_1499_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p>Two of the most up-regulated genes after viral exposure are a reverse transcriptase and a transposase. This suggests that within 24&#x000a0;hours of exposure to a virus, transposable elements (TE) activity, or &#x02018;jumping&#x02019;, is switched on (there were no reads from the control samples that mapped to either of these two genes). Supporting this hypothesis, a study that detected differential expression in hemocytes of the moth larvae <italic>Heliothis virescens</italic> after infection with <italic>Helicoverpa zea</italic> single nucleopolyhedrovirus found many retrotransposons to be upregulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A recent study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> showed that fragments of a virus were reverse-transcribed, producing truncated versions of the virus, which were processed by the RNAi machinery resulting in a reduction in the amount of active virus in the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Due to the increase in transposase activity found in this system, it will be interesting to test if there is a connection between TE activity and the control of a viral infection in this system as is the case in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Of all of the differentially expressed genes, 36 (70%) were downregulated. The prevalence of down-regulation suggests that PiGV may directly or indirectly exert a considerable inhibitory effect on the host immune response. Indeed, late in infection, some studies in cell culture have documented a global downregulation of host genes (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]). Similar effects of viral suppression on host immunity have been documented in other <italic>in vivo</italic> insect/viral systems (<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> infected with Dengue-virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], West Nile Virus and Yellow Fever Virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]). Indeed, in our differentially expressed data set, the only canonical immune system gene, a gram-negative binding protein (GNBP), is downregulated in virally-exposed larvae compared to control larvae. GNBPs are intricately involved activating the Toll pathway, and are upregulated after exposure to bacterial pathogens. The fact that the GNBP identified in this experiment is downregulated suggests that the virus may be suppressing the TOLL pathway. This potential for a trade-off between the immune response to bacteria versus viruses has been documented in mosquitoes, where the growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> was enhanced after viral infection with dengue virus (an RNA virus) in <italic>A. aegypti</italic> hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. They went on to show that viral interference with the host immune system resulted in a decreased production of antimicrobial peptides. Our transcriptome assembly contains several putative antimicrobial peptides, but none of them were differentially expressed after infection with the virus. However, our sampling time point was very early in the infection process, and thus sampling at more time points will be necessary to test if the viral infection has an effect on antimicrobial peptide activity.</p><p>The change in GNBP transcription may support the hypothesis that the innate immune response to a viral infection is not be restricted to the RNAi pathway, but instead additionally involves the Toll pathway. However, it is difficult to distinguish if the activation of different immune pathways is a direct or indirect result of the virus. For example, if the virus crossing the gut membrane results in a wound, naturally occurring gut microbes will also pass into the haemolymph and trigger an immune reaction. Our finding that one of the differentially expressed genes in the moth larvae was of bacterial origin is consistent with this hypothesis. Because we only assessed transcription very early in infection, it is not possible to determine if other members of the Toll pathway would also be differentially expressed.</p><p>Some of the genes that were determined to be differentially expressed are not functionally annotated (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;16, 31%). Many of these genes have high sequence similarity to other organisms, suggesting that functionally conserved, important putative immune, tolerance or repair genes have yet to be characterized in insects. Additionally, some of the genes had no known homology to other organisms, suggesting that there are also highly specific genes that are functionally uncharacterized. This study provides a solid foundation for choosing candidates for further functional characterization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have identified many candidate genes involved in the molecular response of a moth species to a naturally infecting DNA virus, a response for which we previously had a very limited understanding.

All individuals were taken from a large outbred stock that has been maintained at the University of Sheffield for approximately 8&#x000a0;years and reared on a cereal-based diet under standard laboratory conditions (27&#x000b0;C; 16&#x000a0;L:8D cycle). The pathogen used was <italic>Plodia interpunctella</italic> Granulosis Virus (PiGV), a natural DNA virus of <italic>P. interpunctella</italic>. The virus is naturally transmitted through the ingestion of virus occlusion bodies either from the environment or through necropsy of infected individuals. Baculoviruses (BVs) are generally host-specific, obligate killing DNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] with two phenotypes; the occluded virus, which consists of virions encased within a protein coat, and the budded virus. The initial site of virus exposure in the insect is the midgut where the alkaline conditions destroy the occlusion body resulting in the release of infectious virions. These virions may cross the peritrophic membrane into the epithelial cells and systemic infection is established when progeny BVs pass across the basal lamina into the haemocoel and infect secondary tissue such as the tracheal system and the fat body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our aim was to capture the change in mRNA levels during early infection, as immune responses can be swift and transient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. To this end, we chose to sample at 24&#x000a0;hours post infection, at which point enveloped virus nucleocapsids were found trapped in the connective tissue surrounding the midgut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Transcriptome assemblies were constructed from 18 <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> samples sequenced with RNA-Seq (Illumina) 100 base, pair-end reads on three HiSeq lanes (Illumina). The 18 samples came from two independent experiments, one of which (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) is described in a separate paper (McTaggart et al., <italic>in prep</italic>). Each sample consisted of 20 pooled individuals. Here, our aim was to characterize the transcriptomes of larvae, 24&#x000a0;hours after they had been exposed to viral dose of LD<sub>50</sub>. We set up six replicates in each of two treatments (viral exposed and control). In each replicate, 30&#x000a0;F1 generation adult moths were kept together with excess food. Prior to their viral exposure, 50 fourth instar larvae were removed from the pot, starved for 2&#x000a0;hours and then inoculated with the virus using a standard droplet feeding method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The virus solution was prepared by centrifugation of infected <italic>P. interpunctella</italic> larvae, and diluted in blue food colouring and sucrose. The required dose was calculated from a dose response assay performed prior to the experiment.</p><p>We inoculated larvae with either a solution of purified PiGV to LD<sub>50</sub> or with a control solution consisting of only sucrose and blue food colouring. Both treatments were orally administered with a standard oral droplet feeding protocol, and considered successful if the blue solution was visible in at least half of the gut length. Inoculated larvae were moved to individual wells of a 25-cell Petri dish containing ample food. Twenty-four hours later twenty larvae from each replicate were pooled and crushed in 1&#x000a0;ml of Trizol (Life Technologies) and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until RNA extraction. The remaining larvae (N&#x02009;~&#x02009;30) were monitored for infection for 30&#x000a0;days. Due to financial constraints, only three of the six replicates from each treatment (i.e. six samples in total) were sequenced using RNA-Seq.</p><p>Immediately before RNA extraction, an additional 500ul of TRIzol (Ambion, Life Technologies) was added to each sample, and incubated for 5&#x000a0;minutes at room temperature. Two hundred ul of chloroform was added to each sample, shaken vigorously for 15&#x02013;20 seconds and then centrifuged at 11600 rcf for 15&#x000a0;minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. The upper, aqueous phase was isolated and nucleic acids precipitated by adding 0.5 volumes of Absolute Ethanol, and inverting the tubes several times. This solution was used as the starting material for the RNAeasy (Qiagen) protocol, which was followed according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The integrity of the resultant total RNA was confirmed on Bioanalyzer (Agilent RNA-nano reagents). RNA and DNA concentrations were determined with a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen QuantRNA), while the 260:280 ratio was assessed on a Nanodrop (ThermoScientific). For each sample, we subjected 5 ug of total RNA to one round of poly-A selection on oligo(dT) Serabeads. The resultant messenger RNA was fragmented to an average size of 100&#x000a0;bp using divalent cations at 95&#x000b0;C for 5&#x000a0;min prepared following the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommended protocol (Illumina mRNAseq kits Cat no.

First, we built a BLAST database of each transcriptome that was queried with a previously published set of ultraconserved single-copy orthologs (UCOs) using tBLASTn. We counted how many times each gene was observed (with the expectation that each gene should be present only once) in each transcriptome. Similarly, we used the program CEGMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], which uses a different set of highly conserved single copy orthologs to query the data sets.

Contigs with a BLAST hit to the query having an e-value hit greater than 1e-10, and covering at least 80% of the full-length transcripts (inferred based on homology) were considered to be valid candidate transcripts. All contigs were loaded into Blast2Go, annotated with the non-redundant database of NCBI, and GO terms were assigned when possible. Combined graphs of the entire transcriptome were constructed for Biological Process and Molecular Function (level 2). These results were compared with the two other lepidopteran species for which equivalent data was available, <italic>Maruca vitrata</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and <italic>Manduca sexta,</italic> with a chi-square test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Differential expression of immune system genes</title><p>The number of times each contig in the chosen transcriptome was observed in the sequence reads was calculated using HTSeq (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/overview.html">http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/overview.html</ext-link>).

Using the RNA samples prepared for RNASeq, we synthesised complementary DNA (cDNA) by first mixing 500&#x000a0;ng total RNA with 500&#x000a0;ng random hexadeoxynucleotides (Promega) and heating to 75&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;minute.

The thermal profile for amplification was as follows: 95&#x000b0;C for 2&#x000a0;minutes, followed by 40&#x000a0;cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;seconds, 58&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;seconds and 60&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;seconds. Primer pairs were designed by us and tested by standard curve analysis (primer sequences are detailed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Expression of comp6230_c0_seq1 and comp2004_c0_seq1 (relative to actin expression) was analysed using t-tests to ask whether the expression (log transformed) was affected by infection treatment.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>
