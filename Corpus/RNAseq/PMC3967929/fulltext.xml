Cells in the vicinity of dying cells also become harder to kill by ionizing radiation (IR)-induced apoptosis. Both <italic>ban</italic> activation and increased protection from IR required receptor tyrosine kinase Tie, which we identified in a genetic screen for modifiers of <italic>ban</italic>. <italic>tie</italic> mutants were hypersensitive to radiation, and radiation sensitivity of <italic>tie</italic> mutants was rescued by increased <italic>ban</italic> gene dosage. We propose that dying cells activate <italic>ban</italic> in surviving cells through Tie to make the latter cells harder to kill, thereby preserving tissues and ensuring organism survival. The protective effect we report differs from classical radiation bystander effect in which neighbors of irradiated cells become more prone to death. The protective effect also differs from the previously described effect of dying cells that results in proliferation of nearby cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval discs. If conserved in mammals, a phenomenon in which dying cells make the rest harder to kill by IR could have implications for treatments that involve the sequential use of cytotoxic agents and radiation therapy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In multicellular organisms where cells exist in the context of other cells, the behavior of one affects the others.

A response called &#x02018;Phoenix Rising&#x02019; occurs in mice after cell killing by ionizing radiation. Here, the activity of Caspase 3 and 7 is required in dying cells and mediates the release of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, a stimulator of cell proliferation <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. These signals act non-autonomously to stimulate proliferation and tissue regeneration. A follow-up study in mice found a requirement for Caspase 3 in tumor regeneration after radiation treatment <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Not all consequences on neighboring cells are protective or mitogenic. In the classical &#x02018;radiation bystander effect&#x02019;, seen in cell culture and in mice, the effect of irradiated cells on the neighbors is destructive, making the latter more prone to death <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Mothersill1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Mothersill2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. There is evidence for a soluble signal; media from irradiated cells can induce the bystander effect on na&#x000ef;ve cells. Inhibitors of the bystander effect include antioxidants <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Mothersill3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, suggesting that oxidative stress and energy metabolism may be involved in radiation bystander effect.</p><p>We showed previously that <italic>ban</italic> activity increased after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) in wing imaginal discs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Jaklevic1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. IR-induced increase in <italic>ban</italic> activity required caspase activity: expression of a viral caspase inhibitor, p35, or mutations in p53 that reduced and delayed the onset of caspase activation attenuated <italic>ban</italic> activation. We noted that while IR-induced cell death was scattered throughout the disc, <italic>ban</italic> activation was homogeneous. This suggested a non-cell-autonomous component in activation of <italic>ban</italic>. The current study came out of our efforts to understand how <italic>ban</italic> is activated in response to IR. We identified <italic>Drosophila tie</italic>, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase of VGFR/PDGFR family, as an important mediator of IR-induced changes in <italic>ban</italic>. Previous knowledge of Tie function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> was limited to long range signaling for border cell migration during oogenesis <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We report here that Tie was needed to activate <italic>ban</italic> in response to cell death.

<italic>bantam</italic> activation in response to cell killing by IR or clonal cell death</title><p>To detect <italic>ban</italic> activity, we used a published GFP transgene that is expressed from the tubulin promoter and includes 2 perfect <italic>ban</italic> target sequences in its 3&#x02032;UTR, allowing for repression by <italic>ban</italic>

FLP-recombinase mediated &#x02018;flip-out&#x02019; method was used to express GAL4 in random, scattered cells in 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larval wing discs. GAL4 then drove the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, <italic>hid</italic> and <italic>reaper,</italic> to result in cell kill. In these experiments, FLP was driven from a heat shock promoter using a brief (10&#x02013;20&#x02032;) heat pulse at 37&#x000b0;C. Constitutive expression of GAL80<sup>ts</sup> from a tubulin promoter kept GAL4 repressed, and allowed clones to form. To induce cell death, GAL80 was inactivated by an incubation at 29&#x000b0;C for 8&#x02013;12 h (10&#x02032; heat shock and 8 h incubation at 29&#x000b0; shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004220-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Cells expressing GAL4 were marked with RFP. In irradiated discs, a drop in GFP from the sensor was most prominent at &#x0003e;20 h after robust cell death <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Jaklevic1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>; this was expected because GFP has a half-life of 26 h <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Corish1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Therefore, we monitored the sensor 22&#x02013;24 h after de-repression of GAL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004220-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>). We found that GFP was reduced in discs with Hid/Rpr clones compared to discs with RFP-only clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004220-g001">Fig. 1C vs. D</xref>). In discs with flip-out clones, surviving cells had not been exposed to a death-inducing DNA-damaging agent. Yet, these also showed a drop in sensor, reflecting <italic>ban</italic> activation. Co-expression of p35 with Hid/Rpr in clones prevented the decrease in GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004220.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

And the corresponding region in the adult wings was reduced in size. Mutations in dE2F1 caused cell-autonomous apoptosis <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Neufeld1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Therefore, we asked whether depletion of dE2F1 by RNAi also killed cells.

First, the Mahakali effect extended further than previously reported signaling from dead/dying cells. In the extreme case of <italic>ptc4&#x0003e;Hid/Rpr</italic>, the protection reached as far as the edge of the disc. This distance, on of order of 100 or more mm (scale bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004220-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) is comparable to the distance of border cell migration <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Kokai1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, in which Tie is known to function. In contrast, the mitogenic effect that occurs through JNK/Wingless in response to undead cells in the wing disc is seen up to 5 cells away <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Ryoo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Activation of proliferation through the Hpo/Yki axis also spans 3&#x02013;5 cells away. This can be seen as activation of Yki targets such as DIAP1 <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Grusche1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. We could reproduce this result: <italic>ptc4&#x0003e;dE2f1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> activated a Yki target, DIAP1, but only within or close to the <italic>ptc</italic> domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004220.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). <italic>Yki<sup>B5</sup></italic> allele, which disrupts cell death-induced proliferation <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Grusche1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, did not alter the Mahakali effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004220.s009">Fig. S9</xref>), further supporting the idea that the two effects are different. Second, <italic>ban</italic> activation in response to cell death was sensitive to the caspase inhibitor p35. In contrast, the mitogenic effect of dying cells in wing imaginal discs is not sensitive to p35 <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Ryoo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Huh1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Kondo1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004220-PerezGarijo2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004220-PerezGarijo3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Wells1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. We note that the mitogenic effect of dying cells is inhibited by p35 in the differentiating posterior region of eye imaginal discs <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Fan1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, which is similar to what we saw for <italic>ban</italic> activation in the wing discs.</p><p>We found that <italic>tie</italic> was required for IR-induced activation of <italic>ban</italic> and for larval survival after irradiation. There were similarities as well as differences in the role of <italic>ban</italic> and <italic>tie</italic>. <italic>tie</italic> mutants were IR-sensitive (this study), as are viable alleles of <italic>ban</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1004220-Jaklevic1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Tissue-specific overexpression of <italic>ban</italic> results in abnormal growth <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Hipfner1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>; we found that 6 independent UAS-<italic>tie</italic> transgenic lines were lethal when driven by actin-GAL4 (data not shown). Thus, too much <italic>ban</italic> or <italic>tie</italic> has consequences. On the other hand, reducing <italic>tie</italic> or <italic>ban</italic> gene dosage by half attenuated the Mahakali effect. Thus, too little <italic>ban</italic> or <italic>tie</italic> also has consequences. In fact, UAS-<italic>ban</italic> or UAS-<italic>tie</italic> without a GAL4-driver was sufficient to rescue <italic>ban</italic> and <italic>tie</italic> mutant phenotypes [<xref rid="pgen.1004220-Brennecke1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and this study]. Thus, intermediate levels of expression may be important for the function of these genes.</p><p>The biggest difference between <italic>ban</italic> and <italic>tie</italic>, of course, was that while <italic>tie</italic> homozygous larvae were viable (this study), <italic>ban</italic> homozygous larvae are lethal <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Brennecke1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. <italic>tie</italic> became necessary only after radiation exposure. This suggests that <italic>tie</italic> was needed to regulate <italic>ban</italic> not during normal development but after radiation exposure. How is IR and cell death linked to Tie? We found that mRNA for Pvf1, a ligand for Tie in border cell migration, was induced by IR and that this induction appeared to be dependent on cell death (abolished in p53 mutants). <italic>Pvf1<sup>EP1624</sup></italic> mutants that are mRNA and protein null <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Duchek1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, also showed reduced Mahakali effect. The degree of reduction was significant but not back to the level seen in control discs without <italic>ptc4&#x0003e;dE2f1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>, suggesting the involvement of additional ligands or mechanisms for Tie activation. In agreement, we could not see <italic>ban</italic> activation or the Mahakali effect after overproduction of Pvf1 (data not shown). Pvf1 was necessary but insufficient to produce these effects without cell death.</p><p>Tie activated <italic>ban</italic>, at least in part by increasing <italic>ban</italic> levels. How IR and caspase activity promotes Pvf1 expression and how Tie activity increases <italic>ban</italic> levels will be key questions to address in the future. Testing the role of known apoptosis regulators, such as Diap1, and signaling molecules, such as Wg, may help address these questions. We also plan to complete the genetic screen that identified Tie; it has the potential to identify additional components of the Mahakali effect.</p><p>Pvr, a PDGF/VEGF receptor homolog that function redundantly with Tie in border cell migration, also plays an anti-apoptotic role in embryonic hemocytes <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Bruckner1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. A recent study in wing discs found that Pvr is activated in neighbors of dying cells in a JNK-dependent manner, to result in cytoskeletal changes that allow the engulfment of the dead cell by the neighbor <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Ohsawa1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. It is interesting that two PDGF/VEGF receptor homologs that function redundantly in cell migration during oogenesis may also play non-redundant roles in non-autonomous responses to cell death in wing discs.</p><p>Cancer therapy routinely comprises the application of two or more cytotoxic agents (taxol and radiation, for example) to cancer cells. A phenomenon in which cell killing by one agent influence resistance to the second agent is, therefore, of potential clinical significance. The bulk of our analysis focused on protection from IR-induced cell death. But we also have preliminary indication that the Mahakali effect can also protect against cell death induced by maytansinol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004220.s010">Fig. S10</xref>), a microtubule depolymerizing agent with relevance to cancer therapy that we found before to induce cell death in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing discs <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. An important question is whether a phenomenon like Mahakali effect exists in mammals and acts as a survival mechanism in response to cell death. Ang-1, a ligand for mammalian Tie-2, is a pro-survival factor for endothelial cells during serum deprivation and after irradiation in cell culture models <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Holash1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Kwak1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Papapetropoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Interestingly, Ang1 is produced not by endothelial cells but by neighbors, at least in cell culture <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Based on these data, we think it possible that radiation exposure results in Ang1 production by dead/dying cells that promote the survival of endothelial cells via Tie-2. Consistent, an Ang-1 derivative that is a potent activator of Tie-2 has been shown to protect endothelial cells from radiation-induced apoptosis <xref rid="pgen.1004220-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>

Percent eclosions for Tb+ pupae (<italic>ban</italic>/+ and Df/+) were multiplied with each other to get the expected survival. For example, if % eclosion for <italic>ban</italic>/+ and Df/+ were 60% and 60%, the expected survival would be 0.6&#x000d7;0.6 or 36%. To measure the observed survival, <italic>ban/</italic>TM6 Tb virgin females were crossed to Df/TM6 Tb males. X<sup>2</sup> analysis (1 df) was used to calculate the significance of the difference between observed and expected survival, using a cut of value of p&#x0003c;0.001.
