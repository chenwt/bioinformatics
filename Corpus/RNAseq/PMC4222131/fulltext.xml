IFN sensing by the cell activates transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) able to induce an antiviral state by affecting viral replication and release. IFN also induces the expression of ISGs that function as negative regulators to limit the strength and duration of IFN response. The ISGs identified so far belong to coding genes. However, only a small proportion of the transcriptome corresponds to coding transcripts and it has been estimated that there could be as many coding as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). To address whether IFN can also regulate the expression of lncRNAs, we analyzed the transcriptome of HuH7 cells treated or not with IFN&#x003b1;2 by expression arrays. Analysis of the arrays showed increased levels of several well-characterized coding genes that respond to IFN both at early or late times. Furthermore, we identified several IFN-stimulated or -downregulated lncRNAs (ISRs and IDRs). Further validation showed that ISR2, 8, and 12 expression mimics that of their neighboring genes GBP1, IRF1, and IL6, respectively, all related to the IFN response. These genes are induced in response to different doses of IFN&#x003b1;2 in different cell lines at early (ISR2 or 8) or later (ISR12) time points. IFN&#x003b2; also induced the expression of these lncRNAs. ISR2 and 8 were also induced by an influenza virus unable to block the IFN response but not by other wild-type lytic viruses tested. Surprisingly, both ISR2 and 8 were significantly upregulated in cultured cells and livers from patients infected with HCV. Increased levels of ISR2 were also detected in patients chronically infected with HIV. This is relevant as genome-wide guilt-by-association studies predict that ISR2, 8, and 12 may function in viral processes, in the IFN pathway and the antiviral response. Therefore, we propose that these lncRNAs could be induced by IFN to function as positive or negative regulators of the antiviral response.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>IFN</kwd><kwd>lncRNAs</kwd><kwd>HCV</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>viral infection</kwd><kwd>IRF1</kwd><kwd>GBP1</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="89"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="12176"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcriptome analysis by tiling arrays and RNA sequencing has led to the conclusion that while 70&#x02013;90% of the genome is transcribed, only 2% is dedicated to the transcription of protein-coding sequences (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Among the non-coding transcriptome, there is a group of poorly studied transcripts longer than 200&#x02009;nt and with low coding potential that have been collectively called long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). It has been estimated that there could be as many lncRNA genes as coding genes, but the number of lncRNAs is still growing and some authors consider that it could increase to up to ~200000 (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Therefore, there is a great need to identify novel lncRNAs and to understand their function and regulation.</p><p>Long non-coding RNAs genes are very similar to coding genes at the chromatin, DNA, and RNA level (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Compared to mRNAs, most lncRNAs are more cell-type specific, less expressed, and less conserved at the nucleotide sequence level (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Many lncRNAs have been shown to be functional. Some lncRNAs function to regulate the expression of neighboring or antisense genes by transcriptional interference, by recruitment of chromatin modifiers and remodelers, or by regulation of imprinting, editing, splicing or translation, and stability (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and lncRNA-activating RNAs (lncRNA-a) are transcripts that control the expression of neighboring genes in &#x0201c;cis&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, lncRNAs can also function in &#x0201c;trans,&#x0201d; away from their site of synthesis. For instance, some pseudogenes regulate the expression of their parental gene, located in a distant genomic location (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). LncRNAs have especially emerged as regulators of development, pluripotency, and proliferation as some function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Therefore, several lncRNAs have been implicated in cancer and in other human diseases (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>Proliferation, differentiation, and pluripotency factors regulate the expression of some lncRNAs (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Besides, several signaling molecules, including those involved in the immune response, have been shown to induce the expression of specific lncRNAs (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Induction of TLR2, TLR3, or TLR4 leads to the activation of lncRNAs, including lncRNA-COX2, which regulates the expression of several immune genes or NEAT1, which functions to increase the expression of some antiviral genes such as IL8 (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Downregulation of IL1&#x003b2;-eRNA and IL1&#x003b2;-RBT46 lncRNAs decreases IL1&#x003b2; and the accumulation of LPS-induced RNAs (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Similarly, downregulation of lnc-IL7R decreases the LPS-induced inflammatory response (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Treatment of THP1 macrophages with an innate immunity activator also induces the expression of several lncRNAs. One of them, linc1992 (or THRIL) activates the expression of TNF&#x003b1; and other genes involved in the immune response (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In turn, TNF&#x003b1; also induces many lncRNAs in fibroblasts, including Lethe, a pseudogene that responds to NF&#x003ba;B and inhibits NF&#x003ba;B DNA-binding activity leading to reduced inflammation (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Besides, dendritic cells (DCs), CD4+, and CD8+ T-cells express a specific set of lncRNAs that may regulate cell activation and differentiation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). NEST lncRNA controls the IFN&#x003b3; locus in CD8+ T-cells causing decreased <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> pathogenesis (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Downregulation of lnc-DC, expressed in conventional DCs, impairs DC differentiation from monocytes, and reduces the capacity of DCs to activate T-cells (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). LncRNAs also respond to viral infections. Infection with enterovirus, influenza virus, HIV, hepatitis B, and C (HCV) viruses as well as the SARS coronavirus leads to altered levels of lncRNAs (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) (Carnero et al., in prep). From the collection of infection-altered lncRNAs, it is difficult to distinguish those that respond to the virus from those that respond to the cellular antiviral pathways activated by the infection. Recently, some lncRNAs regulated by infection have also been found to be regulated by IFN&#x003b1; in mice (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p><p>Interferon is a key molecule in the cellular antiviral response (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Detection of pathogens by the cell triggers transcription of the interferon (IFN) genes. When type I/III IFN is released, it is sensed by the IFN receptors, which induce the JAK/STAT pathway. STAT1 and 2 coupled to IRF9 form a complex that binds IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) in the promoters of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and activates their transcription. ISGs induce an antiviral state by several means, including inhibition of viral replication, transcription, and translation. Well-characterized ISGs are Mx1, OAS, GBP1, but also STAT1 and IRF9, which amplify the IFN response. Further, STAT1 induces the expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as IRF1, a transcription factor that also activates ISGs, and whose induction is dependent on <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Besides, IFN also induces the expression of negative regulators that limit the strength and duration of the IFN response (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Finally, IFN activates expression of several miRNAs that contribute to the antiviral state or to the control of the IFN response (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have postulated that IFN could also regulate the expression of lncRNAs that may have key roles in the antiviral response. Therefore, we have performed a high-throughput analysis of lncRNAs whose expression is deregulated in response to IFN&#x003b1;. The conditions we used aimed to identify genes controlled by the IFN pathway directly or by other ISGs. The results show that several lncRNAs are controlled in response to type I IFN in several cell lines tested. The best candidates are lncRNA genes upregulated in response to IFN that are found in the genome adjacent to IFN-related coding genes. They have been called ISR2, 8, and 12. Interestingly, guilt-by-association genome-wide studies predict that the function of these lncRNAs is related to the cellular antiviral response and to viral infections. In fact, ISR2, 8, and their neighboring genes are also increased after infection of cultured cells with HCV. A similar increase is detected in the livers of patients infected with this virus or, in the case of ISR2, in blood cells of patients infected with HIV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Cells and patient samples</title><p>HuH7 cells, derived from a human hepatocarcinoma, were provided by Dr. Chisari&#x02019;s lab (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA).

IFN induces the expression of ISGs very fast. Some ISGs are transcription factors able to regulate the expression of genes with antiviral potential in a secondary wave of IFN response. Other ISGs are inhibitory factors that function to decrease the response. Therefore, to identify lncRNAs regulated by IFN or by ISGs, one should analyze the transcriptome of cells treated by IFN at different time points. However, to simplify the analysis, we decided to check first whether we could find conditions showing a wide IFN response at a single time point. To this aim, we tested whether high doses of IFN could lead to increased expression of well-known ISGs even at late times post-IFN treatment. HuH7 cells were treated for 6, 24, 48, or 72&#x02009;h with increasing doses of IFN&#x003b1;2 up to 10,000&#x02009;units/ml, and the expression levels of GBP1, IRF1, BST2, OAS, IL6, and ISG15 were evaluated by qRT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The results show that GBP1 and IRF1 are induced to highest levels at 6&#x02009;h post-treatment, while BST2 and OAS are induced to similar levels at all times tested. In contrast, IL6 is only significantly induced at 3&#x02009;days post-treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and data not shown). However, compared to untreated cells, a significant upregulation of all the genes, including GBP1 and IRF1, can be detected at 3&#x02009;days post-treatment with 10,000&#x02009;units/ml of IFN&#x003b1;2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). In fact, this dose induced the highest levels of these transcripts at most of the time points. Before analyzing the transcriptome of cells treated with 10,000&#x02009;units/ml of IFN&#x003b1;2 for 3&#x02009;days, we confirmed that these conditions induced antiviral effects. When HuH7 cells infected with HCV were treated with these conditions, we indeed detected a drastic decrease in viral protein expression by immunofluorescence and a decrease in the levels of HCV viral genomes by qRT-PCR (data not shown).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>High doses of IFN induce the expression of genes involved in the IFN response at late times post-treatment</bold>.

Ingenuity analysis of this set indicated that IFN signaling is the pathway with the highest enrichment followed by other antiviral responses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C).

Many sequences corresponded to coding genes or seemed to be 3&#x02032;UTR extensions of coding genes and were discarded for further analysis. The remaining sequences corresponded to 48 genes, including 29 genes annotated as lncRNAs and 19 located in non-annotated areas of the genome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D, Table S4 in Supplementary Material). Surprisingly, while 90% of coding genes were upregulated by IFN, only 54% of the lncRNAs were upregulated. Most of the downregulated lncRNAs corresponded to the non-annotated category. This suggests that there could be a relevant IFN-mediated repression of genes that more strongly affects lncRNAs. We named these genes IDRs, for IFN-downregulated RNAs, and accordingly named the IFN-stimulated RNAs ISRs. The fact that almost 40% of the ISRs and IDRs correspond to non-annotated areas of the genome suggests that the percentage of the genome able to react to different stimuli could be even larger than expected.</p><p>As many lncRNAs have been described to regulate the expression of neighboring genes, we looked for the closest coding gene for each ISR or IDR (Table S4 in Supplementary Material). We considered candidates to have no neighbor when the closest coding gene was not within a distance of 100&#x02009;kb from the start or the end of the candidate or when the closest gene was non-coding. Forty candidates had neighboring coding genes according to these criteria. Half of the coding-non-coding pairs were in tandem, convergent, or divergent, 12 were antisense to each other, 4 were overlapping, and 5 pairs seem to share the same promoter according to the DNase I hypersensitivity and the histone marks described by ENCODE for the respective area. Therefore, these couples of coding-non-coding genes could be co-regulated. Three upregulated candidates, ISR2, ISR8, and ISR12 were neighbors of the IFN-related genes GBP6, IRF1, and IL6, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S3-10"><title>IFN&#x003b1; alters the expression of LncRNAs at different time points and in different cell lines</title><p>We next wanted to validate the IFN effect on these candidates in independent samples using a different technique. Furthermore, we wanted to determine whether the levels of ISRs and IDRs were altered early after IFN treatment. Therefore, the expression levels of 24 ISRs and 16 IDRs were evaluated by qRT-PCR in HuH7 cells treated with 0 or 10,000&#x02009;units/ml of IFN&#x003b1; for 6, 12, 24, 48, or 72&#x02009;h.

ISR2 is located in tandem with GBP6, at the end of the cluster of GBP genes formed by GBP3, 1, 2, 7, 4, 5, and 6. In fact, ISR2 is GBP1P1, a pseudogene of GBP1. This may be interesting as some pseudogenes have been described to regulate the expression of their parental genes (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). ISR12 is located in tandem with IL6 and ISR8 is convergent with IRF1. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the expression of GBP1, IRF1, and IL6 in response to IFN in the same cell lines. The results showed a similar induction pattern of each ISR and of the corresponding neighboring coding gene in response to IFN (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A,C). Note that in the case of ISR2, we evaluated the expression of its parental neighboring gene GBP1 instead of the closest neighbor GBP6, as we speculated that there could be a co-regulation of the parental gene and the pseudogene. Furthermore, we could not detect expression of GBP6 in control or IFN&#x003b1;-treated HuH7 cells (data not shown).</p><p>All the experiments performed so far with these lncRNAs have studied the response to high doses of IFN. To determine whether ISR2, 8, and 12 also respond to lower doses, their expression level was evaluated in HuH7 cells treated for 6, 24, 48, or 72&#x02009;h with 5, 50, 250, 1000, or 10,000&#x02009;units/ml of IFN&#x003b1;2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

Further, we evaluated whether expression of these transcripts was induced after treatment with TNF&#x003b1;. TNF&#x003b1;, similarly to some pathogen-associated molecular patterns, induces NF&#x003ba;&#x003b2; signaling and expression of pro-inflammatory genes. However, the NF&#x003ba;&#x003b2; pathway is a poor inducer of ISGs. A treatment of HuH7 cells with 20&#x02009;ng/ml of TNF&#x003b1; for 6&#x02009;h, induced the expression of CXCL10, used as a positive control, more than 100-fold. A significant increase in expression of only 2&#x02013;3-fold was observed after TNF&#x003b1; treatment for GBP1, IRF1, IL6, and ISR12, but not for ISR2.

Even though we did not observe a strong activation after TNF&#x003b1; treatment, transcription factor chIP Seq from ENCODE showed that ISR8 and ISR12 promoters have NF&#x003ba;B binding sites. Interestingly, the ISR8 promoter has sites for STAT1 and 2 as well as IRF1 and 2, suggesting that ISR8 could be a <italic>bona fide</italic> ISG. Besides the non-coding transcript that we name ISR8, six other transcripts could be expressed from the ISR8 area according to UCSC and Ensembl databases (Figure S2A in Supplementary Material). These transcripts have certain coding capacities and could be translated to proteins of up to 126 amino acids named C5ORF56. The syntenic region in the mouse also comprises non-coding transcripts together with transcripts with certain coding potential that lead to peptides no longer than 32 amino acids (data not shown). Only five amino acids in the N-terminal part of the putative protein predicted in mouse are conserved in human. Given the poor conservation and the short size of the predicted peptides all the transcripts from this mouse region could be classified as non-coding (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). To analyze the expression of ISR8 and all the putative coding transcripts annotated in the human ISR8 area, we used qRT-PCR.

If expressed, lncIRF1 could regulate the level of ISR8 via antisense mechanisms. Therefore, we have evaluated the expression of lncIRF1 in response to IFN. The results show that lncIRF1 is expressed and its levels are induced at short times after IFN treatment (Figure S2C in Supplementary Material).

CPAT uses a model built with open reading frame size and coverage together with codon (Ficket score) and hexamer (hexamer score) usage bias.

We compared the levels of each coding/non-coding pair in all the samples evaluated in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. The results show a highly significant positive correlation between ISR2 and GBP1 or ISR8 and IRF1. In contrast, ISR12 had a non-significant correlation with IL6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A). Expression of neither ISR2 nor ISR8 significantly correlated with the expression of other ISGs such as OAS or BST2 (data not shown).</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Correlation of expression between ISR2, 8, and 12 and their coding partners, and guilt-by-association analysis</bold>. <bold>(A)</bold> Expression levels observed for ISR2, 8, and 12 in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> were compared to the expression levels of their coding neighbors GBP1, IRF1, and IL6, respectively, in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C.

Therefore, we decided to perform a more stringent high-throughput analysis of correlation. Accordingly, we carried out a guilt-by-association genome-wide analysis (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), which also predicts the function of unknown genes with high statistical confidence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B). We compared the expression levels of ISR2, 8, and 12 and coding genes related to cellular antiviral pathways, used as positive controls, with the expression levels of all the genes represented in a SurePrint G3 microarray. We used data obtained from microarray experiments performed with 120 human samples of different origin. The results show a significant positive correlation between ISR8 and IRF1 (corr&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.41 and <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10e&#x02212;0.5), indicating that these genes are co-regulated. Significant correlations were not observed for GBP1 and ISR2 or IL6 and ISR12. Furthermore, the correlation analysis of each candidate organized all the microarray genes from the ones with the highest positive correlation to the ones with the highest negative correlation. This matrix was used to search for GO categories with highly significant enrichment in genes that correlate positively (positive <italic>z</italic>-score) o negatively (negative <italic>z</italic>-score) with ISR2, 8, or 12. This analysis revealed that ISR2, 8, and 12 clustered very closely but away from other genes related with the IFN pathway and the antiviral response. ISR2, 8, and 12 showed a negative correlation with genes that significantly enriched GO categories related to viral processes including viral life cycle and viral transcription. ISR2 and 12 also shared a negative correlation with response to viral infection and IFN pathway genes. However, ISR8, similar to IRF1 and TLR3, showed a positive correlation with IFN signaling and immune response genes.</p></sec><sec id="S3-13"><title>ISR2 and ISR8 respond to viral infections</title><p>The results obtained in the guilt-by-association analysis led us to hypothesize that ISR2, 8, and 12 could respond strongly to viral infections or to the IFN response induced by viral infections. To study this hypothesis, we evaluated the expression of these lncRNAs in cells infected with Ad5, a DNA virus, or RNA viruses such as influenza virus, SFV, or HCV. All of them have developed mechanisms to block the cellular antiviral response. Influenza virus control of IFN is exerted primarily by the influenza NS1 protein (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Therefore, we also infected cells with an influenza virus mutant that lacks NS1. All the viruses used, with the exception of HCV, lead to a fast lytic infection that initiates cell death at 24&#x02009;h post-infection in the case of influenza virus and SFV, or at 48&#x02009;h post-infection in the case of Ad5. Therefore, several time points post-infection were evaluated in each case. The results show that ISR12 expression was not altered by infection (data not shown). ISR2 and ISR8 expression was only induced in cells infected with the influenza virus unable to control IFN at later times post-infection, when the IFN response is strongest (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In general, the induction pattern was similar for GBP1 and IRF1.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>ISRs respond to viral infections in cultured cells</bold>. HuH7 cells were mock-treated or infected with wild-type influenza virus (PR8) or a mutant that lacks NS1 (&#x00394;NS1), SFV, Ad5, or HCV for the indicated times. RNA was isolated and the expression levels of ISR2, GBP1, ISR8, and IRF1 were evaluated by qRT-PCR. GAPDH expression was also evaluated and used as a reference to calculate the relative levels of each transcript. The experiment was performed three times.

Increased expression was also observed for GBP1 and IRF1 but not for other ISGs such as OAS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and data not shown). To determine whether a similar upregulation could be observed in HCV patients, levels of ISR2, 8, and 12 were evaluated in livers from HCV-negative (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;19) to HCV-positive (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) patients. The results show that both ISR2 and 8 are significantly upregulated in HCV patients (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>A). No differences were observed in the levels of ISR12 in the same samples. Finally, we wanted to determine whether these lncRNAs also respond to other chronic viral infections relevant for human health. Therefore, we evaluated the expression of ISR2, 8, and 12 in blood cells isolated from healthy patients or from patients chronically infected with HIV. We could not detect expression of ISR8 or 12 in these samples. However, both ISR2 and GBP1 were significantly upregulated in HIV-infected patient cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>B).</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>ISRs respond to viral infections <italic>in vivo</italic></bold>.

These lncRNAs were identified in a high-throughput analysis using conditions that detect increased levels of coding genes that respond to IFN both at early or late times (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). In the cells treated with IFN for 3&#x02009;days, we found, with a very high statistical significance (<italic>B</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;7), an upregulation of well-characterized ISGs such as Mx1, STAT1, IRF9, ISG15, BST2 and several members of the GBP, OAS, and IFI families (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Besides, the IFN-induced STAT pathway shows the highest enrichment by Ingenuity analysis (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). This suggests that high levels of IFN could maintain an active JAK/STAT pathway in HuH7 cells even at late times post-IFN treatment. Therefore, we feel that among the lncRNAs identified in this work, there may be some candidates whose expression is controlled directly by the JAK/STAT pathway, while other candidates could be controlled by other ISGs or by later downstream effectors of the IFN response.</p><p>Comparison of the results obtained in the array between coding and lncRNA genes gave an unexpected result: 90% of the altered coding genes but only 54% of the lncRNAs were upregulated by IFN. This suggests that there could be an IFN-mediated repression of genes that affects more strongly lncRNAs. However, even if IDRs showed a generally decreased expression in the presence of IFN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B), the downregulation was mild. Validation of downregulated genes showed that only IDR16 was strongly affected by IFN at late times post-treatment (Table S5 in Supplementary Material). Further experiments will be required to determine whether there is a relevant downregulation of lncRNA genes in response to IFN. Notably, the majority of the IDRs match with genomic regions that have not been associated with active transcription in public databases. This is surprising, as some of them such as IDR4, 7, 15, or 16 are expressed at high levels in HuH7 cells according to the qRT-PCR data (Table S5 in Supplementary Material). Therefore, it would be interesting to analyze IFN regulation of lncRNAs using RNASeq, as this may yield a more comprehensive picture of the lncRNA transcriptome and its manipulation by IFN. In fact, during the revision of this paper, another manuscript was accepted showing that transcriptome analysis by RNASeq allowed the identification of several lncRNAs whose expression is altered in response to IFN (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). Similar results have been obtained using RNASeq in our lab (Barriocanal et al., submitted).</p><p>Several ISRs were clearly validated by qRT-PCR. Specifically, ISR1, 2, 8, 12, and 22 were upregulated more than fivefold, and ISR2 and ISR8 even more than 50-fold. ISR1 was expressed at very low levels. In contrast, ISR2, 8, and 12 were well expressed in all cell lines tested and their expression was strongly induced by IFN at early (ISR2 and 8) or late times (ISR12) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). Furthermore, low doses of type I IFN&#x003b1; or IFN&#x003b2; also induced the expression of these ISRs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and data not shown). We did not detect significant induction of these ISRs, GBP1, IRF1, or IL6 with type III IFN&#x003bb; using doses able to induce other ISGs such as OAS, ISG15, or BST2 (data not shown). Further experiments are required to determine whether these genes could show some specificity for type I IFN, as the repertoire of genes that are induced by type III IFNs is essentially the same as those induced by type I IFNs (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Finally, ISR12 was also induced after the activation of the NF&#x003ba;&#x003b2; pathway by TNF&#x003b1;, LPS, or polyI:C (data not shown). This result is in line with the identification of NF&#x003ba;&#x003b2; binding sites in ISR12 promoter by chIP Seq.</p><p>Our molecular and bioinformatic analyses strongly suggest that ISR2, 8, and 12 are indeed long non-coding RNAs. The reasons are: (i) they accumulate preferentially in the nucleus of IFN-treated or untreated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>); (ii) they are marked as lncRNAs with high sensitivity and specificity after analysis of their ORF size and coverage, analysis of their codon and hexamer usage bias, or analysis of PhyloCSF; (iii) they have not been identified as associated with ribosomes in ribosome profiling experiments; and (iv) if they are translated to small peptides, such peptides have not been identified by proteomic analyses (Figure S4 in Supplementary Material).</p><p>Given that some lncRNAs regulate the expression of neighboring genes, we searched for the closest coding gene for each ISR or IDR. Interestingly, ISR2, 8, and 12 have neighboring genes related to the IFN response (Table S4 in Supplementary Material, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B, Figure S2 and S3 in Supplementary Material). ISR2 is in tandem and downstream of GBP6. It is very unlikely that ISR2 results from run-off transcription from GBP6, as GBP6 expression could not be detected in HuH7 cells (data not shown). ISR12 is in tandem and upstream of IL6 while ISR8 is convergent with IRF1. None of the transcripts annotated for ISR2 or ISR12 overlaps with the transcripts annotated for GBP6 or IL6, respectively (Figure S3 in Supplementary Material). However, the region of ISR8 and IRF1 is more complex. While ISR8 does not overlap with its coding neighbor IRF1, the IRF1 gene also transcribes a longer transcript of poor coding capacity called lncIRF1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B, Figure S2A in Supplementary Material). LncIRF1 expression is induced by IFN&#x003b1; to similar levels than ISR8 (Figure S2C in Supplementary Material). As ISR8 is antisense to lncIRF1, they could potentially regulate each other by transcriptional interference or by antisense mechanisms, although only 17&#x02009;nt of the mature form of ISR8 are antisense to the mature form of lncIRF1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B and Figure S2A in Supplementary Material).</p><p>None of the coding/non-coding pairs share the promoter, making it unlikely that they are co-regulated at the transcriptional level, which would otherwise be a way to explain that both are induced in response to IFN. Instead, the promoters of these ISRs seem to be independent. ISR2 is located within the GBP locus, which could be indicative of a general co-regulation in response to IFN. The ISR8 and ISR12 promoters have NF&#x003ba;B binding sites, although only ISR12 is reproducibly induced in response to TNF&#x003b1; under the conditions tested. Furthermore, ISR8 seems a <italic>bona fide</italic> ISG as the promoter has sites for STAT1 and 2 as well as IRF1 and 2. In spite of this, the possibility exists that IFN activation of a coding ISG could result in an unintended recruitment of transcription factors to the promoter of lncRNAs located nearby. We do not think that this is a general phenomenon, as in the microarray or RNASeq analysis, we do not observe that many lncRNAs located close to ISGs are induced after IFN treatment. Besides, if such unintended transcription occurs, we would expect that the expression of ISR2, 8, and 12 should always correlate with the expression of their neighboring coding genes. This, however, is not the case.</p><p>Upon further analysis of the results in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, we observed a highly significant positive correlation between the expression levels of ISR2 and GBP1, or of ISR8 and IRF1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A). These correlations may reflect the fact that ISR2 and ISR8 are genes induced by IFN at early time points. In fact, the expression of ISR2 and ISR8 also correlated significantly with the expression of IRF1 and GBP1, respectively (data not shown). Therefore, to analyze correlation in a more stringent manner, we compared the expression of ISR2, 8, and 12 with the expression of all the genes represented in the SurePrint G3 microarray using data from 120 human samples. In this case, we only observed a significant correlation for ISR8 and IRF1 (corr&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.41 and <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10e&#x02212;0.5), suggesting that these two genes are co-expressed. In fact, the ISR8 promoter has a conserved IRF1 binding site.</p><p>Guilt-by-association genome-wide analysis predicts that ISR2, 8, and 12 could function in the IFN pathway and the antiviral response (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B). Furthermore, they could be involved in viral processes including viral life cycle and viral transcription. In fact, ISR2 and 8 are upregulated at later times post-infection with an influenza virus mutant that lacks NS1, unable to block the IFN response (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). This suggests that ISR2 and 8 are increased in response to the physiological amounts of IFN secreted by the cells as a consequence of infection. We did not observe significant responses of ISR2, 8, and 12 to other lytic viruses able to block the IFN response. However, both ISR2 and 8 were significantly upregulated in cells infected with HCV compared to controls. This was observed in HCV-infected cells in culture but also in the livers of HCV-infected patients (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>A). Intriguingly, increased levels of ISR2 and GBP1 were also detected in patients chronically infected with HIV (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>B). We did not observe significant correlations between the levels of ISR2 and ISR8 and clinical symptoms, although patients with higher HIV load tend to have higher levels of ISR2 and GBP1 (data not shown).</p><p>HCV is a chronic virus that employs several viral proteins to block the IFN pathway (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). However, the ISG expression profile of some patients with chronic HCV infections indicates that IFN is being produced by the infected cells as well as by neighboring cells (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). This may in turn explain upregulation of ISR2 and ISR8. Upregulation was also observed for the neighboring genes GBP1 and IRF1 but not for other ISGs such as OAS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and data not shown). This raises the question why the infection persist in spite of increased levels of antiviral factors? Different viruses are targeted by unique sets of ISGs (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). In the case of HCV both GBP1 and IRF1 have been shown to have antiviral potential (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). IRF1 overexpression on its own can activate a similar set of genes as IFN and can lead to a control of the replication of HCV and other viruses (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). Therefore, for infection to persist, the effects of IRF1 and probably other ISGs should be inhibited in infected cells (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). One intriguing hypothesis for future work is that this inhibition is in fact exerted by ISG lncRNA neighbors.</p><p>Further experiments will be required to determine whether these ISRs have a proviral or an antiviral role by affecting the function of ISGs. The only preliminary evidence of an anti-IFN role is the highly significant anti-correlation between ISR2/ISR12 and key factors of the IFN pathway found by genome-wide guilt-by-association studies. Similarly, inhibition of a lncRNA located close to viperin, an ISG that also inhibits HCV replication, has been shown to increase the levels of many IFN-inducible genes (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). Therefore, several lncRNAs could act as negative regulators of the IFN pathway. The guilt-by-association study also shows a positive correlation of ISR8/IRF1 and the IFN response, suggesting that ISR8 could have a positive role in the IFN pathway. One possible approach to further dissect the function of these ISRs in the future will be their inhibition via RNAi. However, resistance to RNAi is a common feature of many lncRNAs that locate in the nucleus away from the RNAi machinery or contain poorly accessible structured sequences. An alternative could be the use of gene editing technologies, provided that the function of the targeted lncRNAs is not essential for the cell, which would prevent their complete deletion. Moreover, it may also be feasible to overexpress selected lncRNAs from plasmids or viral vectors, in order to study gain-of-function phenotypes. In the long run, we are optimistic that these and other approaches will help to further delineate the potential role of lncRNAs in the IFN pathway and in the antiviral response.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Elena Carnero and Marina Barriocanal designed and performed the experiments, analyzed and interpreted the data, and contributed to the writing of the manuscript; Celia Prior performed some of the experiments; Victor Segura and Elizabeth Guruceaga were in charge of all the bioinformatics analyses; Kathleen B&#x000f6;rner and Dirk Grimm prepared and provided the RNA samples from HIV-infected patients; and Puri Fortes conceived the project and the required experiments, provided the budget, interpreted the data, and wrote the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S7"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>The Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00548/abstract">http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00548/abstract</uri></p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><media xlink:href="Data_Sheet_1.ZIP"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Nerea Razquin for excellent technical assistance, Estanis Nistal, Ruben Hernandez, Cristian Smerdou, and Rafael Aldabe for influenza, adenovirus, SFV, and HCV, respectively.
