In addition, we identify combinations of chromatin changes, or signatures, that correlate with cocaine-dependent regulation of gene expression, including those involving pre-mRNA alternative splicing. Through bioinformatic prediction and biological validation, we identify one particular splicing factor, A2BP1(Rbfox1/Fox-1), which is enriched at genes that display certain chromatin signatures and contributes to drug-induced behavioral abnormalities.

Numerous studies to date have utilized gene expression microarrays to obtain an unbiased view of such alterations, and several transcription factors have been implicated in mediating some of these effects. Moreover, several target genes discovered with these approaches have been directly implicated in the complex cellular and behavioral plasticity induced in this reward circuitry associated with drug addiction. However, relatively little information is yet available concerning the detailed molecular steps through which such alterations in gene expression are induced, and available information is limited by the reliance to date on microarray technology.</p><p>Recently, epigenetic regulation, such as multiple histone modifications and DNA methylation, has emerged as a key mechanism of addiction-related phenomena
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Drugs of abuse such as cocaine have been shown to alter the expression levels of several histone- and DNA-modifying enzymes within key brain reward regions, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Importantly, these enzyme changes, which include altered levels of certain histone deacetylases and histone lysine methyltransferases, are associated with cocaine-induced changes in histone acetylation or lysine methylation at many specific candidate genes, which are already known to be involved in cocaine action
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recently, cross-talk has been demonstrated between regulation of histone acetylation and lysine methylation in NAc
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. While many gene-specific histone changes are in a direction commensurate with the altered enzyme expression levels, a large subset of observed changes are in the opposite direction, which further underscores the complexity of chromatin regulation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>To extend these candidate gene studies, we recently mapped cocaine-induced changes in the genome-wide binding of pan-acetylated H3, pan-acetylated H4, and dimethylated H3 (at both K9 and K27) in NAc by use of ChIP-chip assays (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by promoter microarrays)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This study identified hundreds of novel gene targets of cocaine, but was inherently limited in several important ways. First, ChIP-chip by design restricts analysis to proximal promoter regions of genes only, even though we know that much chromatin regulation occurs in other genic, as well as intergenic, regions. Second, recent evidence indicates that net levels of gene transcription result from the complex interplay of large numbers of chromatin modifications, which act in concert in ways that remain incompletely understood
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Third, genome-wide characterizations of gene expression in brain have to date relied mainly on microarrays, as opposed to RNA-seq, which provides unprecedented advantages such as more precise measurement of levels of transcripts and their splicing isoforms
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Finally, recent evidence from <italic>in vitro</italic> non-nervous tissues has suggested that alternative splicing is regulated by chromatin modifications at specific genes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As alternative splicing is a process by which pre-mRNAs are differentially spliced, and lead to the expression of several mRNAs from a single gene, it provides an essential mechanism that expands and diversifies the proteome
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, little is known about the contribution of alternative splicing to cocaine action or how it is influenced by epigenetic regulation in brain.</p><p>To address these limitations, we carried out a more comprehensive analysis of the cocaine-induced transcriptome and epigenome in the mouse NAc. We used ChIP-seq (ChIP followed by next-generation sequencing), which offers several advantages over ChIP-chip
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], to characterize numerous chromatin modifications within this brain region in response to repeated cocaine administration. We focused on several transactivation marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K36me3) and repression marks (H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3). These histone modifications were selected to cover enhancer (H3K4me1), promoter (H3K4me3, H3K27me3), gene body (H3K36me3), and intergenic (H3K9me2, H3K9me3) regions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We also analyzed binding of RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II). These ChIP-seq data were then overlaid onto RNA-seq data to capture cocaine-induced changes in gene expression, including those resulting from regulation of pre-mRNA alternative splicing.</p><p>Our findings identify many chromatin signatures - unique combinations of histone modifications that predict cocaine regulation of gene expression, a large portion of which is mediated by previously uncharacterized changes in alternative splicing. The robustness of this epigenomic analysis is further demonstrated by its ability to predict the involvement of a novel splicing factor, termed A2BP1 (also known as RBFOX1 or FOX-1), in cocaine action.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cocaine-regulated transcriptomic changes in mouse nucleus accumbens</title><p>To characterize the transcriptome of mouse NAc, we used RNA-seq to measure the expression levels of all polyA containing transcripts in NAc of mice treated chronically with cocaine or saline (control); we used a standard treatment regimen of daily 20&#x000a0;mg/kg intraperitoneal doses of cocaine for 7&#x000a0;days with animals analyzed 24&#x000a0;h after the last dose, a procedure known to induce numerous, highly validated molecular and cellular adaptations to the drug
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This procedure is also behaviorally relevant, as it induced locomotor sensitization, an extensively validated form of behavioral plasticity to repeated cocaine administration (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). To account for inter-animal variations, we obtained three biological replicates for each treatment group, with each replicate representing NAc pooled from five animals. Samples were sequenced by an Illumina HiSeq2000 machine. We obtained 93 to 97 million short reads of 100&#x000a0;bp from each replicate. Of these, 65 to 67% were successfully aligned to a reference gene database (Ensembl: Mus musculus, NCBIM37.62) by TopHat
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The quality of the data were assessed by the RNA-SeQC package
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], which revealed that approximately 95% and 81% of the mapped reads are intragenic and exonic, respectively, and that the sequencing data are not overrepresented by mitochondrial reads (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Overall, our aligned short reads represent 21,892,637,222 and 21,717,236,397 transcribed nucleotides for the mouse NAc transcriptome under cocaine and saline treatment, respectively. These data are sufficient to provide on average of approximately 183&#x000d7; coverage for mouse exomes under both conditions.</p><p>We used the Cufflinks package
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] to perform differential analysis for changes in gene expression. For our initial analysis, we used stringent false discovery rate (FDR) cutoffs of &#x0003c;10%, fold change &#x0003e;1.25, and Reads Per Kilobase transcript per Million reads (RPKM) &#x0003e;1, and identified 92 genes (61 increased, 31 decreased; Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>) that are differentially expressed in NAc after repeated cocaine administration (see Materials and methods). To confirm that the expression changes identified reflect the actions of repeated, not acute, cocaine treatment, we performed RNA-seq on NAc obtained from mice treated with a single dose of cocaine, with animals analyzed 24&#x000a0;h later. The data were analyzed the same way and passed all quality assessments mentioned above (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). We identified 55 genes (42 increased, 13 decreased; Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>) that are differentially expressed in NAc in response to a single cocaine dose, only 4 of which overlapped with the chronic cocaine-regulated genes. In addition, two of the four genes showed the opposite direction of regulation. We therefore conclude that the vast majority of gene expression changes induced by repeated cocaine are very different from those induced by acute cocaine.</p><p>On average, each protein coding gene in the reference database encodes 3.4 transcripts. For a coding gene, the transcripts may share the same transcriptional start site (TSS; that is, alternative splicing) or have different TSSs (that is, alternative promoter usage)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Interestingly, our analysis revealed that promoter usage and splicing changes are much more widespread than differential expression in response to repeated cocaine. For this analysis, we used Cufflinks with an FDR cutoff of only &#x0003c;10% . Although this approach would be expected to increase the number of false positive hits, it also reduces the number of false negative hits, which is important for our subsequent ability to overlay these RNA-seq data with epigenetic modifications (see below). This alternative analysis identified 1,772 and 1,739 TSS groups to have alternative promoter usage and alternative splicing (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), respectively, comprising approximately 5% of all TSS groups (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). Looking at individual transcripts, we also found 4,129 to be differentially expressed (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), comprising approximately 5% of all coding transcripts. A few examples of alternatively spliced genes are shown in Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>. We validated these RNA-seq data by confirming altered expression of key transcripts in independent tissue samples by use of Nanostring technology (Figure&#x000a0;

To understand the functional roles of these differentially spliced genes, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and identified 110 (FDR &#x0003c;10%, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test) enriched GO terms (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>). We created an enrichment map
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B) to represent these functional terms and found that the differentially spliced genes are associated with very diverse functions and cellular components. With respect to molecular functions, two major groups are involved in nucleotide binding and ion binding, with one minor group participating in protein localization. In terms of cellular components, four major groups are involved in membrane enclosed lumen, actin cytoskeleton, cell junction, and membrane bounded vesicle, with four minor groups involving chromatin remodeling complex, synapse, neuron projection, and mitochondrion. These results suggest that differentially transcribed or spliced genes play substantial roles in the transcriptional perturbations induced in NAc by chronic cocaine.</p></sec><sec><title>Cocaine-regulated epigenomic changes in mouse nucleus accumbens</title><p>The lasting behavioral abnormalities induced by chronic cocaine treatment have been attributed, in part, to epigenomic changes involving post-translational modifications to histone tails
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We thus chose six histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3), as well as total RNA pol II, to investigate the epigenomic changes induced in mouse NAc by repeated cocaine exposure. They were chosen to ensure coverage of gene promoters, gene bodies, enhancers, as well as intergenic regions and to reflect mechanisms of gene activation and repression (see Background). We used three biological replicates for each mark, with each replicate again representing tissue pooled from five animals. After mapping the reads to the mouse reference genome, we removed the ones that are redundant at the same location and strand (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>). We thereby obtained uniquely aligned, non-redundant reads with a total number varying from 8 to 465 million for each of the seven marks under each condition (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>). Overall, these ChIP-seq data represent a highly informative collection of histone modifications and RNA pol II enrichment, comprising total read counts of 1,105,314,297 and 1,114,544,836 (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>) under cocaine and saline treatment, respectively.</p><p>To determine the enrichment for the 42 (7 marks&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 conditions&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3 replicates) ChIP-seq samples at genic regions, we generated plots (Figure S4A-G in Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>) at TSSs, genebodies, and transcriptional end sites using a program called ngs.plot
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The enrichment patterns for the seven marks from our study are highly similar with those generated in cell culture studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], indicating that the ChIP-seq data are of good quality and that <italic>in vivo</italic> brain histone modifications share similar gross distribution patterns with other tissues. Cocaine does not cause significant changes in any of these gross distribution patterns (Figure S4A-G in Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). We therefore presumed that cocaine-induced changes are localized to specific genomic sites. To reveal the location-specific changes for each of the seven marks, we used diffReps
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] to identify the chromatin modification sites (termed differential sites) that show significant differences between repeated cocaine and saline conditions. We identified thousands to tens of thousands of differential sites (ranging from 200&#x000a0;bp to 1,200&#x000a0;bp in size) for the various marks (FDR &#x0003c;10%; Figure S4H in Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>; Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S10">10</xref>). Together, these differential sites represent a massive amount of epigenomic changes induced in mouse NAc by cocaine. Further examination revealed appreciable changes in the enrichment of most of these marks at differential sites (Figure S4A-G in Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). For example, H3K9me2 displays significant dynamics at its differential sites, with robust increases or decreases (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B,C) induced by cocaine despite the fact that it shows a 'flat-line' like pattern of enrichment at the genebody level genome-wide (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). This further strengthens our notion that cocaine-regulated chromatin changes are highly localized and may correspond to specific functions.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Repeated cocaine-regulated epigenome measured by ChIP-seq.

In total, 248 canonical pathways were found to be enriched (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test). To identify the most important pathways, we ranked them by co-occurrence score among the seven marks and examined the top 30 (Additional files
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref> and
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S13">13</xref>). We found that many of the top ranked pathways have been previously implicated in drug addiction, for example, 'CREB signaling in neurons' (top 2, score&#x02009;=&#x02009;37.5), 'axonal guidance signaling' (top 7, score&#x02009;=&#x02009;28.2), 'synaptic long term potentiation' (top 8, score&#x02009;=&#x02009;27.8), and 'WNT/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling' (top 9, score&#x02009;=&#x02009;26.5). In addition to the canonical pathways, we created three customized gene lists to represent additional knowledge of addiction pathophysiology and also found them to be enriched: 'actin cytoskeleton' (score&#x02009;=&#x02009;25.0); 'synaptic plasticity' (score&#x02009;=&#x02009;17.3); and 'growth factors' (score&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.2). This further demonstrates that the chromatin changes we identified are highly specific to brain functions that contribute to addiction. Interestingly, the two marks that are associated with gene activation, H3K4me3 and RNA pol II, show much more pronounced enrichment than the other five marks among the top 30 pathways (Additional files

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We found in our dataset that all seven marks show local enrichment at exons to varying degrees and are correlated with transcriptional levels under basal conditions (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>). More specifically, exonic enrichments of H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, and total RNA pol II are positively correlated with transcriptional levels; that of H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3 are negatively correlated.</p><p>Despite these correlations, the interplay between histone marks and splicing regulators is complicated. For example, the repressive mark H3K9me3 has recently been found to facilitate the inclusion of variant exons of several genes via a mechanism that involves decreased RNA pol II elongation rate
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Another study
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] investigated the roles of several histone marks in selection of two mutually exclusive exons between two human cell lines, and found that two groups (H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and H3K9me1 versus H3K36me3 and H3K4me1) of histone marks regulate the two exons in the opposite direction. However, how extensive and how exactly the histone modifications influence alternative splicing <italic>in vivo</italic>, especially under pathological conditions (for example, after chronic cocaine exposure), is unknown.</p><p>RNA-seq provides unique advantages for alternative splicing analysis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Some programs achieve this goal by looking at the read counts of individual exons
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, transcripts often share common exons whose read counts thus convey nothing unique about each transcript&#x02019;s expression levels. On the other hand, each transcript must contain unique exonic regions, which provide information about the transcript&#x02019;s expression level. The program we used - Cufflinks - assigns reads proportionally to each individual transcript by solving an optimization problem on the unique exonic read counts
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In line with this approach, we needed a method to describe the chromatin changes associated with each transcript. We therefore devised a systematic approach called 'chromatin signature' that allowed us to profile the epigenomic changes associated with each transcript in a unified fashion (Additional files

<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S16">16</xref>). In this analysis, it was important to use our broader Cufflinks evaluation of differential transcriptional changes, since it reduces false negative discovery rates, while overlaying such data with multiple chromatin endpoints achieves the higher stringency needed to reduce false positive discovery.</p><p>Briefly, we first classified all exons into six different types (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S16">16</xref>): 'promoter', 'canonical', 'variant', 'alternative acceptor', 'alternative donor', and 'polyA'. Each exon type represents a unique combination of exon-intron boundaries. We also derived the neighboring intronic regions (150&#x000a0;bp) for each exon, which are also implicated in splicing regulation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In total, we defined 335,779 and 441,648 unique exonic and intronic regions on the genome and calculated each mark&#x02019;s enrichment difference between cocaine and saline at each region (Additional file

We removed the shared regions (that is, canonical exons and introns at canonical acceptor and donor sites) from consideration as they do not convey distinct chromatin information between transcripts. This results in 13 different types of regions (Additional file

We defined the binding patterns of six histone modifications and of RNA pol II genome-wide under repeated cocaine and saline conditions and correlated these patterns with the repeated cocaine-induced transcriptome. We show that different histone modifications act in a combinational fashion to create chromatin signatures that correlate with altered gene expression and, more specifically, with dramatic cocaine regulation of alternative splicing. These findings not only provide fundamentally new insight into the mechanisms by which repeated exposure to cocaine regulates gene transcription in NAc, but they also provide important information concerning the basic mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in the brain <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Genome-wide mapping of histone modifications has emerged as a powerful means for characterizing the functional consequences of chromatin structure
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, most available studies are derived from cultured cell systems during differentiation, development, or reprogramming. Whether similar rules defined in these homogeneous cell populations <italic>in vitro</italic> also apply to the brain <italic>in vivo</italic> is the key step to expand future epigenetic research. Our profiling of multiple histone marks in mouse NAc thus presents a much needed public reference resource for the neuro-epigenome, as well as detailed knowledge of global chromatin changes that occur in a discrete region of adult brain in response to repeated cocaine administration. We found that the basal patterns of the six histone marks studied are similar to those demonstrated in simpler systems. However, within these constraints, cocaine induced robust modifications in each of these marks at numerous genes and non-genic loci. We also found that the various histone marks carry different weights for transcriptional regulation, and that the combinatory pattern of modifications (chromatin signature) ultimately defines the transcriptional response. Our expectation is that analysis of still additional histone modifications will yield an ever more comprehensive and accurate epigenetic regulation network. Selective analysis of the cocaine-induced epigenomes of the several neuronal and non-neuronal cell types in NAc, something not yet technically feasible, would further improve our understanding of such networks. Nevertheless, our findings to date highlight the power of histone modification profiling for identifying diverse functional groups and target genes involved in cocaine action.</p><p>An unexpected finding of our study is the dominant contribution of changes in alternative splicing induced in NAc in response to chronic cocaine. In contrast to approximately 100 genes that show cocaine regulation of total transcript levels, we demonstrated an order of magnitude more genes that display altered splicing. These data indicate that previous studies that relied on microarray analysis and thereby focused on total gene transcription without discrimination of isoform differences dramatically underestimated the degree to which cocaine modifies the NAc transcriptome. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is a major source of protein diversity in higher eukaryotes, a process particularly important for genes expressed in the brain
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Though there have been sporadic papers on splicing regulation of particular genes in addiction models
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], the present study is the first comprehensive analysis of splicing regulation in response to chronic cocaine. Given the fact that products of different splicing isoforms often serve unique cellular functions, the characterization of individual transcripts instead of the whole gene represents an important advance for understanding the molecular adaptations that underlie cocaine action.</p><p>Though alternative splicing was traditionally thought to be a post-transcriptional event, based largely on the primary sequence of the RNA, recent research has demonstrated that pre-mRNA splicing is intimately linked to transcription and the chromatin architecture of the gene
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The spliceosome is proposed to physically link to the transcriptional machinery through interactions between splicing factors and RNA pol II, and specific histone modifications have been shown to regulate alternative splicing in cell culture. For example, depolarization of cultured neurons triggers the skipping of exon 18 of the neural cell adhesion gene, a change accompanied by H3K9 hyper-acetylation around the exon
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. The effect of depolarization can be further potentiated by treating the cells with a histone deacetylase inhibitor. As another example, the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (<italic>Fgfr2</italic>) gene is alternatively spliced into two isoforms, <italic>Fgfr2-IIIb</italic> and <italic>-IIIc</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The gene is enriched with H3K36me3 and H3K4me1 along the alternatively spliced region in mesenchymal cells where exon IIIc is transcribed, and with H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 in epithelial cells where exon IIIb is transcribed. Importantly, modulation of H3K36me3 or H3K4me3 levels by overexpression or down-regulation of their respective histone methyltransferases changes the tissue-specific alternative splicing pattern in a predictable fashion in cultured cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. These observations suggest that localized changes in histone modification signatures along an alternatively spliced region can change splicing outcome. Furthermore, it provides a novel means of regulating gene transcription (splicing) through epigenetic manipulation.</p><p>However, studies to date have been mainly performed in cell culture with a candidate gene approach. How histone modifications relate to alternative splicing at a more global level, within the brain <italic>in vivo</italic> and in response to environmental stimuli, remains unknown. By obtaining genome-wide maps of several histone modifications within a discrete region of brain under chronic cocaine conditions coupled with genome-wide analysis of alternative splicing patterns, we have identified 29 chromatin signatures that differentially predict alterations in gene expression and, more specifically, regulation of alternative splicing. The genes are highly concentrated in certain functional groups. These findings indicate that control of pre-mRNA alternative splicing by histone modifications is a general feature of biological regulation. Moreover, an unbiased motif analysis inferred unique sets of transcription factors and splicing factors that are associated with individual chromatin signatures.</p><p>As a proof of principle, we selected to further analyze one candidate splicing factor, A2BP1, which has not previously been studied in cocaine action. A2BP1 is a neuron-specific splicing factor that promotes either exon inclusion or skipping. It has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, mental retardation, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. The protein kinase WNK3 binds to A2BP1 and suppresses its splicing activity through a kinase activity-dependent cytoplasmic re-localization of A2BP1
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. Our observation of nuclear translocation of A2BP1 after repeated cocaine exposure suggests a robust role of A2BP1 in alternative splicing even though there is no change in total cellular levels of the protein. Increased nuclear levels of A2BP1 might facilitate adaptive alterations of pre-mRNA splicing of A2BP1 target transcripts that affect cocaine responses. Analysis of brain-specific <italic>A2bp1</italic> knockout mice revealed altered synaptic transmission, increased membrane excitability, and a predisposition to seizures
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Though few changes are seen in total transcript abundance, <italic>A2bp1</italic>-deficient brain displays a variety of splicing changes related to genes mediating synaptic transmission and membrane excitability. Similar implication of A2BP1 targets in neural transmission, neuronal development, and maturation genes has been demonstrated in autism spectrum disorder and human neural stem cell studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Through bioinformatic analysis, our genome-wide data predicted that A2BP1 associates with H3K4me3 in concert with the regulated splicing of target genes after repeated cocaine administration. Indeed, we verified that A2BP1 is associated with H3K4me3 in NAc in response to repeated cocaine administration. Moreover, we show that conditional knockdown of <italic>A2bp1</italic> from the adult NAc dramatically impairs rewarding responses to cocaine, and we confirmed regulation of several predicted A2BP1 target genes in NAc whose regulation by repeated cocaine is lost upon knockdown of this splicing factor. In the future, it will be interesting to further investigate the mechanisms by which cocaine triggers A2BP1 translocation to the nucleus and the means underlying A2BP1 regulation of its gene targets, work which will contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of cocaine action.</p><p>It is important to emphasize that sequencing data obtained from brain is inherently noisier than that obtained from simpler systems such as cultured cells. One prominent example is <italic>Ttr</italic>, which encodes transthyretin, important for thyroid hormone and retinol transport. It is highly enriched in choroid plexus
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>], although expression in retina and certain central neurons has been reported
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. As can be seen from Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S24">24</xref>, although our differential analysis shows that chronic cocaine regulates <italic>Ttr</italic> expression in NAc, this conclusion must be viewed with caution given the great variability in the cocaine and saline replicates. We therefore analyzed our entire differential gene list for genes that show similar large variance. Only three and two of the regulated genes show such variability in acute and chronic data, respectively, which underscores the importance of utilizing multiple statistical tests when evaluating RNA-seq datasets. The analyses also demonstrate that the differential lists reported in this study are generally sound, as substantiated further by the several levels of validation provided. Meanwhile, the source of the variability seen in <italic>Ttr</italic> and a small fraction of other genes remains unknown. One possible source of variability might be dissections of NAc. To gain insight into this possibility, we analyzed classes of genes known to be expressed either at very high levels or at relatively low levels in NAc versus surrounding brain regions, including the choroid plexus (Additional file
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S25">25</xref>). Among a list of over 100 choroid plexus-enriched genes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>] compared to striatum, only <italic>Ttr</italic> shows high variability; all of the others are consistently depleted in our datasets. The data also reveal strong consistency across replicates for NAc-enriched and -depleted genes. Thus, while dissecting a micronucleus from brain by necessity introduces some variability, these data argue for considerable consistency in our dissections. The analysis does, however, highlight systematic differences in expression levels of some genes seen across experiments: replicates are highly consistent within one experiment (for example, acute saline) but vary more between experiments (for example, acute versus chronic saline). Such 'batch' effects may reflect the different basal state of animals used at different times of experimentation, variability that is inherent in any <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment.</p><p>In any event, the results of this study confirm the important insight provided by the multiple platforms of analysis undertaken to better understand how repeated exposure to cocaine alters gene expression in NAc. By further mining these data, and carrying out similar analyses at different time points of cocaine exposure and cocaine treatment paradigms with additional epigenetic marks, it will be possible to ultimately explore the complete complex program of gene regulation that underlies important aspects of drug addiction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cocaine treatment and nucleus accumbens dissection</title><p>Adult male C57BL/6&#x000a0;J mice (Jackson) 8&#x000a0;weeks old were used in this study.
