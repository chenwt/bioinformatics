Previous studies indicated that VM cells were the result of homeostatic proliferation (HP) resembling the proliferation observed in a lymphopenic environment. Here we demonstrate that HP is ongoing in lymphoreplete mice, the degree of which is dictated by the number of naive CD8 T cells with a sufficiently high affinity for self-antigen interacting with peripheral IL-15. VM cell transcriptional profiles suggest a capacity to mediate protective immunity via antigen non-specific bystander killing, a function we show is dependent on IL-15. Finally, we show a VM-like population of human cells that accumulate with age and traffic to the liver, displaying phenotypic and functional attributes consistent with the bystander protective functions of VM cells identified in the mouse. These data identify developmental and functional attributes of VM cells, including their likely role in protective immunity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms11291-i1.jpg"/>Virtual memory T cells are CD8 T cells with memory phenotype present in unimmunized mice.

Many of these MP subsets, such as CD8 intraepithelial lymphocytes or innate CD8s, have a well-described development that depends on thymic signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Much less is known about the development of another MP subset, CD44hi/CD122hi/CD49dlo CD8 cells, which is specific for nominal antigen but present in antigen-inexperienced mice. While we and our collaborators coined the term &#x02018;virtual memory' (VM) to described this cellular subset, the presence of MP cells in the unprimed host had been long been known<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, but were largely assumed to represent cells that had undergone antigen-mediated expansion to microbiome- or food-associated antigens. As a result, the repertoire of these MP cells was not expected to possess any cells specific to nominal/novel antigens except as a result of cross-reactivity to related antigens. In our original description of VM cells, we demonstrated their development depended on homeostatic, not antigenic, cues in the environment, and that within their ranks were included T cells specific to nominal antigens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Since then, we and others have shown that VM cells arise in the periphery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> in a PLZF/IL-4/NKT cell-independent, but interleukin (IL)-15-dependent, manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, once developed they can respond vigorously to cytokines such as IL-4 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) and type I interferon (IFN)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, and that they accumulate in the aged host<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. As with memory cells in general, VM cells make IFN&#x003b3; in response to stimulation with IL-12 and IL-18 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), and, similar to homeostatic proliferation (HP) memory T cells derived from a lymphopenic environment, are efficient in mediating a protective response against a cognate antigen-expressing pathogen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Considering that VM cells make up 15&#x02013;25&#x00025; of the unprimed CD8 pool (in unmanipulated B6 mice), functional benefits commensurate with their prevalence in the repertoire have yet to be clarified.</p><p>The identification of VM cells contributes to the growing recognition that, much similar to the antigen-experienced repertoire of memory T cells, the antigen-inexperienced repertoire displays substantial heterogeneity. More recent evidence shows that the naive (CD44lo) CD8 pool in the periphery has different functionality dependent upon selection signals received in the thymus. Indeed, data have shown that T cells emerging from the thymus with higher affinity for self-antigens (expressing high levels of CD5 [CD5hi]) display a distinct advantage in becoming engaged in both homeostatic and antigen-mediated response when compared with their CD5lo counterparts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Recent data examining the gene expression profile of CD5hi and CD5lo naive T cells suggests that CD5hi cells are transcriptionally poised to engage both proliferative and effector functions far more rapidly than CD5lo cells of the same specificity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. While these studies are informative as to the naive T-cell response to antigen in an inflammatory setting, the cues by which a naive phenotype T cell within the periphery integrates tonic and cytokine signals in a non-lymphopenic environment to become a member of the VM pool are still poorly defined. Furthermore, VM cells have thus far only been studied in mice, although putative human analogues have been suggested<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>In the present work, we now provide conclusive evidence that VM cell development is a natural consequence of the heterogeneity of the naive CD8 T-cell pool. We show that VM cells are not only derived from cells with increased affinity for self-antigens but they also have higher affinity for their cognate antigens than naive phenotype T cells of the same specificity. As has been described for naive T cells during an antigen-specific response, naive CD8 T cells of the highest self-affinity (as measured by CD5) are the most likely ones to undergo IL-15-dependent HP that leads to VM development in the lymphoreplete host. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) comparing naive and VM subsets confirms recently published data on naive T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and further connects VM cell development to the CD5hi naive repertoire. Differences between CD5hi naive, VM and antigen-experienced memory cells in their expression of NKG2D and GzmB further predicted a role for VM cells in mediating bystander immune protection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Surprisingly, in the absence of IL-15, VM expression of granzyme B and NKG2D was nearly ablated, as was their capacity to mediate bystander protection. These data give a new functional role for VM cells during exposure to pathogens independent of antigen specificity as well as a new role for IL-15 during the primary response. Finally, we show that a previously identified VM-like subset in humans traffics extensively to the liver, accumulates with age and collectively displays the phenotypic and functional traits identified in the mouse.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>CD5 expression correlates with increase VM development</title><p>VM cells are CD8&#x0002b;CD44hi,CD49dlo, allowing their reliable separation from naive (CD44lo) and antigen-experienced memory cells (CD44hi,CD49dhi)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Other than the fact that these cells arise in the periphery and are dependent on IL-15, little else was known about VM development. A non-stochastic mechanism was initially suggested by the difference in CD5 expression between VM and naive cells. Expression of CD5 reflects a T cell's affinity for the self-ligands on which it was selected in the thymus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Numerous labs have reported that naive T cells expressing higher CD5 show increased proliferation in response to lymphopenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> or antigenic stimulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> relative to their CD5lo counterparts. Analysis of bulk naive and VM CD8&#x0002b; T cells within an unmanipulated B6 host for CD5 expression levels revealed a statistically significant increased expression of CD5 on all VM cells relative to naive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Further, CD5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts showed an increase in VM cells relative to wild-type (WT; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), allowing us to rule out any role for direct CD5 signalling in VM cell formation. Considering T cells developing in the CD5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> host experience stronger T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation during selection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, these data in conjunction with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> are consistent with the conclusion that the VM pool was likely derived from cells that had been selected with high affinity/avidity on self-antigens in the thymus.</p><p>We previously showed that VM cells are present even in TCR transgenic crossed onto Rag-deficient hosts (Rag<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>; ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), a result that supported the conclusion that VM cells develop independently of their encounter with cognate antigens. In comparing VM cells from WT B6 mice with T cells from either the gBT TCR transgenic (specific for a peptide from herpes simplex virus (HSV) glycoprotein B) or the F5 TCR transgenic (specific for a peptide from influenza nucleoprotein (NP)), each crossed to the Rag<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (gBTxRag, F5xRag), we noted a direct correlation between CD5 expression and the frequency of VM cells. T cells from the gBT and F5 TCR transgenics have higher and lower CD5 expression levels, respectively, as compared with the polyclonal repertoire in WT B6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. When plotted against the percentage of T cells in these hosts that are of VM phenotype, we obtained a near straight-line relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). This was further evidence that the affinity of a T cell for selecting ligands in the thymus (as gauged by CD5 expression) may be a predictor of a cell's propensity to convert to a VM phenotype.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>VM derive from naive cells with high self-affinity</title><p>It was conceivable that VMs had increased CD5 levels as a result of cellular activation, as some data have suggested<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, giving the appearance of having increased affinity for self-antigen. To establish a causal relationship between CD5 expression and propensity for VM conversion, we isolated CD5hi and CD5loCD44lo polyclonal CD8&#x0002b; T cells from unmanipulated B6 WT mice and adoptively transferred them into separate congenic, lymphoreplete WT mice. After 3 weeks, the donor cells were isolated and phenotyped. As anticipated, a significantly greater percentage of the transferred CD44loCD5hi cells had acquired a VM phenotype (CD44hi, CD49dlo) as compared with the transferred CD5lo cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>), in agreement with recent data from Jameson and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. The few VM cells derived from the CD5lo transfers maintained a lower expression of CD5 compared with CD5hi-derived VM converts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Although we cannot discount the possibility of minor fluctuations in CD5 levels, these data indicate that CD5 expression is not markedly upregulated during the process of VM conversion. Regardless of minor changes in CD5 expression, these data are consistent with a causal relationship between the CD5 expression profile of a naive CD8&#x0002b; T cell and its propensity to convert into VM cell within the periphery.</p><p>CD5hi naive T cells have also shown an increased response to antigenic challenge<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The preferential responsiveness of CD5hi over CD5lo T cells can be observed even between T cells with identical TCRs, effectively separating the responsiveness of the T cell from its affinity for cognate antigen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Using T cells from the gBTxRag host, we examined whether the conversion of CD5hi T cells to VM could similarly occur irrespective of TCR affinity. Similar to the results with bulk naive T cells, transferred CD44loCD5hi gBT cells were significantly more likely to convert to VM phenotype compared with transferred CD44loCD5lo gBT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have looked at the relationship between CD5 levels and affinity for foreign antigen, but none included VM cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. As such, we used a tetramer staining and magnetic enrichment method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> to compare naive and VM cells' affinity for the vaccinia virus epitope, B8R. Using flow analysis software, we divided the tetramer mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) for each event against its own CD3 MFI. This method corrects for any reduced tetramer staining that is a result of reduced TCR levels and produces a quantification of relative affinity of the TCR for antigen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. VM cells demonstrated a significantly higher apparent affinity for cognate antigen as compared with naive phenotype T cells of the same specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). This was not an artefact of B8R-specific T cells, as this pattern held true for T cells specific for Ova, HSVgB and LCMV GP33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p><p>These data supported a possible connection between a T cell's affinity for self-ligands and its affinity for cognate antigens. However, naive and memory T cells are known to interact with multimeric peptide:major histocompatibility complex (MHC) with very different avidities due to changes in cell membrane composition and not TCR affinity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Again, analysing T cells from the TCR transgenics, we observed that VM cells with the same TCR as their naive counterparts maintained an increased tet:CD3 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>), consistent with their having an overall higher avidity for peptide:MHC. Although it is still conceivable that VM cells in the polyclonal repertoire also have an increased affinity for cognate antigens, this parameter is obscured by an increase in avidity endowed by their conversion to MP. Overall, these data continue to indicate that the VM pool is not derived stochastically from the entire naive T-cell repertoire. Rather, it is derived from the subset of naive T cells that were selected on higher affinity self-ligands, ultimately producing MP cells with increased binding to multimeric cognate peptide:MHC as well.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>IL-15 availability dictates VM cell conversion</title><p>Previous reports indicated that CD5 expression also predicts the responsiveness of CD8&#x0002b; T cells to undergo HP in response to IL-2/15 under non-lymphopenic conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. This fit well with our data, as we and others have already established that VM cells form in the periphery as a result of IL-15-dependent HP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Combined, these data suggest that the size of the VM pool is dictated both by the affinity of the T-cell repertoire as well as the availability of IL-15. To test this prediction, we injected the IL-15<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> host with IL-15/R&#x003b1; complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> (IL-15c). As shown previously, an IL-15<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> host has no VM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Four days post-IL-15c injection, there is a dose-dependent increase in VM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). There was also an inverse relationship between the CD5 geometric mean fluorescence intensity (gMFI) of the VM cells generated and the dose of IL-15c injected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). This was not because IL-15 stimulation caused reduced CD5 expression, as OT1 VM cells transferred into a naive recipient maintained the same levels of CD5 with or without subsequent IL-15c injection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Thus, as more IL-15 becomes available, T cells with lower affinity for self-antigens convert to VM phenotype, such that the gMFI of CD5 on the VM cells becomes indistinguishable from that of the naive phenotype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Collectively, these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>) indicate that the pool of VM phenotype cells arises as a result of naive T cells with the high affinity for self-antigens responding to limiting amounts of IL-15 trans-presented in the periphery.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>RNA profile shows homeostatic and inflammatory sensitivity</title><p>The transcription factor Eomes and its induction of the IL-2/15R&#x003b2; CD122 are essential for the CD8&#x0002b; T-cell response to IL-15 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). These gene products are also elevated in VM cells relative to the total naive pool<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. We observed a substantial difference between CD44loCD5lo and CD44loCD5hi T cells in their expression of these proteins, with essentially all Eomes and CD122 expression contained within the CD5hi's (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). To better examine gene expression, we performed RNAseq by comparing the total RNA expression in CD5loCD44lo, CD5hiCD44lo and VM cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). By comparing the CD5lo and CD5hi naive T-cell profiles, we found &#x0223c;600 genes that were differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>); a gene set that was in good agreement with recently published RNAseq data from Fulton <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed &#x02018;cytokine/cytokine receptor interaction' as the dominant cellular pathway associated with these genetic differences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified 10 cellular functions as significantly increased (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>); the majority of which related to the regulation of life and death pathways. Curiously, other than the chemokine receptors <italic>Cxcr3</italic> and <italic>Ifngr1</italic>, genes that might predict increased responsiveness to the inflammatory milieu (for example, <italic>Cxcr5</italic>, <italic>Il18rap</italic>, <italic>Il12rb1</italic>, <italic>Il18r1</italic>, <italic>Stat4</italic> and <italic>Ccr2</italic>) only showed substantial changes in expression (&#x0003e;15 transcripts per million) after differentiation to VM cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, the greatest increases were seen in cytokine genes associated with homeostatic cytokine responsiveness (<italic>Il2rb</italic>, <italic>Eomes</italic> and <italic>Il4r</italic>).</p><p>In comparing gene expression between CD5hi T cells and VM cells, substantially more genes (1909; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>) and gene ontology pathways (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>) showed differential expression, although &#x02018;cytokine signalling' continued to be the major associated KEGG pathway (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).

These molecules indicate that the conversion of CD5hi naive T cells into VM cells results in their increased sensitivity to both homeostatic and inflammatory cues, consistent with the functional attributes of VM cells previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>VM cells effect bystander protection</title><p>Besides showing strong upregulation of cytokine and chemokine signalling networks, the RNAseq data also showed that VM cells potently express molecules (IL-12R, IL-18R, IFN&#x003b3;, GrzB and NKG2D) known to enhance innate-like effector functions, which have been connected to so-called &#x02018;bystander protection' of memory CD8&#x0002b; T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.

Importantly, however, the presence of the irrelevant CD4&#x0002b; T cells prevents canonical lymphopenia-induced T-cell expansion of any transferred T cells.

As previously published<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, OTI cells protected against LM-ova challenge, mediating a substantial reduction in splenic bacterial CFUs. gBT cells also protected against LM-ova challenge to a magnitude that was, surprisingly, indistinguishable from that mediated by OTI cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>).

Our data now reveal that IL-15 is also necessary for maximal expression of these effector molecules in the presence or absence of inflammation.

However, maintaining expression of the effector molecules necessary for this function is dependent on the continued presence of IL-15.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Trafficking of VM cells</title><p>The unique profile of chemokine receptor and effector molecule expression, (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>) and adhesion marker (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>) expression in VM cells revealed by the RNAseq data suggested unique tissue trafficking preferences of VM cells as compared with naive. We therefore determined the tissue tropism of VM cells, first focusing on the steady-state distribution of CD8 T cells in unmanipulated, adult (&#x0003e;5 weeks) mice. Using intravenous injection of a labelled anti-CD8b antibody injection to discriminate against vascular and tissue-resident T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, we isolated various tissues and determined relative percentages of naive, VM and antigen-experienced memory cells by flow cytometry. Perhaps, most striking is the significant proportion of the liver-resident T cells that are VM cells, being generally upwards of 60&#x02013;70&#x00025;. Previous studies have described the presence of a considerable pool of memory T cells in the liver<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, largely assumed to be antigen experienced. Our data presented here indicate that these liver-associated memory cells are overwhelmingly VM cells. In contrast to the liver, the small intestine has essentially no VM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>), consistent with their lack of CCR9 and &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>).

The bacterial load in the small intestine was the same after either naive or VM T-cell transfers, indicating that, at least for the gut, VM cells did not display any increased protective capacity relative to naive T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Bacterial loads in the spleen, however, recapitulated our previous protection assays, showing increased protection in mice transferred with VM cells over that of naive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Thus, while VM cells did not provide increased gut-specific protection, they still mediated potent systemic protection against an infection instigated via a gut-specific route.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Phenotypic similarities in putative human VM cells</title><p>Thus far, VM cells have been documented only in mice, and it was not clear whether humans produced an equivalent subset. Establishing human equivalents of mouse cellular subsets is often complicated by the disparity in surface marker expression between the two species. Given its centrality in governing mouse VM development, we initially focused on IL-15 responsiveness as a possible identifier of human VM cells. In contrast to CD5 expression in the mouse, human T-cell expression of CD5 is progressively decreased during the process of memory T-cell differentiation. Further, the T cells with the lowest CD5 expression have the highest response to IL-15, express the highest levels of CD122 and are CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/CD27- (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Although these markers place the putative VM cells within a subset previously considered terminally differentiated (terminal effector memory RA&#x0002b;), they bear considerable similarity to mouse VM cells in their higher expression of CD122, responsiveness to IL-15 and expression of both memory and naive phenotypic markers. Furthermore, when analysing Nur77 and Eomes expression in CD45RA&#x0002b;, RO- CD8&#x0002b; T cells, there was a clear increase in both molecules as CD27 levels drop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). The Nur77 profile suggests a higher level of basal TCR interactions (higher self-affinity), whereas the Eomes expression suggests a history of exposure to IL-15.</p><p>A cell type with a very similar phenotype (CD45RA&#x0002b;CD122hiEomes&#x0002b;) was previously observed in fetal spleen and thymus, although the population was markedly reduced in cord blood and postnatal thymus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Recently, the Eomes&#x0002b; cells within the CD45RA&#x0002b; CD8&#x0002b; T cells were shown to be better identified by co-staining with pan-KIR and NKG2A antibodies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The functional capacity of these CD45RA&#x0002b;Eomes&#x0002b;KIR&#x0002b;NKG2A&#x0002b; T cells was essentially identical to mouse VM cells: coexpressing Tbet and producing IFN&#x003b3; in response to IL-12/18 stimulation. Using these markers, we confirmed the observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b,c</xref>) that this subset represents a sizable fraction of total circulating adult (&#x0223c;5&#x00025;) and cord blood (&#x0223c;1&#x00025;) CD45RA&#x0002b; T cells.</p><p>The presence of these cells in cord blood indicated that it was not necessary for them to be derived from antigen-experienced memory T cells, consistent with their designation as potential VM cells. Besides preferentially trafficking to the liver in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>), VM cells also accumulate with age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. We reasoned that if CD45RA&#x0002b; KIR&#x0002b;NKG2A&#x0002b; T cells were VM, then they might display similar trafficking patterns and age distributions in humans. We therefore compared the frequency of CD45RA&#x0002b; KIR&#x0002b;NKG2A&#x0002b;Eomes&#x0002b; T cells from normal human liver samples with that observed in the blood. In addition, we examined the frequency of these cells in non-diseased human spleen samples from patients ranging between 30 and 70 years old. As in the mouse, we found the frequency of these cells markedly elevated in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>). Furthermore, we saw a reasonable correlation between age and frequency of KIR&#x0002b;NKG2A&#x0002b;Eomes&#x0002b; T cells, with older patients achieving frequencies of 20&#x02013;30&#x00025; of CD45RA&#x0002b; T cells in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that CD45RA&#x0002b; KIR&#x0002b;NKG2A&#x0002b;Eomes&#x0002b; T cells may represent the human equivalent of VM cells.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>We present above three major findings regarding the development and functional properties of VM cells. First, we show that the development of VM cells is not a stochastic process, but rather proceeds as a result of T cells with high affinity for self-antigens responding to IL-15 in the periphery. The end result is an antigen-inexperienced memory T-cell repertoire skewed towards having a higher affinity for self-antigens and higher avidity for foreign antigens. The fact that all of these events proceed in the lymphoreplete host indicates that HP occurs in the WT environment in the absence of overt lymphopenia. Second, besides having higher affinity for self-antigens, VM cells also express adhesion, chemotactic and effector molecules that facilitate an &#x02018;innate-like' response to inflammatory cues. The combination of these attributes make VM cells ideally suited for mediating both antigen-specific and bystander protective immunity even against infectious challenges that have never previously been encountered. Third, the collective properties of IL-15 sensitivity, apparent affinity for self-antigen, sensitivity to the inflammatory milieu and immediate effector functions are maintained in a unique population of cells that most likely represent the human VM equivalent. These human VM cells additionally reflect their mouse VM counterparts in their preferential trafficking to the liver and their increasing presence in the repertoire during ageing.</p><p>The predisposition of CD5hi naive T cells to proliferate in response to antigen or a lymphopenic environment over their CD5lo counterparts is well established<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. It now seems clear that the central determinant favouring the response of CD5hi T cells over CD5lo T cells is not dictated by the TCR specificity or its affinity for cognate antigen. Recent experiments from the Jameson and Allen labs convincingly showed that T-cell responsiveness during antigen challenge was stratified by CD5 expression, even when using a fixed TCR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Jameson and colleagues proposed that the sensitivity of CD5hi T cells to inflammatory cues facilitated their CD5-stratified response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Our data presented here are in general agreement, but further suggest that sensitivity to IL-15 may be central to this increased responsiveness. This sensitivity may be related to more than just expression of receptor components. For example, Surh and colleagues suggested that an increased sensitivity to IL-2/15 was due to the incorporation of their receptors into lipid raft microdomains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. That said, as we have shown here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a&#x02013;c</xref>), there are indeed changes in the expression of gene products necessary for transmission of cytokine signals (<italic>Il2rb</italic>, <italic>Eomes</italic> and <italic>Il4r</italic>), which progressively increase along the CD5lo-memory differentiation continuum (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). However, this is not true for the receptors for IL-7, IL-12 or the common gamma receptor, on which signalling through IL-2, -4, -7 and -15 depends. Thus, the increased efficiency of cytokine signalling in naive CD5hi and VM cells is likely influenced by both progressive expression of signalling components and a subcellular organization that is optimized for signal transduction.</p><p>These data ultimately support a model in which selection in the thymus on high-affinity ligands enacts a cellular programme that augments responsiveness to cytokines. For CD8&#x0002b; T cells, a major outcome of the increased sensitivity to IL-15 is the conversion of a subset of CD5hi T cells into VM. Undergoing VM conversion results in the induction of a host of genes critical for sensing and producing inflammation, thereby facilitating the VM cell response against infectious challenges regardless of antigen specificity. This model lends increasing support for the importance of so-called &#x02018;inflammatory' IL-15, produced during the earliest stages of bacterial or viral infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, as being central for mediating maximal function of both naive CD5hi (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and memory CD8&#x0002b; T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Thus, thymic selection not only produces T cells capable of response to foreign antigens but it also produces cells optimized for diversifying the peripheral T-cell repertoire (via cytokine responsiveness) regardless of antigen encounter.</p><p>Taken more broadly, our data support a new mechanistic understanding of the progressive differentiation from naive to memory T cells. Bevan and colleagues showed that, contradictory to conventional thought, memory T cells are actually less sensitive to antigen, displaying weaker TCR signalling than naive T cells at the same concentration of antigen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. However, memory cells are more sensitive to cytokine-mediated stimuli, engaging both proliferative and effector responses at far lower cytokine concentrations than their naive counterparts. Indeed, the efficiency of the memory cell response to homeostatic cytokines is such that they no longer require &#x02018;tonic' stimulation via their TCR and are able to survive in MHC-deficient hosts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. This suggests that at each increasing step in the differentiation process (CD5lo/CD5hi/effector/memory/VM), a CD8&#x0002b; T cell has increasingly wired its response to be based less on TCR-derived signals and more on signals derived from environmental/cytokine cues. The data we present here demonstrate this principle at each progressive stage of T-cell differentiation with CD5lo cells being relatively quiescent, CD5hi cells being responsive for VM conversion and VM cells being fully recruited into a protective response, all dependent on IL-15, and independent of overt TCR-mediated signals.</p><p>It has become increasingly clear that memory T cells possess substantial innate-like effector functions that are capable of mediating potent (in some instances nearly sterilizing) antigen non-specific protective immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> As a result, memory T cells can influence not just the response to secondary antigen encounters, but to any response accompanied by inflammatory or homeostatic cytokine induction. As we show here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>), mice devoid of memory CD8&#x0002b; T cells (3KxRag) are far less capable of managing their bacterial burden than mice with a population of antigen non-specific memory CD8&#x0002b; T cells. Our data on VM cells perfectly recapitulate the bystander protective function observed for antigen-experienced memory T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, and further add a necessary role for IL-15 in this process. While the combined action of IL-12/18/15 was known to induce CD8&#x0002b; T-cell GrzB and NKG2D expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, our data reveal that IL-15 is required to sustain the expression of these molecules <italic>in vivo</italic> during a bacterial challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we provide here convincing evidence for a population of T cells that likely represent a human equivalent of VM cells. While it was previously suggested that this subset represented human &#x02018;innate CD8' T cells, the phenotypic and functional similarities between innate CD8 and VM cells (at least in the mouse) allow either conclusion for this population. Despite their phenotypic similarities, each cell is the culmination of very different differentiation processes; innate CD8s depend on PLZF, NKT cells and IL-4 in the thymus, and VM cells depend on IL-15 responsiveness in the periphery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Although their development is well established, a location and function for innate CD8 cells outside of the thymus has been difficult to clarify, and little is known of what becomes of these cells within a lymphoreplete, WT host. In contrast, VM cells (i) represent the dominant subset of MP cells within the antigen-inexperienced B6 host<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>; (ii) are present even in the complete absence of all the factors (PLZF, IL-4 and NKT cells) required to produce innate CD8s (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>); (iii) do not require any prior antigen exposure evidenced by their presence in germ-free and TCRxRag<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hosts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>; (iv) traffic extensively to the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>); (v) display a phenotype consistent with high affinity for self/foreign antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>); (vi) respond to IL-15 by maintaining expression of effector molecules that mediate bystander protective function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>); and (vii) increase substantially in their frequency over the course of ageing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. While admittedly lacking in definitive proof, the putative human VM equivalent shares many of these qualities in that they are found in cord blood (no/limited prior antigen exposure), demonstrate a phenotype consistent with an higher affinity for self (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>) and responsiveness to IL-15 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>), express effector molecules important for bystander protection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, and are found in high frequency in the liver and increasing frequency during ageing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). While the formation of these VM cells in human, as well as those in the mouse, do not appear to require antigenic experience, others have shown that a VM phenotype may be acquired from antigen-experienced memory cells following incubation with IL-2/7/15 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Thus, it remains to be determined to what degree the peripheral pool of VM cells, in mouse or human, can be derived from antigen-experienced memory T cells or naive precursors. In addition, more work is needed to establish actual innate protective capacity of these cells in the human in the absence of antigenic stimulation.</p><p>Given the collective data discussed above, it seems reasonable to conclude that the host is generally pre-disposed towards favouring the formation of memory T cells, regardless of specificity. This is, perhaps, the context in which to best view the developmental and functional role of VM cells: by promoting the differentiation of the T cells with highest affinity to self-antigens into VM cells, the host acquires a population of effector cells that are preferentially and rapidly responsive to cytokines but less so to TCR stimulation, ultimately enhancing protective immunity while, possibly, reducing the likelihood of autoimmunity. The need for this dual benefit is most logically centred on the elderly where the decline in lymphocyte development means that the protection of the host to novel antigenic challenges must be increasingly dependent on the functional response of memory cells, with or without antigen specificity. The data we present here on the development, gene expression profile, trafficking and function of VM cells (in mouse and human) draw attention to this populous and versatile T-cell subset as a likely mediator of host protection to a spectrum of immunological challenges.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mice and reagents</title><p>Female C57/Bl6 mice, 6&#x02013;12 weeks old, were purchased from the National Cancer Institute.

A modified Kapa Biosystems (Wilmington, MA, USA) KAPA Stranded mRNA-Seq kit for whole-transcriptome libraries was used to primarily target all poly-A RNA. Briefly, library construction proceeded from isolation of total RNA species, followed by mRNA (poly-A) isolation, first and second strand cDNA synthesis, Life Technologies Ion adaptor ligation, amplification and bead templating. Once validated, the libraries were sequenced as barcoded-pooled samples on a P1 Ion Proton chip. Sequence reads of 30 or more nucleotides were mapped to the mm10 (GRCm38) assembly of the mouse genome with the STAR RNA-Seq aligner version 2.4.1d (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>) using gene annotation data from Ensembl version 78 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>). For each gene in the Ensembl 71 annotation, reads were counted using the HTSeq software version 0.6.0 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). Statistical comparisons of the gene expression between the cell types were performed with the DESeq2 package version 1.8.1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>) and for the R statistical software version 3.2.0 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>).

Samples were diluted 1:1 and run on a Ficoll gradient to isolate the mononuclear layer, which was then isolated and washed.
