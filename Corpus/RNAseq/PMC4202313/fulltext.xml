The most economically damaging plant-parasitic nematode species, and consequently the most widely studied, are those that feed as they migrate destructively through host roots causing necrotic lesions (migratory endoparasites) and those that modify host root tissue to create a nutrient sink from which they feed (sedentary endoparasites). The false root-knot nematode <italic>Nacobbus aberrans</italic> is the only known species to have both migratory endoparasitic and sedentary endoparasitic stages within its life cycle. Moreover, its sedentary stage appears to have characteristics of both the root-knot and the cyst nematodes. We present the first large-scale genetic resource of any false-root knot nematode species. We use RNAseq to describe relative abundance changes in all expressed genes across the life cycle to provide interesting insights into the biology of this nematode as it transitions between modes of parasitism. A multigene phylogenetic analysis of <italic>N. aberrans</italic> with respect to plant-parasitic nematodes of all groups confirms its proximity to both cyst and root-knot nematodes. We present a transcriptome-wide analysis of both lateral gene transfer events and the effector complement. Comparing parasitism genes of typical root-knot and cyst nematodes to those of <italic>N. aberrans</italic> has revealed interesting similarities. Importantly, genes that were believed to be either cyst nematode, or root-knot nematode, &#x0201c;specific&#x0201d; have both been identified in <italic>N. aberrans</italic>. Our results provide insights into the characteristics of a common ancestor and the evolution of sedentary endoparasitism of plants by nematodes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>plant-parasitic nematode</kwd><kwd>RNAseq</kwd><kwd>lateral gene transfer</kwd><kwd>host mimics</kwd><kwd>phylogenetics</kwd><kwd>effectors</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN) cause damage to almost all crops grown and losses to global agriculture attributed to PPNs are estimated at &#x000a3;75 billion per year (<xref rid="evu171-B47" ref-type="bibr">Nicol et al. 2011</xref>). The ability to parasitise plants is hypothesized to have arisen independently on at least four occasions in the Phylum Nematoda. Phylum-wide analysis of a single Small Subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) has produced the most extensive phylogeny of nematodes to date. This phylogeny splits nematodes into 12 Clades, with plant parasites present in four of these Clades (<xref rid="evu171-B59" ref-type="bibr">van Megen et al. 2009</xref>). Clades 1 and 2 contain migratory ectoparasitic nematodes that remain outside the host for the duration of the life cycle. Clade 10, which is composed mainly of fungivorous nematodes, includes two plant-parasitic species of <italic>Bursaphelenchus</italic> (e.g., <italic>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</italic>) and plant-parasitic (foliar) <italic>Aphelenchoides</italic> species (e.g., <italic>Aphelenchoides fragariae</italic>). Clade 12 contains insect parasites, vertebrate parasites, and the majority of the known plant-parasitic species, including those that are the most economically important.</p><p>PPN that employ several different feeding strategies are found within Clade 12. Migratory endoparasites cause considerable damage as they migrate through and feed from disrupted cells. These nematodes have no biotrophic stage. In addition, Clade 12 includes two groups of biotrophic sedentary endoparasitic nematodes that are thought to have evolved biotrophy independently. The best known examples from these two groups are the cyst nematodes and the root-knot nematodes, which are the most economically damaging species (<xref rid="evu171-B38" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al. 2013</xref>). The &#x0201c;false root-knot nematode&#x0201d; <italic>Nacobbus aberrans</italic> is highly unusual as it is the only known nematode that has both a migratory endoparasitic stage and a sedentary (biotrophic) stage within its life cycle.</p><p>The complete life cycle of <italic>N. aberrans</italic> on a potato host is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu171-F1">figure 1</xref>. Second-stage juveniles (J2s) hatch from eggs in the soil and locate plant roots. The J2s use coordinated movements of their needle-like stylet to puncture cells and then migrate destructively through them (intracellular migration) (<xref rid="evu171-B45" ref-type="bibr">Manzanilla-L&#x000f3;pez et al. 2002</xref>). J2s moult without feeding, either in roots or in the soil, into the third-stage juvenile (J3). This stage, and the subsequent J4, can enter or leave roots, migrates destructively and also causes lesions and necrosis. It is thought that the migratory J3 and J4 stages feed, although mixed reports on this topic exist in the literature (<xref rid="evu171-B45" ref-type="bibr">Manzanilla-L&#x000f3;pez et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="evu171-B18" ref-type="bibr">Doncaster 2012</xref>). The J3 and J4 are survival stages (equivalent to the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> dauer stage) and are able to tolerate adverse environmental conditions such as low humidity (<xref rid="evu171-B2" ref-type="bibr">Anthoine et al. 2006</xref>). These stages can remain viable in potato roots/tubers for many months, causing very few visible symptoms, making them easily traded and a concern for quarantine legislation. After the final moult the vermiform females migrate to/into healthy root tissue, where they establish a permanent plant-derived multinucleate feeding site known as a syncytium, within a root gall (<xref rid="evu171-B39" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Payne 1977</xref>; <xref rid="evu171-B61" ref-type="bibr">Vovlas et al. 2007</xref>). An unusual feature of the complex life cycle of <italic>N. aberrans</italic> is that the complete development from J2 to female can occur either inside or outside the host root (<xref rid="evu171-B45" ref-type="bibr">Manzanilla-L&#x000f3;pez et al. 2002</xref>). Females feed from the syncytium for several weeks as their body swells and egg production occurs. Eggs are deposited in a gelatinous matrix to form egg masses in the soil. Reproduction in <italic>N. aberrans</italic> is probably sexual, although there are some suggestions that parthenogenesis may occur (<xref rid="evu171-B45" ref-type="bibr">Manzanilla-L&#x000f3;pez et al. 2002</xref>).

Dashed arrows represent transitions through the life cycle, whereas solid arrows represent movement of the nematode. J2s hatch from eggs in the soil and locate plant roots.

This stage, and the subsequent J4, can enter or leave roots and also migrate destructively and in addition cause lesions and necrosis. The J3 and J4 are the dauer (survival) stages and are able to tolerate adverse environmental conditions such as low humidity. After the final moult the vermiform females migrate to healthy root tissue, where they establish a permanent plant-derived, multinucleate feeding site known as a syncytium that is formed inside a root gall.

It has a broad host range encompassing 84 known plant species across 18 families including crops such as potato, tomato, beans and sugar beet, and many common weeds (<xref rid="evu171-B11" ref-type="bibr">Brodie et al. 1993</xref>; <xref rid="evu171-B45" ref-type="bibr">Manzanilla-L&#x000f3;pez et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="evu171-B44" ref-type="bibr">Manzanilla-L&#x000f3;pez 2010</xref>). <italic>Nacobbus aberrans</italic> causes yield losses that vary with temperature, but can be up to 61% on potato (<xref rid="evu171-B22" ref-type="bibr">Franco 1994</xref>; <xref rid="evu171-B45" ref-type="bibr">Manzanilla-L&#x000f3;pez et al. 2002</xref>). Due to a combination of the wide distribution, broad host range, potential yield losses, and peculiar dormant parasitic stage, <italic>N. aberrans</italic> is recognized as an EPPO A1 rated quarantine pest in Europe (<xref rid="evu171-B57" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. 1992</xref>) and also has quarantine status in the United States (<xref rid="evu171-B41" ref-type="bibr">Lehman 2004</xref>). These factors led to <italic>N. aberrans</italic> being voted as one of the top ten nematodes in molecular plant pathology in a recent survey and review (<xref rid="evu171-B38" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al. 2013</xref>). <italic>Nacobbus</italic> spp, commonly referred to as false root-knot nematodes, are thought to be more closely related to the root-knot nematodes than the cyst nematodes (<xref rid="evu171-B32" ref-type="bibr">Holterman et al. 2006</xref>, <xref rid="evu171-B33" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; <xref rid="evu171-B59" ref-type="bibr">van Megen et al. 2009</xref>). However, the syncytial feeding sites that they produce closely resemble those induced by cyst nematodes and have little in common with the giant cells induced by root-knot nematodes (<xref rid="evu171-B39" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Payne 1977</xref>). The syncytium, which is the sole source of nutrients for the adult female nematode over a period of several weeks, is formed by modifying an initial host cell to become more metabolically active. This initial cell then undergoes local cell wall dissolution and its protoplast fuses with those of the neighbouring cells which thus become incorporated into the syncytium. This process of syncytial formation is very similar to that seen in syncytia induced by cyst nematodes. Conversely, the syncytium is formed inside a gall that is phenotypically similar to that of the root-knot nematodes. In addition, the egg masses produced within/from this gall resemble those of the reniform and root-knot nematodes.</p><p>As for other plant pathogens, the interactions of PPN with their hosts are mediated by the activity of effectors. Effectors can be defined as proteins (or other factors) secreted by a parasite into a host in order to manipulate the host to the advantage of the parasite. Effectors clearly play a key role in several aspects of the biology of <italic>N. aberrans.</italic> Effectors that suppress host defences are likely to be produced as it remains undetected while feeding. As in other biotrophic PPN, effectors need to be produced that induce and maintain the feeding site. Various effectors from other nematode species have been linked to suppression of host defences and induction of the feeding site (<xref rid="evu171-B30" ref-type="bibr">Haegeman et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evu171-B31" ref-type="bibr">Hewezi and Baum 2013</xref>). For example, a secreted SPRY domain-containing protein from the Clade 12 cyst nematode <italic>Globodera rostochiensis</italic> is able to supress CC-NB-LRR-mediated disease resistance responses (<xref rid="evu171-B50" ref-type="bibr">Postma et al. 2012</xref>). In addition, PPN have evolved short proteins/peptides that mimic endogenous plant peptide hormones. The CLAVATA-like (CLE peptides) of the cyst nematode <italic>Heterodera schachtii</italic> are apparently secreted into syncytia and subsequently transported to the apoplasm by plant mechanisms (<xref rid="evu171-B52" ref-type="bibr">Replogle et al. 2011</xref>). Although the precise role of the nematode peptides in parasitism is unclear, they appear to be functional in planta. A <italic>H. </italic><italic>glycines</italic> CLE peptide can complement an <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> CLE mutant (<xref rid="evu171-B63" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2005</xref>) and the overexpression of a nematode-derived CLE peptide in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> results in a &#x0201c;wuschel-like&#x0201d; phenotype similar to that caused by over expression of endogenous CLE peptides (<xref rid="evu171-B62" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2011</xref>). A variety of genes encoding cell wall degrading enzymes have been identified from several PPN. These genes are highly similar to bacterial sequences, and absent from most other animals and are therefore likely to have been acquired by lateral gene transfer (LGT) (<xref rid="evu171-B15" ref-type="bibr">Danchin et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evu171-B28" ref-type="bibr">Haegeman, Jones, et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>In spite of the economic importance and highly unusual life cycle of <italic>N. aberrans,</italic> little is known about the molecular basis of host-parasite interactions in this species, and no resources for molecular studies are available. To address this, we have generated a &#x0201c;reference&#x0201d; transcriptome using RNAseq from three life stages of <italic>N. aberrans.</italic> We have subsequently analyzed changes in gene expression occurring across the life cycle, as it transitions between modes of parasitism. This analysis, including comparisons with other nematode groups, has allowed identification of putative effectors from <italic>N. aberrans.</italic> The data generated provide an insight into both the phylogenetic position of <italic>N. aberrans</italic> relative to other PPN and the evolution of sedentary endoparasitism by nematodes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Biological Material</title><p>An isolate of <italic>N. aberrans</italic> was collected from Puno, Peru in 2001 and cultivated on tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> var.

We have generated a comprehensive database of genes expressed across three life stages, and have used robust statistical analyses to quantify changes in gene expression that occur in the transition between modes of parasitism. This analysis has revealed insights into the evolution, phylogenetic history, and biology of biotrophic plant-nematode interactions.</p><sec><title>Comparative Geno/Transcriptomics</title><p>Next generation sequencing, and in particular RNAseq, is an extremely powerful technique but the tools developed for analysis of the data that are generated are in their infancy. Most analyses, including phylogenomics, become more challenging with large numbers of isoforms. A pipeline was used to reduce redundancy while retaining as much &#x0201c;information&#x0201d; as possible using the most recent accepted methodology from a range of sources (<xref rid="evu171-B56" ref-type="bibr">Schliesky et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evu171-B65" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Smith 2013</xref>). All nonredundant, nonchimeric transcripts were therefore treated independently, and the term gene is used tentatively. The final transcriptome assembly contained &#x0003e;60,000 transcripts less than 97% similar at the nucleotide level. This is many more than expected or observed in other PPN and is probably reflective of sequencing nematodes originally collected from a mixed soil sample and the presence of several isoforms that could not be collapsed into single genes. Similar numbers of common Pfam domains were identified when comparing <italic>N. aberrans</italic> with the root-knot nematode <italic>M. incognita</italic> and the cyst nematode <italic>G. pallida</italic>. In this analysis <italic>N. aberrans</italic> was more similar to either <italic>M. incognita</italic> or <italic>G. pallida</italic> than they are to each other, supporting the position at the base of the cyst nematode&#x02014;root-knot nematode bifurcation.</p></sec><sec><title>Lateral Gene Transfer</title><p>Hundreds of transcripts with alien indices indicative of laterally acquired genes were identified in the <italic>N. aberrans</italic> transcriptome. Several of these have been characterized in other nematode species as virulence factors with functioning GH activity on plant oligo- and polysaccharides (<xref rid="evu171-B37" ref-type="bibr">Jaubert et al. 2002</xref>; <xref rid="evu171-B28" ref-type="bibr">Haegeman, Jones, et al. 2011</xref>). Interestingly, classes of GH that are present in either root-knot nematodes or cyst nematodes are both present in <italic>N. aberrans</italic>. Of particular interest is the <italic>N. aberrans</italic> orthologue of the <italic>M. incognita</italic> protein Minc18543b. This has been identified as a functioning GH28 polygalacturonase and is expressed in the subventral gland cells (<xref rid="evu171-B37" ref-type="bibr">Jaubert et al. 2002</xref>). Until now GH28s were hypothesized to be root-knot nematode specific and possibly shared with their close Pratylenchidae relatives (<xref rid="evu171-B29" ref-type="bibr">Haegeman, Joseph, et al. 2011</xref>). However, two similar transcripts with high sequence identity to the <italic>M. incognita</italic> sequence have been identified in <italic>N. aberrans</italic>. The <italic>N</italic><italic>. </italic><italic>aberrans</italic> sequences are expressed during the J2, or both the J2 and sedentary life stages, and both contain putative signal peptides suggesting functional homology. Neither the <italic>N. aberrans</italic> nor the <italic>M. incognita</italic> GH28s identify any similar sequences in <italic>G. rostochiensis</italic> or <italic>G. pallida.</italic> A highly similar GH28 sequence was also identified from <italic>R. reniformis</italic>. However, the <italic>R. reniformis</italic> sequence appears to be nonfunctional as it lacks a signal peptide and has low read coverage during either J2 or sedentary phase (Eves-van den Akker S, unpublished data). Taken together these results may suggest that a common ancestor to root-knot and cyst nematodes had acquired GH28 polygalacturonase via LGT, and that a gradual loss of function has occurred during speciation in the cyst nematode clade. Interestingly, <italic>N. aberrans</italic>-specific candidate GH enzymes were also identified, although these remain to be confirmed and functionally characterized.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparing Characterized Effector Complements between PPN</title><p>Putative plant peptide-hormone mimics are some of the best characterized effectors in PPN. CLE-like peptides have been identified in both cyst and root-knot nematodes and, unsurprisingly, were identifiable in the <italic>N. aberrans</italic> transcriptome. The CLE-like peptides identified were downstream of predicted secretion signals and were specifically expressed during the biotrophic phase in <italic>N. aberrans</italic>. The function of the CLE-like peptides in PPNs is not clear. CLEs are one of the few features that are shared between both cyst and root-knot nematodes leading to a suggestion that they play a fundamental role in the development of two morphologically diverse feeding sites. By contrast, CEP-like peptides have only been identified in root-knot nematodes and vascular plants (<xref rid="evu171-B8" ref-type="bibr">Bobay et al. 2013</xref>). CEP-like peptides were not identifiable in the <italic>N. aberrans</italic> transcriptome. According to the phylogenetic position of <italic>N. aberrans</italic>, this suggests that evolution/acquisition occurred after the split from <italic>N. aberrans</italic>. Despite their proposed function in root nodule formation (<xref rid="evu171-B36" ref-type="bibr">Imin et al. 2013</xref>), and the phenotypic similarities between nodules and galls, this suggests either a role unrelated to gall formation for these peptides or that superficially morphologically similar galls are produced by distinct means in different PPNs.</p><p>Of the 36 effector families identified in <italic>G. pallida</italic>, half were represented by at least one member in the <italic>N. aberrans</italic> transcriptome. The majority of these effectors are highly up regulated at J2 and have unknown functions. It is assumed that &#x0201c;effectors&#x0201d; expressed in the J2 stage of <italic>G. pallida</italic> play a role in either migration, suppression of host defences or initiation of the feeding site. Due to the unique biology of <italic>N. aberrans</italic>, by comparing these orthologues we can support or reject some of these hypotheses. It is reasonable to assume that genes involved in initiation of the feeding site are expressed in stages just prior to feeding site formation. In <italic>G. pallida</italic> this would correspond to the J2. However, all J2 specific effectors of <italic>G. pallida</italic> that have orthologues in <italic>N. aberrans</italic> are also J2 specific in that species. For <italic>N. aberrans</italic> the stage immediately prior to feeding site initiation would be an immature female, which is the developmental stage after the J3/4. This therefore suggests none of the J2 specific effectors shared by <italic>G. pallida</italic> and <italic>N. aberrans</italic> are involved in the initiation of the feeding sites, and that the as yet unidentified genes in either species, are strictly transcriptionally regulated. Those genes in <italic>G. pallida</italic> that are J2 and male specific are hypothesized to be involved in either migration or suppression of host defences. The corresponding orthologues in <italic>N. aberrans</italic> are up regulated at J2 and migratory stages. However, the migratory stage of <italic>N. aberrans</italic> causes necrosis and lesions, suggesting that these <italic>G. pallida</italic> genes are not involved in suppression of host defences, and are probably involved in migration. Finally, those genes where corresponding orthologues are expressed during the feeding stages in both species may play a critical and conserved role in maintenance of the feeding site or suppression of host defences.</p><p>One such gene family, similar to the 4D06 effector of <italic>H. glycines</italic> (<xref rid="evu171-B23" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al. 2003</xref>) was identified in cyst nematodes, reniform nematodes, and in <italic>N. aberrans.</italic> This is again in contrast with the proposed phylogeny (as for the other effectors shared by cyst nematodes and <italic>Nacobbus</italic>) and therefore suggests that a common ancestor of cyst and root-knot nematodes would have contained the 4D06 gene family. In addition, this gene family provides interesting insights into the evolution of sedentary endoparasitism. This gene family is present in at least three genera of PPN capable of infecting both Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons, suggesting a fundamental role in plant parasitism. A protein alignment of all 4D06-like effectors identified to date allows the sequences to be divided into two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu171-F6">fig. 6</xref>). Group 2, presumably the most &#x0201c;ancestral&#x0201d;, contains 100% of <italic>N. aberrans</italic>, 75% of <italic>R. reniformis</italic>, 40% of <italic>G. rostochiensis</italic>, and just 3.4% of <italic>G. pallida</italic> 4D06-like sequences. Protein alignments are often more reflective of function than evolutionary history, but coupled with the proposed phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evu171-F3">fig. 3</xref>), this suggests that as speciation events have occurred, a gradual change from group 2 to group 1 4D06-like genes has taken place, and that they have been lost in the root-knot nematodes. Cyst nematodes, reniform nematodes, and <italic>N. aberrans</italic> are able to infect <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> with varying degrees of success. Both <italic>N. aberrans</italic> and <italic>R. reniformis</italic> have broad host ranges, whereas the potato cyst nematodes <italic>G. pallida</italic> and <italic>G. rostochiensis</italic> are specialists. However, 4D06-like genes have been identified in other cyst nematodes that do not infect potato (<italic>H. avenae</italic> ERP004648), suggesting that the switch to, and expansion of, group 1 4D06-like genes does not reflect adaptation toward a particular host.</p><p>Significantly differentially expressed transcripts were grouped into ten super clusters that described the changes in gene expression across the <italic>N. aberrans</italic> life cycle. As well as life stage specific clusters that have obvious biological relevance, we have identified clusters that describe transitions from juvenile to parasitic migratory endoparasite to parasitic sedentary endoparasite. Interestingly, the sedentary-specific super cluster 9 is the least well described with just 18% of transcripts with BLAST2GO hits. Making the reasonable assumption that genes specifically expressed at certain life stages are crucial to those stages, this highlights how little is known about this complex biotrophic interaction. Hundreds of putative effectors have been identified that have specific expression profiles, presumably separating the different functions required for successful parasitism of both migratory parasitic and sedentary parasitic stages. Effectors specifically up regulated during the J2 stage are predicted to be involved in migration, whereas those in the sedentary stage are likely to be involved in maintenance of the feeding site and suppression of host defences. Typical effector finding pipelines identify genes encoding secreted proteins specifically up regulated during the biotrophic (or migratory) phase of the interaction. This relatively crude analysis can identify a range of proteins that are not effectors (e.g., digestive enzymes). However, in the case of <italic>N. aberrans,</italic> the presence of a migratory stage that reportedly feeds but does not form biotrophic feeding sites gives more confidence in this type of analysis. Using a combination of known effector expression profiles and clustering of <italic>N. aberrans</italic> transcripts based on expression profile we can identify super clusters that contain putative effector sequences for further study.</p></sec><sec><title>Evolution of Plant-Parasitism by Nematodes</title><p>Due to morphometric and physiological variability of <italic>Nacobbus</italic> in response to host range and temperature, there is very little agreement on the species taxonomy within the <italic>N. aberrans</italic> complex (<xref rid="evu171-B40" ref-type="bibr">Lax et al. 2013</xref>). Using the wealth of information generated here, a local phylogenetic history of the false root-knot nematodes is proposed. We present the most comprehensive and robust phylogeny of PPN, including representatives from all major groups, based on multiple nuclear protein-encoding genes. It is important to note that when constructing the phylogeny the relative positions of all species, except <italic>N. aberrans,</italic> remained constant with the addition of more species. <italic>N. aberrans</italic> was always positioned with the other Clade 12 nematodes, but was found in closer proximity to the root-knot nematodes or the cyst nematodes depending on the range of species included in the analysis. The 65 genes used here are highly conserved, present in all eukaryotes, predicted to be single copy and therefore are expected to be good indicators of evolutionary history. Despite the large number of conserved genes used here, it is possible that <italic>N. aberrans</italic> represents a rogue taxon and this may indicate insufficient phylogenetic signal (<xref rid="evu171-B55" ref-type="bibr">Sanderson and Shaffer 2002</xref>). The Pratylenchidae appear to be difficult to accurately position in a phylogenetic tree based on SSU rDNA, as <italic>R. </italic><italic>similis</italic> groups with the cyst nematodes, whereas <italic>N. aberrans</italic> and the other Pratylenchinae group with the root-knot nematodes. Similarly, it has been noted that <italic>B. xylophilus</italic>, and indeed all Parasitaphelenchidae, are difficult to position using SSU rDNA due to unusual GC content (<xref rid="evu171-B32" ref-type="bibr">Holterman et al. 2006</xref>). However, for the 65 genes used here, no major differences were noted in GC content of the <italic>B. xylophilus</italic> nuclear genes compared with the other nematode species.</p><p>Using all common CEGs between all species available the proposed phylogenetic placement of <italic>N</italic><italic>. </italic><italic>aberrans</italic> is in agreement with published phylogenies. The phylogenetic proximity of <italic>N. aberrans</italic> to the root-knot nematodes correlates poorly with the biology of this nematode. With the exception of the galls, all other defining features of the biotrophic interaction are more similar to those of cyst and reniform nematodes than those of root-knot nematodes. For example, the juveniles of cyst nematodes migrate destructively and intracellularly (<xref rid="evu171-B64" ref-type="bibr">Wyss and Grundler 1992</xref>), whereas the juveniles of root-knot nematodes migrate intercellularly (<xref rid="evu171-B64" ref-type="bibr">Wyss and Grundler 1992</xref>; <xref rid="evu171-B3" ref-type="bibr">Atkinson et al. 1995</xref>). Like the cyst nematodes, the juveniles of <italic>N. aberrans</italic> also migrate destructively and intracellularly (<xref rid="evu171-B45" ref-type="bibr">Manzanilla-L&#x000f3;pez et al. 2002</xref>). The syncytial feeding structure of <italic>Nacobbus</italic> is similar in structure and ontogeny to that of cyst nematodes, and in particular reniform nematodes (<xref rid="evu171-B39" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Payne 1977</xref>; <xref rid="evu171-B61" ref-type="bibr">Vovlas et al. 2007</xref>), and does not resemble the giant cells of root-knot nematodes. Females of root-knot nematodes, reniform nematodes, and false root-knot nematodes all produce eggs into a gelatinous matrix. In root-knot nematodes this matrix originates from rectal glands, whereas in reniform nematodes it originates from vaginal glands (<xref rid="evu171-B53" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al. 1998</xref>). Although the origin of the <italic>N. aberrans</italic> gelatinous matrix is not known (<xref rid="evu171-B24" ref-type="bibr">Geraert 1994</xref>; <xref rid="evu171-B45" ref-type="bibr">Manzanilla-L&#x000f3;pez et al. 2002</xref>), <italic>N. aberrans</italic> and all sedentary nematodes in the cyst/reniform nematode clade lack rectal glands. Indeed, the biology of <italic>N. aberrans</italic> is remarkably similar to that of <italic>R. reniformis</italic>; both moult from J2 to J3/4 female in the soil, retaining their cuticle. The female is the infective stage (i.e., able to induce syncytia) in both and, in sub optimal conditions the J3/J4 is the survival stage.</p><p>These observations can be put in parallel with the LGT analysis and the effector complement analysis. Classes of GH enzyme present in either root-knot nematodes or cyst nematodes are both present in the <italic>N</italic><italic>. </italic><italic>aberrans</italic> transcriptome. In addition, cyst nematode specific effectors, absent from root-knot nematodes, are also present in the <italic>N. aberrans</italic> transcriptome. Similarly, the difficulties in positioning <italic>N</italic><italic>. </italic><italic>aberrans</italic> with respect to cyst and root-knot nematode clades depending on the number of species, number of sequences, or the type of alignment used (as discussed above) may indicate that it is at the very base of this bifurcation. Varying reports exist in the literature about the evolutionary origins of sedentary endoparasitism in the phylum Nematoda (<xref rid="evu171-B33" ref-type="bibr">Holterman et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evu171-B59" ref-type="bibr">van Megen et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evu171-B17" ref-type="bibr">de Almeida Engler and Gheysen 2013</xref>). The position of <italic>R. similis</italic> and <italic>P. coffeae</italic> on each side of the bifurcation presumably implies that migratory endoparasitism is a prerequisite to sedentary endoparasitism and that the migratory parasitic stages of sedentary endoparasites have been lost in cyst and root-knot nematodes and yet retained as an important part of the life cycle in the &#x0201c;intermediate&#x0201d; genus <italic>Nacobbus</italic>.</p><p>The wealth and quality of the information here has raised interesting questions into the phylogeny of PPN and provides a tremendous resource for further study into both sedentary and migratory parasitism.
