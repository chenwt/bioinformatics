This organism has a large genome of 6.3&#x000a0;million nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and causes both life-threatening acute infections as shown in burn patients, and chronic lung infections as in cystic fibrosis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lives in two different life styles, planktonic and biofilm, which are thought to be associated with acute infections and chronic infections, respectively. The expression of virulence in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which can be influenced by environmental signals, is tightly controlled by complex regulatory networks. About 8.4&#x000a0;% of predicted <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genes are involved in regulation, which is among the highest proportion of predicted regulatory genes observed in sequenced bacterial genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to understand the regulatory pathways controlling the expression of virulence in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> under different conditions and time. This can be accomplished by studying the promoter activities of virulence genes at both individual and global gene expression levels (such as RNA sequencing).</p><p>To study the promoter activity of a particular gene, the promoter is commonly fused to a reporter gene [such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene] in a replicative plasmid in order to obtain the highest levels of fluorescence. The resultant plasmid is introduced into the host bacterium, and the activities of the reporter gene are measured under the desired test conditions. To prevent loss of the plasmid, antibiotic is added into the growth medium to maintain the selection pressure. However, in some circumstances (such as polymicrobial interaction studies), the continuous presence of antibiotics to maintain the selection pressure is not desirable because some interacting strains could be susceptible to the antibiotic. In addition, antibiotics themselves can have untoward effect on gene expression circuits. Therefore, it is more preferable to have the fused promoter&#x02013;reporter element stably integrated into the bacterial chromosome.</p><p>Creating stable chromosomal insertion/deletion mutants involves several steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Firstly, target alleles that are often tagged with an antibiotic resistance gene are inserted into a suicide plasmid. Secondly, the resultant suicide plasmid is delivered into the host by electroporation or conjugation, followed by recombination of the plasmid-borne target into the chromosome. Finally, correct mutants are obtained by resolving the merodiploids that result from chromosomal integration of the suicide plasmid by a single crossover. This latter procedure uses a counter-selectable marker such as <italic>Bacillus subtilis sacB</italic> (sucrose counter selection). Some drawbacks of this conventional approach include: (1) difficulties encountered in <italic>sacB</italic> counter-selection due to issues of stringency; and (2) cloning difficulties due to the relatively large sizes of suicide plasmids themselves and few available cloning sites. In this report, we showed that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mutants can be directly created by electroporation of high concentrations of linearized cloning plasmid DNA, eliminating the use of a suicide plasmid.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Growth conditions for bacterial strains and plasmids manipulations</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 5&#x003b1; strains used for subcloning and plasmid isolation were grown in Luria&#x02013;Bertani (LB, 10&#x000a0;g/l of tryptone, 10&#x000a0;g/l of NaCl and 5&#x000a0;g/l of yeast extract) medium at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in the presence of the appropriate selective substance (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of Gentamicin), or in low salt LB medium (10&#x000a0;g/l of tryptone, 5&#x000a0;g/l of NaCl and 5&#x000a0;g/l of yeast extract) containing antibiotic zeocin (50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). <italic>E. coli</italic> plasmid DNA isolations were carried out by the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA).

For inoculation, the culture was adjusted to an optical density of 0.1 at the wavelength of 600&#x000a0;nm (OD<sub>600</sub>). The channels of a 48-well microplate from the Bioflux system (Fluxion Biosciences, South San Francisco, CA) were primed with media, followed by inoculation of each channel with 50&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> suspension (OD600<sub>nm</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.1).

Biofilm formation and green fluorescence were monitored in real time using the LSM710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Thornwood, NY).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To study the promoter activities, we constructed a promoter&#x02013;reporter fusion plasmid pDONR-NT0 (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This plasmid contains three unique restriction enzyme cutting sites (<italic>Xba</italic>I, <italic>Kpn</italic>I &#x00026; <italic>EcoR</italic>I) for cloning of any promoter fragment to be studied into the upstream of the long half-life version <italic>gfp</italic> reporter. Gentamicin-resistance marker was used for selection. The insertion site was chosen to be located at the intergenic region between open reading frames of PA3835 and PA3836&#x02014;a region without any transcription based on our unpublished RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. Basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) results showed that although the sequence could vary, most, if not all, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains have this intergenic region. Because this region is non-coding and lack of transcription activity; therefore, this insertion site is not likely to interfere with other gene functions.</p><p>To prove the concept of transformation using linearized plasmid DNA, we used the promoter element of Exoenzyme S structural gene, a type III secretion effector and an important virulence factor for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. We amplified this promoter by PCR and cloned it into pDONR-NT0 (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) to create pDONR-NT3841P. We transformed 5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g of each of these linearized plasmids into <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 competent cells. The rational for using 5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g total DNA is that this amount has consistently yielded enough transformants for downstream characterization in our preliminary determinations. In addition, it has been shown that the number of recombinants generated from 5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g total DNA is close to the maximum number of transformants that can be obtained in other Gram-negative bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Eight and twelve transformants were obtained from the pDONR-NT0 and pDONR-NT3841P transformation respectively. PCR analyses confirmed that about 50&#x000a0;% of the transformants were correct double crossover recombinants (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The recombinants were designated as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> NT0 and NT3841P respectively. There was no difference in growth patterns between the double crossover recombinants obtained <italic>vs.</italic> wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 (data not shown). The incorrect double crossover recombinants were spontaneous gentamicin-resistant mutants and single crossover recombinants that were likely resulted from the incomplete enzyme digestions.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Recombination frequencies of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 transformation using linearized plasmid DNA</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Constructs<sup>a</sup>

Our transcriptome profiling (RNAseq) showed that the promoter of exoenzyme S gene was activated when <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> grew in a biofilm. Indeed, as compared to the promoterless control, we observed increased fluorescence from the NT3841P recombinant grown as biofilms in the Bioflux System (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Although biofilm formation and type III secretion have been shown to be reciprocally regulated in some publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], biofilms and type III secretion are not mutually exclusive in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</italic> Under some growth condition(s), the type III effector proteins (such as ExoS and ExoT) were expressed in biofilm cells, but not in the planktonic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The discrepancy may be caused by different growth conditions used in the studies. The Bioflux system that we used to grow biofilm is a continuous-flow system which more closely mimics the in vivo conditions. Our results are in agreement with that of Mikkelsen et al., showing increased ExoS expression in biofilm cells grown in a continuous-flow system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>The promoter of Exoenzyme S gene (PA3841) was activated when <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells were in the biofilm state.

For each transformation, although there are variations in transformation efficiencies, we were able to obtain correct double crossover recombinants of these different constructs (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, we were not able to monitor the activities of these promoters using our constructed system, possibly due to the weakness of the promoters and/or the test conditions are not optimal.</p><p>To determine if we can create deletion mutant using this linearized plasmid DNA transformation approach, a small none-coding regulatory RNA deletion plasmid was constructed (by Dr. Rajasekh Karna and Dr. Christine Miller in our laboratories) on the pCR2.1 vector backbone. The plasmid was linearized and transformed into <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 competent cells. Two hundred and eight gentamicin-resistant transformants were obtained. PCR analyses of randomly picked eight transformants showed that all were correct double crossover deletion mutants. We also used this linearized plasmid to transform a highly virulent clinical strain <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain 12-4-4-59 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We obtained eight correct double crossover deletion mutants. This result suggests that this linearized plasmid DNA transformation approach is not limited to PAO1 strain only.</p><p>Recombination efficiency could be influenced by the size of both the flanking region and the inserted non-homologous element, and by the surrounding sequence contexts. As the size of the inserted non-homologous DNA increases, the efficiency decreases exponentially; and once it reaches about 6&#x000a0;kb, the recombination efficiency is not detectable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In contrast, as the flanking region size increases, the recombination efficiency increases. However, once the flanking region size reaches 1&#x000a0;kb, the recombination efficiency is not further improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In our case, the sizes of both flanking regions are ~1&#x000a0;kb, whereas the inserted non-homologous DNA is ~3&#x000a0;kb. Therefore, the low recombination efficiency observed is not likely due to the length of the flanking regions, but more likely due to the large size of the inserted element. The fact that we obtained more deletion mutants supports this. We were not able to improve the transformation efficiency by growing <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> at 42&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C either for overnight or just for 2&#x000a0;h before performing the transformation. The presence of the vector in the total electroporated DNA preparation should not contribute to the observed low recombination efficiency either. In contrary, it may enhance recombination rates by saturating endogenous nucleases. It has been shown that the presence of carrier oligonucleotides increased the frequencies of recombination in both Gram-negative bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Our results showed that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mutants could be generated by electroporation of high concentrations of linearized cloning plasmid DNA. It has been reported that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mutants could be created by electroporation of high concentrations of linear DNA, such as chromosomal DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], PCR fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and single stranded synthetic oligonucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Compared to other forms of linear DNA, this linear plasmid DNA approach has two advantages: Firstly, this approach is not limited to any particular vector. Thus, it would be more convenient to manipulate a target region due to wider selections of vectors. Secondly, because cloning vectors are usually medium-to-high copy number plasmids, it is easier to obtain large quantities of plasmid DNA needed for the transformations. Compared to the conventional mutant generating approach that requires the use of suicide vector(s), this linear plasmid DNA approach eliminates the difficult subcloning steps into the suicide vector and the time consuming steps of resolving merodiploids resulted from single crossover events. One limitation of using linear plasmid DNA is the low transformation efficiencies. However, the number of correct recombinants obtained is still more than needed for downstream characterization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Direct transformation with linearized plasmid DNA provides another avenue to create <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mutants. This new approach eliminates the use of suicide vector(s) for creating <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mutants, and thus facilitates the study of this opportunistic pathogen.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec9"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13104_2016_2130_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><caption><p>
