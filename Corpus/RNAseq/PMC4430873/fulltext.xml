In metazoans, these processes need to be coordinated with animal development and homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. One important factor in the control and coordination of growth is the Myc family of oncogenes (represented by a single protein in insects, simply called Myc, and three major paralogs in vertebrates: c-, N- and L-Myc). Myc&#x02019;s activity is essential for normal animal development in insects and in vertebrates (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]). A moderate reduction of Myc levels in <italic>Drosophila</italic> results in small cells with small nucleoli, reduced organismal growth and adult size, delayed overall development and female sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Fruit flies lacking all Myc activity fail to undergo normal growth and mostly die during early larval stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Conversely, Myc overexpression in vertebrates (and to some extent in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) leads to unscheduled cellular growth and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Consistent with this, mutational activation of Myc, or of upstream signaling pathways, is frequently found in human cancers and causally contributes to this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Knowledge of the relevant Myc targets, therefore, is essential to understand the processes of Myc-dependent growth in normal and pathological situations.</p><p>While Myc can control a large number of genes in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the number of Myc targets is still open in the simpler model <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Several studies have characterized Myc-regulated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but they have not comprehensively addressed which of these genes are controlled by direct Myc binding, nor have they included genes that do not code for proteins. However, recent studies have revealed the abundance and variety of non-coding transcripts in the eukaryotic genome, and have emphasized the biological importance of various such transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Some non-coding RNAs have already been identified as physiologically relevant Myc targets in vertebrates (rRNAs, tRNAs, miRNAs; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]), raising the possibility that the biological activities of Myc might be mediated (in part) by these and additional non-protein coding transcripts.</p><p>We, therefore, set out to extend the search for Myc targets to non-polyadenylated transcripts, using a combination of RNAseq and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIPseq) approaches in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. This approach led to the identification of a core set of less than 500 Myc targets. The majority of these targets control ribosome biogenesis and translation, in good agreement with earlier reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition to the previously identified mRNAs, however, we identified small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) as a novel class of Myc targets. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes 288 snoRNAs (Flybase release FB2014_6; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]), most of which fall into one of two classes: the 60 to 100 nucleotides long box C/D snoRNAs and the 130 to 160 nucleotides long box H/ACA snoRNAs. Upon association with a small set of specific proteins, these two types of snoRNAs form small nucleolar riboproteins (snoRNPs) that catalyze 2&#x02019;-O-methylation and pseudouridylation, respectively. Their best characterized targets are small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs, where many of these post-transcriptional modifications cluster in functionally important regions and contribute to efficient ribosome biogenesis and/or function. In addition, snoRNAs have been shown to affect other biological processes, such as RNA editing, alternative splicing, and gene silencing (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]). Intriguingly, the snoRNA associated proteins all are encoded by core Myc targets, as are several of the factors involved in snoRNP processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These findings indicate that Myc acts as a master regulator of snoRNP biogenesis, and they suggest a biological mechanism that ensures the stoichiometry of RNA and protein components of snoRNPs. At the same time, they reinforce the notion that snoRNP generation, and hence ribosome biogenesis, constitutes the core function of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Myc. We further provide evidence that vertebrate Myc also controls snoRNA expression. Finally, we show that the snoRNA host gene Uhg1 is important for normal animal growth, and that overexpression of different Uhg genes enhances tumor growth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Myc directly binds a core set of sites in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>In order to establish a core set of genes directly controlled by Myc in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we performed ChIPseq experiments in S2 cells using a mouse monoclonal anti <italic>Drosophila</italic> Myc antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To control for background signal, we used non-immune mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) in parallel experiments, and we repeated both anti-Myc and control IgG ChIPs with cells that had been depleted of Myc. This set of experiments resulted in the identification of 240 peaks that are specifically bound by Myc in na&#x000ef;ve S2 cells but not in Myc-depleted cells, and that are not recognized by control IgGs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Since these ChIPs relied on a monoclonal antibody, it is conceivable that some Myc binding sites were missed due to epitope masking. To exclude this possibility, we conducted another set of ChIPseq experiments with a rabbit polyclonal anti <italic>Drosophila</italic> Myc antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and chromatin from S2 cells, again using species-matched non-immune IgGs as control. This approach yielded 98 specifically Myc-bound peaks, most of which (75) overlapped with the Myc-binding sites identified above (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Given this coincidence between the two antibodies, we are confident that we have identified the majority of Myc bound genes, and (based on the negative controls) that these genes represent <italic>bona fide</italic> Myc-binding sites.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Myc binding sites in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. <bold>A)</bold> Myc binding to the Fibrillarin locus as an example of a binding site in S2 cells.

Several possibilities can be considered for this discrepancy. First, although both Kc167 and S2 cells are hematopoietic cells of embryonic origin, it is conceivable that they differ in their molecular characteristics. To address this possibility, we carried out ChIPseq experiments with rabbit anti-Myc antibodies and control IgGs using chromatin from Kc167 cells. This led to the identification of 279 Myc-binding sites (110 of which overlap peaks that were found in S2 cells). However, in these experiments we observed considerably higher background binding than in S2 cells, and, therefore, only 21 binding sites were statistically significant (false discovery rate (FDR) &#x0003c;10%), 19 of which overlap peaks in S2 cells. This similarity with the results in S2 cells argues against major differences between the cell lines (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Second, Yang <italic>et al</italic>. used a different antibody (Santa Cruz rabbit anti <italic>Drosophila</italic> Myc) which might have higher affinity and/or recognize other epitopes on Myc, thus allowing the identification of additional <italic>bona fide</italic> Myc-binding sites. Alternatively, since there are no published data showing the specificity of this antibody, or of control ChIPs with non-immune IgG, or control ChIPs from Myc-depleted cells, some of the 4,000 peaks might also reflect non-specific binding of the antiserum to chromatin. To address such a possibility, we prepared chromatin from na&#x000ef;ve and from Myc-depleted S2 cells, and conducted ChIP experiments with this commercial antiserum. As expected, the ChIP signals at the high-affinity Myc targets nop5 and Uhg1 (see below) are strongly reduced upon Myc depletion (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1B). In contrast, very poor or no reduction is observed at 18 sequences that were identified as Myc binding sites by Yang <italic>et al</italic>. but not in our experiments (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1A, B). This non Myc-specific ChIP signal presumably corresponds to a background reactivity of the commercial antibody, which is unaffected by the Myc knock-down even though Myc protein is depleted highly efficiently (arrow in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1B). By inference, we consider it most likely that most of the sequences that were not identified in our experiments do not specifically bind to Myc in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In our following analysis we, therefore, focus on the 265 sites we have identified in our combined ChIPseq experiments as the core set of Myc binding sites in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (all sites that were specifically bound in at least one experiment in S2 or Kc167 cells, with an FDR &#x0003c;10%; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Ribosome biogenesis and ribosome protein genes are the core Myc targets</title><p>In a first step, we determined the position of the binding sites relative to annotated genes. Fifty-eight percent of all sites map within 100&#x000a0;bp from the nearest transcription start site (TSS; grey bars in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C), and 80% of the sites are less than 1,000&#x000a0;bp from a TSS, suggesting that Myc preferentially binds to promoter-proximal sequences. This preference is even more striking when only Myc peaks are considered that cover a canonical E-box, with 77% of these peaks localizing to within 100&#x000a0;bp of a TSS (red line in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Due to the high gene density in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, several Myc binding sites are located close to more than one TSS, so that altogether 279 genes are potentially affected by Myc binding (see below, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2).</p><p>To determine which of these (or of any other) genes indeed require Myc for their correct expression we conducted RNAseq experiments in S2 cells. For this purpose, we transfected dsRNA directed against Myc (or GFP as a control) into <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells and harvested the cells 24&#x000a0;hours later for total RNA isolation, by which time Myc protein levels were strongly reduced (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). In order to assess both polyadenylated and non-adenylated transcripts, we then depleted the samples of ribosomal RNA and processed the remainder for deep sequencing. The bioinformatic analysis of biologically independent triplicates (both for Myc knock-down and control) resulted in 8,019 genes with detectable expression in S2 cells and a minimal transcript length of 125&#x000a0;nt. Of these, 281 genes were differentially expressed upon Myc depletion (see <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). The majority of these genes, 240, is downregulated upon Myc depletion. Among these, the poly-adenylated transcripts show a good overlap with previously established lists of Myc-activated genes that were obtained in different settings (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3A; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]). Note that, in contrast to the Myc-activated genes, Myc-repressed genes show only poor overlap between different data sets (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3B). Taken together, these observations validate the current RNAseq data set.</p><p>A comparison of the binding and expression data shows that 139 of the Myc-bound genes are downregulated by at least one third upon Myc-knockdown and 59 are upregulated by at least one third (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S4A, B). The remaining transcripts were either not detected in our RNAseq experiments (due to low expression levels in S2 cells or transcript sizes below the 125&#x000a0;nt cutoff) or they showed lower responses to altered Myc levels (some of the corresponding transcripts might be too stable to show a significant decline over the course of the experiment). The following analysis focuses on the 139 genes that are bound by Myc and require Myc for their full expression and that we, therefore, consider to be the core set of directly Myc-activated genes. The overwhelming majority of these genes (114, 82%) functions in ribosome biogenesis and in translation (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). Myc controls several steps in this pathway, starting with the synthesis of ribosomal RNA by RNA polymerase I (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). Consistent with earlier reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], we did not observe direct binding of Myc to rRNA loci in our ChIPseq experiments, but Myc increases the activity of RNA polymerase I by inducing some of its components or cofactors (for example, RpI135; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). Numerous Myc targets then control the post-transcriptional modifications of rRNA in general (15 genes coding for components of small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins, RNPs), and the maturation of the 40S subunit (18 genes) or 60S subunit (17 genes). Myc further induces the expression of ribosomal protein genes (19, 21 and 2 genes coding for components of the small and large ribosomal subunits and the mitochondrial ribosome, respectively), of translation factors (6 genes) and of genes involved in tRNA maturation (6 genes). Myc has also been reported to promote RNA polymerase III activity via an interaction with its co-factor Brf and, therefore, increases the amounts of tRNAs and other Pol III products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]; because of their small size these transcripts were not contained in our analysis. We also did not observe any significant enrichment of Myc at the 306 annotated tRNA loci in our ChIPseq data (data not shown). Presumably, Myc does not contact DNA directly at these sites; indeed, Myc does not require its DNA binding domain nor its classical dimerization partner Max to activate RNA polymerase III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and most tRNA loci (295 of 306) also do not contain any consensus Myc binding site (E-box; data not shown).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

At the same time, they emphasize Myc&#x02019;s central role for the production (and to some extent, activity) of ribosomes. Indeed, of 286 genes that were recently identified as essential for rRNA processing in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], the homologs of 43 count among these core Myc targets in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The situation is particularly striking for snoRNPs, whose best-characterized activities reside in the post-transcriptional modifications of rRNAs. All protein components of snoRNPs are known to be Myc targets, and our analysis now uncovers a large and novel class of Myc targets: the non-coding snoRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>A novel class of Myc targets: snoRNA and Uhg genes</title><p>After Myc depletion 240 genes are significantly downregulated (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05) &#x02013; and 36 of these do not code for proteins, but instead for snoRNAs. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome is predicted to encode 288 snoRNAs ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and FlyBase), ranging in size from 46 to 316&#x000a0;nt. Strikingly, all of the 103 snoRNAs that pass our 125&#x000a0;nt size cutoff and are detectably expressed in S2 cells are strongly downregulated upon Myc depletion (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). This includes most of the box H/ACA snoRNAs, but the majority of the box C/D snoRNAs are smaller than 125&#x000a0;nt and, therefore, not detectable in these RNAseq experiments. However, qPCR and Northern blot analysis of several small box C/D snoRNAs confirmed that they, too, are significantly depleted upon Myc knockdown (see below), suggesting that Myc affects snoRNA levels in general. This dramatic impact of Myc on snoRNA levels can be explained by a combination of different mechanisms. First, most <italic>Drosophila</italic> snoRNA genes are encoded in introns of other genes, from which the mature snoRNAs are excised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Many of the 84 different host genes are <italic>bona fide</italic> Myc targets (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S5), and Myc&#x02019;s impact on host gene expression is likely to be reflected in reduced levels of the intron-encoded snoRNAs. Second, snoRNAs function as part of snoRNPs, whose known protein components all are Myc targets (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4 and e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). Hence, Myc downregulation is expected to deplete snoRNPs and, as a consequence, destabilize the corresponding snoRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Third, Myc also controls the expression of genes that are dedicated to the synthesis of snoRNAs, the so-called Uhg genes (&#x02018;U-snoRNA host genes&#x02019;; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]).

These genes do not contain recognizable open reading frames, and no translation products have been detected (data not shown; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]). Instead, they are dedicated to the generation of snoRNAs: Uhg genes contain up to 16 introns, each of which codes for a single snoRNA &#x02013; 48 snoRNAs for the previously described Uhg genes combined (only two introns do not code for any snoRNA). All of these Uhg (exonic) transcripts are downregulated upon Myc-depletion in the RNAseq data set. qPCR on biologically independent samples confirmed this downregulation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Since all but three of these Uhg-hosted snoRNAs are shorter than 125 nucleotides and, therefore, not contained in our RNAseq data set, we investigated several of these transcripts by qPCR and found that they were also downregulated (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Such a downregulation can also be seen on Northern blots, which further confirms that the mature snoRNAs are affected by Myc depletion and not just their immature precursors (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C shows three snoRNAs that could be detected in S2 cells; see legend). Myc is not only required for the full expression of these Uhg-genes and snoRNAs hosted within their exons, but transient overexpression of Myc is also sufficient to increase their expression to supraphysiological levels (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). Thus, Myc controls the expression of many snoRNAs independently of their stability or the induction of their protein-coding host genes &#x02013; and it does so by direct binding to four of the seven Uhg genes. For Uhg-genes 1, 2 and 5 the Myc peaks are centered on consensus E-boxes, for Uhg4 the Myc peak is located in the vicinity of an E-box (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S6). In addition, Myc binds to a cluster of three snoRNA genes on chromosome 2R, that are arranged in tandem and flanked by a single strongly Myc-bound consensus E-box (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S6B, labeled &#x02018;2R-cluster&#x02019;). Since only seven other snoRNA genes are independently transcribed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we surmise that this cluster might constitute a novel Uhg locus. The binding of Myc to Uhg sequences was confirmed by ChIPs on biologically independent samples (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). It presumably involves Myc:Max complexes (as would be expected for E-box containing targets), since knockdown of Myc&#x02019;s dimerization partner Max reduces Myc recruitment to these Uhg promoters (data not shown). To further corroborate Myc&#x02019;s transcriptional effect on Uhg genes, we cloned a 983&#x000a0;bp genomic DNA fragment, comprising the basal promoter and E-box of the Uhg1 locus, in front of firefly luciferase. This Uhg1 promoter fragment drives strong expression of luciferase upon transfection into S2 cells. RNA-mediated knockdown of Myc reduces relative luciferase expression to a similar extent as that of a reporter driven by the promoter of the previously characterized Myc target CG5033. Conversely, Myc overexpression significantly increases luciferase expression (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C; see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]). Similar results were obtained with a luciferase reporter driven by the Uhg5 promoter region (not shown). Note that reporter activities change more moderately after Myc overexpression than after knockdown. This suggests that Myc levels in na&#x000ef;ve S2 cells may be sufficiently high to saturate the Myc binding sites in the reporter plasmids; alternatively, essential co-factors of Myc may become limiting in conditions of increased Myc expression.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Myc directly binds to and controls Uhg promoters. <bold>A)</bold> ChIPseq profile for the Uhg1 locus in S2 cells.

To determine whether this activity of Myc is evolutionarily conserved, we re-evaluated ChIPseq and RNA expression data from vertebrate cells. The human genome encodes 745 snoRNAs, 419 of which reside in introns of 232 different host genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], including 15 non protein-coding SNHG loci (&#x02018;snoRNA host genes&#x02019;). To address their regulation by vertebrate Myc, we first examined published data from human U2OS cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. When all genes were sorted by the level of Myc binding to their promoters, we observed a significant enrichment for snoRNA host genes among the highly Myc-bound genes (gene set enrichment analysis in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S7A). Thus, as was described for genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], snoRNA host genes are bound by the low physiological levels of c-Myc in U2OS cells. These genes are also activated by c-Myc, as can be seen in murine T-cell lymphomas caused by expression of a tet-controllable Myc transgene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Silencing of the Myc transgene in this system leads to tumor regression. This is accompanied by the rapid up- and down-regulation of 2,287 and 922 genes, respectively, as was determined by Agilent microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. More than 70% of the latter genes are bound by Myc and, therefore, have been proposed to correspond to direct transcriptional targets. snoRNA host genes are highly enriched among Myc-activated genes (gene set enrichment analysis in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S7B). Together with the ChIPseq data above, this shows that Myc directly controls the expression of these host genes, and it suggests that Myc also globally activates the levels of many intronic snoRNAs.</p><p>The impact of vertebrate Myc on snoRNA synthesis can also be observed at the so-called SNHG loci &#x02013; genes that are dedicated to the production of snoRNAs, analogously to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Uhg genes. As an example, the SNHG7 promoter is strongly bound by the low levels of endogenous c-Myc in U2OS cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, center lane in the left panel); this association is at least as strong as that between Myc and its well-established target Nucleolin ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]; Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, center lane in the right panel). Induction of ectopic Myc expression increases the binding to both SNHG7 and Nucleolin further (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A; top lanes), but only slightly augments the expression of these genes (by 1.2 and 1.3 fold, respectively), probably because they are already maximally transactivated by endogenous Myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In contrast, in murine T cells expression of endogenous Myc and binding to the Snhg7 promoter are virtually undetectable (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B, center lane). In these cells, derepression of transgenically expressed Myc triggers strong association with the Snhg7 promoter, and concomitantly induces Snhg7 mRNA expression by 4.4-fold (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B, top row). Importantly, Myc is not only recruited to SNHG7, but to the majority of SNHG promoters in murine and human cells, most often to positions containing canonical E-boxes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C and data not shown; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]). These data show that the control of non-coding snoRNA host genes, in particular, and presumably of snoRNA levels, in general, are an evolutionarily conserved function of Myc proteins.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Myc binds to vertebrate non-coding snoRNA host genes (SNHGs). <bold>A)</bold> ChIPseq traces of SNHG7 (left) and NCL (right; a well characterized, strongly Myc-bound gene) in human U2OS cells, both shown at the same vertical scale. <bold>B)</bold> ChIPseq traces of SNHG7 in murine T cells; the expression level of SNHG7 drops by 4.4-fold after silencing of transgenic Myc expression. <bold>C)</bold> ChIPseq traces for all 15 SNHG loci in U2OS cells.

Using imprecise excision of a P-element we generated a null allele that eliminates the coding regions for all snoRNAs, but does not affect the neighboring genes (<italic>Uhg1</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup>; Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S8A). This mutation is expected to affect 2&#x02019;-O ribose-methylation of 18S- and 28S-rRNA at five positions that are exclusively targeted by Uhg1-snoRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and as a consequence ribosomal assembly and/or activity. Interestingly, 66% of the resulting <italic>Uhg1</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup>/<italic>Uhg1</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> mutant females and 50% of the males survive to adulthood (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;131 and 99, respectively).

Similarly, <italic>Uhg1</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> mutant wandering larvae contain at least as much protein as control animals (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S8C). However, the <italic>Uhg1</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> grow at a significantly slower rate (as inferred from their rate of incorporating radiolabeled amino acids; Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B) and accordingly reach corresponding developmental stages later than wild type flies &#x02013; adult eclosion is delayed by about 12&#x000a0;hours in <italic>Uhg1</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> mutants (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S8D). In addition, <italic>Uhg1</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> females, but not males, show a strongly reduced fertility (not shown). Both such a developmental delay and female-specific sterility are typical manifestations of mutations in pathways affecting growth, and they have been observed for hypomorphic mutations in Myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Consistent with a contribution of Uhg1 to Myc-dependent growth, the documented ability of Myc to promote nuclear growth is blunted in Uhg1 mutant salivary gland cells (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D; compare the relative size of Myc-overexpressing nuclei in wild type versus Uhg1 mutant salivary glands). Together, these data demonstrate that Uhg1 is required for protein synthesis and growth. Nevertheless, the complete absence of Uhg1 has comparatively mild consequences, and in some tissues Uhg1 seems not to be limiting for growth and proliferation. We did not observe any impact of the <italic>Uhg1</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> mutation on the area of imaginal disc cell clones overexpressing Myc (not shown). Similarly, larval brain tumors were not obviously influenced by the complete loss of Uhg1: knockdown of the tumor suppressor <italic>brat</italic> in type II neuroblast stem cell lineages leads to tumors that critically depend on Myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, homozygosity for <italic>Uhg1</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> in such a setting did not reduce tumor mass, nor did it prevent the <italic>brat</italic> knock-down induced reversion of intermediate progenitor cells to supernumerary neuroblasts (not shown). It is possible, though, that the extension of larval development that is caused by the loss of Uhg1, masks a potential reduction in tumor growth rate. As a complementary approach that does not suffer from confounding effects on developmental timing, we therefore investigated the consequences of excessive Uhg levels. We generated various Uhg transgenes and expressed them in different settings. Overexpression of Uhg genes on their own did not increase the size of normal diploid or polyploid cells, nor did this treatment affect the size of cells co-expressing Myc (data not shown). However, independent transgenes for Uhg4 and Uhg5 increased the size of brat-knockdown induced brain tumors, as assayed with a recently described luciferase-based system (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]).

The overwhelming part of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Myc targets control ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis, which, therefore, constitute the core and presumably primordial function of Myc proteins. Among these core targets we find an entire novel gene class that has previously not been recognized as Myc targets: the non protein-coding snoRNAs. Some of Myc&#x02019;s effect on snoRNA levels may be indirect (via the activation of their host genes or by affecting their stability), but a sizable fraction of snoRNAs encoded in Uhg genes is directly transcriptionally activated by Myc (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Schematic of Myc function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

Upon binding to specific protein partners they form snoRNPs that process rRNAs (by catalyzing pseudouridylation, methylation and cleavage) and contribute to their folding, thereby playing an important role in ribosome biogenesis. In addition, some snoRNAs have been shown to regulate alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], affect RNA editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], mediate apoptosis in response to lipotoxic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], serve as progenitors of miRNAs (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]), and they may contribute to the maintenance of open chromatin structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Most animal snoRNAs are encoded in introns of other genes, many of which code for ribosome- and translation-related proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This arrangement is thought to help adapt snoRNA production to a cell&#x02019;s biosynthetic needs. Here, we identify a new means by which the balanced synthesis of the different components of snoRNP complexes is achieved. The protein partners of snoRNAs are well established direct transcriptional targets of Myc, that is, the box C/D snoRNP components Fibrillarin, Nop56, Nop58/Nop5, 15.5K/hoi-polloi, and the box H/ACA snoRNP components GAR1, Dyskerin/Nop60B, NHP2, NOP10/CG7637. Moreover, several factors required for snoRNP assembly or localization are direct Myc targets (for example, Nopp140, U3-55K, DDX18/pitchoune, DDX51/Dbp73D) or show close genetic and physical interaction with Myc (Tip48/reptin, Tip49/pontin) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4 and reviews by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). Thus, a single transcription factor, Myc, controls all components that make up snoRNP particles, as well as several factors that contribute to their function, thereby acting as a master regulator of snoRNP production. At the same time, the production of snoRNPs and rRNA modifications constitute the core function of Myc, as 48% of its mostly highly controlled target genes are dedicated to this task. Our data further show that this control of snoRNA levels by Myc is biologically relevant. The loss of Uhg1-encoded snoRNAs impairs normal growth, whereas overexpression of a subset of Uhg genes promotes tumor growth in a Myc-dependent brain tumor system.</p><p>While our studies have focused on <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we also found that Myc&#x02019;s control of snoRNA host genes is conserved in vertebrates. Indeed, recent publications provide support for Myc&#x02019;s role in snoRNA expression. A bioinformatic analysis of 131 intergenic human snoRNA promoters found an enrichment of E-boxes, that is, potential Myc binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This suggests that, in addition to intronic snoRNAs (our data), independently transcribed snoRNAs might be activated by direct Myc binding. Moreover, several snoRNAs were found to be significantly overexpressed in neuroblastomas with high-level N-Myc expression (that is, N-Myc amplification), as well as in cultured cell lines in response to N-Myc activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. This observation raises the possibility that snoRNAs contribute to the growth of N-Myc dependent tumors, analogously to what we observed upon overexpression of Uhg genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> type II neuroblast tumors. Several publications point to a possible role for snoRNA deregulation in other cancers as well (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]). Thus, the levels of snoRNAs are elevated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), acute leukemias, and metastatic prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], and individual snoRNAs have been shown to contribute to cellular proliferation and/or transformation (SNORD114-1 in K562 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], SNORA42 in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]).

Most of these small RNAs function as part of ribonucleoproteins to post-transcriptionally modify rRNAs, which then presumably affects ribosome activity. Indeed, several observations in vertebrate tumors (as well as our experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) suggest a correlation between the levels of certain snoRNAs and the rate of normal and/or pathological growth. It remains to be seen whether this reflects a global alteration of protein synthesis or differential effects on specific proteins. The accessibility of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system, both for loss-of-function and overexpression approaches, raises the possibility of experimentally addressing these issues in the future. In short, our data highlight the non-coding snoRNAs as a novel and evolutionarily conserved class of direct Myc targets that are likely to play an important role both in normal development, as well as in Myc-dependent pathological growth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Generation of mutant flies, transgenes and reporters</title><p>The allele <italic>Uhg1</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> (null mutant) and <italic>Uhg1</italic><sup><italic>rev</italic></sup> (wild type revertant) were generated by mobilization of P{w[+mC]&#x02009;=&#x02009;EP}Uhg1[G11659] (Bloomington Stock Center number B-28084, Indiana University; Bloomington, IN, USA), inserted after position chr2R:13&#x02019;586&#x02019;605 (coordinates throughout refer to genome release 5) in Uhg1 exon 1. <italic>Uhg1</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> carries a deletion of nucleotides chr2R:13&#x02019;586&#x02019;606 to 13&#x02019;590&#x02019;803 (first to last exon of Uhg1).</p><p>UAS-Uhg transgenes were generated in a &#x02018;y w&#x02019; background by cloning appropriate PCR fragments (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5) into pUAS-T, followed by sequence verification and standard transgenesis procedures.</p><p>Additional flies: wor-GAL4 ase-GAL80/CyO; UAS-brat-IR UAS-FLuc/TM3, Sb Ser tubulin-GAL80[ts] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], actin-FRT-CD2-FRT-GAL4 hs-FLP (H.Stocker, ETH Z&#x000fc;rich, Switzerland), UAS-vito::GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] (Bloomington Stock Center).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> analysis</title><p>To measure the time from egg deposition to adult eclosion, timed egg lays (5 to 14&#x000a0;hours) were performed in 10 to 50 culture vials per genotype (&#x02018;y w; <italic>Uhg1</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup>/CyO, y&#x02009;+&#x02009;&#x02019;, &#x02018;y w; <italic>Uhg1</italic><sup><italic>rev</italic></sup>&#x02019;, &#x02018;y w&#x02019;, &#x02018;y w; <italic>Uhg1</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup>/CyO,y+&#x02019; x &#x02018;y w&#x02019;), so as to avoid overcrowding.
