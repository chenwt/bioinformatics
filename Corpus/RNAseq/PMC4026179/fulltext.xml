Of the four gene clusters identified, the FOX/CREB cluster had the strongest association with LKB1 loss in the training cohort. Analysis of perturbed genes from the connectivity map also revealed induction of this cluster by colforsin, an adenylate cyclase stimulator that activates CREB, and by the typical antipsychotics thioridazine, prochlorperazine, and trifluoperazine, which have been identified as stimulators of FOXO transcription factors.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> We then searched the GEO and Array Express data repositories and found corroborating evidence for CREB and FOXO3 activation within this cluster.

In particular, we show that <italic>LKB1</italic> loss in lung adenocarcinomas is associated with a characteristic pattern of gene expression changes, which can be used to accurately predict <italic>LKB1</italic> loss and is also directly responsive to <italic>LKB1</italic> activation in vitro. We integrate analysis of these gene expression patterns with data on somatic mutations and protein expression to describe novel associations between <italic>LKB1</italic> and other oncogenic pathways, especially activation of the NRF2 pathway for reactive oxygen detoxification and dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT/FOXO3 pathway, both of which have important effects on multiple cellular phenotypes and can affect response to a variety of anticancer treatments. The identification of previously unknown phenotypes associated with <italic>LKB1</italic> loss has also been a major rationale for the development and study of the murine model of <italic>Lkb1/Kras</italic>-mutant lung cancer. However, our meta-analysis of <italic>LKB1</italic>-associated gene expression shows that <italic>LKB1</italic> loss produces distinctly different effects in murine tumors than in human lung adenocarcinomas and cell lines.

This high level of overlap may suggest that selective pressure exists for the activation of NRF2 as a secondary protective mechanism to compensate for <italic>LKB1</italic> loss.</p><p>Down-regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is also evident among resected lung adenocarcinomas with <italic>LKB1</italic> loss. The mechanism by which <italic>LKB1</italic> loss decreases PI3K/AKT signaling is unclear, but several possibilities are worth mentioning. One possibility is that mTOR activation resulting from LKB1 loss could result in feedback inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling,<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> analogous to the effects seen in tumors exhibiting TSC2 loss.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Direct interaction of LKB1 and AKT has also been demonstrated,<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> and LKB1 has been shown to facilitate AKT activation and exert antiapoptotic effects, including inhibitory phosphorylation of the proapoptotic FOXO3 transcription factor.<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Of note, activation of FOXO3 was also suggested by analysis of gene expression, showing that down-regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway may result in alterations in downstream pathway activation. This work guides future functional experiments to explore the interplay of <italic>LKB1</italic> with these various pathways and the resulting effects on clinically relevant phenotypes such as response to targeted inhibitors.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank W.
