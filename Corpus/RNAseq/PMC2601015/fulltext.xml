Despite the status of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as arguably the most well-studied model eukaryote, we still do not have a full catalog or understanding of all its genes. In order to interrogate the transcriptome of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> for low abundance or rapidly turned over transcripts, we deleted elements of the RNA degradation machinery with the goal of preferentially increasing the relative abundance of such transcripts. We then used high-resolution tiling microarrays and ultra high&#x02013;throughput sequencing (UHTS) to identify, map, and validate unannotated transcripts that are more abundant in the RNA degradation mutants relative to wild-type cells. We identified 365 currently unannotated transcripts, the majority presumably representing low abundance or short-lived RNAs, of which 185 are previously unknown and unique to this study. It is likely that many of these are cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), which are rapidly degraded and whose function(s) within the cell are still unclear, while others may be novel functional transcripts. Of the 185 transcripts we identified as novel to our study, greater than 80 percent come from regions of the genome that have lower conservation scores amongst closely related yeast species than 85 percent of the verified ORFs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Such regions of the genome have typically been less well-studied, and by definition transcripts from these regions will distinguish <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> from these closely related species.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, because of the relative ease of its genetic manipulation and its ease of handling in the laboratory, has long served as a model on which studies in higher organisms have been based. To more fully understand how eukaryotic cells express their genomes, we sought to identify RNA species that are transcribed at very low levels or that are rapidly degraded. We created mutants deficient in the ability to degrade RNA, with the expectation that this would increase the relative abundance of such RNAs, and then used high-resolution microarrays and sequencing technologies to locate and identify from where these RNAs are transcribed. Using this approach, we have identified 365 transcripts that do not appear in the most current list of annotated <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> RNA transcripts; of these, 185 are unique to our study. Many of these novel transcripts derive from regions of the genome that are poorly conserved between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and other closely related yeast species, suggesting that these RNAs may play an important role in the divergent microevolution of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Twelve years ago, in a landmark study resulting from the collaborative work of hundreds of scientists around the world, the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> became the first eukaryote to have its genome fully sequenced <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Goffeau1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The initial analysis of the genome utilized the following (necessarily) arbitrary rules for defining whether an Open Reading Frame (ORF) was a protein-coding gene (a &#x0201c;genic ORF&#x0201d;) or not: 1) a genic ORF had to start with ATG and have at least 100 sense codons, and 2) if two ORFs of more than 100 sense codons overlapped one another by more than 50&#x00025; of their lengths, then the longer was picked as being a genic ORF, while the shorter was discarded. In this way, it was determined that the sequence of 12,068 kilobases contained 5,885 potential protein-coding genes. In addition, non-protein-coding genes consisting of approximately 140 ribosomal RNA genes, 40 small nuclear RNA genes, and 275 transfer RNA genes were identified using various criteria, resulting in a total of approximately 6,340 genes.</p><p>Early analyses of the predicted protein-coding genes showed that about 35&#x00025; had no known function or homolog <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Dujon1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, leading to questions about the validity of the rules used to identify genic ORFs. Various algorithmic methods have predicted fewer genes in the yeast genome than the originally predicted number of 6,340, based on a variety of criteria <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Cebrat1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1000299-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, while other methods have found and verified new ones, especially non-coding genes <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Lowe1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000299-McCutcheon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

However, new genes added by one study are frequently marked as &#x02018;dubious&#x02019; by another, as recorded within the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database (SGD) <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Hirschman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, indicating the speculative nature of many of these annotations. Additionally, a recent study <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> has shown that the use of comparative genomics alone to determine whether or not a genomic region is likely to harbor a genic ORF can result in false negatives, since many transcribed elements may not be conserved across even closely related species. It has been suggested that such ORFs may be important for the micro-evolutionary divergence between species. Clearly, even in a genome as simple as, and containing as few introns as that of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, it is still not straightforward to identify all of the genes simply based on the DNA sequence.</p><p>Hybridization of RNA to tiling microarrays (microarrays containing overlapping, offset probes that tile across the entire genome) has been used to generate genome-wide transcript profiles and to detect previously unannotated transcripts. While this technique has its own caveats, it overcomes the limitations of many previous attempts to find undiscovered transcripts, by providing direct experimental support with high-resolution data. Tiling array studies have revealed more than 5,000 novel transcripts in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>

In yeast, tiling array experiments performed by David et al. <xref rid="pgen.1000299-David1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, using RNA isolated from a single experimental condition, identified almost 800 novel (i.e., not annotated in SGD <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Hirschman1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>) transcripts.</p><p>Recently, Miura et al. <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, also working with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, performed large-scale sequencing of vector-capped cDNA clones <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Ohtake1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000299-Kato1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> from two cDNA libraries to accurately map over 11,000 transcriptional start sites (TSSs). Of these predicted transcripts, 667 were novel (many of which were also identified by David et al.), and contained ORFs corresponding to 100 amino acids or less and thus would have been missed in the original annotation. Furthermore, they discovered 45 new introns, 367 novel antisense transcripts, and showed that most yeast genes have two or more TSSs, demonstrating that the transcriptional potential of the yeast genome is more complex than previously thought. In total, their analysis detected only 3,599 of the more than 6,000 currently annotated genic ORFs, suggesting either that many genes were missing from their cDNA library, or that many of the annotated genic ORFs are not correct.</p><p>Recent advances in sequencing technology <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Margulies1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1000299-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> have allowed an unprecedented look at the transcriptome, using a method known as RNA-Seq <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Mortazavi1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.

In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, there are two major pathways that play a role in the decay of mRNAs in the cytoplasm, both of which involve deadenylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000299-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In the first pathway, deadenylation is followed by the removal of the 5&#x02032; m7G cap by Dcp1p and Dcp2p, which is then followed by degradation in the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; direction by Xrn1p <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Decker1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1000299-LaGrandeur1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In addition to Dcp1p and Dcp2p, there exists a group of proteins that function as activators for decapping, including Pat1p, the Lsm1-7p complex, and Dhh1p <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Bonnerot1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1000299-Tharun2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In the second pathway, deadenylated mRNAs are degraded in the 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; direction by the exosome and the Ski complex (consisting of Ski2p, Ski3p, and Ski8p) <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000299-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.

Such RNAs are poorly understood, sometimes being referred to as &#x02018;transcriptional noise&#x02019;, whose expression may be initiated from inadvertent binding of RNA polymerase complexes to DNA sequences that bear resemblance to &#x02018;real&#x02019; transcriptional promoters. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, some of these transcripts are rapidly degraded and have been labeled as cryptic unstable transcripts or CUTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000299-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Wyers1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> and reviewed in <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Chanfreau1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000299-Bickel1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>). While the roles of these CUTs are unclear, the mechanism by which these RNAs are degraded has been elucidated and it has been shown that they are specifically targeted for degradation via polyadenylation by the non-canonical polyadenylation protein Trf4p, a component of the TRAMP complex <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Wyers1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000299-Haracska1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000299-Egecioglu1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Why these RNAs are transcribed at all, and why a specific degradation pathway exists for them in the budding yeast remains speculative.</p><p>To identify additional novel transcripts in the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we have employed both tiling microarrays and RNA-Seq, with the explicit goal of identifying those transcripts that are either short-lived and/or occur in low abundance. Such transcripts may include previously unrecognized protein-coding transcripts and non-coding transcripts, as well as cryptic unstable transcripts and &#x02018;transcriptional noise&#x02019;. To allow better detection of these types of transcripts, we have analyzed RNA isolated from three strains containing various combinations of deletions of six genes that play a role in RNA processing (<italic>RRP6</italic>, <italic>XRN1</italic>, <italic>PAT1</italic>, <italic>LSM1</italic>, <italic>SKI2</italic> and <italic>SKI8</italic>), with the hypothesis that the most unstable and/or least abundant transcripts would show the greatest relative change in abundance in such mutants. The mutant-derived RNA was compared to RNA from wild-type cells, using Affymetrix strand-specific tiling microarrays. Novel strand-specific transcripts were identified by segmentation of the relative expression measures from the tiling arrays and subsequently validated using Illumina's Solexa sequencing platform. Using a combined tiling array and RNA-Seq approach, we have identified a total of 365 transcripts that are currently unannotated in SGD.

We wanted to provide, in a high-throughput fashion, distinct and complementary lines of evidence for the existence of each putative transcript. We thus selected two technologies as being appropriate for this aim: tiling arrays and high-throughput sequencing. We used the tiling arrays to discover novel transcribed segments, with their strand of origin information. This approach has been used successfully in previous studies <xref rid="pgen.1000299-David1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and there are well-established computational and statistical methods for analyzing tiling array data. Tiling arrays, as opposed to high-throughput sequencing, provide an even spacing of measurements across the entire genome, making them more amenable to off-the-shelf segmentation algorithms. In addition, an entire population of molecules is hybridized to the microarray, whereas a sequencing based approach is inherently a sampling strategy, limited by the depth to which one can afford to sequence, and by the complexity of the sample being sequenced. However, high-throughput sequencing provides an independent experimental platform well-suited for transcript validation as each read provides distinct evidence for the presence of a transcribed segment.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Discovery of Novel Transcripts Using Tiling Microarrays</title><p>Tiling microarray analysis of mRNA from yeast grown under a diverse set of several different conditions suggested that the greatest fraction of known transcripts are detectable in the presence of high salt (0.8 M NaCl) (our unpublished results); we thus chose high salt as the growth condition used in the experiments described herein.

In order to correct for probe-specific effects and to detect only those transcripts that were differentially expressed between a mutant and the wild-type, we used as expression measures the log ratio of mutant PM intensities to wild-type PM intensities. We segmented the log ratios using a piecewise constant change point model as implemented in the &#x02018;segment&#x02019; function in the R package &#x02018;tilingArray&#x02019; <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Huber1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> from Bioconductor <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Gentleman1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Following Huber et al., we utilized the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) penalized likelihood to select the number of transcribed segments. Poly A&#x0002b; RNA and total RNA microarray data were segmented separately. Based on a visual assessment of the resulting segmentation it appeared that BIC overestimated the number of segments (also noted by Huber et al.).</p><p>Oversegmentation makes downstream validation of the segments more challenging, as putative segments are judged in pieces as opposed to their entirety. Thus, we post-processed the segmented data to: (1) join adjacent segments with similar expression measures, (2) drop segments that are not differentially expressed, using a threshold of &#x0003c;0.5 on the log<sub>2</sub> scale, (3) remove segments overlapping known annotation on the same strand, (4) remove segments containing fewer than 5 probes, and (5) remove segments opposite known annotation if they had a log<sub>2</sub> fold change less than 2, or there was detectable transcription on the opposite strand (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for a detailed discussion). For the sake of consistency, we will now refer to our post-processed segments as clusters, as they may refer to one or more original segments. After segmentation and post-processing of the tiling microarray data, we identified 892 candidate clusters in the poly A&#x0002b; RNA data (826 of which were intergenic) and 338 from the total RNA data (324 of which were intergenic). Our criteria in analyzing the microarray data were somewhat liberal, with the aim of being as inclusive as possible; however, we coupled this with more stringent criteria for subsequent validation by sequencing, with the expectation that many of these clusters identified from the tiling microarrays would not be subsequently validated. All subsequent analyses were done at the cluster level.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Validation of Novel Transcripts Using Ultra&#x02212;High Throughput Sequencing</title><p>Following identification of these clusters from the tiling array data, we sought to validate them using sequencing. The same RNAs harvested for the tiling microarray experiments were used to generate cDNA libraries for ultra high-throughput sequencing on a Solexa 1G Genome Analyzer. Libraries were generated from double polyA purified RNAs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) from both the wild-type and the mutant strains, and were run on four lanes each of a Solexa flow cell. Reads that passed Solexa's software filters were aligned to the genome using ELAND, allowing up to two mismatches per read. For subsequent analyses, we retained only reads mapping to a unique location, and in total, we generated more than 50 million uniquely mappable reads across all four strains. The wild-type library generated a total of 14,103,067 uniquely mapped reads from four lanes, the &#x00394;<italic>rrp6</italic>&#x00394;<italic>lsm1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>pat1</italic> mutant library generated 14,745,813 reads, the &#x00394;<italic>ski2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ski8</italic>&#x00394;<italic>rrp6</italic> mutant library 14,973,577 reads, and the &#x00394;<italic>xrn1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>rrp6</italic>&#x00394;<italic>lsm1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>pat1</italic> mutant library 10,714,094 reads.

Background regions were defined as regions that were intergenic on both strands, with the following additional regions removed: novel regions identified in David et al., Davis and Ares, Miura et al., and Nagalakshmi et al. <xref rid="pgen.1000299-David1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000299-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000299-Nagalakshmi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000299-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, as well as putative novel regions identified in this study using the tiling array.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000299-g002">Figure 2</xref> demonstrates that with an increase in sequencing effort there would be a diminishing return in terms of percentage of bases sequenced to a certain depth. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000299-g002">Figure 2</xref> also illustrates that an increase in sequencing effort results in an increase in the percentage of bases sequenced from both background and intronic regions (see discussion). This is the case in our data as well as those of Nagalakshmi et al. This implies that any method for declaring a gene as &#x0201c;detected&#x0201d; must evaluate the data in the context of the reads observed in these regions.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000299-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows ROC-like curves depicting the tradeoff between detecting ORFs and detecting background regions, as we vary the detection cutoff. These plots demonstrate that the choice of a detection cutoff imposes a sample specific tradeoff between detecting annotated ORFs and background regions. For subsequent analyses, we chose a cutoff corresponding to calling 20&#x00025; of background regions detected. Using this cutoff, we detected on average 75&#x00025; of the Verified ORFs across all four experiments.</p><fig id="pgen-1000299-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000299.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>ROC-like curves depicting the relationship between the percentage of detected Verified ORFs and percentage of detected Intronic/Background regions, as the detection threshold varies.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000299.g003"/></fig><p>A GO analysis <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Boyle1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> of the Verified ORFs that were not detected above background indicated a significant enrichment for ORFs whose gene products are involved in the cell cycle and sporulation. The lack of sporulation gene expression is not surprising, as the cells would not be expected to be undergoing sporulation under these conditions; as for cell cycle gene expression, presumably the salt shock shuts off the cell cycle, and those transcripts are no longer detected at these thresholds by the time we collected the cells (30 minutes after exposure to salt).</p><p>In addition, we also analyzed our sequence reads to look at the dynamic range of detected transcripts. By considering Verified ORFs (&#x0003e;50 unique bp) that were detectable above background in the sequence data, the most abundantly expressed transcript in every mutant, and the wild-type, in terms of number of mapped reads per unique base was that of <italic>HSP12</italic> (<italic>YFL014W</italic>), which is known to be induced under conditions of osmotic stress. Its average number of reads per unique nucleotide was &#x0223c;400 in every case. The least abundant transcript was different in each mutant, but with an average number of reads per base of less than 1. Thus, transcript abundances of the Verified ORFs (as measured by sequencing) span at least 3 orders of magnitude (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000299.s010">Table S3</xref> for read counts and RPKMs <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Mortazavi1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> for all annotated ORFs).</p><p>As another measurement of the validity of the sequenced libraries, we determined how many known introns we were able to detect by looking for reads that spanned exon-exon junctions. To detect these intron spanning reads, we identified those reads that mapped to the set of spliced genic ORFs but did not map to the unspliced genome. The wild-type and mutant libraries each generated sequence reads that map to exon-exon junctions, which, when combined, confirm splice junctions in 244 (86&#x00025;) of the 284 known spliced ORFs reported in the current SGD annotation. In the most extreme case (<italic>RPL28</italic>) we saw 1399 reads that mapped to the exon-exon junction in the data from the &#x00394;<italic>rrp6</italic>&#x00394;<italic>lsm1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>pat1</italic> mutant. Of those forty genes whose exon-exon junctions we failed to detect, two were in mitochondrial genes, and 16 were in Dubious or Uncharacterized ORFs. Of the remaining 22, six of the genes are expressed in meiosis, and fourteen have an initial exon of only a few residues. These were less likely to have been detected by our strategy, as we looked for reads that matched the ORF sequence and not the genome, which would have had to start at a few specific residues to be detected. Subsequent analysis, by inclusion of 5&#x02032; UTR sequence to capture such exon boundary spanning reads, was able to identify these remaining introns. Thus, only two Verified ORFs, <italic>YER014C-A/BUD25</italic> and <italic>YPL075W/GCR1</italic>, which were not meiosis specific, failed to have reads detected that spanned their exon junctions. <italic>BUD25</italic> is opposite two other Verified ORFs in the genome, while Nagalakshmi et al <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Nagalakshmi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> also noted that they were unable to identify exon-exon boundary spanning reads for <italic>GCR1</italic>. Indeed, we were able to identify reads that spanned the 5&#x02032; exon-intron junction, and the 3&#x02032; intron-exon junction, suggesting that the intron is misannotated.</p><p>We then examined an integrated dataset consisting of our tiling array and sequencing data as well as data from other published high-resolution studies. Various statistics of the potentially novel transcripts were computed to determine our proposed changes to the set of transcripts produced from the yeast genome. Firstly, we required that a cluster had to contain at least 50&#x00025; uniquely mappable bases. For every potential novel transcript identified by our microarray data in a particular mutant, we employed the following criteria to Solexa data originating from the same mutant to validate the transcript: (A) the transcript detectable above background level, (B) the transcript differentially expressed between the mutant and the wild-type, and (C) the transcript differentially expressed when compared to its surrounding regions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for detailed explanation of precise criteria and cutoffs used for determination of validity).</p><p>In addition, we analyzed our data for the presence of reads containing a putative poly A&#x0002b; tail, which would allow us to infer both the strand of origin as well as a precise 3&#x02032; boundary, however, very few such reads were present in our dataset most likely due to our use of random priming as opposed to oligo dT priming.</p><p>Following validation of individual clusters, we determined which clusters were common across the different mutants and as well as our poly A&#x0002b; and total RNA hybridizations. 240 of our validated clusters were found in data from only one microarray, 79 were found in 2, 26 in 3, and 20 were found in 4 or more of the six microarrays, resulting in 365 validated transcripts (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000299.s008">Table S1</xref>), identified by virtue of differential transcript abundance between one or more mutants and the wild-type strain. Of these, 204 were found exclusively in the poly A&#x0002b; RNA, 86 were found exclusively in the total RNA fraction, and 75 were detected in both. Several of these overlap with novel transcripts identified in recent studies: 67 with David et al. <xref rid="pgen.1000299-David1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, 116 with Miura et al. <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 46 with Nagalakshmi et al. <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Nagalakshmi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, and 43 with Davis et al <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Beyond these, our 365 validated transcripts includes 185 additional previously undescribed transcripts, which we were able to discover by down-regulating RNA degradation. The majority of these novel transcripts (140 of 185) were found and validated in a single mutant only, with only 45 of them being identified and validated on two or more mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000299-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen-1000299-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000299.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Venn diagram showing the distribution of novel segments between the different mutants within which they were discovered.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000299.g004"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Characterization of Validated Transcripts</title><p>For each of the potential novel transcripts, their immediate surrounding regions were plotted (e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000299-g005">Figures 5</xref> through <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000299-g006"/>

There is a large region of low nucleosome occupancy just upstream of it, suggesting that the region is indeed transcribed, and the transcript itself overlaps with the nucleosome dip of the downstream ORF, suggesting that this new transcript may play a role in the transcriptional regulation of the ORF downstream of it. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000299-g010">Figure 10</xref> shows a relatively long transcript (1,721 bp) on the Watson strand that is also seen in David et al. and Nagalakshmi et al. It is highly conserved and the presence of a nucleosome dip upstream suggests that this region is transcribed.</p><p>We analyzed all of our novel transcripts for potential open reading frames, to determine if any were likely to be protein-coding. In each case, the longest open reading frame was translated and blasted against the non-redundant protein dataset (nr) from GenBank. The shortest novel transcript identified was 47 nucleotides long (intergenic), while the longest was 1,869 nucleotides in length (also intergenic), though the longest ORF that it contains only has the potential to encode a peptide 80 amino acids in length. The longest ORF that we discovered within all of our novel transcripts was within an &#x0223c;438 bp transcript on the Watson strand of chromosome 7 (coordinates 23,339&#x02013;23,777), with the potential to encode an 87 amino acid polypeptide. However, this potential peptide showed no significant similarity when BLASTed against the GenBank non-redundant protein dataset. The remaining longest ORFs within each novel transcript were all shorter, with no significant similarities to any known proteins. It is not clear whether this means they do not encode proteins, or whether they encode novel, short proteins, which are currently uncharacterized due to their low conservation. We also analyzed each of our novel transcripts for any matches to known RNA structures present in the RFAM database <xref rid="pgen.1000299-GriffithsJones1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000299-GriffithsJones2" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, but none of the sequences showed matches to any RFAM entries.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Validation of Transcripts Identified in Other Studies</title><p>Using our detected above background statistic, we sought to determine the percentage of recently published novel transcripts present in our sequencing data. It should be noted that non-detection based on our data does not imply non-existence of these transcripts due to the differing experimental conditions as well as the distinct assays. Using our wild-type data, we detected 18.1&#x00025; of the 487 Nagalakshmi et al. transcripts, 43.7&#x00025; of the 784 David et al. transcripts, and 16.3&#x00025; of the 667 Miura et al. transcripts. Using our &#x00394;<italic>rrp6</italic>&#x00394;<italic>lsm1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>pat1</italic> data, we detected 65.3&#x00025; of the 176 Davis and Ares transcripts (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000299.s009">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000299.s009">Table S2</xref> for a discussion of which transcripts were used from each study).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have clearly demonstrated that there is still much we do not know about the transcriptome of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, despite its deserved reputation as the most well-characterized eukaryote. Unbiased genome-wide studies of the budding yeast transcriptome <xref rid="pgen.1000299-David1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000299-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000299-Nagalakshmi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> have yielded a remarkable amount of information, regarding new transcripts, new introns, the presence and location of antisense transcripts, and corrections to the current annotation. As described here, we have utilized tiling microarrays in conjunction with &#x0201c;next-generation&#x0201d; technologies to sequence cDNA libraries, with which we generated more than 50 million uniquely mappable reads from a wild-type and four mutant strains. Using these data, we have identified and validated 365 transcripts, the majority of which are more abundant in one or more of the RNA turnover mutants than in the wild-type strain (with a minority being less abundant), all of which are currently unannotated in SGD. The functions of these new RNAs remain unknown, though it is possible that many of the newly discovered transcripts correspond to CUTs, which normally would have been targeted for degradation by the TRAMP complex, but have been stabilized in the mutant background. Others may correspond to novel functional transcripts. These novel transcripts do not contain long ORFs capable of encoding proteins with recognizable similarity to known proteins; it is not clear whether this means they do not encode proteins or whether they code for hitherto unknown proteins with no known homologs. They also do not contain any recognizable RNA structures found in the RFAM database.</p><p>While our work described here has much in common with the work described in David et al. and Nagalakshmi et al., our use of RNA turnover mutants resulted in the finding of an additional 185 novel transcripts that may have otherwise remained undiscovered. Miura et al.'s use of vector-capped cDNA clone libraries is powerful in that it has a single nucleotide resolution, as opposed to our tiling microarray resolution of 4 nucleotides, allowing these authors to map transcriptional start sites to the exact nucleotide, in a high throughput manner. The use of overlapping, but non-identical, techniques among all these studies (including this one) has resulted in an ever more detailed knowledge of the yeast transcriptome.</p><p>In our approach, we utilized a high-throughput discovery and validation pipeline. Clearly, much work needs to be done to characterize and understand the transcripts discovered here as well as those discovered in previous studies, however a first step in characterizing the transcripts is localization and then validation. In our computational analysis we employed a strategy of being lenient in identification of putative novel transcripts (differentially expressed at 0.5 on the log2 scale). This was followed by a strict validation step (at our thresholds, on average 75&#x00025; of annotated Verified ORFs were detected in our 3 mutant experiments as described by the ROC-like curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000299-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Many (&#x0223c;55&#x00025;) of the clusters found in the microarray analysis were not validated by these stringent thresholds. These tended to be shorter, be less differentially expressed and included many clusters that were less abundant in the mutants as compared to wild-type. By using distinct assays with rigorous criteria for transcript validation, we have elucidated more of the regions of the yeast genome that are transcribed.</p><p>In our attempt to find low abundance and transient transcripts by restricting our search to transcripts that were present in differential relative abundance in our RNA processing mutants, we may have missed transcripts that are present in the mutant and the wild-type at the same abundance. This was a caveat we had to consider in the pursuit of transcripts that we believed would otherwise be difficult to detect, and the discovery of 185 novel transcripts despite the work of other comprehensive genome-wide transcriptome studies shows that our strategy was a fruitful one. By utilizing the strand-specific tiling array were able to localize transcripts to their strand of origin, something that was not possible (without introducing a 3&#x02032; bias to the data by priming the labeling reaction with oligo-dT) with the current protocols for RNA-Seq using the Solexa 1G Genome Analyzer. It is likely that modified protocols will soon address this shortcoming, and indeed such protocols for the ABI SOLiD sequencing system have been recently published <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Cloonan1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>.</p><p>We can now ask the important and obvious question: has the yeast transcriptome been completely described, and what does completion mean? It is possible that if we sequence deeply enough, we may observe that every nucleotide within the genome is transcribed at some level (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000299-g002">Figure 2</xref>), though clearly this is not a strict enough criterion to allow us to identify a transcribed segment. The genome-wide studies that have set out to discover new transcripts in yeast in an unbiased fashion have so far used a limited set of experimental conditions. Thus, it seems likely that deep sequencing of RNA from dozens of possible conditions (which must be carefully chosen to span as much of the &#x0201c;expression space&#x0201d; as possible) will yield yet more new transcripts, or show new variations in existing ones. It will be of particular interest to profile all of these novel transcripts under a variety of conditions to see how they are regulated and co-regulated, as well as to determine whether they encode proteins or functional RNAs, and whether their absence results in a detectable phenotype.</p><p>Since many of the recently discovered transcripts (including those in this study) have been found in regions of the genome where there is little or no sequence conservation (though the conservation scores from Siepel et al. <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Siepel1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref> do not indicate whether these regions are evolving neutrally, or under positive selection), it will be informative to profile different and diverse strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to determine if these transcripts are ubiquitous within the species, and to determine whether the syntenic (but non-conserved) regions within closely related species within the <italic>Saccharomyces sensu stricto</italic> are also transcribed. With such data, we can hope to discover and hopefully appreciate not only how each of these species are related to one another, but also how their transcriptional potential and networks have diverged.</p><p>Since the landmark publication of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome sequence 12 years ago, more than 25,000 research publications on yeast have appeared, yet we are still adding to our knowledge of the transcriptome of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. While arguably the most well-understood eukaryote, we still do not have a complete understanding of such a fundamental concept as &#x0201c;what and where are all of its genes.&#x0201d; New technologies such as high resolution tiling microarrays and ultra high-throughput sequencing are opening up new avenues of research, and it is clear that the quantity of data that these technologies allow us to generate will only increase. This study (and others like it) underscores how much work remains to be done in understanding and cataloging the transcriptomes of even the most well-studied model organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains</title><p>All deletions were created in a diploid <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strain which was created by crossing strains FY23 and FY86 <xref rid="pgen.1000299-Winston1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, which are isogenic to the sequenced strain S288C and carry the auxotrophic markers: his3-&#x00394;200, leu2-&#x00394;1, trp1-&#x00394;63, and ura3-52.

Uneven spacing in the tiling array probes occurs due to repeat regions often leaving an area of the chromosome tiled at a lower density. In order to keep the cutoffs consistent through these areas we employ the strategy of enforcing a minimum length at the base and probe level. These joined segments were then referred to as clusters.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Drop all baseline clusters as well as any cluster with fewer than 5 probes or a length less than 40 bp.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Remove any cluster that overlaps any known transcribed annotation on the same strand.
