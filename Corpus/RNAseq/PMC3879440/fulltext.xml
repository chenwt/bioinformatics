Genes associated with disease resistance are overrepresented among those showing structural variations, suggesting an adaptive role for gene and exon presence&#x02013;absence variation (PAV). To shed light on the possible functional relevance of polymorphic coding region loss and the mechanisms driving this process, we characterized genes that have lost entire exons or their whole coding regions in 17 fully sequenced <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> accessions. We found that although a significant enrichment in genes associated with certain functional categories is observed, PAV events are largely restricted to genes with signatures of reduced essentiality: PAV genes tend to be newer additions to the genome, tissue specific, and lowly expressed. In addition, PAV genes are located in regions of lower gene density and higher transposable element density. Partial coding region PAV events were associated with only a marginal reduction in gene expression level in the affected accession and occurred in genes with higher levels of alternative splicing in the Col-0 accession. Together, these results suggest that although adaptive scenarios cannot be ruled out, PAV events can be explained without invoking them.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>exon deletion</kwd><kwd>presence&#x02013;absence variation</kwd><kwd>whole genome evolution</kwd><kwd>transposable elements</kwd><kwd>adaptive evolution</kwd><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Intraspecies variation in gene content represents an important source of heterogeneity in the genome of a species and potentially contributes to an organism&#x02019;s adaptability in response to external pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B16">Feuk et al. 2006</xref>). Cataloguing significant gains and losses in coding regions within or between species will allow a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the molecular evolution of genomes and can assist in identifying functional variation in agronomically elite varieties of staple crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B44">Wang, You, et al. 2013</xref>). To this end, several studies have examined polymorphic full or partial gene loss in several plant species. For instance, after resequencing 50 rice genomes, up to 1,327 possible gene loss events (2.4% of the total gene set) were detected relative to the Nipponbare reference accession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B49">Xu et al. 2012</xref>). Significant intraspecies variation in gene content has also been reported in maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B39">Swanson-Wagner et al. 2010</xref>), sorghum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B53">Zheng et al. 2011</xref>), and soybean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B27">McHale et al. 2012</xref>). Previous studies in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, using resequencing microarrays and Illumina sequencing-by-synthesis reads, have also shown significant variations in total nuclear genome sequence among naturally occurring strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B13">Clark et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B33">Ossowski et al. 2008</xref>). A more recent study using 18 fully sequenced <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genomes found that, relative to the reference accession Col-0, 93.4% of proteins had intraspecies variation in their genes, inclusive of large deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B17">Gan et al. 2011</xref>) with around 775 genes per accession found to have deletions spanning 50% or more of their coding region sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B17">Gan et al. 2011</xref>). A comparison of 80 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genomes found that 9% of the total genes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> showed presence&#x02013;absence variation (PAV) averaging 444 absent genes per accession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B41">Tan et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p>Characterization of coding region PAV has shown certain gene categories to be significantly enriched. For instance, 52 of the 154 nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) <italic>R</italic> (resistance) genes were found to be deleted in at least 1 of 50 rice cultivars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B49">Xu et al. 2012</xref>). Similar overrepresentation of the <italic>R</italic> genes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> has also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B4">Bakker et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B37">Shen et al. 2006</xref>), while in the soybean, genes enriched in structural variation are more likely to be involved in nucleotide binding and biotic defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B27">McHale et al. 2012</xref>). Enrichment of particular functional gene categories among genes affected by structural polymorphism suggests these structural polymorphisms may have a functional role, allowing accessions to be better adapted to the environmental conditions they face.</p><p>However, this hypothesis has not been explicitly tested. If significant polymorphic deletions are adaptive, we would expect that affected genes should show multiple signatures of being under selection. On the other hand, if structural polymorphisms mostly affect genes evolving under relaxed constraints, then their adaptive significance should be questioned.</p><p>Here we characterize genes affected by PAV spanning whole exons in <italic>A. thaliana,</italic> to investigate which genomic features, if any, are associated with these polymorphisms.

A subset of the annotated deletions was experimentally validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B17">Gan et al. 2011</xref>). To further rule out the possibility of wrongly identifying deletions due to differences between assemblies, exons were confirmed as missing by searching for homology between the Col-0 exon on all other accessions (see Materials and Methods).</p><p>A total of 794 exons were classified as missing in at least one of 17 accessions, corresponding to 411 genes (&#x0223c;1.5% of the total gene set) including 81 genes where the full coding region was completely absent in at least one accession (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary table S1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online).

To do so, we used four classification schemes: &#x0201c;GO,&#x0201d; a condensed set of GO terms (GOslim), the Pfam protein domain database and the family classification scheme of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B17">Gan et al. 2011</xref>) (see Materials and Methods). Of the 330 E-PAV genes, we found most to be poorly characterized with 50% of them having no associated GOslim term. The proportion of poorly characterized genes is greater among CDS-PAV genes, with more than 60% having no associated GOslim term for biological process. When examining genes with associated GOslim terms we found both E-PAV and CDS-PAV genes to be significantly enriched in genes associated with signal transduction and nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="mst166-F1">fig. 1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

Furthermore, E-PAV genes also appear significantly enriched in genes associated with the GOslim term &#x0201c;other binding,&#x0201d; which includes proteins that bind to lipids, metal ions, and ATP, among other cofactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="mst166-F1">fig. 1</xref>). Significant overrepresentation of functional categories among PAV genes is consistent with a previous assessment of large coding region indels in the soybean genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B27">McHale et al. 2012</xref>) and of whole gene deletions in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B41">Tan et al. 2012</xref>).

We considered nucleotide diversity at both replacement sites and silent sites (defined as noncoding sites and the synonymous sites of protein-coding regions) for each gene, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B17">Gan et al. (2011)</xref>. PAV genes were found to be associated with higher nucleotide diversity in both silent and replacement sites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online).</p><p>Although higher d<italic>N</italic>/d<italic>S</italic> and nucleotide diversity are suggestive of relaxed selective constraints, this pattern is also consistent with a scenario of positive and/or balancing selection. To differentiate between these possible scenarios, Tajima&#x02019;s <italic>D</italic> was calculated for each gene (see Materials and Methods). A threshold of &#x000b1;2 was considered as the point at which <italic>D</italic> significantly departs from the null expectation of neutral evolution for any given gene. Of the 330 E-PAV genes with E-PAV, 24 have <italic>D</italic> &#x0003c; &#x02212;2 and only 2 have <italic>D</italic> &#x0003e; 2 (AT1G12180, <italic>D</italic> = 2.17, and AT5G35460, <italic>D</italic> = 2.05, both of which are functionally uncharacterized). Among CDS-PAV genes, only seven have <italic>D</italic> &#x0003c; &#x02212;2 and none have <italic>D</italic> &#x0003e; 2. Compared with the set of intact genes, there are no significant differences in the proportion of PAV genes either with <italic>D</italic> &#x0003c; 2 (randomization test <italic>P</italic> = 1 for both E- and CDS-PAV genes) or <italic>D</italic> &#x0003e; 2 (randomization test <italic>P</italic> = 0.93 and <italic>P</italic> = 1 for E- and CDS-PAV genes, respectively). As demographic characteristics of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> population may result in a shift in the average Tajima&#x02019;s <italic>D</italic> among the general pool of genes, it is possible that these hard thresholds may not be informative. Indeed, we find that intact genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have the average Tajima&#x02019;s <italic>D</italic> estimate shifted toward negative values. Thus, PAV genes could fall short of the hard threshold of +2 and still have a higher <italic>D</italic> estimate than the general pool of genes, suggestive of balancing selection. However, E-PAV genes do not show significant differences in Tajima&#x02019;s <italic>D</italic> estimates compared with intact genes and CDS-PAV genes have; in fact, a significantly lower estimate of <italic>D</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="mst166-F2">fig. 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary tables S1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). It is possible that PAV genes may have a higher range of <italic>D</italic> values compared with intact genes, hiding a higher proportion of genes under positive and balancing selection that would not be reflected in overall changes in the mean. To test this, we compared the distributions of Tajima&#x02019;s <italic>D</italic> estimates in the three sets of genes (intact, E-PAV, and CDS-PAV). However, we did not observe any evidence for increased dispersion in <italic>D</italic> among PAV genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

To further examine this possibility, we examined the proportion of PAV genes below the fifth and above the 95th percentile of the &#x0201c;intact&#x0201d; distribution (<italic>D</italic> = &#x02212;2.05 and 1.39, respectively). If a significantly higher proportion of E-PAV or CDS-PAV genes are found compared with the intact set at the positive end of the distribution, we can infer the existence of a detectable subset of PAV genes that may be undergoing balancing selection. However, such a pattern is clearly not observed&#x02014;only 2.33% of E-PAV&#x02014;and no CDS-PAV genes exceed the threshold value. At the opposite end of the distribution, we observe no overrepresentation in the proportion of E-PAV genes whose estimates of <italic>D</italic> are lower than the threshold (3.32%) although we do observe this for CDS-PAV genes (8.82%). This finding would suggest that a significant proportion of CDS-PAV genes might be undergoing stronger purifying or positive selection relative to intact genes. Together, these results suggest that although we cannot rule out the effect of balancing selection acting on a few individual PAV genes a general trend of balancing selection for PAV genes does not readily apply. The excess of negative <italic>D</italic> values among PAV genes coupled with the higher levels of nucleotide diversity and the significant increases in d<italic>N</italic>/d<italic>S</italic> ratios are consistent with a scenario of weaker purifying selection but could also be explained by positive selection.</p><p>We examined a number of parameters that have been previously associated by some studies with gene essentiality to further explore the functional importance of PAV genes, including a gene&#x02019;s age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B11">Chen, Trachana, et al. 2012</xref>) and the number of paralogs it has (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B19">Hanada et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B25">Makino et al. 2009</xref>), along with weaker associations such as expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B12">Cherry 2010</xref>) and tissue specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B46">Wolf et al. 2006</xref>).</p><p>Compared with newer genes, older genes are more likely to be essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B11">Chen, Trachana, et al. 2012</xref>). After using the phylogenetic relationships of plant genomes to create a proxy for gene age, we observed that the 330 genes affected by E-PAV are more likely to be newer additions to the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="mst166-F2">fig. 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). It is also possible that E-PAV genes have a greater number of paralogous genes that might compensate for any loss of function. Consistent with this, we find that those genes with missing exons have higher number of paralogs compared with those genes with all exons present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="mst166-F2">fig. 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). However, the opposite result was observed when analyzing CDS-PAV genes&#x02014;these have an average of 4.2 paralogs when compared with genes with no exon losses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="mst166-F2">fig. 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online), suggesting their function is less essential. We then assessed the expression patterns of genes affected by exon presence&#x02013;absence, because broadly and highly expressed genes are typically associated with higher levels of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B51">Yang 2009</xref>). Using a randomization test, we found that genes with exon losses in one or more accessions, when compared with intact genes, had lower expression levels and higher tissue specificity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). In addition, we also observed that exons missing in at least one accession are, on average, shorter than exons present in all accessions (170 bp vs. 284 bp, randomization test <italic>P</italic> = 9.9e<sup>&#x02212;</sup><sup>5</sup>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). However, although exons affected by polymorphic deletions are shorter on average compared with nondeleted exons, E-PAV genes are longer than unaffected genes (2,360 bp compared with 2,142 bp, respectively; randomization test <italic>P</italic> = 0.008; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). By contrast, CDS-PAV genes&#x02014;where polymorphic deletions encompass the gene&#x02019;s entire coding region&#x02014;were found to be shorter than unaffected genes (640 bp compared with 2,142 bp, randomization test <italic>P</italic> = 9.9e<sup>&#x02212;</sup><sup>5</sup>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary table S3</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online).</p><p>Overall, these findings show that although certain functional categories are overrepresented among genes with exon loss, more generally significant coding region loss is prevalent among novel, lowly expressed and poorly functionally characterized genes.

To explore whether genes affected by PAV have a local enrichment for such hotspot motifs, we examined the density of these motifs both in and around genes (see Materials and Methods). However, we observed no significant differences in hotspot motif occupancy in the nongenic regions of windows surrounding E-PAV genes compared with intact genes (in window sizes of 1 to 100 kb centered on the gene&#x02019;s midpoint; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary table S4</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online).

To assess whether exon loss is likely to have resulted in reduced functionality for the genes affected, we compared expression levels for genes with and without missing exons across accessions. If exon loss causes or follows from diminished functionality by previous mutations, we would expect expression to be significantly reduced in those accessions affected by E-PAV. Using RNAseq transcription profiles for each <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B17">Gan et al. 2011</xref>), we compared the expression patterns of individual genes in accessions affected by exon deletions with those accessions where the gene remained intact. To do this, we transformed expression data per accession to <italic>Z</italic> scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B8">Cheadle et al. 2003</xref>). We then looked only at those genes where exon loss had occurred in a single accession (210 genes). For each gene, we took 1) the expression level of that gene in the affected accession and 2) the mean expression level of that gene across the 17 unaffected accessions (the other 16 under study plus the reference genome, Col-0). We found that half of the genes examined had an expression level below this mean and 37% an expression level equal to it. However, on average, expression levels in the affected accession departed little from mean expression in unaffected accessions (0.15 standard deviations). In 27 genes (13% of cases), expression level in a gene affected by an exon deletion was higher than the mean expression across unaffected accessions with 14 cases showing a statistically significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="mst166-F4">fig. 4</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary table S6</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). These 27 genes are generally poorly characterized with 12 having no functional category annotations. Most genes affected by exon deletions had low expression levels to begin with, although some exceptions are notable, such as rotamase CYP4 (AT3G62030; involved in a variety of cellular functions related to metabolism and response to several types of stress), which has an average expression level in the unaffected accessions of 400 rpkm, among the top 1% of genes with detectable expression in Col-0.

We found a significant enrichment of genes associated with the GO terms for protein and nucleotide binding as well as signal transduction. Both gene family and Pfam annotation enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichments of gene members from the disease resistance associated NBS-LRR gene families. Significant deviations from random expectations have been observed in previous studies of PAV genes in plants, with similar overrepresentation of resistance-associated gene families among PAV genes. For instance, in sorghum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B53">Zheng et al. 2011</xref>), PAV genes are enriched in nine Pfam categories, including the NB-ARC domain-containing family. In soybean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B27">McHale et al. 2012</xref>), PAV-affected genes have also been found to be enriched for members of the NB-ARC family, and within the GO category of &#x0201c;defense response.&#x0201d; CDS-PAV genes have also been shown to deviate from random expectations in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B41">Tan et al. 2012</xref>), with the greatest significant enrichment in PAV genes also reported for those with NB-ARC domains.</p><p>These functional and/or gene family enrichments can be suggestive of an adaptive role for PAV events by aiding specific ecotypes in adapting to their local environment. Our results&#x02014;showing that genes associated with, for example, resistance are more likely to be affected by PAV&#x02014;are, at first glance, consistent with this hypothesis. In addition, we were able to confirm a previous report of CDS-PAV for three members of the <italic>R</italic> gene family&#x02014;the single-exon gene AT5G05400 and the multiexon genes AT5G18350 and AT5G49140 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B37">Shen et al. 2006</xref>)&#x02014;a family known to have signatures of positive selection in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B30">Mondragon-Palomino et al. 2002</xref>).

Although there are, on average, a higher number of substitutions in E-PAV genes compared with intact genes, this is not a clear signature of adaptation and can suggest comparatively relaxed negative, rather than stronger positive, selection.</p><p>We further found that PAV genes have significantly higher nucleotide diversity both at silent and replacement sites. Both observations are suggestive of weaker purifying selection; however, they can also be expected if PAV genes were under higher balancing selection. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that the diversity of resistance-associated genes is maintained by balancing selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B42">Van der Hoorn et al. 2002</xref>), which are overrepresented among PAV genes. Balancing selection has been proposed to stably maintain both the intact gene and the absent allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B41">Tan et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p>So, is balancing selection the most parsimonious explanation for why PAV genes are associated with higher nucleotide diversity? A classic scenario of transspecies polymorphism, associated with balancing selection, cannot be assessed given the limited sequence variation data available for <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, <italic>A. thaliana</italic>&#x02019;s closest sequenced relative. It is possible that the &#x0201c;gene/exon present&#x0201d; and the &#x0201c;gene/exon absent&#x0201d; alleles are under selection to be maintained in different <italic>A. thaliana</italic> populations, allowing them to better adapt to their local environment. This would be consistent with the increase in nucleotide diversity, but this scenario cannot be distinguished from alternative neutral models. Conditional neutrality at PAV loci, where the functional gene has ceased to be adaptive in some but not all environments, cannot be ruled out (e.g., in the case of resistance genes where the corresponding pathogen is absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B18">Gos and Wright 2008</xref>]). In this case, the absent allele would have no selective advantage at any point but rather result from relaxed constraints associated with PAV genes in some <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> populations. Moreover, a model of generalized relaxed constraints affecting the PAV loci would also lead to increased nucleotide diversity and slight increases in d<italic>N</italic>/d<italic>S</italic>.</p><p>Tajima&#x02019;s <italic>D</italic>, a comparison of two estimators of <italic>&#x003b8;</italic> (the population mutation rate 4<italic>Ne</italic>&#x003bc;)&#x02014;the number of segregating sites and the average number of pairwise differences between sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B40">Tajima 1989</xref>)&#x02014;offers a more reliable estimate of selective pressures acting on a gene as it incorporates information about the distribution of segregating alleles in a species. This allows more accurate estimations of the degree and direction of departure of sequence evolution from a neutral expectation (although nonselectionist interpretations of <italic>D</italic> are also possible, such as recent population expansion or bottlenecking for negative and positive <italic>D</italic>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B40">Tajima 1989</xref>). Tajima&#x02019;s <italic>D</italic> values do not provide evidence for either E-PAV or CDS-PAV genes to be under balancing selection. Taking d<italic>N</italic>/d<italic>S</italic>, nucleotide diversity, and <italic>D</italic> estimates together, most PAV genes appear to be evolving under relaxed constraints.</p><p>A signature of relaxed selection associated with PAV genes is combined with a variety of features that have been associated with lower gene essentiality. We found that PAV genes have lower expression levels and higher tissue specificity; both of these features have been associated with higher rates of substitutions and reduced gene essentiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B46">Wolf et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B12">Cherry 2010</xref>). Older genes have been considered more essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B11">Chen, Trachana et al. 2012</xref>) and have been associated (in humans, flies and <italic>Aspergillus</italic>) with a higher expression level and stronger purifying selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B47">Wolf et al. 2009</xref>). We found that PAV genes are, on average, newer additions to the genome and that most exons affected by PAV do not have an orthologous exon in <italic>A. lyrata</italic> (663/794). We note that both E-PAV and CDS-PAV genes are enriched in reverse transcriptase domains (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary figs.

This is possibly explained in some cases by alternative splicing, which has already been associated with an increased frequency of exon loss in humans, mice, and rats&#x02014;alternatively spliced forms are less likely to be conserved between species than constitutive exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B29">Modrek and Lee 2003</xref>). In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, we found that genes with E-PAV are under weaker purifying selection and have a greater number of alternative splice events compared with intact genes. This observation suggests that alternatively spliced exons are likely to be under reduced selective constraints compared with constitutive exons, and thus whole exon deletions would have less of a detrimental effect than the loss of a constitutive exon. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that exon loss events have been associated with elevated alternative splicing levels within a species rather than between species.</p><p>The genomic context of genes has also been linked to both patterns of sequence evolution and features associated with gene essentiality. A recent study in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> has correlated the presence of TEs adjacent to genes with sequence variation within that gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B43">Wang, Weigel, et al. 2013</xref>), suggesting TEs tend to accumulate near genes under lower selective pressures located in regions with less efficient purging of TE sequence. Indeed, for our set of E-PAV genes, we find a higher density of TEs in the vicinity. In addition, we also find that genes undergoing PAV have an increased proportion of motifs associated with recombination hotspots within their sequence. Both findings are consistent with PAV events being associated with genes located in genomic regions evolving under reduced selective constraints. Moreover, higher TE content and hotspot motifs are consistent with the suggestion that unequal recombination between homologs may be a major mechanism for generating P/A polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B41">Tan et al. 2012</xref>). However, it should be noted that no recombinogenic motif is both necessary and sufficient for a recombination event to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B22">Johnston and Cutler 2012</xref>), and as such, their connection, if any, to PAV remains speculative.</p><p>All of these features considered together suggest that although some individual deletions might have an adaptive value, overall coding region loss disproportionally affects genes under reduced selective pressures. So how are these results reconciled with the enrichment of certain gene families and GO functional terms? The enrichment of specific functional categories and gene families among PAV genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="mst166-F1">fig. 1</xref>) leads to the implication of adaptive pressures favoring PAV on genes related to specific biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B41">Tan et al. 2012</xref>). However, as we have shown, PAV genes are associated with a variety of features suggestive of lower selective constraints. We argue that the enrichment of certain GO categories and/or gene families among genes associated with a particular genomic feature does not, by itself, allow us to draw conclusions about any adaptive processes these genes may be undergoing. Consistent with this, we find that intact genes associated with the gene categories in which PAV genes are enriched also show the same signatures of reduced selection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary table S7</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). This is notable for those sets of genes involved in, for example, signal transduction, nucleic acid binding, and the NBS-LRR family&#x02014;categories enriched among PAV genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="mst166-F1">fig. 1</xref>). For instance, if we compare the set of E-PAV genes to the set of genes with all exons present and the set of NBS-LRR genes to the set of genes belonging to other families, we find that both E-PAV and NBS-LRR genes are comparatively newer additions to the genome, have a higher d<italic>N</italic>/d<italic>S</italic> ratio, a higher number of alternative splicing events, a higher number of paralogs, a higher proportion of SNPs, and are found closer to TEs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary table S7</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). We note that the proportion of polymorphic sites is higher not only in PAV genes but in genes of that functional category. To demonstrate that PAV genes do not bias the comparison of, for example, the set of NBS-LRR genes to the set of genes belonging to other families, we repeat the analysis restricted to intact genes only and observe the same result (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">supplementary table S7</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/molbev/mst166/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online).</p><p>The fact that we observed fewer PAV genes than a previous study examining 80 fully sequenced <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genomes (<italic>n</italic> = 2,741; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B41">Tan et al. 2012</xref>) is likely due to differences in methodology. First, our analysis uses 17 genomes assembled using a combination of read-to-reference genome (Col-0) alignment and de novo approaches, and&#x02014;importantly&#x02014;for which transcriptome data were available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B17">Gan et al. 2011</xref>), rather than the 80 accessions reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B7">Cao et al. (2011)</xref>. Second, we use a more conservative methodology for defining significant deletions while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B41">Tan et al. (2012)</xref> define PAV genes using what is referred to as the &#x0201c;broad definition&#x0201d;: &#x0201c;one being found at a particular locus only in some genomes compared to the others.&#x0201d; This allows a gene to be called as a PAV gene even if a copy exists at a different locus. To minimize the inclusion of rearrangement events as deletions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B41">Tan et al. (2012)</xref> examined their predicted PAV genes using BlastN against a reference accession, excluding from the &#x0201c;absent&#x0201d; category any gene with a counterpart that matches &#x0003e;50% of its length. Our definition of PAV is more restrictive as we only deemed an exon or gene to be deleted if genome alignments showed that the deletion spanned at least a whole exon or whole gene with not a single identifiable base remaining. Finally, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B41">Tan et al. (2012)</xref> study used genomes assembled according to the TAIR8 annotated positions, whereas our data are assembled according to TAIR10. There is a small risk, therefore, of having incorporated now-obsolete gene models into their findings. Regardless of the methodological differences and the resulting variation in sample size, it is worth noting that our results are not in contradiction to those of previous studies examining PAV both in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and other species, as we find similar deviations from random expectations in the functional annotations of genes. Our analysis of sequence evolution and other genic features of PAV genes do not rule out the possibilities of conditional neutrality at PAV loci or that balancing selection may be acting on PAV genes, allowing adaptation to the environmental conditions of specific ecotypes. Instead, the findings presented show that PAV events can be explained by a nonadaptive interpretation where genes under reduced constraints are more susceptible to the spread of allele variants containing significant deletions.</p><p>In summary, our results suggest that although significant enrichment in functional categories among PAV genes was observed, most exon loss events are observed in newer, poorly functionally characterized genes associated with signatures linked to less essential genes evolving under lower purifying or balancing selection. This may reduce the potential functional relevance of structural variations within these genes. We conclude that although an adaptive model for PAV cannot be ruled out, the observed functional enrichments among PAV genes and increased nucleotide diversity can also be interpreted without invoking selection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Genome Sequence and Annotations</title><p>Exon coordinates for <italic>A. thaliana</italic> strain Col-0 were obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) (<ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Ontologies/Gene_Ontology/ATH_GO_GOSLIM.txt">ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Genes/TAIR10_genome_release/TAIR10_gff3/TAIR10_GFF3_genes.gff</ext-link>, dated 20 March 2012 [last accessed October 8, 2013]).

Those ESTs aligning to regions with no annotated gene were excluded from the analysis. EST alignments were then used to create an exon template. Alternative splicing events per gene were identified by comparing alignment coordinates for each individual EST to exon annotations. As a low EST coverage can increase the number of falsely positive claims that an exon is constitutive, rather than spliced, we excluded genes with 10 or fewer ESTs. ESTs were assigned to genes using gene annotation coordinates. A comparable alternative splicing index that avoids transcript coverage biases was obtained using the transcript normalization method described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mst166-B23">Kim et al.
