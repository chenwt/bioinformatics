To better understand its behavior in this environmental niche, RNA was extracted from the anterior nares of three documented <italic>S. aureus</italic> carriers and the metatranscriptome analyzed by RNAseq. In addition, the <italic>in vivo</italic> transcriptomes were compared to previously published transcriptomes of two <italic>in vitro</italic> grown <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains. None of the <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions, even growth in medium resembling the anterior nares environment, mimicked <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. Survival in the nose was strongly controlled by the limitation of iron and evident by the expression of iron acquisition systems. <italic>S. aureus</italic> populations in different individuals clearly experience different environmental stresses, which they attempt to overcome by the expression of compatible solute biosynthetic pathways, changes in their cell wall composition and synthesis of general stress proteins. Moreover, the expression of adhesins was also important for colonization of the anterior nares. However, different <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains also showed different <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior. The assessment of general <italic>in vivo</italic> expression patterns and commonalities between different <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains will in the future result in new knowledge based strategies for controlling colonization.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is recognized as a major human pathogen, but also described as a human commensal. The human nose is its major reservoir and ecological niche where approximately 20&#x02013;30% of humans are reported to be permanent carriers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Even though carriage is usually asymptomatic, nasal carriage has a crucial function as a source of invasive infections in both community and hospital settings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. In recent decades, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) has increased markedly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and vancomycin resistant clones have also been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The reasons for the rapid emergence of MRSA are still unclear and the spread cannot be explained solely be the antibiotic selection pressure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In how far the natural ecological niche constitutes a selective advantage for MRSA remains to be elucidated. <italic>S. aureus</italic> carriage is influenced by host and environmental factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and also by interactions with other community members within the anterior nares<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Thus, it is assumed that a better understanding of the ecology of this niche may support strategies for limiting the carriage of <italic>S. aureus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p><italic>S. aureus</italic> clearly belongs to the most studied bacterial species and its behavior under different <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions has been analyzed in great detail, where virulence factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, global regulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, stress response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, nutrient acquisition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, immune evasion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and attachment mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, among others have been described. However, with the emergence of high throughput sequencing methods, the interest to understand the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation and the interactions between the host and the inhabiting bacterial communities has increased significantly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and recent studies using deep sequencing transcriptomic analysis (RNAseq) indicate the behavior of <italic>S. aureus in vivo</italic> to be significantly different from that observed by the classical <italic>in vitro</italic> approach<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>Efforts to understand the survival and persistence of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in its ecological niche on the one hand aimed to understand the metabolic challenges. The analysis of nasal secretions resulted in the development of a synthetic nasal medium, which should mimic the nasal environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Thereby, iron limiting conditions as well as the absence of distinct amino acids were identified as shaping the transcriptional response. However, even though the use of such a medium may offer important insights into the global reaction of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to its natural conditions, it evidently cannot simulate the host environment and simulate e.g. adhesion processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Moreover the anterior nares are a complex ecosystem, which is characterized not only by the interaction of <italic>S. aureus</italic> with the host, but by the presence of a complex microbial community<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> which may compete for nasal nutrients and interact with <italic>S. aureus.</italic> All these interactions cannot be easily mimicked <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>In the current report, we analyzed the genome-wide transcriptional activity of <italic>S. aureus in vivo</italic> in the anterior nares of 3 volunteers at two different time points by RNAseq and compared the transcriptome profiles to those previously obtained by two distinct <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The results of our study provide the first high-resolution analysis of the transcriptional response of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to its natural environment and will allow an understanding of how <italic>S. aureus</italic> persists in such a hostile environment niche.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>The bacterial community of three <italic>S. aureus</italic> carriers</title><p>To gain insights into the behavior of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in its natural ecological niche, three healthy volunteers persistently colonized by <italic>S. aureus</italic> were selected. Volunteer 1 was colonized by a novel strain (novel spa type with repeat succession 15-21-12, <italic>S. aureus</italic> D1), volunteer 2 by a strain typed as spa type t0254 (<italic>S. aureus</italic> O1) and volunteer 3 by a strain typed as spa type t12 (<italic>S. aureus</italic> R1). Spa type t12 is reported to be one of the most abundant types colonizing healthy individuals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, specifically in young adults as is the case here. Multilocus sequence typing identified <italic>S. aureus</italic> D1 and R1 to belong to sequence type ST30 and <italic>S. aureus</italic> O1 to belong to sequence type ST15.</p><p>The bacterial communities of the anterior nares of these carriers were sampled during both winter (W) and summer (S) and the composition of the active bacterial community analyzed by deep sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons following reverse transcription&#x02013;polymerase chain reaction (RT&#x02013;PCR) of total RNA extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, right). Analysis revealed a high abundance of <italic>S. aureus</italic> sequence reads in 5 of the 6 samples, and only in volunteer 1 it comprised &#x0003c;1% of sequence reads during summer (Volunteer 1S). A specifically high amount of sequence reads originating from <italic>S. aureus</italic> was observed in volunteer 3 (38&#x02013;44%) indicating this organism to be specifically active in this person.</p><p>Overall, all three volunteers showed the presence of a bacterial community composed of core nasal colonizers such as <italic>Corynebacterium accolens/tuberculostearicum</italic> (19&#x02013;42% relative abundance), <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis/capitis/caprae</italic> (6&#x02013;23%), <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic> (2&#x02013;15%) or <italic>Peptoniphilus</italic> sp. (3&#x02013;9%) among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> right and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset S1</xref>). While the composition of the bacterial communities of volunteer 2 and 3 were very similar during both sampling times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> right), evident differences were observed for volunteer 1, where the winter sampling showed a mild colonization by <italic>S. aureus</italic> (9%), whereas the summer community was dominated by <italic>Dolosigranulum pigrum</italic> and <italic>Corynebacterium propinquum/ pseudodiphtheriticum.</italic></p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Metatranscriptomic analysis of nasal microbial communities</title><p>The same six <italic>in vivo</italic> samples described above were subject to a metatranscriptomic analysis by RNAseq. After quality filtering, 9&#x02013;106 million sequence reads per sample were obtained (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Between 15 and 96% of those reads could be assigned to human RNA and were removed. After removal of 16S rRNA reads between 2 and 8 million of sequence reads remained as potential bacterial mRNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>A crucial step for evaluating the activity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in its natural niche is the capability to separate sequence reads originating from <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>. Using a database of 25&#x02009;<italic>S. aureus</italic> and 2&#x02009;<italic>S. epidermidis</italic> genomes to assign reads to these species, between 12,000 and 120,000 reads showed a high similarity of (alignment length) * (% identity/ query length) &#x02265;80% with <italic>S. aureus</italic> genomic sequences. However, of those reads between 35 and 95% could also be assigned to <italic>S. epidermidis,</italic> showing the similarity between the two species and the high level of possible mis-assignment. In contrast, using a similarity ratio &#x02265;90%, the percentage of reads that could not be clearly assigned to one of those species decreased substantially to 9&#x02013;34%. Only in case of sample 1S, 90% of the reads remained of unclear assignment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). This corresponds to the high relative abundance of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> compared to that of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in this specific sample, as indicated by amplicon sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> right). Thus, assignment of reads to <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> was performed using a similarity ratio &#x02265;90% as cut-off, whereas assignment to bacterial genera was performed with a &#x02265;80% similarity ratio as cut-off (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>In total, between 18,000 and 310,000 reads could be assigned to the different bacterial genera and species, which is only a subset of the metatranscriptomic reads remaining after depletion of human and ribsosomal reads (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). The remaining unassigned mRNA reads illustrate the complexity of the anterior nare niche, and may represent transcripts pertaining to other community species such as eukaryotic species like fungi and protozoa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, although identifying these taxa was beyond the scope of this work. However, previous experiences also have shown an association between the sample quality and the number of RNAseq mapped reads obtained from it, <italic>i.e.</italic> samples with lower quality, and therefore more degraded RNA molecules, as present in <italic>in vivo</italic> samples yield both lower numbers of reads that can be assigned and reads mapped to genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and may explain why only a subset of metatranscriptomic reads could in fact be assigned here.</p><p>Comparison of the composition across the six nasal microbial communities under study as deduced by amplicon sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> right) versus the composition as indicated by the relative amounts of transcripts assigned to the different species and genera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> left) indicated similar structures. This in turn indicates that representative amounts of metatranscriptomic reads were sampled in each case.</p><p>Potential <italic>S. aureus</italic> reads were then mapped against a database of orthologous groups of proteins previously built on the basis of 25 reference genomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and 73&#x02013;80% of the reads could be successfully mapped to the <italic>S. aureus</italic> gene catalogue (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The remaining reads matched intergenic regions that mainly reflect the sites of transcription initiation and different RNA species. Analysis of the sequence reads that could be mapped to <italic>S. aureus</italic> versus those that could be mapped to both <italic>S. aureus</italic> or <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> considering a &#x02265;90% similarity ratio showed, that for some genes all reads fall into the last category, indicating the presence of highly conserved gene regions, preventing a clear assignment (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset S2</xref>). As sample 1S mainly contains <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> sequence reads, which could not clearly be assigned, it was excluded from further detailed analysis keeping the samples in which <italic>S. aureus</italic> was shown to be active and abundant.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Functional categorization of transcripts expressed by <italic>S. aureus</italic> under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions</title><p>Due to the difference in sequencing depth between the samples, random resampling was performed and the expression patterns analyzed on the basis of 5,000 sequence reads each (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). These <italic>in vivo</italic> expression patterns were compared to those previously reported for <italic>S. aureus</italic> USA300 LAC and <italic>S. aureus</italic> IPL32 grown <italic>in vitro</italic> in rich medium (BHI) and a synthetic nasal medium (SNM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> which mimics the nasal conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Cluster analysis was used to determine the similarity between the global transcriptional profiles of <italic>S. aureus</italic> under the different conditions. The dendrogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) shows that all 5 <italic>in vivo</italic> transcriptomes differed substantially from those of USA300 LAC and <italic>S. aureus</italic> IPL32 under <italic>in vitro</italic> growth conditions, that is, these two groups of samples were &#x0003c;50% similar, and those of both strains grown in synthetic nasal medium (SNM) were not more similar to the <italic>in vivo</italic> trancriptomes then those obtained in rich medium.</p><p>It is important to note that the <italic>in vitro</italic> RNAseq libraries had been amplified using Ambion&#x02019;s MessageAmp kit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, while the <italic>in vivo</italic> libraries in this work were generated using the Epicentre&#x02019;s ScriptSeq Kit, but where isolation of RNA and sequencing were performed in the exact same manner. A comparison between these two methods on <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells grown to mid-log phase revealed only an additional 10% difference in the global expression profile compared to replicates (taking into account standardized read count across 2,582&#x02009;<italic>S. aureus</italic> genes), where the rank-order of gene expression was mostly retained (Spearman rank correlation of 0.911) (data not shown).</p><p>Immense differences were obvious between the 5 <italic>in vivo</italic> transcriptomes sharing only &#x0003e;55% of similarity. Differences were observed not only between <italic>S. aureus</italic> transcriptomes from different individuals but also between transcriptomes obtained from the same volunteer at different timepoints, and thus from the same <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain. This reveals that differences in the transcriptomic profiles are not only due to the colonizing strain, but also to the environment provided by the host.</p><p>Gene expression analysis based on the relative abundances of gene transcripts assigned to their respective Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) showed no evident difference between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>), and mainly differences in the general distribution per categories between growth media were obvious, as previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. However, differences were also visible in the relative transcript abundances of genes involved in inorganic ion transport and metabolism (category P) and secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism (category Q), where levels during growth in complex medium were lower compared to those during growth in either SNM or <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>To obtain a better view on differences in transcriptomes, genes that were expressed to levels exceeding a normalized value of 1000&#x02009;rpm after resampling were considered in more detail (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset S2</xref>). Of the genes that were expressed in at least one <italic>in vivo</italic> sample at a level exceeding 1000&#x02009;rpm, 240 genes were indicated to be expressed differently under <italic>in vivo</italic> versus <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions (see Materials and Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Expression of genes encoding surface bound proteins</title><p>The adherence to components of the human extracellular matrix is a key step for the persistence of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the nasal habitat and a total of 35 adhesins have been examined in detail<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Of these, the staphylococcal cell-wall protein clumping factor B (ClfB, USA300HOU_2630) which promotes adhesion to squamous epithelial cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> was indicated as important for nasal colonization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In fact, read counts indicating transcription of the encoding gene <italic>in vivo</italic> varied from 910&#x02013;4660 reads per million of total sequence reads (rpm), whereas those from cells grown in SNM (<italic>in vitro</italic>) were only 330&#x02013;550&#x02009;rpm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>).

This indicated the importance of SdrCDE (USA300HOU_0555-0557) as attachment factors for nasal colonization. Furthermore, the <italic>sas</italic>F gene (USA300HOU_2646) was expressed to a much higher extend <italic>in vivo</italic> compared to <italic>in vitro</italic> (340&#x02013;1330&#x02009;rpm versus 14&#x02013;120&#x02009;rpm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> surface proteins can interact with different compounds in the extracellular matrix, and also the elastin-binding protein (<italic>ebp</italic>S, USA300HOU_1419) was expressed to a higher extent <italic>in vivo</italic> compared to its <italic>in vitro</italic> expression (350&#x02013;1690&#x02009;rpm <italic>in vivo</italic> versus 210&#x02013;250&#x02009;rpm after growth in SNM), whereas the <italic>cna</italic> gene (SAA6008_02751) encoding collagen adhesin was expressed only in two of the three volunteers (samples of volunteer 1 winter, 1W; and of volunteer 3 in summer and winter, 3S and 3W).

As mentioned above, the majority of transcripts obtained from sample 1S could not clearly be assigned to <italic>S. aureus</italic> or <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, however, of the 583 reads that were mapped exclusively to <italic>S. aureus,</italic> &#x0003e;50% were due to transcription of <italic>sas</italic>G. Taken collectively, these levels of expression indicate that <italic>S. aureus</italic> uses a whole battery of adhesins to colonize the anterior nares, with the precise nature of the expression of adhesins being seemingly dependent on the colonizing strain and/or the human host.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis</title><p>Much of the success of <italic>S. aureus</italic> as a major colonizer across the human body has been attributed to its capacity to retrieve iron from the host<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and iron limiting conditions as evidenced by the high expression of iron-regulated genes have recently been observed in culture media mimicking the conditions in the anterior nares<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> or human plasma among others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.

These databases comprised the complete genomes from 1) the 25&#x02009;<italic>S. aureus</italic> strains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, 2) <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> strains ATCC12228 and RP62A, 3) <italic>F. magna</italic> (ATCC29328), 4) <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic> RH4, 5) <italic>P. acnes</italic> SK137, 6) <italic>D. pigrum</italic> ATCC51524, 7) <italic>Corynebacterium accolens</italic> ATCC49725 and <italic>Corynebacterium variabile</italic> DSM44702 and 8) <italic>Peptoniphilus duerdenii</italic> (ATCCBAA164). The metatranscriptomic datasets devoid of human and ribsosomal reads were individually analyzed using this set of blast databases. Reads were assigned to a genus, if the ratio (alignment length * % identity)/ query length) exceeds 80%. As a reasonable number of reads could not clearly be assigned to either <italic>S. aureus</italic> or <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, a ratio (alignment length * % identity)/ query length) &#x0003e;90% was used to assign reads to these species (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Presumptive <italic>S. aureus</italic> reads were mapped against a previously described <italic>S. aureus</italic> OG/Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> using rpstblastn. An alignment ratio of &#x02265;60% (alignment length * % identity/ query length) was used for the positive assignment of sequences to the orthologous groups. Reads that mapped to <italic>S. aureus</italic> were further blasted (blastn) against two genomes of <italic>S. epidermidis (S. epidermidis</italic> strains ATCC12228 and RP62A). Reads that showed an alignment ratio &#x02265;90% were aggregated and assigned as reads that could originate from either S. aureus or S. epidermidis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Dataset S2</xref>).</p><p>As the number of <italic>S. aureus</italic> sequence reads varied between libraries (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>) and then to compare with recently published <italic>in vitro</italic> data that comprised orders of magnitude more sequence reads<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, mapped read counts were re-randomized to the smallest library size of 5000 reads using an in-house Perl script<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Finally all read count data were normalized to reads per million (rpm).</p><p>Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) were assigned to the probable <italic>S. aureus</italic> reads by querying the COG profiles deposited in the Conserve Domain Database (CDD) database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref> (downloaded from the NCBI ftp site/ little endian) using rpsblast (version 2.2.25). The results were parsed using an in-house Perl script.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data analysis and interpretation</title><p>In order to compare the different <italic>in vivo S. aureus</italic> transcriptomic libraries with each other and then also with other published datasets (i.e. the <italic>in vitro</italic> libraries from Chaves-Moreno <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), a sample-similarity matrix was generated using the Bray&#x02013;Curtis coefficient<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref> and gene-expression profiles compared using group-average agglomerative hierarchical clustering using PRIMER (v.6.1.6, PRIMER-E, Plymouth Marine Laboratory, Plymouth, UK)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>.</p><p>Previous analysis of <italic>S. aureus</italic> 6850<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> SH1000 global transcriptomic profiles using the ScriptSeq&#x02122; v2 RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit (as performed here), showed similarities of 80&#x02013;85% between replicates. Then, a direct comparison between the global transcriptomic profiles obtained from <italic>S. aureus</italic> SH1000 cells grown to mid-log phase in BHI using the MessageAmp&#x02122; II-Bacteria RNA amplification kit (Ambion) with a T7 primer modified to include a BpmI restriction site for removal of poly-A tails prior to sequencing as described by Chaves-Moreno <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> or the ScriptSeq&#x02122; v2 RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit (Epicentre) (like the <italic>in vivo</italic> samples of this work) revealed global expression profiles of 75% similarity (using the Bray-Curtis algorithm) with a Spearman rank correlation of 0.911 (based on the read counts of the 2,582&#x02009;<italic>S. aureus</italic> genes). So we can deduce that the choice of RNAseq library preparation method may contribute to an additional 10% difference in the global expression profile while retaining the rank-order of gene expression.</p><p>As the <italic>in vivo</italic> transcriptomes were very different and cannot be regarded as replicates, a detailed comparison with previous <italic>in vitro</italic> data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> was based on those genes that were expressed in at least one <italic>in vivo</italic> sample at a level exceeding 1000&#x02009;rpm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).
