A native of South America, this ant has spread rapidly throughout the southeastern U.S. and the Caribbean, and become an acute pest that produces exceedingly large populations that are difficult to control (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Deyrup et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">MacGown and Layton, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Meyers, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Wetterer and Keularts, 2008</xref>).

Control efforts are currently limited to chemical insecticides. However, sustainable control of this ant pest will likely require the use of natural enemies. Unfortunately, the only known pathogen of tawny crazy ant is <italic>Myrmecomorba nylanderiae</italic>, a microsporidium that has been identified in the U.S. population (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Plowes et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In 2012, we employed a metatranscriptomics&#x02014;next generation sequencing approach to facilitate discovery of potential viral natural enemies of tawny crazy ant (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Valles et al., 2012a</xref>). From this work, three short sequence fragments were identified that exhibited strong identity with positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. Completing this investigation here, we used these previously identified sequences as templates to obtain the genome sequence of a new virus, <italic>Nylanderia fulva virus 1</italic> (NfV-1).

Two other contiguous sequences identified from the earlier study (i.e., 13287.C1 and 8702.C1) were also found to be part of the NfV-1 genome and not from unique viruses. The NfV-1 genome was found to be 10,881 nucleotides in length, excluding the poly(A) tail present on the 3&#x02032; end (<bold>Genbank accession KX024775</bold>). The NfV-1 genome sequence contained 58% adenine/uracil, and 42% guanine/cytosine. The genome contains a single large open reading frame (ORF) (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(A)). The ORF commences at the first canonical (AUG) start codon, present at nucleotide position 7, ends at a UGA stop codon at nucleotide 10,849, and encodes a predicted polyprotein of 407,455&#x000a0;Da (3614 amino acids). No large ORFs were found in the reverse orientation. The 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTRs comprise 6 and 33 nucleotides, respectively. No genome amplification occurred without reverse transcription, consistent with NfV-1 being an RNA virus. The most significant matches from blastp analysis (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>) of the polyprotein were to Solenopsis invicta virus 3 (SINV-3) and Kelp fly virus (KFV) with corresponding identities of 26% (65% coverage) and 34% (37% coverage), respectively, while more distant matches clustered in the picornavirus-like &#x0201c;superorder.&#x0201d; Analysis with blastp and HHpred (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000f6;ding et al., 2005</xref>) identified helicase (Hel), protease (Pro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains in the N-terminal two thirds of the polyprotein (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(A)). These domains contained characteristic motifs for a superfamily III helicase, 3C-like chymotrypsin-related cysteine protease, and a superfamily I RdRp, respectively (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Koonin and Dolja, 1993</xref>), indicating that NfV-1 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus in the picornavirus-like superorder (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Koonin et al., 2008</xref>). Given the picornavirales/calicivirus-like Hel-Pro-RdRp arrangement, it is likely that NfV-1 also encodes a VPg (viral protein of the genome) between Hel and Pro. Inspection of NfV-1, SINV-3, KFV and two related sequences (GBSB01003728, LA857567; see below), revealed a short region immediately upstream of Pro, containing many Lys/Arg and Asp/Glu residues, reminiscent of calicivirus VPg proteins (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Goodfellow, 2011</xref>). In SINV-3 and LA857567, this region contained near identical repeats, two copies of QRKGEKKIKK[V/I]TNYDSDGVQP in SINV-3 and two copies of GDRK[K/T]K[TNF/QKY]VDSDGVQPQ in LA857567 (suggestive of a repeated binding and/or linkage site) while all five sequences contained one or more copies of a [E/D]S[E/D] motif. We suggest that this region may correspond to VPg (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(A) and (B)).</p><p>Application of HHpred to the NfV-1 polyprotein sequence also revealed an Ovarian Tumor (OTU) domain upstream of Hel, and a dsRNA-binding protein (dsRBP; &#x0201c;*&#x0201d; in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(A)) domain and a jelly-roll (JR) capsid protein domain both downstream of RdRp (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(A)). Thus, NfV-1 has a genome organization similar to SINV-3 except that SINV-3 appears to lack the OTU domain, and has a ribosomal frameshift site downstream of the JR domain whereas in NfV-1 there is no frameshift (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(B)). Potential 3C-like protease cleavage sites were predicted based on the location of predicted protein domains, alignment between NfV-1, SINV-3, KFV and two related sequences (GBSB01003728, LA857567; see below), and sequence homology between different sites within a species (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(A)&#x02013;(C)); it should be stressed that some predictions, particularly those that deviate from a &#x0201c;consensus&#x0201d; sequence, were uncertain.</p><p>In SINV-3, the capsid proteins VP1 (comprising the JR domain), VP1-FSD (VP1 with a &#x0201c;Frame Shift Domain&#x0201d; appended, via ribosomal frameshifting) and VP2 (encoded downstream of FSD) can be expressed from the genomic RNA (gRNA); however, a subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) is also produced during virus infection from which only the dsRBP and capsid proteins can be expressed (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(B)) (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Valles et al., 2014a</xref>). VP1 has been hypothesized to form the virion shell, with FSD (present at sub-stoichiometric levels) forming projections; VP2 is also associated with the virion at sub-stoichiometric levels while dsRBP has been hypothesized to be a viral suppressor of RNA interference (RNAi) (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Valles et al., 2014a</xref>). A similar genome organization is also presented by Acyrthosiphon pisum virus (APV). Due to the similarity between NfV-1 and SINV-3, it is likely that NfV-1 also produces a sgRNA encoding the dsRBP and capsid proteins. A potential sgRNA start site was predicted (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(D)) by analogy with SINV-3 (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Valles et al., 2014a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Phylogenetic and comparative analysis</title><p>Sequences similar to NfV-1, SINV-3 and APV were identified in the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide (nr/nt) and Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) databases using tblastn. A total of 17 sequences with full or substantial genome coverage were selected for further analysis (<xref rid="s0080" ref-type="fn">Supplementary Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Transcriptome shotgun assembly sequences are typically derived from RNASeq (Illumina or Roche 454 platforms) analysis of cellular organism transcriptomes. The genomes of RNA viruses infecting the target organisms are often inadvertently sequenced and assembled as part of the transcriptome, and can be recognized by similarity to known viral sequences. However, as the TSA sequences have not been shown to correspond to infectious viruses, it is possible that some derive from defective viral sequences (such as transcribed host-genome-integrated virus-derived fragments; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010</xref>), or have in silico assembly errors. TSA-derived sequences are also often incomplete and, particularly for 454 sequencing, often have frame-shift sequencing errors. Therefore caution is required when using TSA-derived virus sequences for virus taxonomy and comparative genomic analysis.</p><p>To establish an RdRp-based phylogeny, we extracted the picornavirus-like superorder RdRp alignment provided in supplementary file 2 of <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Koonin et al. (2008)</xref>, appended the equivalent region (based on alignment to APV) from the 17 sequences in <xref rid="s0080" ref-type="fn">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, and rebuilt the alignment using MUSCLE (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Edgar, 2004</xref>). We then used MrBayes (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ronquist et al., 2012</xref>) to generate a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo based phylogenetic tree (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The analysis revealed that SINV-3-like and APV-like sequences form two distinct clusters which may form the basis of two new virus families (tentative names <italic>Solinviviridae</italic> [type species <italic><bold>Sol</bold></italic>enopsis <italic><bold>invi</bold></italic>cta virus 3] and <italic>Acypiviridae</italic> [type species <italic><bold>Acy</bold></italic>rthosiphon <italic><bold>pi</bold></italic>sum virus]. NfV-1 clusters within the SINV-3 clade.</p><p>Within the APV-clade, three closely related aphid-derived sequences (APV, rosy apple aphid virus and a <italic>Sitobion avenae</italic> [Arthropoda: Insecta: Hemiptera] TSA) have similar genome structure, including conservation of two predicted overlapping genes that might be translated via leaky scanning on the inferred sgRNA (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Valles et al., 2014a</xref>). Thika and Kilifi viruses, both isolated from <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (Arthropoda: Insecta: Diptera) (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Webster et al., 2015</xref>), lack the ribosomal frameshift site identified in APV (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">van der Wilk et al., 1997</xref>) but instead have monocistronic genomes. Nonetheless they maintain the genome order Hel-Pro-RdRp-dsRBP-JR. Due to the lack of frameshifting, instead of producing the 33K (VP1) and 66K (VP1-FSD) capsid proteins of APV, they would produce just a single JR-containing capsid protein (presumably equivalent to VP1-FSD, giving a 1:1 stoichiometry of shell: projection domains). The <italic>Clavigralla tomentosicollis</italic> (Arthropoda: Insecta: Hemiptera) TSA, derived from 454 sequencing, apparently had a number of frame-shift sequencing errors, but no change in reading frame corresponding to the APV frameshift site. Thus the sequence from <italic>Clavigralla tomentosicollis</italic> is likely to be monocistronic, similar to the Thika and Kilifi virus sequences to which it is most closely related. More distantly related were the TSAs from <italic>Eucyclops serrulatus</italic> (Arthropoda: Maxillopoda: Cyclopoida) and <italic>Anurida maritima</italic> (Arthropoda: Collembola: Poduromorpha). For the <italic>Eucyclops serrulatus</italic> TSA, the characteristic dsRBP domain downstream of RdRp was not found but instead was replaced with a predicted zinc-finger domain.</p><p>Within the SINV-3/NfV-1 clade, a TSA sequence from <italic>Monomorium pharaonis</italic> (Arthropoda: Insecta: Hymenoptera) had a very similar genome organization to SINV-3 but also encoded a potential overlapping gene that might be translated from the inferred sgRNA (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). A potential overlapping gene is also present at this location in NfV-1 and is the only AUG-initiated ORF in the NfV-1 genome apart from the polyprotein ORF with length &#x0003e;100 codons. The <italic>Diabrotica virgifera</italic> (Arthropoda: Insecta: Coleoptera) TSA, derived from 454 sequencing, had two frame-shift sequencing errors which could be accurately corrected by amino acid alignment to the <italic>Meligethes aeneus</italic> (Arthropoda: Insecta: Coleoptera) TSA sequence, following which both the <italic>Diabrotica virgifera</italic> and partial <italic>Meligethes aeneus</italic> sequences appeared to be monocistronic, but otherwise consistent with the SINV-3 genome architecture. More divergent TSA sequences from <italic>Liposcelis bostrychophila</italic> (Arthropoda: Insecta: Psocoptera) and <italic>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</italic> (Arthropoda: Insecta: Coleoptera) also appeared to be monocistronic but, while the <italic>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</italic> TSA displayed the characteristic gene order Hel-Pro-RdRp-dsRBP-JR, the dsRBP and JR domains could not be identified with HHpred in the <italic>Liposcelis bostrychophila</italic> sequence. It is possible that this sequence represents a &#x0201c;chimeric&#x0201d; virus that has acquired a different C-terminal gene block (perhaps containing novel capsid proteins) or, alternatively, the TSA sequence may be misassembled at the 3&#x02032; end. Finally, a TSA sequence from <italic>Menopon gallinae</italic> (Arthropoda: Insecta: Phthiraptera) appeared to be dicistronic. While we could not rule out sequencing/assembly errors being responsible for the &#x0201c;broken&#x0201d; ORF, the dicistronic architecture with Hel-Pro-RdRp encoded in the 5&#x02032; ORF and the capsid proteins encoded in the 3&#x02032; ORF would be compatible with the production of a sgRNA in viruses of this clade. KFV has a rearranged genome structure and may be misassembled (see discussion in <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Valles et al. (2014a)</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, despite similarity in the RdRp region, Nora virus has a quite different genome architecture: ORF2 encodes picorna-like Hel, Pro and RdRp domains, ORF4 encodes three proteolytically cleaved capsid proteins (where the first and likely the second contain JR domains), ORF3 encodes a minor capsid protein, and ORF1 encodes a viral suppressor of RNAi (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Ekstr&#x000f6;m et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">van Mierlo et al., 2012</xref>). Although the RdRp phylogenetic analysis placed Nora virus within the SINV-3/APV sister clades, the posterior probability for this placement was only 0.64.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Purification and electron microscopy</title><p>Particles purified from NfV-1-infected tawny crazy ants migrated to a density of 1.287&#x000b1;0.012&#x000a0;g/ml CsCl.

Control methods are limited currently to chemical insecticides, so discovery of natural enemies is sorely needed to develop sustainable control methods. To date, efforts to identify biologically-based control organisms of tawny crazy ant have led to the discovery of <italic>Myrmecamorba nylanderiae</italic>, a microsporidium (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Plowes et al., 2015</xref>) and putative viral pathogens (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Valles et al., 2012a</xref>). The putative viruses were identified in silico using a metatranscriptomics&#x02014;next generation sequencing approach (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Valles et al., 2012a</xref>). Blast analysis (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>) of nucleotide sequences from a gene library collected from nine geographically separated colonies identified 51 unique sequences of putative viral origin. Three of these sequences (13287.C1, 3776.C1, 8702.C1) were shown to be likely from replicating viruses that infect the ant (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Valles et al., 2012a</xref>). Using sequence 3776.C1 as a starting point, oligonucleotide primers were designed and RACE (3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;) reactions conducted leading to the discovery of a new virus, <italic>Nylanderia fulva virus 1</italic> (NfV-1). The 10,881 nucleotide RNA genome was monopartite, monocistronic, single-stranded, and possessed a poly(A) tail at the 3&#x02032; end of the genome. Sequencing also revealed that the three fragments identified in the earlier study (i.e., 13287.C1, 3776.C1, 8702.C1) were all part of the same virus genome.</p><p>Analysis of the NfV-1 genome revealed superfamily III helicase, 3C-like protease, and superfamily I RdRp domains in the order Hel-Pro-RdRp, characteristic of members of the order Picornavirales and family <italic>Caliciviridae</italic>. A single picorna/calici-like jelly-roll capsid domain was predicted downstream of the RdRp domain, making the genome structure more calici-like than picorna-like. The related virus SINV-3 has been shown to produce a sgRNA for capsid protein expression, which is another calici-like feature of these viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp amino acid sequence placed NfV-1 in a clade with SINV-3, KFV and several arthropod-derived TSA sequences. APV, rosy apple aphid virus, Thika virus, Kilifi virus and several other arthropod-derived TSA sequences formed a separate sister clade (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In both clades, there existed sequences in which ribosomal frameshifting downstream of the jelly-roll capsid domain would result in sub-stoichiometric levels of the extension domain (&#x0201c;FSD&#x0201d;) and VP2, and sequences in which these domains were fused in-frame with the jelly-roll domain apparently resulting in a 1:1 stoichiometry. Notwithstanding the similarities in genome architecture, there was no evidence based on the RdRp tree that these viruses clustered more closely with caliciviruses than picornaviruses. On the other hand, a previous analysis of the helicase domain, placed APV and KFV closer to caliciviruses than picornaviruses (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Koonin et al., 2008</xref>). These two clades of &#x0201c;calici-like&#x0201d; arthropod-infecting positive-sense RNA viruses may form the bases of two new families for which we tentatively propose the names <italic>Solinviviridae</italic> (<italic><bold>Sol</bold></italic>enopsis <italic><bold>invi</bold></italic>cta virus 3 as the type species, NfV-1, and relatives) and <italic>Acypiviridae</italic> (<italic><bold>Acy</bold></italic>rthosiphon <italic><bold>pi</bold></italic>sum virus as the type species, Thika virus, and relatives).</p><p>Unlike caliciviruses, but in common with other insect viruses, most members of the two clades were predicted to encode a viral suppressor of RNAi, generally taking the form of a dsRNA binding domain (&#x0201c;*&#x0201d; in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) with the same predicted fold as the 1A suppressor of silencing protein of Drosophila C virus (family <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic>) (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">van Rij et al., 2006</xref>). In the <italic>Eucyclops serrulatus</italic> TSA, the dsRBP domain was not predicted but instead HHpred predicted a zinc-finger domain at the same genomic location (&#x0201c;Z&#x0201d; in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). While many zinc-finger domains are involved in DNA binding, others are involved in RNA binding (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hall, 2005</xref>); thus this may be an alternative viral suppressor of RNAi. Unusually, NfV-1 contained a predicted OTU domain upstream of the helicase domain. OTU domains have been found in a few diverse RNA viruses, where they can be involved in proteolytic cleavage of viral polyproteins and, via a de-ubiquitination/de-ISGylation activity, inhibition of innate immune signaling (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Frias-Staheli et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">van Kasteren et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>NfV-1 was detected in larval, pupal, worker, and queen stages (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The virus was not detected in eggs indicating that it is not vertically transmitted and is likely acquired by horizontal transmission (intra- and inter-colony). Formal inter-colonial transmission tests and frequent laboratory NfV-1 infections of newly acquired field colonies of tawny crazy ant support this conclusion. However, transmission studies of NfV-1 to uninfected ants were equivocal. While transmission to uninfected tawny crazy ant colonies occurred, a corresponding control colony also acquired the infection. NfV-1-treated and -untreated colonies were housed in the same facility, so cross contamination was a concern. Indeed, the tawny crazy ant insectary was regularly contaminated with NfV-1. Virus-free colonies retrieved from the field and held in separate rearing trays in our facility invariably acquired the infection. In fact, a preliminary transmission study testing an NfV-1 bait formulation resulted in both inoculated and control colonies (<italic>n</italic>=2) becoming infected (D.H.O unpublished data). This same problem was encountered with SINV-3 and its host, the red imported fire ant, <italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic> (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Valles and Porter, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Valles et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Valles et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>QPCR data of different developmental stages corresponded with the intra-colonial developmental infection rate of NfV-1; the larval stage of tawny crazy ant contained significantly higher quantities of NfV-1 compared with adults (workers and queens) and pupae. The purpose of these experiments was to determine which developmental stages were infected, not necessarily to examine viral pathogenesis, so the NfV-1 titer may actually be higher in different stages depending on the infection time course. The NfV-1 replicative strand was only detected in the larval stage. However, failure to detect the replicative strand in the adult stage does not necessarily suggest that it is not involved in NfV-1 pathogenesis. Indeed, low NfV-1 titer and the absence of the replicative genome strand in worker ants may be attributed to RNA degradation. Worker ants were shown previously to contain a potent RNA degrading substance (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Valles et al., 2012b</xref>). Localized to the abdomen, liberation of this endogenous substance resulted in severe to complete RNA degradation in preparations from tawny crazy ant workers (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Valles et al., 2012b</xref>).</p><p>Perfunctory host specificity tests suggest that NfV-1 infection may be limited to <italic>N. fulva</italic> according to the phylogeny-based system proposed by <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Briese (2005)</xref>. The virus was not detected in congeners or closely related species outside the <italic>Nylanderia</italic> genus (<xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, a more thorough study, including direct challenge with NfV-1, will be required to establish the host specificity.</p><p>Use of RNA viruses as a viable method of ant control has been proposed previously (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Oi and Valles, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Valles, 2012</xref>). SINV-3 has been successfully released into field populations (Florida and California) of <italic>S. invicta</italic> as a classical biological control agent (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Valles and Oi, 2014</xref>) and has shown promise as a biopesticide (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Valles and Porter, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Valles et al., 2013</xref>). Despite a lack of overt symptoms among tawny crazy ants infected with NfV-1, one of the infected colonies used from the transmission experiment declined over time exhibiting significant mortality among brood (83%) and workers (76%). However, other colonies seemed to thrive despite NfV-1 infection. Mean oviposition rates of infected queens was 43% lower than uninfected queens, however the sample size of infected queens was small and the reduced rate was not statistically significant. Field populations of <italic>N. fulva</italic> have been observed (DHO, personal observation) and reported to exhibit unexplained extensive reductions and corresponding disappearance from established areas (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Wetterer et al., 2014</xref>). This type of population cycling is commonly observed in introduced populations trying to establish themselves in a new area (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Simberloff and Gibbons, 2004</xref>). Many RNA viruses are known to persist as inapparent infections that begin actively replicating when the host experiences some sort of external stress or co-infection with another pathogen (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Christian and Scotti, 1996</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Scotti et al., 1981</xref>). Thus, NfV-1 alone, or in combination with another pathogen, may be contributing to this boom-bust cycle observed in tawny crazy ant. Obviously, the impact of NfV-1 on tawny crazy ant colonies will have to be examined more closely.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>4</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0045"><label>4.1</label><title>Ant collections</title><p><italic>Nylanderia fulva</italic> colonies were collected from field sites in Gainesville (Alachua Co.), near Winter Garden (Lake Co.), Lakewood Ranch (Manatee Co.), and Callahan (Nassau Co.)

The percent change in brood volume and worker counts after 19 weeks were compared between persistently infected (NfV-1 detected on more than one sampling) and uninfected colonies by <italic>t</italic>-test (Proc <italic>T</italic> TEST, SAS 9.4, 2012).</p><p>Vertical transmission of NfV-1 was evaluated by confining individual queens in 1.7&#x000a0;ml microcentrifuge tubes for 24&#x000a0;h (<italic>n</italic>=19 queens) at 24.9 (&#x000b1;0.9 SD)&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 23.5 (&#x000b1;0.1 SD)% RH. Eggs were counted within each tube under a dissecting microscope. Queens were obtained from seven colonies used in the transmission test of which NfV-1 was detected in two colonies. A total of 9 queens were sampled from the infected colonies and 2 queens each were collected from the five uninfected colonies. The queens were removed from the vials and placed into a different clean 1.5&#x000a0;ml tubes. The egg clusters were washed with 1&#x000a0;ml of RNAse-free water two times and collected at the bottom of each tube by centrifugation. Total RNA was extracted from the paired queen and water-rinsed eggs and RT-PCR was conducted to detect the presence of NfV-1 as described.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><label>4.7</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The intra-colonial infection rate and stage infection (QPCR) data were subjected to analysis of variance using the general linear models procedure (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">SAS, 1988</xref>).

The upper blue arrows represent the cloning strategy for acquiring the NfV-1 genome. Contig 3776.C1 was used as template for initial 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; RACE reactions. Positions of picorna-like helicase (Hel), protease (Pro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein domains are shown within the polyprotein ORF. Predicted ovarian tumor (OTU), picorna/calici-like jelly-roll fold capsid protein (JR) and dsRNA binding protein (*) domains are also indicated. Potential virus protease cleavage sites are indicated with red triangles. The sequence upstream of Pro is likely to correspond to VPg. A putative sgRNA is indicated. Initiation at the first AUG (poor context) on the sgRNA would lead to translation of a short overlapping ORF while initiation at the second AUG (strong context) would lead to translation of the dsRBP domain and capsid proteins. VP1 (orange) and VP2 (red) are annotated based on analogy with the mapped structural proteins of SINV-3. (B) SINV-3 genome organization and potential cleavage sites. (C) Sequences at the potential cleavage sites in NfV-1 and SINV-3.

Nora virus, the next most closely related virus (by RdRp-based phylogeny), is also shown for comparison. Sequences assembled from Roche 454 sequence data are shown in pale green with breaks in the polyprotein ORF presumed to have resulted from frame-shift sequencing errors indicated. (The Sitobion TSA also derives from 454 sequencing but high similarity to APV permitted unambiguous removal of three frame-shift errors.) Likely partial sequences are also indicated by un-closed rectangles, although it is possible that additional sequences are incomplete and therefore that some ORFs may be 5&#x02032;-truncated. Red lines in KFV indicate a 638-nt sequence duplication that may indicate a rearranged defective sequence.
