The mechanism(s) that virulent nematodes employ to evade or suppress host plant defenses are not well understood. Here we report the use of a genetic strategy (allelic imbalance analysis) to associate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with nematode virulence genes in <italic>Heterodera glycines</italic>, the soybean cyst nematode (SCN). To accomplish this analysis, a custom SCN SNP array was developed and used to genotype SCN F3-derived populations grown on resistant and susceptible soybean plants. Three SNPs reproducibly showed allele imbalances between nematodes grown on resistant and susceptible plants. Two candidate SCN virulence genes that were tightly linked to the SNPs were identified. One SCN gene encoded biotin synthase (<italic>HgBioB</italic>), and the other encoded a bacterial-like protein containing a putative SNARE domain (<italic>HgSLP-1</italic>). The two genes mapped to two different linkage groups. HgBioB contained sequence polymorphisms between avirulent and virulent nematodes. However, the gene encoding <italic>HgSLP-1</italic> had reduced copy number in virulent nematode populations and appears to produce multiple forms of the protein via intron retention and alternative splicing. We show that HgSLP-1 is an esophageal-gland protein that is secreted by the nematode during plant parasitism. Furthermore, in bacterial co-expression experiments, HgSLP-1 co-purified with the SCN resistance protein Rhg1 &#x003b1;-SNAP, suggesting that these two proteins physically interact. Collectively our data suggest that multiple SCN genes are involved in SCN virulence, and that HgSLP-1 may function as an avirulence protein and when absent it helps SCN evade host defenses.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the United Soybean Board (Proposal Number: 1420-532-5620, PI: KNL) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://unitedsoybean.org/">http://unitedsoybean.org/</ext-link>); North Central Soybean Research Program (Proposal Number: NCSRP 2010-07360, PI: KNL) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncsrp.com">http://www.ncsrp.com</ext-link>); Illinois Soybean Association (Proposal Number: 09ISA354291, PI KNL) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ilsoy.org/">http://www.ilsoy.org/</ext-link>); United Stated Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Agricultural and Food Research Initiative (Proposal Number: 2008-04061, PI: KNL) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nifa.usda.gov/">http://nifa.usda.gov/</ext-link>).

SCN is an obligate parasite that must form a highly metabolically active, multinucleate nurse cell in the plant root (the syncytium) in order to complete its life cycle [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>],[<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The process of syncytium formation is complex and involves nematode-directed alterations of plant hormones, metabolic pathways and host gene regulation [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], in addition to suppression of host-plant defense mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To prevent nematode infection, the plant utilizes several resistance mechanisms, including pre-formed defenses and specific resistance genes [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Understanding the mechanisms host plants use to block nematode parasitism might provide insights into how some nematodes evade these defenses.</p><p>Genetic studies have indicated that resistance to SCN is polygenic, and numerous quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for SCN resistance have been identified. However a single accession Plant Introduction (PI) 88788, and to a lesser extent soybean cultivar (cv) Peking, predominate the commercial seed market [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recently, resistance genes to SCN were map-based cloned at two loci and both were shown to be atypical plant resistance genes [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The <italic>Rhg1</italic> locus from PI88788, was analyzed using an RNA interference (RNAi)-based approach which identified three genes that were part of a tandem repeat encoding a soybean &#x003b1;-SNAP protein, a wound inducible protein and a potential amino acid transporter [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The <italic>Rhg4</italic> SCN resistance gene from cv Forrest (Peking-type resistance) was recently map-based cloned using targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING), in combination with gene complementation and gene silencing [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. <italic>Rhg4</italic> also encoded a novel type of plant resistance gene, a serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), which is an enzyme involved in one carbon folate metabolism. The SCN resistance conferred by <italic>Rhg4</italic> also requires <italic>Rhg1</italic> to function fully, indicating the two seemingly different SCN resistance mechanisms work together in some unknown, but important way [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Host-plant resistance is an effective and environmentally friendly management tool. However, virulent nematode populations are able to overcome plant defenses to successfully reproduce on resistant plants. These &#x0201c;virulent&#x0201d; SCN are armed with specific virulence genes that have yet to be identified. It is suggested that nematodes probably have to overcome both innate resistance common to many plants, and induced host-plant resistance mechanisms controlled by specific nematode resistance genes [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the case of basal resistance mechanisms, plant phytoalexins might be detoxified by esophageal-gland-expressed glutathione-S-transferase [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Likewise, an esophagus-expressed chorismate mutase (CM) is thought to play a similar role by altering the production of chorismate-derived nematode toxins [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Some SCN CM alleles showed a correlation with SCN&#x02019;s ability to reproduce on some SCN-resistant soybean cultivars, suggesting some CM enzymes may aid the nematode in overcoming innate resistance mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Other nematode effectors that have been implicated in modulating host defense are GrSPRYSEC-19 [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], Hg30C02 [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], Hs10A06 [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], Hs4F01 [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Mi-CRT [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>While proteins expressed from esophageal glands are undoubtedly important for nematode parasitism, it has been also suggested that glutathione peroxidases secreted from the hypodermis could protect cyst nematodes against reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Likewise, a lipid binding protein secreted from the cuticle Gp-FAR-1 has been hypothesized to be an inhibitor of jasmonic acid signaling [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although not secreted, biosynthetic enzymes involved in the production of vitamin B metabolites, such as pantothenate (VB5), biotin (VB7), thiamin (VB1) and pyridoxal 5-phosphate (VB6), could play a role in circumventing a starvation-based mechanism of nematode resistance [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Two avirulence genes tied to specific host plant resistance genes have been identified in root knot nematodes (<italic>Meloidogyne spp</italic>.); map-1protein is secreted from nematode amphids [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and Mj-Cg-1 [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] which when silenced via RNAi increased the level of root-knot nematode virulence. However, the mechanism by which these genes alter nematode virulence is unknown.</p><p>In cyst nematodes the best examples of avirulence genes are the SPRYSEC effector protein Gp_RBP-1 of <italic>Globodera pallida</italic>, which has been shown to induce a specific hypersensitive reaction when co-expressed with the potato nematode resistance gene <italic>Gpa-2</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Likewise, the venom allergen Gr-VAP1 of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>rostochiensis</italic> triggers a cell death response in tomato (<italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic>) plants containing the Cf-2 and Rcr3<sup>pim</sup> genes [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Much of how plant parasitic nematodes evade or suppress host plant resistance mechanisms depends on the corresponding plant-resistance genes involved in preventing the nematode from completing its life cycle. Thus, one might expect the unusual nematode resistance genes found at the <italic>Rhg1</italic> and <italic>Rhg4</italic> loci would require SCN to deploy equally unique mechanisms to overcome these atypical types of resistance. In this paper, we describe the use of whole genome allelic imbalance or bulk segregant analysis to identify two candidate SCN virulence genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Allelic imbalance analysis</title><p>Dong &#x00026; Opperman [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] established that genetic analysis of SCN virulence was feasible. The subsequent development of high throughput DNA sequencing and genotyping methods made a map-based approach to identify SCN virulence genes possible. In this project we constructed an F<sub>3</sub> mapping population of SCN, segregating for virulence, and then used an allelic imbalance/bulk segregant-based approach to identify regions of the SCN genome containing virulence gene candidates.</p><p>To create the SCN mapping population, two inbred SCN strains were crossed. The female parental strain, TN10, was non-virulent and the male parental strain, TN20, was virulent on SCN resistant soybean. The resulting F<sub>1</sub> nematodes were allowed to randomly inter mate for two generations to generate a mapping population of unmated F<sub>3</sub> female SCN and F<sub>3</sub> single cyst derived populations to use for allelic imbalance analysis.</p><p>A pool of F3 single cyst derived populations was used to inoculate soybean plants containing the <italic>Rhg1</italic> resistance locus, or susceptible plants harboring only the susceptible <italic>Rhg1</italic> alleles. The resulting cysts were harvested from all plants and the DNA was extracted. The SCN populations used in the selection experiments contained both virulent and avirulent SCN, thus one would expect the frequency of SCN virulence genes to increase in SCN populations grown on soybean harboring the <italic>Rhg1</italic> resistance locus, but not on the susceptible plants. Furthermore, genetic recombination in the SCN genome should create a condition in the SCN population where allelic ratios of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near SCN virulence genes should be altered, but SNPs physically farther away from or unlinked to virulence genes will not have distorted ratios of SNP alleles in comparison to the susceptible control. This type of allelic imbalance or bulk segregant analysis can be a useful genetic approach if a way of conducting high-throughput SNP analysis is available.</p><p>Since commercial genotyping tools were absent for SCN, a custom Illumina SNP array was developed. At the time of the initiation of this project, the SCN genome was not available, so cDNA sequence reads of SCN inbred strain TN10 from egg and J2 developmental stages were collected, assembled and used as a template to identify SNPs in the SCN genome. SNPs that differed between the parental strains were identified by aligning genomic sequence collected from both parental inbred strains. A total of 1536 SNPs were selected that were homozygous between the parental SCN inbred strains and these were used to generate custom genotyping oligonucleotides for the Illumina GoldenGate genotyping system.</p><p>Two types of SCN DNA were genotyped, one was a set of 10 DNA samples for the allelic imbalance analysis and the other was a set of 84 DNA samples extracted from the F<sub>3</sub> mapping population. Parental DNA from SCN strain TN10 and TN20 were run as controls. The experiment was repeated to provide a biological replicate. In the allelic imbalance analysis, out of the 1536 SNPs tested, three SNPs showed a statically significant imbalance where the virulent and avirulent SNP allele consistently differed in frequency when the bulk SCN populations were grown on susceptible and resistant plants. Thus, the three SNPs (212, 1063 and 1533) were considered good candidates for markers linked to SCN virulence loci (<xref rid="pone.0145601.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A partial genetic map containing these three SNP markers was constructed from the SCN F<sub>3</sub> mapping population SNP data and showed that the three virulence associated SNPs mapped to two different linkage groups (<xref rid="pone.0145601.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0145601.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0145601.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0145601.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>SCN genetic linkage groups containing SCN SNPs linked to virulence.</title><p>The left column has the map distance in centimorgans and the right column shows the SNP number.

containing the SNPs associated with virulence, a SCN genome sequence was required. Fortunately, a draft assembly of the SCN TN10 genome was recently completed by the Joint Genome Institute (JGI). BLASTN was used to match the DNA sequences flanking the SNPs to the genome scaffolds. The BLASTN search identified three scaffolds; scaffold 385 (40,259 bp) for SNP 212, scaffolds 1924 (15,316 bp) for SNP 1063 and scaffold 20 (176,619 bp) for SNP 1533.</p><p>Although it was unknown how close the SNPs might be to candidate SCN virulence gene(s), it was thought that a closely linked SCN virulence gene could be identified based upon homology to known pathogenicity related proteins and the presence of sequence polymorphisms between virulent and avirulent SCN.</p><p>Since the SCN scaffolds were from a preliminary build of the SCN genome, they were not annotated. To identify expressed genes, SCN transcriptome nucleotide sequence, derived from egg and J2 RNA, was aligned to the scaffolds. The beginning and end of the expressed genes were identified and intron sequences were removed. The resulting cDNA sequences were then compare to known proteins using BLASTX (<xref rid="pone.0145601.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

The remaining 100 amino acids of the predicted SCN Ha-dsl-1-like protein were not similar to Ha-dsl-1. Furthermore, when genomic sequences from SCN TN10 and TN20, collected from an Illumina sequencer, were aligned to the SCN Ha-dsl-1-like gene, the same allelic form was present in both SCN TN10 and TN20, thus this gene was not considered a promising virulence gene candidate.</p><p>However, the SCN <italic>Paenibacillus dendritiformis</italic>-like protein in scaffold 385, which spans from base positions 18,000 to 22,000 in the scaffold, appeared more interesting.

For this reason this sequence was chosen for further analysis. The SCN <italic>P</italic>. <italic>dendritiformis</italic>-like gene encodes a predicted protein of 326 amino acids (36.8 kDa) containing a 20-amino acid signal peptide and a 70 amino acid coiled-coil domain at amino acid positions 41 through 111.

SNARE proteins are highly conserved in eukaryotes and are involved in mediating membrane fusion events between cell membranes.

If transcripts were produced containing intron sequences, the resulting proteins would be truncated due to stop codons in all of the intron sequences. The one exception is intron 3, which does not have a stop codon, but does have enough cDNA coverage so that one third of the transcripts could retain this intron. In this case, it would be expected that a protein 48 amino acids longer would be produced (<xref rid="pone.0145601.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). In addition, alignments of cDNA to the genomic sequence indicates a three-nucleotide deletion occurs 13% of the time due to an apparent alternative splice site at the beginning of exon 3.

Immunolocalization experiments were conducted to localize the protein in the nematode while it was parasitizing the plant to determine if it was expressed in a nematode cell type that might secrete the protein from the nematode into the plant. To do this, peptide antibodies to HgSLP-1 were produced and incubated with nematode infested root sections. When the HgSLP-1 antibodies were detected via florescent microscopy, the antibodies bound to a subventral esophageal gland, indicated by the extensive florescent signal emitted from the basal cell body (<xref rid="pone.0145601.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Distinct antibody staining was also observed in the gland extension, metacorpus and esophageal lumen and stylet (<xref rid="pone.0145601.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). While florescent signals were also observed in plant cells walls adjacent to the nematode, we do not interpret this signal as the <italic>in planta</italic> location of HgSLP-1 since florescent signals are also observed in plant cell walls near the nematode in control sections. However, florescent signals in an esophageal gland or stylet were never observed in control sections. The fact that florescent signal is present in the esophageal lumen and stylet is consistent with the HgSLP-1 being secreted from the nematode since at this point the protein would have passed the valves in the metacorpus and there would be no further barriers to HgSLP-1 leaving the nematode. However, this data does not show that HgSLP-1 is injected into the nematode feeding cell. Future higher-resolution microscopic studies on SCN feeding cells will be required to address the plant subcellular location of HgSLP-1.

The fractions were collected and assayed for the presence of the HgSLP-1 protein via antibody dot blots. The HgSLP-1 (36.8 kDa) alone eluted at fraction 23 slightly sooner than the chymotrypsinogen A standard (25 kDa) which eluted at fraction 30, which is consistent with its expected size. However, when extracts containing both HgSLP-1 and &#x003b1;-SNAP were run through the column, the HgSLP-1 eluted at fraction 15, very close to the albumin standard (67 kDa) that eluted at fraction 12. The shift in elution of HgSLP-1 is consistent with this protein binding to &#x003b1;-SNAP and confirms the co-purification experiments described above. In both protein extracts, early fractions, particularly fraction 1, also contained HgSLP-1.

A genetic approach to the identification of nematode virulence genes makes few assumptions about the underlying nature of the genes controlling the virulence phenotype. Past genetic studies on SCN virulence indicated one or two genes control the nematodes ability to reproduce on <italic>Rhg1</italic> and <italic>Rhg4</italic>-resistant plants [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This study showed that SCN was a viable genetic system; however, it was also clear that SCN lacked a genetic infrastructure (a genome sequence and sequence polymorphisms) needed for map-based cloning of the genes controlling the virulence phenotype.</p><p>Part of the problem has been resolved with the development of the semi-quantitative GoldenGate SNP assays for SCN [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] that can be used for genetic mapping and for map-based cloning via allelic imbalance [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] or bulk segregant analysis [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In our study, three SNPs (212, 1035 and 1533) showed consistent differences in SNP frequency when the bulk nematodes were grown on resistant and susceptible plants. Our criteria for identifying candidate virulence genes in the scaffolds of interest was based on the hypothesis that an SCN virulence gene might encode an effector protein or may have entered the genome via HGT from a microorganism and that the putative virulence gene should have a clear sequence polymorphism(s) between virulent and avirulent parents. Due to a lack of known SCN effector proteins in the SCN scaffolds under investigation, the putative HGT events in two of the scaffolds became the focus of our attention. The scaffold with SNP 1035 contained HgBioB, the scaffold with SNP 212 contained HgSLP-1, and the third SNP-containing region is still under analysis.</p><sec id="sec009"><title>HgBioB</title><p>Biotin functions as a carboxyl carrier for biotin dependent carboxylases, which are critical for fatty acid metabolism and amino acid catabolism. Biotin has also been shown to play a role in cell signaling, epigenetic regulation of genes, chromatin structure [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and recently in microbial pathogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], making it a good candidate for a SCN virulence gene.</p><p>In general, multicellular animals, including SCN, have lost the ability to synthesize biotin <italic>de novo</italic>. It is assumed the gene loss occurred because animals can simply acquire the vitamins through their diet. Thus, it seems unusual that SCN, an animal and a parasite, would express biotin synthase. The discovery of <italic>HgBioB</italic> in one of the scaffolds associated with SCN virulence was very significant, since this gene had previously been identified and speculated to be involved in SCN virulence [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In fact, the SCN SNP 1035 associated with SCN virulence was in the <italic>HgBioB</italic> gene, making it the best candidate virulence gene in the scaffold. HgBioB has been predicted to be functional, since it retains a conserved active site, but the virulent and avirulent SCN appear to have slightly different amino acid sequences. These amino acid sequence differences could alter biotin synthase enzymatic activity and thus could be the basis of this virulence trait. The exact role HgBioB could play in virulence is unclear, but we have previously speculated it could be a method for the nematode to circumvent SCN resistance, if part of the mechanism of resistance is caused by the plant reducing biotin availability during a nematode resistance response. It should be noted, that the nematode does not have the complete biotin biosynthetic pathway, but only the last enzyme in the pathway. So, if a plant reduced biotin synthesis at the last step, as a mechanism to starve the nematode parasite, the precursors to biotin may still be available for conversion to biotin via HgBioB [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this scenario a more enzymatically active biotin synthase enzyme, in the virulent SCN, could give the nematode a competitive advantage. It would be necessary to measure the levels of biotin in SCN feeding cells of susceptible and resistant soybean plants to test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>HgSLP-1</title><p>The region of the SCN genome that contains SNP 212 encodes <italic>HgSLP-1</italic>, a gene that appears to have entered the SCN genome via HGT. Interestingly, <italic>HgSLP-1</italic> appears to vary in copy number in SCN populations. Some of the SCN strains tested for HgSLP-1 copy number variation were the genetically characterized inbred SCN strains OP20, OP25 and OP50 [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The genetic study of the OP SCN inbred strains established that SCN virulence was controlled by one or two genes, depending on the type of resistant plants and nematode strains used. This landmark study established that virulence on <italic>Rhg1</italic>-type resistance was genetically controlled by the dominant <italic>Ror1</italic> gene (reproduction on resistant) in the virulent strain OP50, but OP50 growth on <italic>Rhg4</italic>/<italic>Rhg1</italic>-based resistance was controlled by the recessive <italic>ror2</italic> gene. The virulent inbred SCN strain OP20 was shown to require two virulence genes to reproduce on the <italic>Rhg1</italic> source of resistance. This study suggested that SCN utilizes several mechanisms to overcome <italic>Rhg1</italic>-based resistance, but only one gene, <italic>ror2</italic>, to overcome <italic>Rhg1/Rhg4</italic>-type resistance. When these nematodes were tested for the presence or absence of <italic>HgSLP-1</italic>, the gene was present in OP25 (avirulent SCN), but nearly absent or reduced in copy number in OP20 and OP50 (both virulent on <italic>Rhg1</italic> and <italic>Rhg1</italic>/<italic>Rhg4</italic> resistant plants). It is interesting to note, that even though OP20, OP50 and TN20 are not related to each other (two are from North Carolina and the other from Missouri) the nematode strains have a similar virulence profile in that they grow on most SCN resistant plants. More work is needed to confirm the correlation between lower copy number of <italic>HgSLP-1</italic> and broad SCN virulence. However, it is interesting that the <italic>ror2</italic> virulence gene that controls growth on the <italic>Rhg1</italic>/<italic>Rhg4</italic>-type resistance is recessive. The deleted <italic>HgSLP-1</italic> gene in most of the nematodes in this strain would be expected to act as a recessive gene, thus it may be that <italic>ror2</italic> is in fact this deletion or lack of <italic>HgSLP-</italic>1.</p><p>HgSLP-1 contains a t-SNARE domain, thus it could interact with proteins involved in membrane fusion. In general, to initiate membrane fusion between a vesicle and a target membrane, a complex of proteins must interact; a vesicle will have a membrane bound v-SNARE (also referred to as R-SAREs, Vamp or synaptobrevin proteins), while the target membrane will have a different membrane bound t-SNARE protein (also referred to as Q-SAREs or syntaxin proteins) [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The complex also contains a protein called SNAP-25 that binds to the other SNAREs to form a stable trans-SNARE complex where coiled-coil domains bind these proteins together [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The soluble protein &#x003b1;-SNAP is an adapter protein and binds to the t-SNARE, NSF and to a lesser extent SNAP-25 [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and stimulates the NSF ATPase to disassemble the cis-SNARE complex after membrane fusion [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>The SCN gene encoding <italic>HgSLP-1</italic> is homologous to a bacterial protein from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>dendritiformis</italic>. A subset of bacterial SNARE proteins act as virulence effectors in intracellular human pathogens such as <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Legionella</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In these intracellular bacteria, the SNARE domain proteins acts as a mimic and directly bind to host v-SNAREs to suppresses defense-related membrane fusion events, which aids the bacteria by preventing the phagosome membranes from fusing with lysosomes and killing the bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Likewise, the &#x003b1;-SNAP proteins can bind to t-SNAREs via coiled-coil domains both in trans-SNARE complexes and independently [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. When &#x003b1;-SNAP binds to free t-SNAREs in a cell, this interaction prevents membrane fusion events [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Thus, it seemed possible that if the HgSLP-1 could act as a t-SNARE mimic and bind to an &#x003b1;-SNAP, or a soybean v-SNARE, it might prevent defense-related membrane fusion events in the nematode feeding cell by sequestering these required plant membrane fusion proteins. However in <italic>Rhg1</italic>-mediated resistance, plants have up to 10 copies of <italic>Rhg1</italic> &#x003b1;-SNAP, which may allow them to overcome this putative sequestration. While the data indicates HgSLP-1 is secreted from the nematode and interacts with a soybean &#x003b1;-SNAP, further work will be required to experimentally demonstrate that HgSLP-1 is injected into the feeding cell and interacts <italic>in planta</italic> with host proteins.</p><p>The role of plant membrane fusion proteins in SCN-resistance is supported by the finding that one of the <italic>Rhg1</italic> resistance genes encodes a &#x003b1;-SNAP protein. Rhg1 &#x003b1;-SNAP proteins may confer SCN resistance by themselves [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] or in combination with the other resistance genes at the <italic>Rhg1</italic> locus [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Exactly how HgSLP-1 might mitigate host defenses in soybean lacking the <italic>Rhg-1</italic> loci is unclear, but over expression of &#x003b1;-SNAP can induce syntaxin 31 in soybean and this t-SNARE protein enhances SCN resistance [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], thus blocking this interaction may promote susceptibility. It has also been demonstrated in tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>) that by blocking syntaxin SYP132, a t-SNARE protein involved with targeting vesicles containing PR proteins, increased bacterial susceptibility [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Similarly, resistance to <italic>Peronospora parasitica</italic> is mediated via VAMP721/722 vesicles in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], suggesting vesicle transport is a critical component for host-plant resistance to several plant pathogens. Thus, it seems plausible that HgSLP-1 could block the vesicle-mediated transport of anti-nematode proteins or metabolites in a similar way and inactivate this type if basic host defense mechanism.</p><p>However, our data suggests the roles of HgSLP-1 and Rhg1 are not simple. Different isolates of SCN populations had variable copies of the <italic>HgSLP-1</italic> gene and the RNA-Seq data suggests that the mRNA encoded by the gene is alternatively spliced and forms containing intron sequences may be produced. Similarly, the Rhg-1 &#x003b1;-SNAP proteins show significant polymorphisms between and within SCN resistant and susceptible soybean lines [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The diversity of SCN SNARE-like proteins could reflect the nematodes attempt to adapt to different soybean &#x003b1;-SNAP proteins or other binding partners of HgSLP-1. Indeed, the apparent reduction in copy number of <italic>HgSLP-1</italic> from TN20 and other nematode populations may reflect a resistance evasion mechanism used by the nematode as several highly virulent SCN populations appear to have reduced copy numbers of the gene. However, if HgSLP-1 is important for establishing a feeding cell, one might expect that the lack of this protein may impair the growth and development of virulent SCN lacking the gene. While the lack of HgSLP-1 may play a role in evading host plant defense mechanisms, other potential virulence genes, such as the <italic>HgBioB</italic> or the gene near SNP 1533 are probably also required for virulence.</p><p>Overall, HgSLP-1 could play a role in SCN virulence, via its absence, but it could be involved with feeding cell formation if alterations of membrane fusion would be beneficial in this process. It seems plausible that HgSLP-1 may have other binding partners in the plant cell in addition to the <italic>Rhg1</italic> &#x003b1;-SNAP, but it will be important to localize HgSLP-1 at higher resolution in nematode feeding cells to validate its <italic>in planta</italic> role in nematode parasitism. It will be interesting in the future to test other &#x003b1;-SNAP variants to determine their binding kinetics to <italic>HgSLP-1</italic> in its various forms. It will also be important to follow up on the involvement in biotin in <italic>Rhg1</italic>-mediated resistance by further analysis of the biotin biosynthetic enzymes in the plant and nematode. Increasing our knowledge of how nematodes evade/suppress host plant resistance may lead to more durable SCN resistant plants or to improved methods of monitoring virulent nematode populations, which in turn will aid in the management of these damaging pathogens.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Development of SCN population for mapping and selection</title><p>Soybean cyst nematodes, populations TN10 and TN20 were grown by standard methods and cysts were harvested and purified as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].

Two TaqMan assays were used to measure the copy number of the <italic>HgSLP-1</italic> gene relative to a control gene, <italic>HgFAR-1</italic>. Standard PCR conditions were used for the TaqMan assays: 50C for 10 min, followed 95C for 10 minutes, then 40 cycles of 95C for 10 sec, and 60C for 1 min. For each DNA type, triplicate PCR reactions were conducted and the entire experiment was conducted twice with similar results. The data was compared using the &#x00394;Ct method [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], where &#x00394;Ct = Ct<sup>target</sup>-Ct<sup>control gene</sup> and the fold difference (FD) between the <italic>HgSLP-1</italic> target gene and the HgFAR-1 control gene was calculated using the equation, FD = 2<sup>-&#x00394;Ct</sup>. The fold differences were normalized to OP25 since there was nearly no difference in &#x00394;Ct for this SCN population. <italic>HgFAR-1</italic> was known to be of consistent copy number Craig et al. (2008). The primer and probes for detection of HgFAR-1 were as follows: F-primer AGGTGACCAAATTCTACC, R-primer GGGTGTCCATTTATTTGC, Probe FAM-CTGACCGAGGATGGACAA-MGBNFQ. The HgSLP-1 TaqMan primers and probes detected sequences in the second exon of HgSLP-1, the following oligonucleotides were used: F-primer, CGAGATGAAATGAACCAAA R-primer, GAGTCGTTTGTCCATTTG Probe FAM-AACACGAGATTGGAC -MGBNFQ.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Localization of HgSLP-1 protein in SCN-infected soybean roots</title><p>Antibodies to HgSLP-1 were generated from a synthetic peptide (CRHLFESGEASETAS) in rabbits and affinity purified by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). Susceptible soybean seedlings (Essex) were inoculated with inbred SCN strain TN10 eggs, which were allowed to hatch and infect the soybean roots for 5 days to generate a mixed age population of nematodes. Root sections containing SCN infection sites were dissected and 0.5 cm long root segments were placed in ice-cold FAA fixative (50% ethanol, 5% acetic acid, 10% formalin). The nematodes and roots were microwave-fixed and embedded in paraffin [<xref rid="pone.0145601.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Immunolocalization of HgSLP-1 was conducted by sectioning (10 &#x003bc;m) the paraffin embedded roots and mounting them on Probe-on-Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh PA) over night at 42&#x000b0;C. The slides were soaked twice in xylene for 5 minutes, and then incubated in 100% acetone for 5 minutes. After repeating the acetone incubation the slides were hydrated by soaking for 5 minutes each in 95%, then 85%, 70%, and 50% acetone. Finally they were soaked in distilled H<sub>2</sub>O and phosphate buffered saline (PBS: 137mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10mM Na2HPO4, KH2PO4 pH 7.4) for 5 minutes each. The nematodes were permeablized by incubating the nematodes in PBS containing 4 &#x003bc;g/ml proteinase K for 30 minutes. The proteinase K was inactivated by soaking the slides 5 minutes in PBS with 0.2% glycine, then in PBS with 1mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride, followed by a 5 minute treatment in PBS. The slides were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS for 30 minutes, and then washed with PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 5 minutes. The slides were incubated for two hours with the HgSLP-1 primary antibody or pre-immune serum as a negative control (1:250 dilution) in PBS with 0.1% BSA, then washed 3 times, 10 minutes each wash, in PBS with 0.1% BSA. Next, the slides were incubated with the secondary antibody, goat-anti-rabbit Oregon green 488 (Life Technologies) in PBS with 0.1% BSA (1:250 dilution) and incubated for 2 hours. Finally, the slides were washed 3 times (10 minutes each wash) in PBS with 0.1% BSA. The slides were washed once with water and mounted with a coverslip using Prolong anti-fade and allowed to dry overnight. The sections were observed on a Zeiss Axioscope 2 florescence microscope and digital images were captured with a Zeiss Axiocam. These experiments were conducted three times with similar results.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Production of &#x003b1;-SNAP antibodies</title><p>Total RNA from soybean cv Forrest was converted to cDNA and used as a template to PCR amplify &#x003b1;-SNAP (Glyma18g02590) accession number LOC100814639 using primers <italic>Xma</italic>I-SNAP-F: AAACCCGGGAATGGCCGATCAGTTATCGAAGG and <italic>Xho</italic>I-SNAP- R: AAAACTCGAGTCAAGTAATAACCTCATACTCC.

The protein concentration of the resulting <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> protein extract was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Fisher Scientific). Equal concentrations of proteins from the negative control and experimental samples were purified using Dynabeads His-Tag Isolation kit (Life Technologies) following manufacture&#x02019;s protocol. The eluted proteins were run on a Mini-Protean TGX SDS-PAGE 4&#x02013;20% gradient gel (BioRad, Hercules CA) and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using an iBlot dry blotting system (Life Technologies). The protein blot was incubated with blocking buffer (0.1M maleic acid, 0.15M NaCl, 1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100) for one hour. The primary polyclonal antibodies, anti-HgSLP-1 or anti- &#x003b1;-SNAP, were diluted 1:5000 in blocking buffer and incubated with the blot for 30 minutes and were then washed with blocking buffer three time for 10 minutes each. The secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate, was also used at a 1:5000 dilution in blocking buffer and was incubated and washed as described above. The secondary antibody was detected using Western Blue Stabilized substrate for alkaline phosphatase (Promega, Madison WI) and the reaction was stopped using TE (10mM Tris-HCL, 1mM EDTA) after approximately 20 minutes of development at room temperature. The experiment was repeated with similar results.</p><p>The total <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> protein extracts expressing HgSLP-1 alone or both HgSLP-1 and -&#x003b1; SNAP were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. The gel filtration column was 50 cm tall and had a diameter of 1.8cm. The column was packed with Superdex 75 prep grade resin (Amersham Biosciences) and a BioRad Econogradient pump. The protein fractions were collected on a BioRad model 2110 fraction collector. The column was equilibrated using 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl buffer and then calibrated using a LMW gel filtration calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences). Blue dextran 2000 was used to determine the void volume of the column and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25.0 kDa), ovalbumin (43.0kDa), albumin (67.0kDa) were used in the column calibration. For each column run, the flow rate of the column of 0.25ml/minute and each fraction was collected for two minutes. Before each sample was added, 200 ul of blue dextran 2000 was added to the column, allowed to run into the column for one minute, then 200 ul of protein extract was added (either HgSLP-1 or the extract containing both HgSLP-1 and &#x003b1;-SNAP). The extracts were the same ones used in the co-purification experiments described above. The fractions obtained were tested for the presence of HgSLP-1 using protein dot blots. Briefly, 1600 ul of cold acetone was added to 400 ul of each fraction, the proteins were allowed to precipitate on ice for 30 minutes, then they were centrifuged and the acetone was removed from the protein pellet. The proteins were dried in a Speedvac and then suspended in 10 ul of 1x SDS PAGE buffer and boiled for 5 minutes. 2 ul of the protein fraction was spotted onto nitrocellulose, dried, and then the HgSLP-1 was detected as described above. The resulting spots were quantified using NIH image and the resulting intensities were plotted using Microsoft Excel. The experiment was repeated with similar results.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>DNA and RNA sequence data</title><p><italic>HgSLP-1</italic> gene sequence is deposited in GenBank accession number KM575849.
