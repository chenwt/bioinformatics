Via an insertional mutation screen for loci affecting NCC development in mice, we identified one line&#x02014;named TashT&#x02014;that displays a partially penetrant aganglionic megacolon phenotype in a strong male-biased manner. Interestingly, this phenotype is highly reminiscent of human Hirschsprung&#x02019;s disease, a neurocristopathy with a still unexplained male sex bias. In contrast to the megacolon phenotype, colonic aganglionosis is almost fully penetrant in homozygous TashT animals. The sex bias in megacolon expressivity can be explained by the fact that the male ENS ends, on average, around a &#x0201c;tipping point&#x0201d; of minimal colonic ganglionosis while the female ENS ends, on average, just beyond it. Detailed analysis of embryonic intestines revealed that aganglionosis in homozygous TashT animals is due to slower migration of enteric NCC. The TashT insertional mutation is localized in a gene desert containing multiple highly conserved elements that exhibit repressive activity in reporter assays. RNAseq analyses and 3C assays revealed that the TashT insertion results, at least in part, in NCC-specific relief of repression of the uncharacterized gene Fam162b; an outcome independently confirmed via transient transgenesis. The transcriptional signature of enteric NCC from homozygous TashT embryos is also characterized by the deregulation of genes encoding members of the most important signaling pathways for ENS formation&#x02014;Gdnf/Ret and Edn3/Ednrb&#x02014;and, intriguingly, the downregulation of specific subsets of X-linked genes. In conclusion, this study not only allowed the identification of <italic>Fam162b</italic> coding and regulatory sequences as novel candidate loci for Hirschsprung&#x02019;s disease but also provides important new insights into its male sex bias.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Hirschsprung&#x02019;s disease (also known as aganglionic megacolon) is a severe congenital defect of the enteric nervous system (ENS) resulting in complete failure to pass stools. It is characterized by the absence of neural ganglia (aganglionosis) in the distal gut due to incomplete colonization of the embryonic intestines by neural crest cells (NCC), the ENS precursors. Hirschsprung&#x02019;s disease has an incidence of 1 in 5000 newborns and a 4:1 male sex bias. Although many genes have been associated with this complex genetic disease, most of its heritability as well as its male sex bias remain unexplained. Here, we describe an insertional mutant mouse line (&#x0201c;TashT&#x0201d;) in which virtually all homozygotes display colonic aganglionosis due to defective migration of enteric NCC, but in which only a subset of homozygotes develops megacolon. Surprisingly, this group is almost exclusively male. The TashT ENS defect stems, at least in part, from the disruption of long-range interactions between evolutionarily conserved elements with silencer activity and <italic>Fam162b</italic>, resulting in NCC-specific upregulation of this uncharacterized protein coding gene. Global analysis of gene expression further revealed that several hundreds of genes are significantly deregulated in TashT enteric NCC. Interestingly, this dataset includes multiple X-linked candidate genes potentially underlying the male sex bias. Taken together, our data pave the way for a clearer understanding of the intriguing male sex bias of Hirschsprung&#x02019;s disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC #342093) and from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR #MOP-26037) to NP.

One of its essential roles is to regulate intestinal motility. The ENS is made up of interconnected neural ganglia, themselves composed of neurons and supporting glial cells, forming two main parallel networks: the submucosal plexus and the myenteric plexus. The muscles of the bowel wall that ensure peristaltic movements are controlled by the myenteric plexus of the ENS.</p><p>The ENS is constructed during embryo development by derivatives of migrating neural crest cells (NCC) [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These multipotent cells originate from the dorsal part of the neural tube, undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and migrate extensively to contribute to numerous embryonic structures. Among several different cell types, NCC generate melanocytes as well as all enteric neurons and glia. The developing bowel is mainly colonized by NCC derivatives originating from the vagal region of the neural tube. Such colonization proceeds as a rostro-caudal wave lasting more than 5 days in the mouse (from embryonic day (e) 9.0 to 14.5), with NCC derivatives first entering the foregut, passing through the midgut (prospective small intestine) and finally populating the hindgut (prospective colon) either by migrating through the intestinal mesenchyme [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] or by taking a shortcut via the mesentery [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The hindgut is the last part of the intestines to be colonized and, therefore, the most susceptible to enteric NCC (eNCC) developmental defects. Sacral NCC also contribute to the ENS, but this later contribution is minor and cannot compensate for a lack of vagal NCC [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Defects in hindgut colonization by eNCC result in a lack of neural ganglia in the colon, leading to intestinal blockage due to absence of peristalsis. This phenotype is generally described as &#x0201c;aganglionic megacolon&#x0201d; because of the subsequent massive accumulation of fecal material and severe distention of the colon. In humans, this condition is called Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) and, depending on the length of aganglionosis, is clinically subdivided in short-segment (i.e. restricted to the rectosigmoid colon) and long-segment forms. Short-segment HSCR represents the vast majority of cases and is more common in males than females, with an overall ratio of ~4:1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In patients displaying longer segments of aganglionosis, the sex bias is much less pronounced or absent altogether. Although mutations in at least 15 genes have been implicated in HSCR, heritability is unexplained for the majority of cases [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. HSCR is thus a classic example of a complex disease involving multiple genes, incomplete penetrance, variable expressivity and an intriguing male bias.</p><p>Most known HSCR-associated genes encode players from two signaling pathways: the GDNF ligand/ RET receptor and EDN3 ligand/ EDNRB receptor pathways. In fact, <italic>RET</italic> is the main gene associated with HSCR [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For both pathways, the receptor is found at the surface of eNCC while the ligand is dynamically secreted from the surrounding mesenchyme during the colonization phase. The role of GDNF/RET and EDN3/EDNRB signaling in ENS formation has been well conserved evolutionarily and studies in animal models have revealed that both pathways profoundly influence every key aspect of eNCC development such as proliferation, survival, differentiation and, most especially, migration [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Mouse models have been particularly informative in this regard and multiple lines bearing mutation&#x02014;either spontaneous or targeted&#x02014;of genes encoding members of Gdnf/Ret and Edn3/Ednrb pathways have been studied [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the incomplete penetrance and, above all, the male bias observed in human HSCR have been poorly replicated in current animal models [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Here, we report the creation of a new insertional mutant mouse model for HSCR that displays, for the first time, incomplete penetrance of the aganglionic megacolon phenotype with a very strong male bias. Extensive characterization of this mouse line and independent validation via transient transgenesis indicate that this outcome is, at least in part, initiated by the specific upregulation of <italic>Fam162b</italic> in NCC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Phenotypic overview of the TashT mouse line</title><p>The TashT mouse line was obtained from an insertional mutagenesis screen for genes involved in NCC development.

Since melanocytes are derived from NCC, this genetic tool also proved to be a potent indicator of abnormal NCC development via identification of non-uniform pigmentation patterns. This approach yielded several transgenic mutant lines (to be described elsewhere) among which TashT (<italic>Tachet&#x000e9;e</italic>, in French) was identified due to its variegated pigmentation (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><fig id="pgen.1005093.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005093.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>The TashT mouse line is a model for male-biased aganglionic megacolon.</title><p>(a) Comparison between heterozygous and homozygous TashT animals from a F2 litter at postnatal day (P) 21.

These animals are smaller than unaffected TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> siblings (reaching about 74% of littermate weight) and exhibit bowel obstruction concomitant with lack of myenteric ganglia in the distal colon (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,c</xref>). The most striking and interesting feature of this lethal phenotype is the fact that the vast majority of affected animals are male (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). In addition, we found via histological analyses that colonic aganglionosis can not only be detected in megacolon-suffering but also in non-affected TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> animals of both sexes (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). To determine whether megacolon expressivity could be correlated with extent of aganglionosis, we undertook a systematic analysis of the length of the colonic ENS for a random group of TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> animals of weaning age via staining of acetylcholinesterase activity (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). In accordance with such correlation, quantification results first revealed that&#x02014;regardless of the sex of the animal&#x02014;a minimal length of the colon (~ 80%; critical region in <xref rid="pgen.1005093.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>) has to be properly innervated in FVB/n mice in order to avoid blockage. No intermediate phenotype was noted in the course of these analyses as none of the non-affected animals showed signs of abnormal accumulation of feces in the colon. Furthermore, these results confirmed that most TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> animals exhibit aganglionosis in the distal colon and that males (ganglionated on average over 79% of total colon length) are more affected than females (ganglionated on average over 89% of total colon length) (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Importantly, a similar statistically significant difference between male and female animals (74% vs 90%) was also observed in neonatal colons, thus confirming the developmental origin of this male-biased defect.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Detailed analysis of TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> eNCC reveals a cell migration defect</title><p>To analyze ENS formation in TashT embryos, we took advantage of the fact that this line bears a second co-injected transgene (pSRYp[1.6kb]-YFP) that labels migrating NCC derivatives (including eNCC of vagal and sacral origin) with YFP fluorescence [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (see also <xref rid="pgen.1005093.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).

Although ectopic fluorescence in the cecum and proximal hindgut regions impeded precise visualization of the migration front between e11.5 and e14.5, we found that this delay persists through the time at which normal colonization of the digestive tract is overtly completed (e15.5). The presence of scattered fluorescent cells beyond the chains of vagal-derived eNCC at this stage also suggests that the contribution of sacral-derived eNCC to the distal hindgut is not abrogated in TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> embryos.</p><fig id="pgen.1005093.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1005093.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>A cell migration defect underlies the defective colonization of TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> embryonic guts by eNCC.</title><p>

To further characterize the colonization defect, leader cells at the tip of eNCC chains were then visualized during several hours in <italic>ex vivo</italic> cultures of e11.0 intestines from littermate control (TashT<sup>Tg/+)</sup> and mutant (TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup>) embryos (Figs. <xref rid="pgen.1005093.g002" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1005093.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> and S1&#x02013;S2 Videos). It is noteworthy that TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> intestines were selected for these analyses on the basis of the severity of their colonization defect in order to increase the odds of detecting differences between control and mutant eNCC. Using these conditions, we found that the average migration speed, and therefore travel distance, is almost halved in TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> leader eNCC while directionality of migration is not noticeably affected (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Given the selection bias towards more affected embryos, it is important to bear in mind that this severe effect is most likely not representative of the true average migration speed of mutant eNCC. It should also be noted that the small difference in eNCC location along the intestines&#x02014;before cecum (TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup>) vs entry of cecum (TashT<sup>Tg/+</sup>)&#x02014;cannot account for the observed difference in speed since the eNCC migration front normally displays a fairly stable net speed of ~35 micron/hour (~0.58 micron/min) between e10.5 and e12.5 [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Migration of eNCC is dependent on multiple signaling pathways among which GDNF/RET and EDN3/EDNRB are recognized as the most critical regulators [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To evaluate the status of these signaling pathways in TashT embryos, we made use of a recently described quantitative migration assay using e12.5 midgut explants [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. With control TashT<sup>Tg/+</sup> or G4-GFP tissues, collagen gels containing either GDNF or EDN3 increased the number of cells coming out of the explants (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Interestingly, when these ligands were used in combination, a synergistic increase in eNCC numbers invading the collagen was observed. However, little reaction to these extracellular ligands was detected in eNCC derived from TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> embryos (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). In fact, eNCC from homozygous embryos migrated out of intestinal explants even in the absence of exogenous ligands, suggesting they lost some sensitivity to their endogenous microenvironment and distinguished poorly between intestinal tissue and collagen gel.</p><p>Premature differentiation or a scarcity of progenitor cells can disturb eNCC colonization and lead to incomplete ENS formation [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To verify whether these processes might contribute to the TashT phenotype, we performed a detailed marker analysis of embryonic intestines in order to quantify neuronal and glial differentiation as well as proliferation and cell death of eNCC. Quantification of proliferation and cell death in e12.5 stage-matched bowel tissues failed to reveal any significant difference between TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> and control TashT<sup>Tg/+</sup> embryos (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). Assessment of neuronal differentiation at the same stage also failed to reveal any significant difference (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>a-<xref rid="pgen.1005093.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6b Fig</xref>). On the other hand, glial differentiation at e15.5 was found to be less prevalent in TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> distal bowel tissues, to the benefit of undifferentiated progenitors (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>c-<xref rid="pgen.1005093.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6d Fig</xref>). This, however, is most likely a consequence of the delay in rostro-caudal colonization, and goes contrary to the idea that premature differentiation is the cause of the TashT migration defect. Taken together, these results thus highlight the eNCC migration defect (concomitant with insensitivity towards GDNF and EDN3) as the principal cause of the TashT aganglionosis phenotype. Moreover, since no clear sex bias was observed in these analyses, the relatively modest male bias in phenotype severity is most likely the result of an accumulation of subtle differences during the whole ENS developmental time window.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>The TashT transgenic insertion disrupts evolutionarily conserved regions possessing silencer activity</title><p>Breeding of the TashT line revealed systematic co-segregation of pigmentation with YFP fluorescence, meaning co-integration of both transgenes into a single autosomal locus which is frequent when an equimolar mixture of each transgene is micro-injected [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

Transcriptional activity was then assessed in various cell lines (Neuro-2a, P19, Cos7 and NIH 3T3) via luciferase assays (Figs. <xref rid="pgen.1005093.g003" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005093.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>). Overall, this analysis revealed very strong repression activity in a cell type-independent manner for two of the cloned regions (CE5 and 6) (Figs. <xref rid="pgen.1005093.g003" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005093.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>).

This stage was chosen because it combines ease of intestine dissection with clear presence of the eNCC colonization defect in TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> tissues. It is also important to note that this analysis was restricted to anterior intestinal tissues only (prospective oesophagus, stomach and small intestine) because endogenous YFP labelling in the TashT line is strictly specific to eNCC in these regions (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1b Fig</xref>).

Each of these 229 genes was manually assigned to a category based on function and/or localization of their gene product. Assembling these categories in &#x0201c;super-categories&#x0201d; reveals that TashT affected genes are mostly involved in the control of cell signaling (categories: Ligand-receptor and Signal transduction) and gene expression (category: Transcription factor) as well as in the composition of, and interaction with, the cell microenvironment (categories: Extracellular matrix, Cell adhesion as well as Channel and transmembrane transport). Especially notable examples within each of these super-categories include, respectively, genes encoding Gdnf and Edn3 ligands, many Hox transcription factors as well as various Collagen members. Another category worth mentioning is the Metabolic pathway which notably contains many players of retinoid signaling (Aldh1a1, Aldh1a2, Aldh1a7 and Rdh10).

In contrast to littermate controls for which bowel tissues were fully colonized, all three transgenic embryos displayed incomplete colonization of the distal hindgut by vagal-derived eNCC and, as a result, this region was found to only contain scattered Sox10-positive eNCC of presumably sacral origin in a way similar to what is observed in TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> tissues (compare <xref rid="pgen.1005093.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref> with <xref rid="pgen.1005093.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). In addition to having used a different genetic background for these experiments (B6C3), we believe that the fact that all <italic>Fam162b</italic> overexpressers were female likely explains, at least in part, the more modest effect observed in comparison to TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> embryos. Although we cannot currently exclude the possibility that other gene(s) might also be primary target(s) of the TashT mutation and might thus also contribute to the TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> phenotype, these transgenesis data support a role for <italic>Fam162b</italic> overexpression in TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> pathogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec008"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have identified and characterized a novel mouse model for aganglionic megacolon, called TashT, allowing us to describe the eNCC transcriptome during development and to propose two novel genetic loci implicated in the pathogenesis of megacolon&#x02014;one that is protein coding, the other involving evolutionary conserved non-coding sequences&#x02014;as well as an ultra-long-range interaction between these loci.

In addition to analyzing eNCC directly, we took full advantage of the RNAseq technology and included non-coding RNA in our analyses. This resulted in a much more extensive list of genes known to be expressed in eNCC, from a few hundred to several thousand (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005093.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Datasets).</p><p>Importantly, the transcriptional signature of TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> eNCC not only highlighted <italic>Fam162b</italic> as a potential causative gene, but also provided mechanistic insights into the identified cell migration defect. In this regard, it is noteworthy that several modulated transcripts in TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> eNCC encode components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005093.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10c Fig</xref>). NCC have been suggested to modify their extracellular environment during, or perhaps as a requirement for, migration [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. One possibility is thus that the modulated ECM in TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> embryonic intestines is less permissive to cell migration [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Another, not mutually exclusive possibility is that the reduced sensitivity of TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> eNCC to growth factors/chemoattractants normally present in the intestinal ECM underlies the migration defect. In agreement with this, we have found that TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> eNCC have lost their ability to respond to exogenous GDNF and EDN3 in explant assays, with eNCC appearing unable to distinguish between bowel tissue and collagen gel (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). This latter outcome is most likely due to the surprising robust overexpression of both <italic>Gdnf</italic> and <italic>Edn3</italic> by TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> eNCC (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005093.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10a Fig</xref>). Indeed, given that Gdnf and Edn3 are both normally heavily secreted from the surrounding mesenchyme, additional oversecretion from eNCC is expected to disturb the dosage of ligands these cells normally encounter and/or to disrupt any gradient that might be present. Our RNAseq data also suggest that the lack of responsiveness to GDNF and EDN3 might be due to an overabundance-induced negative feedback on their cognate receptor. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that expression of both <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Ednrb</italic> is reduced in TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> eNCC (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005093.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10a Fig</xref>). Interestingly, in the case of Gdnf/Ret signaling, this hypothesis is further supported by the observed overexpression of <italic>Lrig1</italic> and <italic>Lrig3</italic> in TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> eNCC (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Dataset</xref>). These genes encode functionally-redundant transmembrane proteins [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] which, as specifically demonstrated for Lrig1 in neuronal cells, can be induced by Gdnf at the transcriptional level and then physically interact with Ret in order to reduce Gdnf binding and tyrosine kinase activity [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Regardless of the exact underlying mechanism, a lack of responsiveness to EDN3 might well be responsible for the slower migration of TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> eNCC (Figs<xref rid="pgen.1005093.g002" ref-type="fig">2b-c</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005093.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>), as inhibition of Ednrb signaling has been recently shown to primarily affect the speed of eNCC migration [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Long-range repression of Fam162b expression</title><p>Most of the known and characterized long-range acting regulatory elements do not interact with their nearest promoter but bypass several intervening genes in order to reach their target promoter [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Long-range enhancer-promoter interactions are also thought to be more commonly involved in the regulation of tissue-specific genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, most studies of intra-chromosomal long-range interactions involve loci up to several hundred kb away from each other, though ultra-long-range events (several Mb) between enhancer and promoter are not uncommon [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our 3C data are in accordance with these observations and indicate that the interaction between the conserved elements near the TashT transgene insertion site and the <italic>Fam162b</italic> gene ~3.6 Mb away (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) falls in the ultra-long-range category. Little is known of the spatiotemporal pattern of <italic>Fam162b</italic> expression. The evidence to date is in agreement with an expression in neural derivatives: it is weakly expressed in the mouse olfactory bulb (Allen Brain Atlas, RP_051012_01_G06) and expressed in the frontonasal prominence of mouse embryos, proximal to the oral cavity [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]&#x02014;a tissue heavily populated by cranial NCC.

Given the forced juxtaposition of regulatory elements with the proximal promoter in such assays, the absence of a cell type-specific activity in our analysis thus points to a chromatin conformation-dependent mechanism conferring specificity <italic>in vivo</italic>. As supported by our 3C data (<xref rid="pgen.1005093.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), we suggest that an ultra-long-range chromatin loop maintains <italic>Fam162b</italic> expression at a basal level in a subset of neural-derived cells, including eNCC. Further investigations into the regulation of <italic>Fam162b</italic> expression will be necessary to confirm and expand this hypothesis. The biological function of the <italic>Fam162b</italic> gene product is also currently unknown.

This critical region (~80% of colon length; <xref rid="pgen.1005093.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>) represents a threshold level beneath which intestinal blockage occurs systematically, and in a sex-independent manner. The fact that the mean length of the ganglionated region of TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> males ends in this critical region while females typically show a more extensive ENS explains the apparent contradiction between the male bias in megacolon expressivity and the near complete penetrance of distal aganglionosis in both sexes. A common defect of eNCC colonization, slightly exaggerated in males, is thus the source of the observed sex bias of the megacolon phenotype in TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> animals. In this regard, it is noteworthy that a similar link between extent of aganglionosis and megacolon expressivity has been previously described in mice bearing the <italic>Ednrb</italic>

Interestingly, although only a very modest male sex bias in megacolon expressivity was reported in this latter case (~1.5:1), the correlations made with extent of aganglionosis are in agreement with the threshold level revealed by our study. Indeed, full penetrance of megacolon in <italic>Ret</italic>

However, as evidenced by the fact that <italic>Sox10Dom</italic> mutants on a C57BL/6J&#x02014;C3HeB/FeJ mixed background display a shorter aganglionic zone leading to megacolon (~10%), it should also be noted that position of the threshold level may vary as a function of the genetic background [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>The aganglionic megacolon of TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> animals share striking similarities with both the variable penetrance and male sex bias of short-segment HSCR, the most common form of the disease (~80% of cases). The threshold level identified with the TashT line is also in accordance with the fact that virtually no sex bias is observed in long-segment HSCR. Our analysis of the TashT line thus provides useful insights into the ontogeny of aganglionic colon and the origin of the sex bias, and shows that, though perhaps suffering from chronic constipation, TashT<sup>Tg/Tg</sup> mice are nevertheless able to pass intestinal material when more than 4/5 of their colon is innervated.</p><p>Apart from <italic>Ret</italic>

We reasoned that exaggerated defects in males could arise from overexpression of male-specific genetic material (upregulated genes on Y chromosome) or from a deficiency in the expression of genes present as single alleles (downregulated genes on X chromosome). Another interpretation of this second possibility is that females are protected through biallelic expression of some X chromosome genes, provided they escape X-inactivation [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

The abdomen of TashT e11.0 embryos was opened and the surrounding tissues trimmed just enough to expose the developing intestine. The embryo was placed on a small nitrocellulose filter (Millipore GSWP01300) soaked in PBS, and the extra tissues surrounding the intestine were slightly pressed onto the membrane. The PBS was then blotted off before being replaced with DMEM/F12 media (containing 10% FBS and antibiotics). The filter was flipped on top of a DMEM/F12-filled 2 mm-wide trough in a 1% agarose film covering the round glass bottom of a 35 mm culture dish (Greiner Bio One 627860), so that the intestine would float in media without touching either the agarose or the glass.

Five to 6 chain tip cells were tracked from at least 3 intestines of each genotype. Speed and directionality were calculated from this dataset, with the orientation of the mesentery as a reference angle. We cannot totally exclude the possibility that more than one cell was included per chain tip measurement as individual eNCC at the wavefront sometimes exchange places with one another by a leapfrogging process [<xref rid="pgen.1005093.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Ex vivo eNCC migration assays</title><p>
