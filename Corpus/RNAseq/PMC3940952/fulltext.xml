Genes of the cellulose synthase-like (<italic>Csl</italic>) F gene family have been shown to be involved in (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan synthesis but many aspects of the biosynthesis are still unclear. Examination of the sequence assembly of the barley genome has revealed the presence of an additional three <italic>HvCslF</italic> genes (<italic>HvCslF11</italic>, <italic>HvCslF12</italic> and <italic>HvCslF13</italic>) which may be involved in (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan synthesis. Transcripts of <italic>HvCslF11</italic> and <italic>HvCslF12</italic> mRNA were found in roots and young leaves, respectively. Transient expression of these genes in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> resulted in phenotypic changes in the infiltrated leaves, although no authentic (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan was detected. Comparisons of the <italic>CslF</italic> gene families in cereals revealed evidence of intergenic recombination, gene duplications and translocation events. This significant divergence within the gene family might be related to multiple functions of (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucans in the Poaceae. Emerging genomic and global expression data for barley and other cereals is a powerful resource for characterising the evolution and dynamics of complete gene families. In the case of the <italic>CslF</italic> gene family, the results will contribute to a more thorough understanding of carbohydrate metabolism in grass cell walls.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by The Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division (RESAS) through a Strategic Partnership for Food and Drink Science (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk">http://www.scotland.gov.uk</ext-link>) and by the Australian Research Council (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arc.gov.au/">http://www.arc.gov.au/</ext-link>) Centre of Excellence in Plant Cell Wall Biology.

In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved health-related claims stating that the intake of 3 grams of soluble &#x003b2;-glucan (from oat or barley) per day helps to effectively lower blood total and LDL cholesterol <xref rid="pone.0090888-Food1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090888-Food2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan functions as soluble dietary fibre and has additional health benefits in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), type II diabetes and colorectal cancer <xref rid="pone.0090888-Food1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090888-Food2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In the gastrointestinal tract, (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan is believed to form a gel matrix that increases bile acid excretion and delays glucose absorption into the blood, thus lowering insulin levels. The health properties of (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan are thus dependent on its molecular weight (MW) and solubility <xref rid="pone.0090888-Brennan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, in the brewing and distilling industries, high levels of (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan are undesirable, causing problems with filtration and decreasing processability. Similarly, (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucans are classified as anti-nutrients in animal feed formulations, where they reduce growth rates of monogastric animals <xref rid="pone.0090888-Annison1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Although commonly found in walls of the graminaceous monocotyledons, (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan is generally absent from dicotyledon cell walls. The polymer is a major constituent of the primary cell wall and more minor component of secondary cell walls in most members of the Poaceae, including the common cereals wheat, barley and oat <xref rid="pone.0090888-Burton1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In seeds, (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan may play a role in energy storage and it is believed to have a growth-related function in vegetative tissues, although significant levels of (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan also occur in mature tissues of rice and some other grasses <xref rid="pone.0090888-VegaSanchez1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The first functional identification of a gene capable of synthesising (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan came from Burton et al. <xref rid="pone.0090888-Burton2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> who transformed the dicot <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> with a cellulose synthase-like <italic>CslF2</italic> gene from rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) and demonstrated the subsequent presence of a small amount of (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan in the dicot cell walls. In 2009, Doblin et al. introduced a <italic>CslH</italic> gene from barley into Arabidopsis and this gene also promoted synthesis of detectable amounts of (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan; thus it appears that two different gene families could be involved in the synthesis of the polymer. To date, involvement in (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan synthesis has been demonstrated for the barley proteins CslF4, CslF6 and CslH <xref rid="pone.0090888-Burton3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090888-Doblin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The <italic>CslF</italic> and <italic>CslH</italic> genes are members of the superfamily of cellulose synthases (<italic>CesA</italic> genes) and cellulose synthase-like (<italic>Csl</italic>) genes <xref rid="pone.0090888-Doblin2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Further investigations of (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan synthesis and the <italic>CslH1</italic> gene showed that the enzyme, but not the (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan, could be detected in the Golgi apparatus by antibodies. The (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan can only be detected outside the plasma membrane. The hypothesis is that a modification occurs at the plasma membrane, making polymer epitopes accessible to the antibody <xref rid="pone.0090888-Burton2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090888-Doblin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090888-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Given the emerging importance of the (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan polymer for both human health and industry, it is of interest to understand which of the <italic>Csl</italic> genes have the potential to direct (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan synthesis, where and when they mediate it, and how the polysaccharide is used by the plant during different phases of its life cycle. In this paper we use the new barley genome assembly <xref rid="pone.0090888-IBGSC1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> to re-examine the composition and dynamics of the <italic>HvCslF</italic> gene family from barley, and also perform an initial analysis of the gene family in wheat. Our results provide a platform for understanding the different roles <italic>HvCslF</italic> genes may play in barley growth, development and interaction with its environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification and mapping of barley <italic>CslF</italic> genes including three previously undescribed genes</title><p>Sequences for the seven known barley <italic>CslF</italic> family genes were collected from GenBank (i.e. <italic>HvCslF3</italic>, <italic>HvCslF4</italic>, <italic>HvCslF6</italic>, <italic>HvCslF7</italic>, <italic>HvCslF8</italic>, <italic>HvCslF9</italic>, and <italic>HvCslF10</italic>). These seven genes, along with mutant versions of <italic>CslF6</italic>, are the only barley <italic>CslF</italic> sequences currently listed on the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cazy.org">www.cazy.org</ext-link>). A BLAST search of the newly available barley cv.

The <italic>CslF</italic> family members are named after their homologs in rice, starting with <italic>HvCslF3</italic> as there are no homologous sequences in barley to <italic>OsCslF1</italic> and <italic>OsCslF2</italic>. <italic>OsCslF5</italic> is thought to be a pseudogene and there are no homologs in barley. An additional <italic>CslF</italic> gene was previously found in barley compared to rice and named <italic>HvCslF10</italic><xref rid="pone.0090888-Burton4" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In keeping with this scheme, the three new sequences described here were named <italic>HvCslF11</italic>, <italic>HvCslF12</italic> and <italic>HvCslF13</italic>. A phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090888-g001">Figure 1</xref>) clearly shows that <italic>HvCslF11</italic> and <italic>HvCslF13</italic> are most closely related to <italic>HvCslF4,</italic> while <italic>HvCslF12</italic> is most closely related to <italic>HvCslF9</italic>. The genetic location of all ten barley <italic>CslF</italic> genes was determined from the barley genome assembly <xref rid="pone.0090888-IBGSC1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The <italic>HvCslF9</italic> gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 1H, <italic>HvCslF7</italic> is located on the long arm of chromosome 5H and <italic>HvCslF6</italic> is located on the long arm of chromosome 7H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090888-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The other members, <italic>HvCslF3</italic>, <italic>HvCslF4</italic>, <italic>HvCslF8</italic> and <italic>HvCslF10</italic>, are localized in a cluster on chromosome 2H near the centromeric region. Of the three new sequences, <italic>HvCslF12</italic> is also located in this cluster on the short arm of chromosome 2H and <italic>HvCslF11</italic> is on the long arm of chromosome 7H.

The full but shorter HvCslF13 protein sequence of 703 amino acids could only be inferred by reference to the cv. Bowman <xref rid="pone.0090888-IBGSC1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> since the cv. Morex sequence contained premature stop codons. All three enzymes have the characteristic glycosyltransferase motif D, D, D, QxxRW and therefore belong to the GT2 family of glycosyltransferases <xref rid="pone.0090888-Coutinho1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. For all HvCslF family members except HvCslF13, eight trans-membrane helices have been predicted, two near the 5&#x02019; end and six near the 3&#x02019; end, placing the 5&#x02019; end and catalytic motif putatively in the cytosol. An early stop codon in the cv. Bowman <italic>HvCslF13</italic> gene leads to only three trans-membrane helices at the 3&#x02019; end; <italic>HvCslF13</italic> is therefore potentially a pseudogene. With the exception of <italic>HvCslF7</italic> and <italic>HvCslF12</italic>, which have a single intron, all other <italic>CslFs</italic> have two introns which vary from 132 to over 5500 base pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090888-g003">Figure 3</xref>). A closer look at the catalytic motif shows a strongly conserved region. The HvCslF3 and HvCslF10 enzymes have a QIVRW motif, while HvCslF8, HvCslF9 and the newly identified HvCslF12 share a QILRW motif. HvCslF4, HvCslF6, HvCslF7 and the two &#x02018;new&#x02019; HvCslF11 and HvCslF13 enzymes have a QVLRW motif. This could be of importance because demonstration of (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan synthesis activity has so far been restricted to HvCslF4 and HvCslF6 <xref rid="pone.0090888-Burton3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090888-Doblin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> i.e. the genes with the QVLRW motif.

Knowing what genes are involved in (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan synthesis and breakdown, and when and where they are switched on or off is therefore important to understanding these contrasting features. The discovery of three &#x02018;new&#x02019; <italic>HvCslF</italic> genes in barley is relevant to ongoing studies of the dynamics of cell wall synthesis in the grasses. Our data are consistent with <italic>HvCslF13</italic> being either non-functional or a pseudogene. However, all three newly discovered <italic>HvCslFs</italic> possess the important glycosyltransferase GT2-motif, and <italic>HvCslF11</italic> and <italic>HvCslF12</italic> are expressed, albeit restricted to root and leaf respectively. These data suggests that <italic>HvCslF11</italic> and <italic>HvCslF12</italic> could play a role in (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan biosynthesis in roots or leaves but their role, if any, in grain tissues would likely be minor. Transient expression of <italic>HvCslF11</italic> and <italic>HvCslF12</italic> in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> revealed no evidence for authentic (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan biosynthesis. Nevertheless, a shrivelled necrotic phenotype was observed that was not due to infiltration damage. The HPAEC profiles suggested that some new molecules were being produced, but they could not be identified. It is possible that the expressed genes are producing some unusual polysaccharide product and that this is causing the phenotype. The <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> transient system has been moderately successful for testing (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan synthase activity, producing small amounts of the polymer on expression of <italic>HvCslF4</italic>, <italic>HvCslF6</italic> or <italic>HvCslH</italic> [Little A, Burton RA, Fincher GB, unpublished observation]. It may be that other components that are necessary for efficient (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan synthesis are missing in the dicot cells and remain to be identified. Consequently, the fact that <italic>HvCslF11</italic> and <italic>HvCslF12</italic> cannot synthesize (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan on their own in dicot cells does not exclude them from being involved in (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan synthesis in barley.</p><p>The first connection between grain (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan content and the <italic>CslF</italic> genes emerged from a genetic study on QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) that affect grain (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan content <xref rid="pone.0090888-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. While this study identified four QTL, Burton et al. <xref rid="pone.0090888-Burton2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> used conservation of synteny around the major QTL on chromosome 2H to identify the orthologous cluster of <italic>CslF</italic> genes on rice chromosome Os07. They then showed using stable expression that two genes in the cluster, <italic>OsCslF2</italic> and <italic>OsCslF4</italic>, were able to synthesise (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan in Arabidopsis. An intriguing observation about these QTL studies is that the genetic analyses of <xref rid="pone.0090888-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> used a population derived from a cross between the barley cultivars Steptoe and Morex. The expression studies we report here used RNA-seq. data from the cv. Morex. Importantly in our datasets, none of the 2H <italic>CslF</italic> cluster genes are expressed in the developing grain suggesting they may not be involved in synthesising grain (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan. This conclusion is supported by observations that when <italic>CslF6</italic> on chromosome 7H is mutated, no detectable (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan is found in the leaf or in the grain <xref rid="pone.0090888-Taketa1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, indicating <italic>CslF6</italic> as a major gene responsible for grain (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan biosynthesis. However, this apparent absence of (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan in the <italic>HvCslF6</italic> mutant must be reconciled with our observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090888-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and those of Burton et al. <xref rid="pone.0090888-Burton4" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, that transcripts of both <italic>HvCslF9</italic> and <italic>HvCslF8</italic> are present in developing grain, albeit at lower levels than <italic>HvCslF6</italic> transcripts. The <italic>HvCslF8</italic> gene is a member of the cluster on chromosome 2H. Furthermore, our transcript profiles here are limited to 15 days post pollination, and we have found in other studies that <italic>HvCslF</italic> gene transcription can be initiated as late as 30-35 days post pollination [Wong SC, Mather DE, Burton RA, Fincher GB, unpublished observation]. At this stage, the level of involvement of the <italic>HvCslF</italic> genes in the chromosome 2H cluster in (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan synthesis remains unclear. Similarly, the final levels of (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan in mature barley grain may also be controlled by (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan endohydrolases for which high levels of gene transcripts are sometimes detectable in developing grain <xref rid="pone.0090888-Burton4" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>The solubility of (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan is believed to be affected by changes in the DP3:DP4 ratio which could influence other (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan properties. <italic>HvCslF6</italic> and <italic>HvCslF4</italic> have been shown to alter the DP3:DP4 ratio when overexpressed in barley <xref rid="pone.0090888-Burton3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. <italic>HvCslF11</italic> is very closely related to <italic>HvCslF4</italic> and therefore could have an influence on (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan characteristics of roots, where <italic>HvCslF11</italic> is specifically expressed.

Originating from a common ancestor, sorghum was the first to diverge, followed by rice and then Brachypodium <xref rid="pone.0090888-Doust1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Sorghum has <italic>SbCslF7</italic> (Sb01g021420) on chromosome Sb01, <italic>SbCslF6</italic> (Sb07g004110<bold>)</bold> on chromosome Sb07 and a cluster of <italic>CslFs</italic> on chromosome Sb02. These genes exhibit conserved synteny with their likely orthologs in rice, but different duplication events characterise the cluster. The sequence from <italic>SbCslF3</italic> (Sb02g035990<bold>)</bold> is duplicated twice (Sb02g036010, Sb02g036000<bold>)</bold> and there is a recombination event between two sequences (Sb02g022011, Sb02g036030<bold>)</bold> which are assigned to the <italic>SbCslF10</italic> clade. One of these sequences (Sb02g022011<bold>)</bold> appears to have been translocated to a more distal position, further from the centromere, on the chromosome Sb02 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090888-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Rice has one cluster of <italic>CslF</italic>s on chromosome Os07, and two outliers with <italic>OsCslF6</italic> (Os08g06380<bold>)</bold> on chromosome Os08 and <italic>OsCslF7</italic> (Os10g20260<bold>)</bold> on chromosome Os10. Based on homology one would expect to find <italic>HvCslF9</italic>, <italic>HvCslF11</italic> and <italic>HvCslF13</italic> as part of the cluster of genes located on barley chromosome 2H, instead of chromosomes 1H, 7H and 2H respectively. The <italic>HvCslF11</italic> and <italic>HvCslF13</italic> genes appear to have resulted from duplication followed by translocation. The wheat homologs of <italic>HvCslF9</italic>, <italic>HvCslF11</italic> and <italic>HvCslF13</italic> are present in all three genomes on chromosomes 1ABD, 7ABD and 2ABD, but they are not found in Brachypodium. The duplication and translocation must therefore have happened after the separation from Brachypodium. Wheat also appears to have duplicated a gene closely related to <italic>CslF13</italic> and <italic>CslF11</italic> after the separation from barley (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090888-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Brachypodium shows a different pattern with the cluster on chromosome Bd01, and <italic>BdCslF6</italic> (Bradi3g16307<bold>)</bold> on chromosome Bd03, while <italic>BdCslF7</italic> is lost. <italic>BdCslF9</italic> (Bradi3g45515<bold>)</bold> in Brachypodium is an outlier as in barley, but synteny is not conserved with either rice or barley. The different composition of the <italic>CslF</italic> genes, their locations in the different grass species and patterns of gene expression could help us understand how they evolved and how they influence (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan content and function at different times and in different tissues in related species. Why, for example does rice have little or no (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan in the grain, whereas the (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan content in Brachypodium grain is up to 40% w/w and barley shows a moderate amount of (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan with 4-10% w/w <xref rid="pone.0090888-Burton1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090888-Guillon1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>? Is this due to selection for starchy grains during domestication? It is clear that the (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan in the grain of Brachypodium largely replaces starch as the primary storage carbohydrate, consistent with suggestions that (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-glucan acts as an alternative source of metabolizable glucose in leaves of young barley seedlings <xref rid="pone.0090888-Roulin1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.

The following primer pairs were used: HvCslF11_F - <named-content content-type="gene">AGCCACGGTTTACAGTACGA</named-content>; HvCslF11_R - <named-content content-type="gene">ACTACGTACGTGTCTATCCAGA</named-content>; HvCslF12_F - <named-content content-type="gene">GAAGAGCCAATGGTTTCGC</named-content>; HvCslF12_R - <named-content content-type="gene">CCAGAGAAACGGCATCATCC</named-content>. The genes were cloned into the Gateway entry vector pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and sequenced on an ABI 3700 (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) at the Australian Genome Research Facility, Adelaide, Australia, to eliminate constructs with errors. In a LR recombination reaction the inserts were transferred into the Gateway destination vector pEAQ-HT-Dest1 under the control of a CaMW 35S promoter <xref rid="pone.0090888-Sainsbury1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. As a positive control HvCslF6 was included and as a negative control the vector pEAQ-HT-Dest1 without the chloramphenicol resistance gene and ccdB gene was used. The constructs were transformed into the <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> strain AGL1 and left to grow overnight at 28&#x000b0;C in LB medium containing rifampicin and kanamycin. 2 mL of the overnight culture were spread on a LB plate and grown for 2 days at 28&#x000b0;C. 10 mL of an infiltration buffer (10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM MES (2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid)) were added per plate and cells scraped off the surface. OD<sub>600</sub> was measured and adjusted to an infiltration OD of 1. 1 &#x000b5;L of 100 mM Acetosyringone was added per mL and left for 3 hours at room temperature. <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> seedlings were grown under glasshouse conditions, 22&#x000b0;C with natural light, in the Plant Accelerator (University of Adelaide). Whole leaves of 4 week old <italic>Nictotiana benthamiana</italic> plants were infiltrated from the underside using a 10 mL syringe without a needle. Leaves were harvested after 6 days, freeze-dried and ground using a ball bearing mill. Analysis of (1,3;1,4)-&#x003b2;-D-glucan was performed using 20 mg of ground tissue following the commercially available reagents (Megazyme International Ireland Ltd, Bray, Ireland) and a protocol based on <xref rid="pone.0090888-McCleary1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Method modifications include two washes of 50% ethanol and two washes of 100% ethanol for 10 minutes at 97&#x000b0;C, followed by a 20 minute extraction at 90&#x000b0;C in 1 ml 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) and a 1.5 hour incubation at 50&#x000b0;C with 40 &#x000b5;L U/ml Lichenase. Total beta glucan levels within the samples were analysed using the glucose oxidase-peroxidase reagent supplied with the kit.
