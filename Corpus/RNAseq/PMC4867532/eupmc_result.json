    "Sporisorium scitamineum causes the sugarcane smut disease, one of the most serious constraints to global sugarcane production. S. scitamineum possesses a sexual mating system composed of two mating-type loci, a and b locus. We previously identified and deleted the b locus in S. scitamineum, and found that the resultant SsΔMAT-1b mutant was defective in mating and pathogenicity.To further understand the function of b-mating locus, we carried out transcriptome analysis by comparing the transcripts of the mutant strain SsΔMAT-1b, from which the SsbE1 and SsbW1 homeodomain transcription factors have previously been deleted, with those from the wild-type MAT-1 strain. Also the transcripts from SsΔMAT-1b X MAT-2 were compared with those from wild-type MAT-1 X MAT-2 mating. A total of 209 genes were up-regulated (p < 0.05) in the SsΔMAT-1b mutant, compared to the wild-type MAT-1 strain, while 148 genes down-regulated (p < 0.05). In the mixture, 120 genes were up-regulated (p < 0.05) in SsΔMAT-1b X MAT-2, which failed to mate, compared to the wild-type MAT-1 X MAT-2 mating, and 271 genes down-regulated (p < 0.05). By comparing the up- and down-regulated genes in these two sets, it was found that 15 up-regulated and 37 down-regulated genes were common in non-mating haploid and mating mixture, which indeed could be genes regulated by b-locus. Furthermore, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that carbon metabolism pathway and stress response mediated by Hog1 MAPK signaling pathway were altered in the non-mating sets.Experimental validation results indicate that the bE/bW heterodimeric transcriptional factor, encoded by the b-locus, could regulate S. scitamineum sexual mating and/or filamentous growth via modulating glucose metabolism and Hog1-mediating oxidative response."
