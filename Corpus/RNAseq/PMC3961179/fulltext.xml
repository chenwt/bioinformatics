Analyzing blood cell transcripts by RNA-Seq is a robust means to identify novel biomarkers that rapidly becomes a commonplace. However, there is lack of tools to discover novel exons, junctions and splicing events and to precisely and sensitively assess differential splicing through RNA-Seq data analysis and across RNA-Seq platforms. Here, we present a new and comprehensive computational workflow for whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq analysis, using an updated version of the software AltAnalyze, to identify both known and novel high-confidence alternative splicing events, and to integrate them with both protein-domains and microRNA binding annotations. We applied the novel workflow on RNA-Seq data from Parkinson's disease (PD) patients' leukocytes pre- and post- Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) treatment and compared to healthy controls. Disease-mediated changes included decreased usage of alternative promoters and N-termini, 5&#x02032;-end variations and mutually-exclusive exons. The PD regulated FUS and HNRNP A/B included prion-like domains regulated regions. We also present here a workflow to identify and analyze long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) via RNA-Seq data. We identified reduced lncRNA expression and selective PD-induced changes in 13 of over 6,000 detected leukocyte lncRNAs, four of which were inversely altered post-DBS. These included the U1 spliceosomal lncRNA and RP11-462G22.1, each entailing sequence complementarity to numerous microRNAs. Analysis of RNA-Seq from PD and unaffected controls brains revealed over 7,000 brain-expressed lncRNAs, of which 3,495 were co-expressed in the leukocytes including U1, which showed both leukocyte and brain increases. Furthermore, qRT-PCR validations confirmed these co-increases in PD leukocytes and two brain regions, the amygdala and substantia-nigra, compared to controls. This novel workflow allows deep multi-level inspection of RNA-Seq datasets and provides a comprehensive new resource for understanding disease transcriptome modifications in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a novel, fascinating class of RNAs with largely unknown biological functions. Parkinson's-disease (PD) is the most frequent motor disorder, and Deep-brain-stimulation (DBS) treatment alleviates the symptoms, but early disease biomarkers are still unknown and new future genetic interference targets are urgently needed. Using RNA-sequencing technology and a novel computational workflow for in-depth exploration of whole-transcriptome RNA-seq datasets, we detected and analyzed lncRNAs in sequenced libraries from PD patients' leukocytes pre and post-treatment and the brain, adding this full profile resource of over 7,000 lncRNAs to the few human tissues-derived lncRNA datasets that are currently available. Our study includes sample-specific database construction, detecting disease-derived changes in known and novel lncRNAs, exons and junctions and predicting corresponding changes in Polyadenylation choices, protein domains and miRNA binding sites. We report widespread transcript structure variations at the splice junction and exons levels, including novel exons and junctions and alteration of lncRNAs followed by experimental validation in PD leukocytes and two PD brain regions compared with controls. Our results suggest lncRNAs involvement in neurodegenerative diseases, and specifically PD. This comprehensive workflow will be of use to the increasing number of laboratories producing RNA-Seq data in a wide range of biomedical studies.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Israeli Chief Scientist (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.matimop.org.il/ocs.html">http://www.matimop.org.il/ocs.html</ext-link>) to HB, the Thyssen Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fritz-thyssen-stiftung.de/?L=1">http://www.fritz-thyssen-stiftung.de/?L=1</ext-link>) and an Infrastructure Award of the Israeli Ministry of Science (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://most.gov.il/english/research/Pages/default.aspx">http://most.gov.il/english/research/Pages/default.aspx</ext-link>) to HS and HB, ELSC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elsc.huji.ac.il/">http://elsc.huji.ac.il/</ext-link>) and the Rosetrees foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rosetreestrust.co.uk/">http://www.rosetreestrust.co.uk/</ext-link>) to HS and the European Network of excellence on alternative splicing (EURASNET, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eurasnet.info/">http://www.eurasnet.info/</ext-link>, LSH-2004-1.1.5-3) to HS, the Edmond and Lilly Safra Center for Brain Sciences (ELSC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elsc.huji.ac.il/">http://elsc.huji.ac.il/</ext-link>) to HS and HB.

<xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Guenzl1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. LncRNAs are currently defined as transcripts of over 200 nucleotides <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Nonetheless, the GENCODE non-coding RNA set, the largest currently lncRNA database, contains currently as much as 136 spliced transcript shorter than 200 bp, and the general and structural annotation of lncRNA overall is still ongoing <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Harrow1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. LncRNAs may contain open reading frames (ORF), and are often transcribed by RNA polymerase II, spliced and polyadenylated &#x02013; but do not code for any protein product. LncRNAs are the least well studied among thousands non-coding eukaryotic RNAs that have been discovered so far. While genome-wide expression and evolutionary analyses suggest that some of them play functional roles, their cellular mechanisms of action are still largely unknown <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Guttman1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Nonetheless, accumulating evidence suggests that in the nervous system, lncRNA functions span regulating brain evolution and neural development <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Qureshi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and mediate behavioral and cognitive processes <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In Drosophila, the neuronal-expressed CRG lncRNA is involved in regulating locomotion by recruiting RNA polymerase II to the adjacent promoter of the movement-related protein-coding gene CASK, thereby increasing CASK expression <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In humans, lncRNAs are involved in neurogenesis, neuropsychiatric disorders <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, cancer (for example, HT19 which is involved in tumor growth) <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Matouk1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>) and in Autism <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Ziats1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> as well as in the neurodegenerative Huntington's <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and Alzheimer's (AD) diseases <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Holden1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, the involvement of lncRNAs in the leading neurodegenerative motor disorder worldwide, Parkinson's disease (PD), is still unknown.</p><p>PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide (after AD) <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Nussbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Dorsey1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, with age being the leading risk factor currently known and no known cure. It affects 1&#x02013;2% of the population above 65 years of age <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Allain1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-BenmoyalSegal1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Douglas1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and is characterized by four cardinal motor symptoms (resting tremor, bradykinesia (&#x0201c;slow movement&#x0201d;), postural instability and akinesia (&#x0201c;lack of movement&#x0201d;) <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Hoehn1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>
<xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Fahn1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. These appear when most of the brain's dopamine-producing neurons have already been diminished. Most cases are defined as &#x02018;sporadic&#x02019; and treatment is aimed at replacing lost DA through adjusting the declining levels of the precursor L-Dopa. The alternative, deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment allows a significant reduction in the medication dosage while drastically improving motor function in patients. DBS presumably alleviates the disease symptoms by targeting the basal ganglia Sub-Thalamic Nucleus (STN) brain region through yet undefined mechanisms <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Kringelbach1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>While the underlying aetiology of sporadic PD remained elusive, genomics studies have implicated several genes in the loss of DA neurons. Mutations in &#x003b1;-synuclein (SNCA), the first gene identified as linked to PD <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Polymeropoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, cause early-onset PD, and the SNCA protein product has been identified as a major component of Lewy bodies <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Baba1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, a morphological pathological hallmark of PD <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Gibb1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Mutations in the ubiquitin ligase Parkin (PARK2) that targets proteins for degradation in the proteasome through linkage of ubiquitin molecules cause DA neuron pathology <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Um1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and autosomal recessive Parkinsonism <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Kitada1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The DJ-1 (PARK7) protein regulates oxidation&#x02013;reduction signalling pathways via inducing gene expression <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Mullett1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, inhibiting the formation of SNCA aggregates <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Shendelman1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and limiting dopaminergic cell death in cellular and animal PD models <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Guzman1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Mutations in the putative serine threonine kinase LRRK2 (PARK8) cause uncoupling of mitochondria in fibroblast and neuroblastoma cells <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>; and the PTEN-induced protein kinase PINK1 (PARK6), mutations in which cause early-onset PD <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Hatano1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> is believed to be involved in mitophagy <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Grenier1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Taken together, these observations suggest that inherited, and possibly acquired impairments in the pathways regulating protein metabolism, oxidative stress and mitochondrial functioning are causally involved in PD emergence. Yet, current medications only improve the disease motor symptoms &#x02013; but do not provide a cure. Furthermore, identification of the disease in its early stages, before the majority of the dopaminergic neuron population have diminished, is currently impossible.</p><p>Transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood is of great interest for clinical research, as differences between samples obtained in a minimally invasive and cost-effective manner can be translated into gene signatures of disease, as well as disease stage, drug response and toxicity <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Blood cells interact with most tissues and organs in the human body and their cellular composition provides a reflection of both physiological and pathogenic stimuli, including brain treatment effects <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Furthermore, 80% of the genes expressed in peripheral blood cells are shared with other central tissues <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. While nucleated white blood cells make up the minority of blood cells, they are the most informative. Correspondingly, gene expression differences in peripheral whole blood have been used to determine gene signatures related to both acute myeloid leukemia <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and neuropsychiatric disorders and Huntington's disease, where significant correlation between blood and brain transcripts was identified <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Matouk1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Other neurological diseases for which peripheral blood-based biomarkers have been identified include multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Nickles1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-FehlbaumBeurdeley1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. These effects have been specifically attributed to neuronal death, neuronal cell-free RNA expression and well-described neuro-immune modulatory effects <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Nickles1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-FehlbaumBeurdeley1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Likewise, we have recently observed parallel changes in microRNAs (miRNAs) and genes predicted as their targets that further underwent splicing changes in PD leukocytes and in PD-relevant brain regions, including the substantia nigra (SN) as well as the frontal lobe) through coupled analysis of small RNA-Seq data and splice junction arrays <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. These spanned immune, mitochondrial and oxidative stress changes, supporting our microarray identification of interleukin-4 (IL4) related processes in whole blood data from a large early PD cohort <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq3" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Since the first report of miRNA involvement in PD <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, new findings provide ample evidence for involvement of differentially expressed miRNAs in the PD brain <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Mouradian1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>

<xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Doxakis1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In differential expression studies of PD patients' leukocytes, we found expression changes that were partially reversed following DBS treatment <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq4" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq5" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Parallel changes were also detected in both the frontal cortex and the caudate-putamen brain areas from PD model mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) neurotoxin. Thus, leukocyte datasets provide useful resource for identifying possible disease biomarkers (which are urgently needed for PD), and for studying PD-related processes in an easily accessible tissue. With the advent of current genomic technologies, new tools are required for linking between different datasets produced from various technologies including different types of microarrays, and RNA-Seq of both long and short molecules.</p><p>Other potentially involved regulators of other transcripts are microRNAs (miRNAs), &#x0223c;22 nucleotides small non-coding RNAs processed by Drosha and Dicer from larger pri-miRNA molecules (the initial miRNA transcript) and pre-miRNA (i.e the 65&#x02013;70 nucleotide hairpin) <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Binding of mature miRNAs to RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) is followed by guidance to target cognate protein-coding mRNAs, largely through identification of &#x02018;seed&#x02019; matches (sequences complementary to positions 2&#x02013;8 of the miRNA) in the 3&#x02032; un-translated region. The miRNA-RISC complex then initiates a program for mRNA degradation or block of translation. Of note, miRNAs can operate in tandem, cooperatively, or without an apparent seed sequence match. Since the first report of miRNA involvement in PD <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, new findings provide ample evidence for involvement of differentially expressed miRNAs in the PD brain <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Mouradian1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>

<xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Doxakis1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Much of these changes are reflected in PD leukocytes, where we recently observed by microarray analyses coupled miRNA-Alternative Splicing (AS) modifications that were modulated by DBS <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Thus, leukocyte datasets provide useful resources for studying PD-related processes, and new tools are required for linking between these different datasets.</p><p>In our current study, we employed whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing and a newly developed workflow that includes comprehensive RNA-Seq analysis approaches to characterize all of the leukocyte-expressed protein coding transcripts as well as the non-coding class of lncRNAs in PD patients and control volunteers. We identified splicing changes, as well as novel exons and junctions by implementation widespread gene-, exon- and junction-level analyses. We implemented a variety of differential expression and splicing analysis methods including linear regression, Splicing Index (SI), ASPIRE and FIRMA. This enabled an integrated analysis of exons and junctions (both separately and combined), transcript structural variations and functional processes, and allowed the conduction of integrated RNA-Seq analysis of whole transcriptome data. We also implemented a new module that enables identification of known and novel Poly-A sites. Our comprehensive novel RNA-Seq analysis workflow further enabled the identification of specific protein domains translated from sequence regions detected as spliced, as well as potential miRNA binding sites within the detected regions. We applied this vast range of analysis tools on PD leukocytes from PD patients (pre-DBS) and post treatment (post-DBS) while being either on- or off-electrical stimulation, all as compared to matched controls the Amygdala and SN. The experimental and analysis workflow is illustrated under <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003517-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Additionally, we used a publically available junction array datasets to characterize knock out effects of two PD leukocyte modified genes that are involved in additional neuropathologies, both include prion-like domains: FUS and HNRNP A/B <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Kim3" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. We further analyzed an additional independent RNA-Seq dataset from PD brain samples and compared the PD blood and leukocyte modified lncRNAs to the brain modified ones following the full characterization of PD brain expressed lncRNAs in the external dataset. Experimental quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) tests validated exemplary findings both in patients' leukocytes and two brain regions from an additional set of PD brain samples as compared with unaffected control brain samples.</p><fig id="pcbi-1003517-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003517.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>General outline of the RNA-Seq experiment and analysis workflow.</title><p>RNA was extracted from PD leukocytes pre-DBS, post-DBS on stimulation and following one hour of electrical stimulation cessation (off-Stim). Libraries were constructed for SOLiD whole transcriptome sequencing following ribosomal RNA removal, fragmentation and gel purification. Primary analysis of the 50 nucleotide long reads was followed by mapping of the outcome reads to the human genome through BioScope cloud computation. Tertiary data analysis workflow was developed through a novel RNA-Seq module of AltAnalyze (version 2.0). The analysis steps included: sample-specific database construction followed by detection of known and novel junctions and exons. Four different algorithms were used for measurement of splicing changes from single features (junctions/exons) and feature pairs. These included: linear regression, splicing-index, ASPIRE and FIRMA. Subsequent annotation of the splicing events at the transcript level enabled detection of various annotations including 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; end variations, cassette exons and mutually exclusive exons. Additionally, detection of both promoter region and splicing alternations as well as intron retention events was enabled, and a novel module for poly-A site prediction was incorporated. Enrichment for protein binding domains and miRNA target sites was conducted using z-score and the corresponding databases. Additionally, detection of all the lncRNAs expressed in these samples expressed lncRNAs was conducted through alignment to GENCODE 7 database, and followed by differential expression analysis (EdgeR) and predictions of secondary structure and potential miRNA complementarity predictions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003517.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To deeply delineate splicing modulations and to characterize the full profile of lncRNAs as well as their differential expression in PD, we implemented a novel and comprehensive RNA-Seq analysis workflow (available as version 2.0 of AltAnalyze <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Salomonis1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> program).

While we have previously reported alternative splicing alterations in PD leukocytes pre- and post-DBS through exon and junction microarray analyses <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq4" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq5" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, RNA-Seq data analysis offers several important advantages in expression studies. Being independent of predefined probes (as compared with microarray platforms), RNA-Seq allows unbiased identification of novel junctions, exons and transcript isoforms as well as altered polyadenylation choices at high resolution. The in-depth coverage allows a more accurate measurement of exon inclusion or exclusion and identification of lowly abundant junctions and exons. Moreover, this analysis further enables detection of reciprocal pairs of junctions, one that includes and the other that excludes an exon. To fully exploit these virtues, we developed an updated version of AltAnalyze (version 2.0) for RNA-Sequencing analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.altanalyze.org/">http://www.altanalyze.org/</ext-link>). Extending the program that was initially developed and introduced for junction microarray analyses <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Salomonis2" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, we introduce a significantly improved workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003517-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This is reflected in its user-friendly pipeline for the analysis of both known and novel splicing events directly from SOLiD BioScope processed RNA-Seq results (but also from other platforms, such as TopHat <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Trapnell1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, HMMSplicer <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Dimon1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref> and SpliceMap <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Au1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>). The obtained analysis results can be directly integrated with alternative exon or junction array datasets. Unlike existing RNA-Seq analytical pipelines, this new version of AltAnalyze can directly evaluate differential gene expression, identify known and novel alternative exons and junctions and alternative Poly-A sites, perform combinatorial exon and junction analyses and evaluate these effects at the level of protein domains, miRNA targeting and enriched biological pathways, as a fully automated and user-friendly pipeline.</p><p>We have developed a full analysis scheme to analyze using a wide range of analysis approaches gene, exon and junction levels of count data. This tool is able to analyze count information that is obtained from various platforms and analysis methods of data produced by RNA-Seq experiments (Methods).

Splicing-Index (SI) algorithm (described in detail under <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Srinivasan1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Gardina1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>) was applied on the PD leukocyte RNA-Seq data based on the above-described novel targeted RNA-Seq module of AltAnalyze.

Notably, 34 modified genes were detected in both the RNA-Seq and microarray technologies, including the elongation factor EIF2AK3 and the interleukin receptor IL1RL1. Also, the majority of disease-induced changes, 1313 were exon inclusion ones and only 339 &#x02013; exclusion events, similar to the enrichment of inclusion events seen in cortical samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Berson1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>.</p><p>To further identify high confidence splicing events, we implemented linear regression analysis approach for analyzing all the reciprocal junction pairs detected in the RNA-Seq libraries (i.e reciprocal junction pairs: all the pairs of junctions one of which includes an exon in the transcript and one excludes it). Following sample-specific database construction of all the known and novel junctions available in the samples, the test is performed on all the junction pairs detected in the RNA-Seq libraries (both novel and known). Using this novel RNA-Seq implemented analysis approach on the sequenced PD leukocyte RNA, we could identify all the detected known and novel splice junctions.

Only 87 of the disease-altered junctions existed in current genomic databases, and thus the majority of these junctions could not be previously detected by microarray analyses.

This workflow enabled us to detect novel exons and junctions in protein coding RNA molecules, as well as a large range of splicing events under PD pre- and post- brain stimulation both on- and one hour off- electrical stimulation (which re-induces the disease motor symptoms), as compared with healthy control volunteers.

At the transcript level, the DBS-induced increase in alternative ends, as well as in intron retention and alternative promoter usage, was accompanied by a 50% decrease in the number of &#x02018;bleeding exons&#x02019; (that &#x02018;leak&#x02019; into other transcripts). The number of cassette exons (present in certain transcripts but not in others) was predictably highest among all the possible types of splicing events in all the sequenced samples. Specifically, we observed increase in the frequency of cassette exons and intron retention events both in the disease and following DBS, as compared with the global population of expressed exons. Notably, non-conventional AT/AC and GT/AG ending introns were predictably very rare, in all the tested clinical conditions, as compared with the other types of transcript structural variations and disease-modified Poly-A choices.</p><p>Our deep survey characterized leukocyte-expressed lncRNAs in both patients and control volunteers and identified 5 lncRNAs that are over-expressed in the disease and inversely decrease following DBS.

Another disease-modified lncRNAs that decreased post-DBS (RP11-79P5.3) was also found as differentially expressed by analysis of an additional external, independent PD brain RNA-Seq data-set <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Rhinn1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref> and its disease up-regulation was successfully validated by qRT-PCR in the leukocytes as well as in two brain regions from an additional set of PD and unaffected control brain samples, in both the Amygdala and SN.</p><p>So far, only a few large-scale studies have revealed fundamental characteristics of lncRNAs including their low levels of expression, temporal and spatial patterns of expression, sequence conservation and association with histone modifications <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref>. Functional assays have also revealed diverse mechanisms through which lncRNAs act to regulate protein-coding genes at both the transcriptional and translational levels. However, to date there is insufficient data on the relationship between sequence, expression and pattern of newly identified lncRNAs <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Wapinski1" ref-type="bibr">[106]</xref>.

Yet, the identification of alternative, still unidentified features may produce a framework with which to accurately predict the functions of un-annotated lncRNAs <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref>. An independent brain dataset analyzed in the current study exhibited a large number of lncRNAs commonly expressed in leukocytes from PD patients, thus we provide here an exceptionally rich resource for lncRNA expression in PD human leukocytes and brain regions.</p><p>We recently profiled differentially expressed miRNAs of PD patients' leukocytes pre- and post-DBS by small RNA deep sequencing <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Soreq7" ref-type="bibr">[107]</xref>, concurrently with alternative splicing changes of their predicted target genes. That study involved analysis by a junction array-adopted version of AltAnalyze. Here, we use the AltAnalyze target prediction module to detect potential miRNA binding sites within regions detected as undergoing splicing modifications by the RNA-Seq analyses, as well as putative protein binding domains. To detect disease and treatment-affected pathways, the splicing-sensitive results were re-analyzed using the functional AltAnalyze analysis module GO-Elite <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Zambon1" ref-type="bibr">[108]</xref> for over-representation analysis (ORA) of pathways, ontologies and other gene sets. We believe that our current approach and results will provide a useful resource for biomedical researchers of movement and neurodegenerative disorders, and that our suggested analysis workflow may maximize the observations obtained by analyzing RNA-Seq data through simultaneous detection of novel junctions, exons and splice isoforms in a data-specific manner through comprehensive yet sensitive detection of alternative splicing events.</p><p>Our lncRNA analysis workflow and results will also provide an important resource to the biomedical community. Currently, 31% of the human genome bases in sequenced transcripts are annotated as intergenic (located between coding genes). Of these, lncRNAs are rapidly emerging as important and fascinating regulatory factors across a diverse catalogue of molecular, genetic and cellular processes, but phenotypic consequences of their differential expression, as well as sequence and structure derived functionality are still an Enigma. Here, in addition to comprehensive detection of both junction and exon level splicing changes in protein coding transcripts, we also fully characterized the disease- and treatment-expressed lncRNAs, and found large disease-induced expression changes in 13 lncRNAs (of the over 6000 lncRNAs detected in the leukocytes overall), including such that are involved in RNA processing. We have validated the RNA-Seq observed disease alternations through real-time RT-PCR for three lncRNAs, including two potential ceRNAs predicted to bind numerous miRNAs. Although only recently detected, lncRNAs raise a great interest to the scientific community due to their tremendous influence on our perception of genes. It is clear now that they can function at the molecular level <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Wilusz1" ref-type="bibr">[109]</xref>, but their potential role in human neurodegenerative diseases was not reported yet. Certain lncRNAs function as transcriptional regulators of neighboring protein-coding genes by cis- or trans-modulation <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Beckedorff1" ref-type="bibr">[110]</xref>, enhance or repress nearby protein-coding genes <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Wilusz1" ref-type="bibr">[109]</xref>, operate as epigenetic gene regulators through histone or DNA modification <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[111]</xref> (for example, in muscular dystrophy) <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Cabianca1" ref-type="bibr">[112]</xref>, and act as precursors or decoys for small RNAs <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Jalali1" ref-type="bibr">[113]</xref>. Thus, the expression map of lncRNAs in human leukocytes and specifically, in PD patients' pre- and post- DBS treatment may become an important resource. Specifically, both miRNA-binding lncRNAs and splicing modulations have been demonstrated to impact miRNA binding site integrity, which has been proposed to be an important mechanism in regulating miRNA-RNA sensitivity <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Salomonis1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Emerging evidence further demonstrates a role for lncRNAs in regulating both miRNA targeting <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Salmena1" ref-type="bibr">[114]</xref>, possibly competing with the protein coding targets of the sponged miRNAs, and splicing factors <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Moran1" ref-type="bibr">[115]</xref>. For example, the lncRNA MALAT1 modulates SR splicing factor phosphorylation <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Tripathi1" ref-type="bibr">[116]</xref>, whereas miR-188-5p which is complementary to the PD-induced lncRNAs targets the alternative splicing regulatory factor SFRS1 (SF2/ASF) <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Sanford1" ref-type="bibr">[117]</xref> (which we previously reported as modified in PD patients through exon microarray analysis).</p><p>Two of the PD differentially induced lncRNAs predictably bind many complementary miRNAs, and were further increased following DBS treatment. RP5-875O13.1 (lnc-SPATA21-1) showed complementarity to 8 miRNAs and RP11-462G22.1 to 21 miRNAs, supporting the notion that lncRNAs may function in PD as protective decoys preventing the functioning of their complementary miRNAs. That miRNAs may present lncRNA-trapped, possibly non-functional versions, further suggests that quantifying miRNA levels in biological sources may be insufficient to predict their functioning potential. The DBS treatment potentially exacerbated this reaction, upon induction of changes in large number of lncRNAs. These two lncRNAs may hence belong to the newly discovered competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) lncRNA class, originally described as transcribed retropseudogenes that retain the miRNA-binding function of their parent mRNAs, which currently include lncRNAs <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Salmena1" ref-type="bibr">[114]</xref>. CeRNAs have been proposed to function as miRNA &#x02018;decoys&#x02019; or &#x02018;sponges&#x02019;, thereby de-repressing levels of protein coding transcripts that share with the ceRNAs the same miRNA response elements <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Salmena1" ref-type="bibr">[114]</xref>. Although ceRNA-mediated regulation represents an elegant mechanism by which lncRNAs may control protein function through miRNA mediators, the proportion of lncRNAs that act as ceRNAs remains unknown <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Ilott1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.</p><p>Of note, secondary sequence structures were so far not studied for lncRNAs, and our current observation for secondary structure enabling possible miRNA sponging for two of the disease differentially expressed lncRNAs calls for future studies involving lncRNA secondary structures predictions. Future comparative study of various species will provide further insights into structure-based functionality of lncRNAs <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Rands1" ref-type="bibr">[118]</xref>. So far, Knockout models for specific lncRNAs did not produce any phenotypes. However, evidence for their importance stems from lncRNAs involvement in cancer and other human diseases, and evolutionary analyses suggest that lncRNAs represent a new class of non-coding genes whose importance should become clearer upon further experimental investigation <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Young2" ref-type="bibr">[119]</xref>. We anticipate some of these associations will be made clearer by longitudinal studies that will include larger cohorts of PD patients as well as targeted lncRNA knockout models that will experimentally validate a link between splicing events with lncRNA differential expression. The discovery of at least one lncRNA regulated in our PD patients that affects splicing, highlights additional potential candidate lncRNA spliced targets consistently identified via RNA-Seq, junction and exon microarray analyses. Importantly, we found highly complex and previously unknown splicing and alternative poly-A patterns in healthy controls' leukocytes and a conspicuous decline of this rich variability in PD leukocytes. Together, these findings support the notion of a massive impact of both lncRNAs and the existence AS changes that cause a wide range of transcript-level structure modifications in PD.</p><p>Blood cells provide an accessible source for biomarker identification, and although accurate identification of disease biomarkers in the blood has proven difficult in the past, blood biomarkers were recently found for both neurological diseases as well as psychiatric disorders <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Nickles1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-FehlbaumBeurdeley1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.

While their involvement in sporadic neurodegenerative processes is still incompletely understood, findings of hnRNP A/B decline in Alzheimer's disease <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Berson1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref> suggests that impaired splicing regulation might be involved in the emergence of sporadic neurodegenerative processes, including PD. Splicing alternations were also reported to occur early on in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and failed nuclear transport and fibril formation by splicing factors harboring prion-like domains, such as hnRNP A/B and FUS was recently implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Kim3" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. It is hence noteworthy that we found AS changes in the prion-like domains of the non-mutated variants of these transcripts and identified <italic>protein transport to nuclei as</italic> a primarily impaired signaling network in PD leukocytes. Additional predictions involve neuro-immune signaling, with a specific focus on the CDC42 Rho GTPase which functions both in controlling anxiety and in defense against viral infection and general immune cell activities, both phenomena known in PD patients and which emerged in our network analysis as changed in the disease. Post-mortem brain studies of sporadic PD, highlighted mitochondrial dysfunction as being central to the disease <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Schapira1" ref-type="bibr">[120]</xref>, and it was further pointed out as contributing to the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative diseases such as Ataxia <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Narendra1" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref>. Pink1 and Park2 may act in a quality control pathway preventing the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, and regulators that control Park2 translocation into the damaged mitochondria were recently elucidated <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Schapira1" ref-type="bibr">[120]</xref>, revealing that this pathway is much more complicated than previously appreciated, and suggesting that other, yet unknown, regulators also contribute to the process.</p><p>Here, we have charted the first whole transcriptome genome-wide splicing map of Parkinson's leukocytes through characterization of both known and novel junctions and exons via multileveled analysis of high throughput long RNA sequencing. Wide annotations of alternate promoters, splicing and alternative poly-A sites allowed us to identify and quantify both disease- and treatment-induced splicing shifts, miRNA binding site modifications, putatively changed protein-protein interactions and other transcript structural changes in the three tested states of the participant patients (disease, post-treatment ON- and OFF- stimulus). We also noted shifts in splice patterns in PD leukocytes as compared with the global splicing map of the human genome, which was partially sustained post-DBS presenting specific attenuation of disease-derived increase in the frequency of Poly-A choices. To identify inclusion exons expressed in a reciprocal nature relative to a corresponding exclusion junction we have implemented and applied on the RNA-Seq data a more stringent algorithm based on the ASPIRE analysis approach. Importantly, we provide here a full resource of leukocyte-expressed lncRNAs in both disease and healthy states and specifically in PD.</p><p>In summary, we developed a novel computational approach and a user friendly tool for analyzing whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq data through sample specific database construction. Our workflow includes identification of novel splice junctions, exons and splicing events, including such that involve novel variants, in protein-coding genes. We combined both exon- and junction- level analyses by applying this newly developed version of AltAnalyze for RNASeq analysis to gain deep insight into gene expression and splicing aberrations in PD and search for electrical stimulation -induced changes, concurrently with global detection and differential expression of the leukocyte expressed lncRNAs. RNA-seq comprehensive analyses thus enable new insight to leukocyte transcriptome data, which becomes an important resource for researchers of neurodegenerative diseases overall, and our results will provide insights into DBS-treatable diseases overall (including mental disorders <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-HeeramunAubeeluck1" ref-type="bibr">[122]</xref>). In particular, lncRNAs may be future novel biomarkers for PD and other neurodegenerative and neurological conditions and an important tool in future personalized neurology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>PD patients and matched controls were recruited to the study according to the declaration of Helsinki (Hadassah University Hospital, Ein-Kerem, approval number 6-07.09.07) and have signed informed consent prior to inclusion in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Recruitment of human PD patients and control volunteers</title><p>Blood leukocytes were collected from 3 PD patients pre- and post- bilateral sub-thalamic (STN)-DBS neurosurgery while being on stimulation and following a short 1-hour of stimulation cessation and from 3 healthy age-matched control healthy volunteers (HC).

SOLiD-3. System software analysis was used for all the primary data analysis including image analysis, bead finding, quality metrics and color calls. The software applications used to set and control data analysis included SOLiD software suite under license agreement. The suit included: Instrument Control Software (ICS), SOLiD Experimental Tracking System (SETS), and SOLiD Analysis Tools (SAT) V3.0. Job management by the Job Manager used the Corona-Lite v4.0 platform. Sequencing was run on the Applied Biosystems SOLiD 3 System. Images of each cycle were analyzed, data was clustered and normalized. For each tag, a sequential (sequence-ordered) set of color space calls was produced. Quality metrics were produced through normalization. Two probe sets were used to maximize the fraction of &#x0201c;mappable&#x0201d; amplified beads, read length and sequencing throughput for sequencing of the 50-bp reads. Five rounds of primers (A, B, C, D and E) were used to sequence template by ligation of di-base labeled probes. As the libraries were size fragmented, the set of primers used was specific to the P1 Adaptor. For each library three types of raw data files were created: .csfasta (the sequenced reads in color space), .qual and .stats. The quality values given in the .qual files (estimate of confidence given for each color call), q for a particular call, is mathematically related to its probability of error (p), and is calculated as follows: q&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;10log<sub>10</sub>p. The SOLiD q values are similar for those generated by Phred and the KB basecaller for capillary electrophoresis (described in detail under <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Ewing1" ref-type="bibr">[124]</xref>). The algorithm relies on training (calibration) to a large set of control data and color calls for which the correct call is known.

Predicting de- Novo junctions, exons and Poly-A site choices, annotating UCSC and EnsEMBL exons and detecting intron retention</title><p>For each RNA-Seq sample, a sample-specific database was constructed, based on the count reads obtained by the experimental procedure, and both EnsEMBL and UCSC genome coordinates. Following the identification of all of the transcript structural event types by parsing of all EnsEMBL and UCSC databases, the cases of intron retention were identified first by searching for regions that consist of a single exon and span two adjacent exons in at least one additional transcript for each gene. The remaining exons were clustered based on genomic coordinate overlaps (e.g alternate 5&#x02032; or 5&#x02032; start-sites). Each exon was annotated as corresponding to exon block and region number within the corresponding transcript. All possible pair-wise transcript comparisons for each gene were then performed to identify exon pairs that show evidence of alternative exon-cassettes, alternative 3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032; splice-sites or alternative-N or -C terminal exons. All transcript exon pairs were considered (except for those adjacent to a retained intron) by comparing the exon block-ID and region-IDs of an exon and its neighboring exons to the exon blocks and regions in the compared transcripts, and a custom heuristic assigned the appropriate annotation based on these transcript comparisons. In addition to all of the de-novo splicing annotations, additional splicing annotations were imported from the UCSC genome database and linked to existing exon blocks and regions based on genomic coordinate overlaps. Various programs can be used to produce the junction input .BED/TAB files, in addition to SOLiD Bioscope output files (such as TopHat <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Trapnell1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu">http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu</ext-link>, HMMSplicer <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Dimon1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://derisilab14.ucsf.edu/software/hmmsplicer">http://derisilab14.ucsf.edu/software/hmmsplicer</ext-link>)).

Exon count input .bed files are produced from BAM files with BEDTools (and exon counts can be further uploaded as .tab count files, produced by BioScope for SOLiD libraries, as in this case). In addition to known splice junctions (EnsEMBL and UCSC), novel reciprocal junction and trans-splicing events are analyzed and annotated as well. We have further incorporated, for the first time, alternative Poly-A predictions using the polyA database <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[126]</xref> with human genomics coordinates.

For the analysis of RNA-Seq data, we implemented both single-feature (exon/junction) through Splicing-Index (SI) (initially introduced to exon microarrays <xref rid="pcbi.1003517-Gardina1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>) and FIRMA, or combined (pairs) of features analyses (e.g reciprocal junction pairs): through linear regression and ASPIRE. The calculation of statistical significance involved t-test (default) but can also be modified to other statistical tests (such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov). In addition to detection of known junctions and exons, novel junctions and exons (as well as splicing changes) are derived by de-novo predictions. The exon values are normalized to the total number of read counts using the RPKM calculation prior to the analysis. Further details are given under AltAnalyze online documentation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.altanalyze.org">www.altanalyze.org</ext-link>).

This target dataset consisted of 14,880 sequences in FastA format and was used also for the leukocyte RNA-Seq data alignment. The run parameters were set as in the alignment of the leukocyte RNA-Seq count reads (-k1 and &#x02013;best). The aligned sequences were parsed with in-house generated scripts (Genomnia srl, Milan, Italy) and transformed in transcript count tables with EnsEMBL GENCODE transcript ID identifiers. Several transcripts that were not included in EnsEMBL were eliminated from the dataset prior to the analysis (since considered as &#x02018;retired&#x02019; transcripts).
