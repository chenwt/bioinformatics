Conversely, disruption of apoptosis is a basic modality cancer cells exploit for survival<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. However, the role of necroptosis, or programmed necrosis, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is uncertain. There are a multitude of potential inducers of necroptosis in PDA including ligation of TNFR1, CD95, TRAIL receptors, Toll-like receptors, ROS, and Chemotherapeutics<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Here we report that the principal components of the necrosome, RIP1 and RIP3, are highly expressed in PDA and are further upregulated by chemotherapy. Blockade of the necrosome <italic>in vitro</italic> promoted cancer cell proliferation and induced an aggressive oncogenic phenotype. By contrast, <italic>in vivo</italic> RIP3 deletion or RIP1 inhibition was protective against oncogenic progression and was associated with the development of a highly immunogenic myeloid and T cell infiltrate. The immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) associated with intact RIP1/RIP3 signaling was in-part contingent on necroptosis-induced CXCL1 expression whereas CXCL1 blockade was protective against PDA. Moreover, we found that cytoplasmic SAP130 was expressed in PDA in a RIP1/RIP3-dependent manner, and Mincle &#x02013; its cognate receptor &#x02013; was upregulated in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. Mincle ligation by SAP130 promoted oncogenesis whereas Mincle deletion was protective and phenocopied the immunogenic reprogramming of the TME characteristic of RIP3 deletion. Cellular depletion experiments suggested that whereas inhibitory macrophages promote tumorigenesis in PDA, they lose their immune-suppressive effects in the context of RIP3 or Mincle deletion. As such, T cells which are dispensable to PDA progression in hosts with intact RIP3 or Mincle signaling become reprogrammed into indispensable mediators of anti-tumor immunity in absence of RIP3 or Mincle. Our work describes parallel networks of necroptosis-induced CXCL1 and Mincle signaling which critically promote macrophage-induced adaptive immune suppression enabling PDA progression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Pancreatic cancer</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>C-type lectin receptors</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">We found that RIP1 and RIP3 are highly expressed in human PDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>).

Similarly, FADD, which complexes with RIP1/RIP3 to form the necrosome, MLKL, a downstream mediator of necroptosis, and Caspase 8, a principal driver of apoptosis, were upregulated in PDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.

Moreover, Kras<sup>G12D</sup>;RIP3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> PDEC exhibited a distinct phenotype including loss of CDK4 and elevated expression of Bcl-xL and c-Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended-Data-Fig 1b</xref>) which have selectively been associated with aggressive tumor-biology in PDA<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Since RIP3 deletion increased proliferation of PDA cells, we postulated that blockade of necroptosis <italic>in vivo</italic> would accelerate tumorigenesis. To test this, we compared the rate of oncogenic progression in p48<sup>Cre</sup>;Kras<sup>G12D</sup>(KC);RIP3<sup>+/+</sup> versus KC;RIP3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pancreata. Contrary to our hypothesis and belying our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, RIP3 deletion was protective. KC;RIP3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pancreata exhibited a diminished rate of acinar replacement by dysplastic ducts, slower PanIN progression, and reduced fibro-inflammatory changes compared with KC;RIP3<sup>+/+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended-Data-Fig. 1c</xref>). Accordingly, aged-matched KC;RIP3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pancreata weighed less than controls and RIP3 deletion extended survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b, c</xref>).

To test whether abrogation of RIP1 signaling similarly protected against PDA, we treated 6 week-old KC mice for 8 weeks with Nec-1s.

RIP3 deletion diminished infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended-Data-Fig. 2a</xref>). Conversely, the fraction of T cells and B cells were increased in KC;RIP3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pancreata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended-Data-Fig. 2b, c</xref>).

Further, consistent with our immunohistochemical data, bulk tumor-infiltrating TAMs and their M2-like Arg1<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup> subset were diminished in the context of RIP3 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended-Data-Fig. 2f&#x02013;h</xref>). Macrophage expression of PD-L1 was also reduced by RIP3 deletion (not shown). Collectively, these data suggest that RIP3 deletion increases lymphocyte infiltration in PDA and reduces infiltration of immune-suppressive myeloid cellular subsets.

Similar to our findings using pan-RIP3 deletion, Kras<sup>G12D</sup>;RIP3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> tumors grew at slower rates than Kras<sup>G12D</sup>;RIP3<sup>+/+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>) suggesting that RIP3 blockade in the epithelial compartment alone protects against PDA progression.</p><p id="P9">Since inflammatory cells within the PDA TME express the components of the necrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b, c</xref>), we investigated whether RIP3 deletion in the extra-epithelial compartment would similarly mitigate PDA progression. WT and RIP3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were challenged with an orthotopic intra-pancreatic injection of Kras<sup>G12D</sup> PDEC or Pdx1<sup>Cre</sup>;Kras<sup>G12D</sup>;Tp53<sup>R172H</sup> (KPC)-derived PDA cells, which express both mutant <italic>Kras</italic> and <italic>p53</italic>, and tumor size was measured at 3 weeks.

RIP3 deletion resulted in elevated T cell and B cell infiltrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e, f</xref>) and peri-tumoral T cells expressed lower IL-10 and PD-1, higher CD44, and exhibited a lower fraction of Tregs compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g, h</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended-Data-Fig. 3a&#x02013;d</xref>). Analysis of the myeloid compartment again revealed a reduction in the fraction of peri-tumoral MDSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>) and TAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j</xref>) with a shift toward an M1-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4k, l</xref>) and reduced PD-L1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4m</xref>). These data ostensibly contrast with a recent report which found that RIP1 signaling can enhance CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cross-priming. However, effects in PDA may be unique to the immunologic milieu of the pancreatic TME<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Accordingly, RIP3 deletion was not protective against B16 melanoma or subcutaneously-implanted KPC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended-Data-Fig. 3e, f</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Since CXCL1 expression in PDA is contingent on the necrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) and we found that CXCR2 is widely expressed on peri-tumoral leukocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended-Data-Fig. 4a, b</xref>), we postulated that CXCL1 may be responsible for the pro-tumorigenic immune-suppression associated with RIP3 signaling by mobilizing myeloid cells<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. To test this hypothesis, we challenged WT mice with orthotopic PDA whilst blocking CXCL1 in select cohorts. CXCL1 blockade protected against tumorigenesis in both the orthotopic Kras<sup>G12D</sup> PDEC (not shown) and KPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended-Data-Fig. 4c</xref>) models. However, &#x003b1;CXCL1 treatment did not further enhance tumor protection in RIP3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended-Data-Fig. 4d</xref>). Moreover, similar to RIP3 deletion, CXCL1 blockade reduced MDSC and TAM accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended-Data-Fig. 4e, f</xref>). Tumor-infiltrating T cells were also more activated in the context of CXCL1 blockade as evidenced by higher CD44 and TNF&#x003b1; expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended-Data Fig. 4g, h</xref>). However, CXCL1 inhibition was not significantly associated with higher infiltration of peri-tumoral T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended-Data-Fig. 4i</xref>), nor did it diminish Treg accumulation or lower IL-10 expression (not shown), each characteristic of RIP3 deletion. Taken together, these data suggest that CXCL1 overexpression alone may not account for the entire immune-suppressive phenotype associated with intact necroptosis signaling in PDA.</p><p id="P12">We postulated that necroptotic tumor cells release soluble factors which induce peri-tumoral immune-suppression. Mincle, a C-type lectin receptor (CLR) critical in mycobacterial immunity, can promote sterile inflammation <italic>in vitro</italic> by ligating SAP130, a nuclear protein released from dying cells<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. We discovered high cytoplasmic SAP130 expression in human PDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended-Data-Fig. 5a</xref>). <italic>SAP130</italic> expression was also upregulated by chemotherapeutics in human PDA cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended-Data-Fig. 5b</xref>).

Similarly, Gemcitabine-induced upregulation of <italic>Sap130</italic> was partially mitigated by Nec-1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended-Data-Fig. 5d</xref>). SAP130 expression in PDA was evident in both epithelial and inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended-Data-Fig. 5e, f</xref>). Moreover, confocal microscopy suggested SAP130 co-localization with RIP1/RIP3 in human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended-Data-Fig. 5g</xref>) and murine (not shown) PDA. <italic>SAP130</italic> similarly correlated with high <italic>RIP1/RIP3</italic> coexpression in a human RNAseq database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended-Data-Fig. 5h</xref>). Notably, there was a trend toward an association between high <italic>SAP130</italic> expression and diminished survival in human PDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended-Data-Fig. 5i</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We postulated that Mincle ligation by SAP130 drives necrosome-induced accelerated oncogenesis. Accordingly, immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that Mincle co-associates with SAP130 in PDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended-Data-Fig. 5j</xref>). Mincle was expressed in inflammatory cells in the human PDA TME, but absent in transformed ductal cells and in normal pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended-Data-Fig. 6a</xref>). Overall, ~10% of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes expressed Mincle in human PDA compared with minimal expression in PBMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended-Data-Fig. 6b</xref>). Subset analysis revealed high Mincle expression in human CD14<sup>+</sup>CD15<sup>+</sup> tumor-infiltrating monocytes compared with lower expression in their counterparts in PBMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended-Data-Fig. 6c</xref>). Similarly, in KC mice 10&#x02013;15% of pancreatic leukocytes expressed Mincle compared with low expression in the spleen or in parenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended-Data-Fig. 6d</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed Mincle expression in enriched PDA-infiltrating leukocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended-Data-Fig. 6e</xref>). Subset analysis suggested that Mincle was highly expressed in PDA-infiltrating MDSC, DC, and macrophages compared with lower expression in spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended-Data-Fig. 6f</xref>). Western blotting showed elevated expression of Mincle-related signaling intermediates in PDA in a RIP3-dependant manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended-Data-Fig. 6g</xref>). Accordingly, p-Syk<sup>+</sup> leukocytes were comparatively scarce in KC;RIP3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and KC;Mincle<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pancreata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended-Data-Fig. 6h</xref>). However, Mincle deletion in PDA did not mitigate CXCL1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended-Data-Fig. 6i</xref>) and CXCL1 blockade did not alter expression of Mincle-associated signaling intermediates (not shown).</p><p id="P14">To determine whether Mincle signaling accelerates oncogenesis, we serially treated 6 week-old KC mice with the Mincle ligand TDB, which we confirmed induced Syk phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended-Data-Fig. 7a</xref>). Mincle ligation accelerated tumorigenesis resulting in higher grade PanIN lesions, extensive fibrosis, and scattered foci of invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended-Data-Fig. 7b</xref>). TDB also accelerated the growth-rate of orthotopically implanted KPC-derived tumors in WT (not shown) and RIP3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended-Data-Fig. 7c</xref>), suggesting that the pro-tumorigenic effects of Mincle activation in PDA are either independent or downstream of RIP3 signaling. Moreover, the inflammatory TME in TDB-treated RIP3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pancreata recapitulated the immune-suppressive milieu associated with an intact necroptosis signaling mechanism. Specifically, TDB-treated pancreata trended toward a lower fraction of tumor-infiltrating T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended-Data-Fig. 7d</xref>) and exhibited increased recruitment of both MDSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended-Data-Fig. 7e</xref>) and M2-like TAMs which expressed high PD-L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended-Data-Fig. 7f&#x02013;i</xref>).

Mincle deletion slowed the rate of oncogenesis based on histological analysis, pancreas weight, and animal survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended-Data-Fig. 8a&#x02013;c</xref>). Similarly, orthotopic KPC-derived tumor implantation in Mincle<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pancreata resulted in smaller tumors and prolonged survival compared with implantation in WT hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended-Data-Fig. 8d, e</xref>). However, the survival benefit afforded to Mincle<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was not as pronounced as RIP3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>. Moreover, Kras<sup>G12D</sup> PDEC orthotropic implantation experiments suggested that CXCL1+Mincle blockade had additive protective effects whereas combined blockade of RIP3+Mincle or RIP3+CXCL1 did not confer additional protection over RIP3 blockade alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended-Data-Fig. 8f</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To determine whether Mincle deletion mimics the immunogenic reprogramming of the TME associated with RIP3 deletion, we assayed the pancreatic infiltrate in KC;Mincle<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

Flow cytometry confirmed that Mincle deletion was associated with a higher immunogenic T cell infiltrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended-Data-Fig. 9b&#x02013;d</xref>), diminished MDSC infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended-Data-Fig. 9e</xref>), a trend toward reduced DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended-Data-Fig. 9f</xref>), a decreased fraction of TAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended-Data-Fig. 9g</xref>) with M1-like polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended-Data-Fig. 9h, i</xref>) and reduced PD-L1 expression (not shown). These changes recapitulate the immunogenic reprogramming of the TME characteristic of RIP3 deletion.</p><p id="P17">To investigate whether tumor-protection in absence of RIP3 or Mincle signaling is T cell dependent, we depleted T cells coincident with orthotopic KPC tumor administration in cohorts of WT, RIP3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and Mincle<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals. T cell depletion did not influence PDA growth in WT mice.

Conversely, depletion of macrophages in WT mice led to T cell activation and tumor protection; however, macrophage-depletion had no effect on further enhancing T cell activation or tumor protection in RIP3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Mincle<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended-Data-Fig. 10b, c</xref>). These data suggest that in WT hosts TAMs promote PDA progression whereas T cells are dispensable to outcome; conversely, in absence of RIP3 or Mincle signaling, macrophages surrender their tumor-promoting effects and T cells are reprogrammed into indispensable mediators of anti-tumor immunity. Collectively, our work suggests that necroptosis-induced CXCL1 and Mincle signaling promote myeloid cell induced adaptive immune suppression in PDA. Each of these networks represent novel targets for experimental therapeutics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended-Data-Fig. 10c</xref>).</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S2"><title>Animals and In Vivo Models</title><p id="P18">C57BL/6 (H-2Kb) mice were purchased from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME).
