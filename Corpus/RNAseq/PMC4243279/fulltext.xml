Premature senescence of nodules can negatively impact on nitrogen availability for plant growth and, as such, we need a better understanding of nodule development and senescence. Cysteine proteases are known to play a role in nodule senescence, but knowledge is still fragmented regarding the function their inhibitors (cystatins) during the development and senescence of soybean nodules. This study provides the first data with regard to cystatin expression during nodule development combined with biochemical characterization of their inhibition strength.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Seventy nine non-redundant cysteine protease gene sequences with homology to papain, belonging to different subfamilies, and several legumain-like cysteine proteases (vacuole processing enzymes) were identified from the soybean genome assembly with eighteen of these cysteine proteases actively transcribed during nodule development and senescence. In addition, nineteen non-redundant cystatins similar to oryzacystatin-I and belonging to cystatin subgroups A and C were identified from the soybean genome assembly with seven actively transcribed in nodules. Most cystatins had preferential affinity to cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases. Transcription of cystatins Glyma05g28250, Glyma15g12211, Glyma15g36180 particularly increased during onset of senescence, possibly regulating proteolysis when nodules senesce and undergo programmed cell death. Both actively transcribed and non-actively transcribed nodule cystatins inhibited cathepsin-L- and B-like activities in different age nodules and they also inhibited papain and cathepsin-L activity when expressed and purified from bacterial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overlap in activities and specificities of actively and non-actively transcribed cystatins raises the question if non-transcribed cystatins provide a reservoir for response to particular environments. This data might be applicable to the development of strategies to extend the active life span of nodules or prevent environmentally induced senescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12870-014-0294-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cystatin(s)</kwd><kwd>Cysteine protease(s)</kwd><kwd>Programmed cell death</kwd><kwd>RNASeq</kwd><kwd>Senescence</kwd><kwd>Soybean</kwd><kwd>Symbiotic nitrogen fixation</kwd><kwd>Transcriptome</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>In plants, cystatins are natural and specific inhibitors of cysteine proteases of the papain C1A family that generally block C1A proteases by a tight and reversible interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Several cystatin functions have been proposed, but all involve a balanced interplay with a cysteine protease to regulate proteolytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Research has so far provided strong evidence that plant cystatins regulate endogenous protein turnover during growth and developmental processes, including senescence and programmed cell death, and are further involved in accumulation and mobilization of storage proteins. A further key function is protection against plant pests where cystatins prevent cysteine protease activity required for protein digestion in pests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Cysteine protease expression during nodule senescence has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Proteolytic activity in infected nodules limits the bacterial symbiosis and nitrogen fixation, with cytosolic leghemoglobin and the bacteriod as targets. In <italic>Medicago trunctula</italic> anti-sense inhibition of the cysteine protease CYP15A caused a delay in nodule senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and nodule lifespan was prolonged, when a nodule-specific papain-like cysteine protease (AsNODF32) was silenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, despite strong evidence for cysteine protease involvement in nodule development and senescence, only limited detailed information is currently available on any specific cystatin function and activity in these development and senescence processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The most detailed analysis of participation of an endogenous cystatin in interaction with an endogenous cysteine protease during senescence has been the coordinated expression of the mRNAs of a cysteine protease and a cystatin in senescent spinach leaves where a senescence-related cysteine protease&#x02013;cystatin complex was identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Further evidence of the <italic>in vivo</italic> regulation of cysteine protease have been provided by Pillay <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] showing that co-expression of the rice cystatin OCI in tobacco plants protected recombinant proteins from degradation by lowering overall cysteine protease activity.</p><p>The Phytozome database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net">www.phytozome.net</ext-link>) currently contains over 300 cystatin-like sequences from the Viridiplantae kingdom, 706 C1 cysteine protease sequences and 362 C13 cysteine protease (VPE-type) sequences. The recent release of the complete soybean genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] as well as the release of a RNAseq atlas of genes expressed in fourteen different soybean tissues including nodules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] has further allowed identification and characterization of all 19 soybean cystatins, irrespective of transcriptional activity, and 18 active cysteine proteases. Accurate studies are now possible to determine the cystatin and cysteine protease classes expressed in nodules and also to investigate if endogenous cystatins preferentially interact with specific target cysteine proteases in nodules. Our study was therefore aimed to provide a first insight into such interactions by identifying and characterizing all members of the cystatin and cysteine protease gene families in soybean nodules. We included both actively and non-actively transcribed cystatins and cysteine proteases identified through homology searches in the soybean genomic database. The nodule transcription profiles were developed with the technique of RNAseq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] which allowed us to determine the expression of all oryzacystatin I-like cystatins, papain-like cysteine proteases, as well as vacuole VPE-type cysteine proteases in determinate soybean crown nodules during nodule development and senescence. Such VPE cysteine proteases resemble mammalian caspases and they contribute to the senescence process and PCD (Programmed Cell Death) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], but might further activate pre-proteases by post-translational modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>In our characterization, we were also interested to determine to which families and functional groups nodule cystatins and cysteine proteases belong as well as the cystatin substrate preference by testing <italic>in vitro</italic> produced cystatin proteins with various cysteine protease-containing extracts. Cystatins are part of subfamily B of the I25 cystatin family and in cereals they can be divided into various functional groups (A, B and C) with most cystatins belonging to groups A and C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Group A cystatins, which efficiently inhibit cathepsin L-like cysteine-proteases, are preferentially expressed in dry and germinating seeds whereas group C1 cystatins, which are potent inhibitors of C1A peptidases, are mostly expressed in developing seed endosperms. Cysteine proteases cluster into different subfamilies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] with cysteine proteases closest to papain clustering with subfamily XCP1 represented by the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> genes At1g20850 and At4g35350. Cysteine proteases with cathepsin-L-like activity can closely cluster with subfamily RD21 consisting of RD21A (<italic>A. thaliana</italic> gene At1g47128), RD21B (At5g43060) and RD21C (At3g19390). A C-terminal granulin domain is characteristic of the RD21 subfamily. Cysteine proteases with cathepsin-L-like activity can further cluster with the SAG12 subfamily. Cysteine proteases with cathepsin-F-like activity cluster with subfamily RD19 with members RD19A (At4g39090), RD19B (At2g21430) and RD19C (At4g16190) and RD19 members have a characteristic ERFNAQ motif in the pro-domain. Cysteine proteases with cathepsin-H-like activity cluster with members of the AALP (At5g60360) and ALP2 (At3g45310) subfamily.</p><p>We were finally also interested to determine the interaction affinities between selected actively and non-actively transcribed cystatins during nodule development and senescence. This should provide information about the relative activities and specificities of both expressed and non-expressed cystatin genes in soybean. In our study, we found an overlap in the activities and specificities of the expressed and non-expressed cystatin genes raising the question of whether the non-transcribed cystatins provide a reservoir for responses to particular environments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cystatin identification</title><p>All expressed nodule cystatins were identified from our RNAseq data. When the oryzacystatin-I (conserved region 1EQK_A) was used for comparison as a model cystatin, 25 cystatin sequences were identified in the assembled genome; of these 20 were non-redundant sequences (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). When we carried out a phylogenetic genetic analysis of cystatins by comparison with cystatins from different I25 cystatin subfamilies (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), Glyma13g04250 and Glyma20g08800, transcribed in nodules during nodule development and senescence, had high similarity to group A cystatins (<italic>Vigna unguiculata</italic> cystatin, OCI, HvCPI-1 and HvCPI-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Glyma13g04250 was further paralogous to Glyma14g04250 with identical location, but on a different chromosome. Also, the two cystatins Glyma13g25870 and Glyma15g36180 were highly similar to Cystatin B (At3g12490) and HvCPI-4 (group A) and Glyma05g28250 was further highly similar to group B cystatins (cystatin 2 (At2g31980), HvCPI-5 and HvCPI-9). They also contained a C-terminal extension with a SNSL amino acid motif enabling them to inhibit legumain C13 cysteine proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Finally, Glyma15g12211, which was the most abundant cystatin in nodules, was similar to group C (subgroup C1) cystatins (Monellin cystatin (At5g47550), HvCPI-6 and HvCPI-8).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Mapping of transcribed soybean nodule cystatins to different I25 cystatin subfamilies.</bold>

Localisation of Glyma15g36180 was not reliable and the cystatin could be located in either the mitochondrion or the secretory pathway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cysteine protease identification</title><p>A total of 99 cysteine protease sequences with homology (1E&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;&#x02212;1.0) to the model cysteine protease papain (E.C.3.4.22.2) were further identified from the soybean genome assembly (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Several sequences were alleles, paralogos and orthologos of other cysteine protease gene sequences. From these we identified 79 non-redundant cysteine protease gene sequences which had similarity to members of eight different cysteine protease sub-families. Seven sub-families were distinguished from our expression data and we identified confidently five functional groups (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, none of the identified soybean cysteine proteases clustered with papain (subfamily XCP1). Cysteine proteases with cathepsin-L-like activity included Glyma04g03090 (closely clustering with subfamily RD21), as well as the two proteases Glyma14g09440 and Glyma17g35720 (similar to subfamily RD21 members). We also confirmed the C-terminal granulin domain, characteristic of the RD21 subfamily, in these cysteine proteases. Glyma04g04400 (cathepsin-L-like activity) had highest similarity to RDL2 (Arabidopsis gene At3g19400) and closely clustered with the RD21 subfamily members.

However, the ERFNAQ motif (instead of the ERFNIN motif in the pro-domain) characteristic of the RD19 subfamily, was absent. Glyma08g12340, which had no significant similarity to any specific subfamily, was closest to the two subfamilies RD19 or CTB3. Further cysteine proteases with cathepsin-H-like activity included Glyma09g08100, Glyma15g19580 and Glyma17g05670, which had high similarity to AALP and ALP2. The three proteases also had an N-terminal NPIR vacuolar targeting signal and other RD21 subfamily motifs (except that the ATC motif was lacking in Glyma09g08100). Although Glyma03g38520 and Glyma19g41120 had similarity to this subfamily, they contained an ECGIE motif in the C terminus, characteristic of subfamily CTB3.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Cystatin transcription</title><p>We then investigated the nodule cystatin and cysteine protease transcriptome at various time points (4, 8 and 14&#x000a0;weeks) of soybean nodule development and senescence (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

We first used the model rice cystatin OC-I as well as the cysteine protease inhibitor E64. OC-I and E64 both prevented cathepsin-L-like activity in 4&#x000a0;weeks old nodules but were less efficient against extracts derived from 8 and 14&#x000a0;weeks old nodules (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Both inhibitors also prevented cathepsin-B-like activity in an extract of 4&#x000a0;weeks old nodules. We then compared OC-I and E64 potency with the potency of various recombinant soybean cystatins either actively transcribed or non-active in nodules (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Cystatins tested were generally more active against extracts from younger nodules (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Five of the cystatins actively transcribed in nodules blocked cysteine protease activity in nodule extracts. However, only Glyma05g2850 inhibited cathepsin-L-like activity in nodule extracts from all three time points (4, 8, and 12&#x000a0;weeks) and cathepsin-B-like activity in extracts derived from 4 and 8&#x000a0;weeks old nodules. The most potent cystatin among the expressed cystatins was Glyma15g36180 and potency of this cystatin was comparable to OC-I and E64 when either cathepsin&#x02013;L or B activity was measured in an extract derived from 4&#x000a0;weeks old nodules.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>

Three cystatins (Glyma04g10360, Glyma07g39590 and Glyma18g12240) inhibited cathepsin-L as well as cathepsin-B like activity in extracts derived from all three time points. Glyma07g39590 was further the most potent of all tested cystatins against cathepsin-L and B activity in an extract derived from 14&#x000a0;weeks old senescent nodules.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We identified 8 cystatin genes expressed in soybean nodules using RNAseq. Since we carried out macro-dissection of crown nodule tissue, and not micro-dissection with selected tissues, RNAseq data represented transcription profiles of the entire nodule and also contained transcripts from areas surrounding the senescing nodule cortex. When we compared their transcription with already published RNAseq data from various other tissue types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], none of the identified nodule cystatins was uniquely transcribed. Several cystatins were further actively transcribed during nodule development and senescence but not exclusively transcribed at a particular time point like senescence. Only Glyma05g28250 was actively transcribed, and also inhibited cathepsin-L-like activity in nodule extracts, at all three selected time points. The cystatin very likely plays a maintenance role and regulates cysteine protease activity throughout nodule development and senescence. The other actively transcribed cystatins were only capable of inhibiting specific types of cysteine proteases activity (cathepsin L or B) at specific time points. Cathepsin B is a member of the peptidase C1 family and this cysteine protease is required for PCD involved in the plant disease resistance hypersensitive response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Transcription of cystatins Glyma05g28250, Glyma15g12211, Glyma15g36180 increased by about two-fold during the onset of senescence with concurrent co-induction of several cysteine proteases. These cystatins very likely regulate proteolysis when nodules senesce and undergo PCD to maintain nitrogen fixation in determinate soybean nodules for as long as possible.</p><p>Cystatins, which are part of subfamily B of the I25 cystatin family, belong to various groups (A, B and C) from to our phylogenetic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, any classification solely based on phylogenetic analysis might not accurately provide information about a particular function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Several nodule cystatins, almost equally transcribed during nodule development and senescence, had high similarity to group A cystatins. In cereals, group A cystatins, including rice cystatins, efficiently inhibit cathepsin L-like cysteine-proteases and they are preferentially expressed in dry and germinating cereal seeds. They possibly regulate endogenous enzymes involved in the mobilization of stored proteins upon germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>The nodule group A cystatin cluster also contained two cystatins, Glyma13g25870 and Glyma15g36180, with a C-terminal extension. Such an extension was also found in Glyma05g28250, highly similar to group B cystatins. Plant cystatins with a carboxy-terminal extension contain a SNSL amino acid motif and inhibit cysteine proteases of the legumain C13 family (VPEs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Their consistent transcription during nodule development and increase of transcription found for Glyma15g36180 and Glyma05g28250 when nodules senesce, indicates that they are very likely produced to tightly control cell disruption and activation of any cysteine proteases that may compromise nitrogen fixation. VPE proteases resemble mammalian caspases and they contribute to the senescence process and PCD by contributing to the collapse of the vacuole membrane with release of proteases into the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. There is also evidence that VPEs play a regulatory role activating pre-proteases by post-translational modification, leading to maturation and proteolytic activity upon removal on the I19 inhibitory domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Cysteine proteases, expressed as pre-proteins, consist of an I29 inhibitor domain preventing non-specific activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In our study, transcription of the entire set of nodule VPE cysteine proteases strongly increased coinciding with the progression of senescence. VPEs are therefore predominantly transcribed in senescent nodules and might play an important role in the activation of cysteine proteases. These activated cysteine proteases finally degrade both the bacteroids and nodule cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and correlates with nitrogenase activity decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] as well as decrease in both crown nodule biomass and nodule number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Glyma15g12211, identified in the Phytozome database, was the most abundant nodule cystatin with similarity to group C1 cystatins. This cystatin was almost four-times higher transcribed than all other actively transcribed cystatins in nodules. The Glyma15g12211 was identical to the previously described Glyma15g12210 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] which was found to be highly transcribed both in nodules and in other tissues including seeds. In cereals, group C1 cystatins are preferentially expressed in seeds, particularly in developing endosperms, and are potent inhibitors of C1A peptidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Future research is needed to identify the specific target cysteine proteases and why Glyma15g12211 is preferentially expressed in nodules.</p><p>We also identified cystatins not actively transcribed in nodules. When expressed <italic>in vitro</italic>, these cystatins had a much broader range of inhibitory activity against the nodule proteolytic complement than actively transcribed cystatins. They had nearly double the inhibitory capacity towards cathepsin-L-like cysteine protease activity, and also partially towards cathepsin-B-like cysteine protease activity, compared to actively transcribed cystatins. This might indicate that proteolytic activity should not be compromised by extensive cystatin expression with the onset of senescence and remobilization of nitrogen. However, these non-actively-transcribed cystatins might also have other specific functions and are only activated under certain biotic and abiotic stress conditions to prevent premature nodule death.</p><p>Based on our RNAseq data, 18 cysteine proteases were actively transcribed in nodules during development and senescence. Identified cysteine proteases were further functionally diverse belonging to different proteolytic sub-families. Transcript abundance of cysteine proteases at early and mature nodule development was relatively constant, with different cysteine proteases contributing toward the overall proteolytic complement (cathepsin-B-, F-, L- and H-like). Most of our tested nodule cystatins had preferential affinity to cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases. With the onset of senescence, however, cysteine protease transcript abundance was nearly doubled and correlated with senescence progression. However, only transcription of Glyma06g18390, which was very lowly transcribed, changed significantly due to the onset of senescence. This cysteine protease is homologous to senescence-related SAG12 (At5g45890). However, in a previous comprehensive transcriptomics study in <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> to understand <italic>Medicago</italic> nodule senescence, four cysteine protease genes highly homologous to SAG12 were the most abundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Future research has to determine the reason for such transcription difference of SAG12 homologous cysteine proteases in soybean determinate nodules and <italic>Medicago</italic> indeterminate nodules.</p><p>To analyze any endogenous cystatin function in nodules, it is crucial to identify their possible endogenous target cysteine proteases. Only little is so far known about any possible direct interaction between cystatins and their target proteases <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. We therefore searched cystatin and cysteine proteases sequences for signal peptides to obtain some information about their cellular localisation. Cystatins Glyma05g28250, Glyma07g39590 and Glyma13g25870 are likely localised in the secretory pathway. The ER has a vast protein storage protein capacity and relatively low proteolytic activity and cystatins might contribute to low proteolytic activity in this organelle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Nodule cystatins, such as Glyma05g28250, Glyma07g39590 and Glyma13g25870 with signal peptides, would be able to interact with C1A proteases that also have secretion sequences in their gene sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. MJ Chrispeels and NV Raikhel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] further predicted that the open reading frame of two cysteine proteases contain a putative vacuolar targeting signal. We also found such signal for Glyma04g36470 and Glyma06g18390, despite that Glyma06g18390 was explicitly expressed during nodule senescence which raises the question of the particular Glyma06g18390 function when targeted to the vacuole. One possible explanation is that this vacuolar targeting signal directs these cysteine proteases to the bacteroid-containing symbiosome compartment for bacteroid protein degradation affecting peribacteriod membrane stability. Rupture of the peribacteriod membrane then eliminates the microbial partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In our study the phylogenetic relationship and transcription of individual components of the cysteine protease&#x02013;cystatin system in soybean nodules during nodule development and senescence were characterised. Several of these components, including legumains, had coordinated transcription during nodule senescence strongly indicating their direct involvement in nodule senescence. Our study has, overall, created new knowledge about types of cystatin and cysteine protease transcribed, timing of coordinated transcription of the two components of the system and inhibitory activity of actively transcribed and non-transcribed cystatins in nodules for more future detailed interaction studies. Application of this knowledge might ultimately allow development of engineering strategies to circumvent particularly stress-induced premature senescence in nodules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The potential of using cystatins to regulate cysteine protease activity and thereby agronomical important traits (such as stress tolerance, delayed leaf senescence, etc.) was demonstrated in a transgenic soybean line overexpressing a cystatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Prolonging the period of active nitrogen fixation, due to delayed nodule senescence by regulating cysteine protease activity, might provide the benefit of better soybean growth and improving yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and potentially contributing to future food security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, since still little is currently known about the <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction between the two components of the system, we are currently determining, as a next step, their interaction by <italic>in vitro</italic> assays with both purified recombinant cystatin and purified cysteine proteases and investigating their individual localisation by immuno-histochemistry.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Identification of cysteine proteases and cystatins in soybean</title><p>The Soybean Genome Database [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://soybase.org/">http://soybase.org/</ext-link>], Phytozome Database [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net/soybean">http://www.phytozome.net/soybean</ext-link>] and NCBI-BLAST [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>] online resources were searched to identify the entire family of cystatins and cysteine proteases and cystatins in <italic>Glycine max</italic>.
