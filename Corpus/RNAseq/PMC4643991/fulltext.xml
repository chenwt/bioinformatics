Cyclins are very well characterised in model systems such as yeast and human cells, but surprisingly little is known about their number and role in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, the unicellular protozoan parasite that causes malaria. Malaria parasite cell division and proliferation differs from that of many eukaryotes. During its life cycle it undergoes two types of mitosis: endomitosis in asexual stages and an extremely rapid mitotic process during male gametogenesis. Both schizogony (producing merozoites) in host liver and red blood cells, and sporogony (producing sporozoites) in the mosquito vector, are endomitotic with repeated nuclear replication, without chromosome condensation, before cell division. The role of specific cyclins during <italic>Plasmodium</italic> cell proliferation was unknown. We show here that the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genome contains only three cyclin genes, representing an unusual repertoire of cyclin classes. Expression and reverse genetic analyses of the single Plant (P)-type cyclin, CYC3, in the rodent malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>, revealed a cytoplasmic and nuclear location of the GFP-tagged protein throughout the lifecycle. Deletion of <italic>cyc3</italic> resulted in defects in size, number and growth of oocysts, with abnormalities in budding and sporozoite formation. Furthermore, global transcript analysis of the <italic>cyc3</italic>-deleted and wild type parasites at gametocyte and ookinete stages identified differentially expressed genes required for signalling, invasion and oocyst development. Collectively these data suggest that <italic>cyc3</italic> modulates oocyst endomitotic development in <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The malaria parasite is a single-celled organism that multiplies asexually in a non-canonical way in both vertebrate host and mosquito vector. In the mosquito midgut, atypical cell division occurs in oocysts, where repeated nuclear division (endomitosis) precedes cell division, which then gives rise to many sporozoites in a process known as sporogony. The molecular mechanisms controlling this process are poorly understood. In many model organisms including mouse and yeast cells the cell cycle is regulated by members of the cyclin protein family, but the role of this family in the malaria parasite is unknown. Here, we show that there are only three cyclin genes and investigate the function of the single P-type cyclin (CYC3) in the rodent malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>. We show that CYC3 has a cytoplasmic and nuclear localisation throughout most of the parasite lifecycle and by gene deletion we demonstrate that CYC3 is important for normal oocyst development, maturation and sporozoite formation. Moreover, we show that deletion of <italic>cyc3</italic> affects the transcription of genes required for cell signalling and oocyst development. The data suggest that CYC3 modulates asexual multiplication in oocysts and plays a vital role in parasite development in the mosquito.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>AAH is supported by the Francis Crick Institute which receives its core funding from Cancer Research UK, the UK Medical Research Council, and the Wellcome Trust.

Progression through mitosis is controlled by a range of factors, including cyclins, protein kinases (PKs) and phosphatases (PPs), and the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) components [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Cyclins play active roles at distinct stages of the cell cycle [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] via regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Cyclins possess a conserved ~100-residue sequence known as the cyclin box that mediates CDK binding and activation [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Certain cyclins are capable of binding several CDKs, which are themselves able to associate with multiple cyclins [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These distinct but overlapping functions orchestrate cell cycle progression.</p><p>In most model systems, the synthesis and level of cyclins are tightly regulated during the cell cycle, with each cyclin being degraded via ubiquitination once its function is complete [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Key cell cycle transitions are regulated by specific cyclins: G1/S cyclins, which are essential for cell cycle entry at G1/S (start), and G2/M cyclins, which are essential at the G2/M (mitosis) transition. In some species, there are multiple forms of G1 and G2 cyclins. For example, in vertebrates there are at least three G1 cyclins (C, D, and E) and two G2 cyclins (A, which is also active in S phase, and B). Many other cyclins with additional functions have also been described [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Recent bioinformatic analyses have identified 3 distinct classes of cyclin: Group I (including cyclin A, B, D, E, F, G, I, J, and O families), Group II (P/Pho80-like, and Y), and Group III (C, H, K, L, and T) [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

Group II contains both cell cycle cyclins and those of other function, such as cell metabolism (e.g. P-type cyclins (CYCPs), which were originally believed to be unique to plants) and appear to link cell cycle regulation to nutritional status [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The cyclin box of CYCP in plants shows high similarity to the corresponding domain of trypanosome cyclins CYC2, CYC4, CYC7, CYC10 and CYC11 [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> PHO80-like cyclins [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Malaria parasites, <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, which belong to the phylum <italic>Apicomplexa</italic>, divide and proliferate in an unusual way compared to other eukaryotes. During its life cycle, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> exhibits two types of cell division; one in asexual stages that resembles endomitosis and one in sexual stages. The endomitotic-like asexual stage is characterized by multiple nuclear divisions preceding cytokinesis, with maintenance of the nuclear membrane wherein the microtubule organising centre (MTOC) or spindle body is embedded [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This process is observed at three developmental stages of the parasite life cycle: during schizogony, replication and multiplication within liver and red blood cells in the vertebrate host [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and at the sporogonic stage of parasite development in the mosquito vector [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The other type of cell division occurs during male gametogenesis, where three rounds of rapid DNA replication are followed by cell division and chromosome condensation giving rise to eight microgametes [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In the human malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, the stages of development during asexual multiplication inside red blood cells have been described as (a) ring stage (early trophozoite) with a single (haploid) interphase nucleus in G0, (b) mature trophozoites ready for chromosome replication (G1) and undergoing DNA synthesis (S phase), and (c) the schizont stage when asynchronous nuclear division begins (M phase) and repeated S and M phases continue resulting in a multinucleate syncytium [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. At the end of the growth phase, cell division occurs in the late stage schizont or segmenter to form merozoites that are released to invade new red blood cells. This process resembles that of endomitosis observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The molecular mechanisms that regulate nuclear and cell division in the malaria parasite remain largely unknown. We have previously shown that the single putative homologue of cell division cycle protein 20 (CDC20), a well-characterised activator of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), is crucial for karyokinesis and cytokinetic control of male gametogenesis [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, systematic genome-wide functional analysis of the protein kinome and phosphatome has identified molecules crucial for both male gametogenesis and asexual multiplication during sporogony, including CDKs, CDPK4, MAP2 and PTPLA [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> has a number of genes that code for calcium dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) that are implicated in control of growth and cell division [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

This group contains most canonical cyclin families that regulate specific cell cycle transitions with their CDK partners: Cyclin D-CDK4/6 for G1 progression, Cyclin E-CDK2 for the G1/S transition, Cyclin A-CDK2 for S phase progression and CyclinA/B-CDK1 for mitosis, although in fission yeast, all cell cycle transitions are driven by a single Cyclin B/CDK complex (CDC13/CDC2) [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In keeping with this key role and previous analyses [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], Group I cyclins were found in all non-apicomplexan species examined here, including the alveolate <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, none of the apicomplexan species examined contained Group I cyclins, except <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, which was found to encode three Group I cyclins of indeterminate family, suggesting that there has been a loss of Group I cyclins during the evolution of apicomplexan lineages (<xref rid="ppat.1005273.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).</p><p><italic>Plasmodium</italic> species encode only one cyclin from the P family (Group II) and two Group III cyclins from families H and L. The cyclin P family is not found in animals, but includes many plant cyclins and Pho80 in budding yeast, which link nutritional sensing to cell cycle progression. In contrast, both H and L families are associated with transcription: the CDK7/Cyclin H/MAT1 complex functions as a Cdk-activating kinase in cell cycle regulation [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and as a modulator of the general transcription factor TFIIH [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

CYC3 is a P-type cyclin, a family which contains many cyclins of plants (CYCPs) [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Both Pho80 and plant CYCPs appear to link cell cycle regulation to nutritional status: in yeast, Pho80 and other P-like cyclins associate with CDK Pho85 to phosphorylate a variety of substrates involved in phosphate, glycogen and carbon source metabolism (reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]), whereas CYCP2;1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is required for G2/M transition in meristem activation in a nutrition-responsive manner [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

Our gene deletion mutant is consistent with this analysis in terms of number and size of oocysts, but further dissects in depth the function of <italic>cyc3</italic> throughout the lifecycle using transcriptome analysis and high resolution microscopy. Maturation of most of the <italic>&#x02206;cyc3</italic> oocysts, based on their abnormal shape and size, was impaired in infected mosquito guts, and detailed studies revealed that this defect in oocyst growth and differentiation began during early sporogony. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> oocysts contain a highly lobed syncytial nucleus that divides at the time of sporozoite budding into a number of lobes, which undergo subsequent mitotic division resembling endomitosis [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The <italic>&#x02206;cyc3</italic> phenotype suggests that although initial oocyst formation occurs, in many of the oocysts the division of nuclear lobes with oocyst growth is drastically affected and further budding of sporozoites from these lobes does not occur. This defect leads to abnormalities in membrane formation, vacuolation and subsequent cell death during the later stages of sporogony. The characteristics of <italic>&#x02206;cyc3</italic> oocyst development suggest that maturation and differentiation are arrested, with cells unable to progress further to form additional lobes and start sporozoite budding and mitotic division.</p><p>A number of gene deletion mutants have been described in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> that affect oocyst maturation for example; <italic>Pb</italic>CAP380, affecting oocyst capsule formation [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]; <italic>Pb</italic>GEX and <italic>Pb</italic>DMC1, affecting oocyst size and sporozoite formation [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]; <italic>Pb</italic>LAPs and <italic>Pb</italic>CDLK, affecting sporogony but not the size of the oocyst [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]; <italic>Pb</italic>MISFIT, causing small sized oocysts [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]; and G actin sequestering protein (C-CAP) affecting oocyst development and showing similar features to <italic>&#x00394;cyc3</italic> during early oocyst development [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. However, the phenotype of <italic>&#x00394;cyc3</italic> lines differs from that of all these mutants due to the fact that some normal oocysts are produced, which are able to form invasive salivary gland sporozoites and initiate liver stage infection. Moreover, none of the other mutated genes was implicated in cell cycle control or cell division. The presence of a small number of normal oocysts/sporozoites in the &#x00394;<italic>cyc3</italic> mutant does suggest that CYC3 has a subtle role in oocyst/sporozoite development. The reduction in sporozoite number (in addition to the reduction in oocyst number) is drastic at 14 and 21 dpi compared to the WT parasites and there is clear expression of CYC3-GFP in 14 dpi oocysts, both indicative of a role in sporozoite development. This might suggest that there are unknown regulatory mechanisms involved in the control of the oocyst development that can by-pass a default CYC3-dependent pathway to some degree in these parasites during early oocyst development and sporogony.</p><p>Specific protein kinase and phosphatase mutants (<italic>Pb</italic>PK7 and <italic>Pb</italic>PPM5) show some resemblance to the &#x00394;<italic>cyc3</italic> phenotype, with a reduced number of oocysts, which were abnormally small and did not complete sporogony before arresting [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, only minor changes in the transcript level of protein kinase (<italic>pk7)</italic> or phosphatase <italic>(ppm5)</italic> were detected. Conversely, <italic>cyc3</italic> transcripts are down-regulated in <italic>&#x00394;ppm5</italic> parasites [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] suggesting that PPM5 acts upstream of CYC3.</p><p>Gene deletion revealed that CYC3 is dispensable during asexual multiplication in erythrocytes and in the liver (erythrocytic and exo-erythrocytic schizogony) and sexual development during male gametogenesis. However, CYC3 clearly modulates sporogony via endomitotic multiplication during oocyst development in the mosquito. Oocysts are the only replicative extracellular stage during the parasite life cycle, and therefore it is possible that CYC3 modulates this extracellular replication in response to metabolic sensing within the mosquito. For example, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CYCP2;1 is transcribed in response to sugar signals by a specific transcriptional factor, allowing cell cycle progression [<xref rid="ppat.1005273.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. CYC3 may have a direct or indirect role in regulation of transcription in the ookinete, of specific genes involved in oocyst growth (defined as a G1 phase) and sporogony (defined as S/mitotic phases), and that could explain why we see expression of CYC3-GFP in ookinetes and 10 to 14 dpi oocysts. Rescue experiments in yeast suggest that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> CYC3 does not behave as a classical G1 or G2/M cyclin, or at least cannot substitute for the function of yeast cyclins. Nevertheless the peak in expression of CYC3-GFP around 10 to 14 dpi of oocyst development, just before sporogony, and the defect in sporozoite production in <italic>&#x00394;cyc3</italic> mutants, are both consistent with a cyclin-B-like role in cell cycle progression and a role in G1/S progression.</p><p>Global transcript analysis of the <italic>&#x00394;cyc3</italic> mutant suggested that neither <italic>cyc1</italic> nor <italic>cyc4</italic> compensates for the <italic>cyc3</italic> deletion.

The nuclear fluorescence intensity was standardized to the haploid DNA content by measuring the fluorescence intensity of ring-stage parasites in parallel on the same slide and with the same microscope and camera settings.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1005273.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic analysis of cyclins.</title><p>A maximum likelihood protein phylogeny comparing apicomplexan cyclins to sequences from human, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, and <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>.
