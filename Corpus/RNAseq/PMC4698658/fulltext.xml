While a distinct set of processes drive metastasis when compared to tumorigenesis, it is yet unclear if genetic alterations in metabolic pathways are associated with metastatic progression of human cancers. Here, we analyzed the mutation, copy number variation and gene expression patterns of a literature-derived model of metabolic genes associated with glycolysis (Warburg effect), fatty acid metabolism (lipogenesis, oxidation, lipolysis, esterification) and fatty acid uptake in &#x0003e;9000 primary or metastatic tumor samples from the multi-cancer TCGA datasets. Our association analysis revealed a uniform pattern of Warburg effect mutations influencing prognosis across all tumor types, while copy number alterations in the electron transport chain gene <italic>SCO2</italic>, fatty acid uptake (<italic>CAV1, CD36</italic>) and lipogenesis (<italic>PPARA, PPARD, MLXIPL</italic>) genes were enriched in metastatic tumors. Using gene expression profiles, we established a gene-signature (<italic>CAV1, CD36, MLXIPL, CPT1C, CYP2E1</italic>) that strongly associated with epithelial-mesenchymal program across multiple cancers. Moreover, stratification of samples based on the copy number or expression profiles of the genes identified in our analysis revealed a significant effect on patient survival rates, thus confirming prominent roles of fatty acid uptake and metabolism in metastatic progression and poor prognosis of human cancers.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Metastases are responsible for the majority of cancer-related mortalities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. While the progression of primary malignancies to metastasis may be driven by linear progression of tumors via accumulation of mutations, or by parallel evolution of metastatic tumors, it is evidently clear that the genetic alterations driving tumorigenesis are distinct from the ones involved in metastatic progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Cancer cells frequently rewire cellular metabolism to increase ATP synthesis, enhance production of macromolecules and maintain redox status, and the acquisition of such alterations is increasingly being recognized as an important hallmark of cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. However, it is unclear if these genetic alterations in metabolic pathways can provide a selective advantage towards the metastatic progression of cancer cells.</p><p>One of the most commonly observed, and widely studied, metabolic rewiring event during cellular transformation is the increased uptake of glucose and the switch to aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Despite the poor efficiency of ATP generation compared to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the switch to aerobic glycolysis increases the availability of intermediate metabolites required for anabolic processes including nucleic acid and amino acid biosynthesis that are essential for the sustenance of rapidly proliferating cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Often ignored, another important source of energy and anabolism in cancer cells is fatty acids (FA) metabolism &#x02013; almost all tumors gain the ability to synthesize long-chain fatty acids <italic>de novo</italic> by upregulating the expression of fatty acid synthase (<italic>FASN</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Besides constituting lipid membranes, FAs serve as a rich source of energy production through mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Tumor cells overexpressing the brain isoform of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (<italic>CPT1C</italic>), the enzyme responsible for mitochondrial uptake of FAs, are more aggressive and resistant to therapeutics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. From a metabolic perspective, adaptations observed during malignant transformation are very similar in nature to those observed in embryonic and adult hematopoetic stem cells, namely, they metabolize glucose through aerobic glycolysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. More recently, researchers have established that FA metabolism also plays a major role in the maintenance of stem cells. <italic>De novo</italic> lipogenesis are highly active in adult neural stem cells, and increased <italic>FASN</italic> expression is essential for the proliferation and maintenance of the undifferentiated state of the stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In addition, PPAR-&#x003b4; (<italic>PPARD</italic>)<italic>-</italic>regulated mitochondrial FA oxidation are critical for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The parallels between characteristics of stem cells and aggressive cancer cells extend beyond metabolic rewiring to proliferative, migratory and self-renewing properties, and the acquisition of stem cell-like features in cancer cells is closely associated with increased invasiveness and metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. At the functional level, the activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program enables metastatic dissemination of the cancer cells including the capability for self-renewal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Hence, the progression of EMT and cancer stem cell-like features in tumors confer resistance to therapeutics and are associated with poor prognosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>The parallels between highly aggressive cancers and stem cells raise the possibility that the genes regulating cellular metabolic pathways, especially fatty acid metabolism, may be altered during metastatic progression of human cancers. Here, we studied the genetic alterations in metabolic genes associated with metastatic progression using the multi-cancer Translation of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pan-cancer datasets. We adapted a hypothesis-driven approach, wherein, we constructed a literature curated pathway model of genes altered in cancer cells that regulate glycolysis (Warburg effect) or FA metabolism, including cellular FA uptake. Next, we identified the genes exhibiting significant accumulation of mutations or copy number alterations (CNA) in metastatic tumors as compared to primary tumors. We further established a prognostic gene signature by analyzing the gene expression patterns of metabolic genes in context of EMT progression in seven different TCGA datasets. The prognostic value of the alterations and gene signature were validated by stratification of the pan-cancer samples and evaluating the influence on survival rates. Our analysis revealed that the Warburg effect genes with significant prognostic value (<italic>TP53, STK11</italic>) were uniformly mutated across all tumor types (primary or metastatic). However, genes involved in cellular FA uptake (<italic>CAV1, CD36</italic>) and de novo lipogenesis (<italic>PPARA, PPARD, MLXIPL</italic>) were specifically amplified at higher frequencies in metastatic tumors. In addition, the OXPHOS gene <italic>SCO2</italic>, a transcriptional target of p53 was also amplified in metastatic tumors. Contrary to expectations, the expression levels of <italic>SCO2</italic> were higher in p53 mutation background, with significant influence on prognosis. By analyzing gene expression data, we found that <italic>CAV1, CD36, MLXIPL, CPT1C</italic> and <italic>CYP2E1</italic> were the top ranked genes associated with an EMT phenotype. Stratification of samples based on copy numbers or expression profiles of the genes identified in our analysis revealed significant influence on patient survival rates.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><p>In order to identify the metabolic genes that are significantly altered in metastatic cancer cells, we first constructed a literature-derived pathway model of genes that regulate FA metabolism and glycolysis in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and analyzed for changes in mutations, copy number alterations and mRNA expression patterns that altered significantly in metastatic tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We further validated the clinical relevance of these alterations by their ability to predict patient survival rates. The list of candidate genes in the literature-based model (herein denoted as model genes) was restricted to genes previously reported to be significantly altered between normal and cancer cells, and included enzymes, signaling or transcriptional regulators of glucose metabolism (Warburg effect), FA oxidation, and lipogenesis (including lipolysis and esterification) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Additionally, we included the FA transport genes since elevated uptake of exogenous FAs contributes to the cellular FA pool<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, and a recent study from our laboratory showed that elevated uptake of free fatty acids via CD36 was associated with induction of the EMT program in liver cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. To investigate the influence of genetic alterations in the model genes, we compared the mutation, CNA and gene expression profiles of the model genes between tumors classified as primary or metastatic in the TCGA pan-cancer datasets, or against a composite EMT-score in the TCGA datasets of individual cancers. The mRNA expression-based EMT score, consisting of relative expression levels of mesenchymal and epithelial genes, served as a proxy for metastatic status<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA) test followed by Tukey&#x02019;s post-hoc test, the EMT score was significantly higher in the pan-cancer metastatic tumors than the primary tumors (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;13</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In addition, we evaluated the influence of the EMT score on the patient&#x02019;s prognosis by classifying the samples by their mean EMT score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>), and found significant reduction in survival rates in the high EMT subset (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;20</sup>).</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Accumulation of FA metabolism gene mutations in metastatic tumors</title><p>We evaluated the influence of non-synonymous mutations in the FA metabolism and Warburg effect genes from the pan-cancer dataset. We found that mutations in the tumor suppressors <italic>TP53</italic> (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;13</sup>) and <italic>STK11</italic> (LKB1, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002) resulted in significant reduction in survival rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C,D</xref>). Both <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>STK11</italic> are among the 127 significantly mutated genes identified in the mutation landscape study of the pan-cancer cohort<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In addition, we evaluated the role of cumulative mutations within each model category and found the most frequently mutated genes in the Warburg effect category (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>), however <italic>TP53</italic> alone contributed nearly 97% of the mutations in this group. In terms of survival rates, the presence of single or multiple mutations in the Warburg effect or FA metabolism and uptake genes significantly reduced cumulative survival (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.7&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). In fact, single or multiple mutations in the Warburg effect group alone significantly reduced survival rates (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.7&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>), while mutations in the FA transport and metabolism group of genes were not significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1D,F</xref>). When compared to primary tumors, 50% of the FA oxidation, 41% of the lipogenesis and 24% of cellular FA uptake genes exhibited significantly higher mutation frequency in metastatic tumors, whereas none of the Warburg effect genes showed higher mutation frequency in metastatic tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1G,H</xref>). These results highlight the fact that the Warburg effect gene mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>STK11</italic> did not accumulate in metastatic tumors, and were associated with reduced survival rates uniformly across all tumor types.</p><p>We next evaluated the accumulation of CNAs in metastatic tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). For this analysis, we used the GISTIC2 (Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer, version 2.0) calls from the pan-cancer CNA dataset to calculate the frequency of patients with either a copy number gain or copy number loss, defined as a GISTIC2 call &#x02265;1 or &#x02264;1, respectively. We used the Fisher&#x02019;s exact test to compare if the gain or loss frequencies were significantly different between metastatic and primary tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We did not observe significant difference in copy number loss frequencies of any gene between primary and metastatic tumors. However, 6 genes were amplified at significantly higher frequencies in metastatic tumors: <italic>SCO2</italic> (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>), <italic>MLXIPL</italic> (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>), <italic>PPARA</italic> (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup>), <italic>PPARD</italic> (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup>), <italic>CAV1</italic> (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) and <italic>CD36</italic> (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>). To further assess the prognostic role of these genes, we classified the pan-cancer tumors into two clusters using their CNA profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The samples were classified as low copy number (Cluster 1) or high copy number (Cluster 2) based on the 6-genes, identified in the previous step. A Kaplan-Meier curve analysis of the two clusters indicates a reduction in survival rates in the high copy number cluster (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;29</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). When compared to the known regions of focal somatic copy number alterations, none of the six genes overlapped with focal peak regions of amplification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>). However, <italic>CAV1</italic> (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) and <italic>CD36</italic> (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01) were both significantly amplified across all cancers according to the genome-wide GISTIC analysis.</p><p>The carbohydrate response element binding protein ChREBP encoded by <italic>MLXIPL</italic> transcribes lipogenic enzymes <italic>LPK</italic>, <italic>ACC1</italic> and <italic>FASN</italic> and gluconeogenesis enabling enzyme <italic>G6Pase</italic> in response to increased levels of carbohydrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. While the fatty acid synthesis reaction requires NADPH, the switch to aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells promotes the pentose phosphate pathway, which serves as the major source of cellular NADPH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The PPAR transcription factors (<italic>PPARA, PPARD</italic>) transcribe genes that regulate a number of lipid metabolism pathways including lipolysis, fatty acid uptake, oxidation and lipogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, and together with the amplification of the fatty acid transporters, <italic>CAV1</italic> and <italic>CD36,</italic> would result in elevated synthesis and accumulation of fatty acids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The expression of <italic>CAV1</italic> has been previously discussed in the context of tumor growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, and has been found to be associated with metastasis and poor prognosis of prostate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, pancreatic metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> and gastric cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. While not as extensively studied, the fatty acid translocase encoding <italic>CD36</italic> has been recently reported to be associated with the progression of liver cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, glioblastoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> and the <italic>in vitro</italic> proliferation of sarcoma and breast cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The p53-regulated <italic>SCO2</italic> gene, encodes a protein that, together with <italic>SCO1</italic>, regulates the assembly of electron transport chain-associated cytochrome C oxidase complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> downregulate the transcription of <italic>SCO2</italic>, thereby preventing the assembly of this critical OXPHOS complex and increasing the cell&#x02019;s reliance on glycolysis for ATP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. However, we found that the <italic>SCO2</italic> gene was frequently amplified in metastatic tumors and these alterations corresponded to the mRNA levels of <italic>SCO2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Contrary to expectations, <italic>SCO2</italic> mRNA levels were significantly higher in tumors bearing <italic>TP53</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>) and higher <italic>SCO2</italic> expression was associated with poorer prognosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Additionally, the combined impact of p53 mutation and high <italic>SCO2</italic> expression resulted in the lowest survival rates compared to unaltered state of both genes or altered state of one of the two genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>). It was reported that both mutations and overexpression of <italic>SCO2</italic> gene can delay the assembly of cytochrome C oxidase on the mitochondrial membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. However, it remains to be identified whether <italic>SCO2</italic> amplification serves as a mechanism to bypass the influence of p53 mutation on OXPHOS, or whether <italic>SCO2</italic> amplification further disrupts OXPHOS thereby driving the cell towards aerobic glycolysis.</p><p>In addition to the literature-curated model genes, we also analyzed the influence of the lipid and carbohydrate metabolism gene sets obtained from the REACTOME database. We found that copy number gains in only 2 out of the 471 lipid (<italic>CYP27B1, SUMF2</italic>) and 1 out of 235 carbohydrate (<italic>PHKG1</italic>) metabolism genes had a significant impact on survival rates. Further, mutations in only 2 lipid (<italic>PIK3CA, PRKD1</italic>) metabolism genes influenced survival rates while none of the carbohydrate metabolism gene mutations had a significant impact. Of the significant CNA and mutation genes, only <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations frequency varied significantly between primary and metastatic tumors. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>)</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Establishing a metabolic gene expression signature associated with metastatic progression</title><p>We performed an association analysis between the mRNA expression profiles of the model genes and the EMT score for several epithelial cancers from the TCGA database: breast cancer (BRCA), colorectal adenocarcinoma (COADREAD), kidney renal clear cell cancer (KIRC), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ovarian cancer (OV) and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). Using the nearest neighbor algorithm based on Pearson&#x02019;s correlation with stringent family-wise error rate control (Bonferroni&#x02019;s FWER), we identified the model genes with either significant positive or negative association with EMT score (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 4&#x02013;10</xref>).</p><p>An intriguing generalized pattern emerged from this analysis. We found that elevated expression of fatty acid uptake genes, <italic>CAV1</italic> and <italic>CD36,</italic> were consistently associated with a high EMT score across all cancers. We also observed cancer type-specific alterations in the pathways. For instance, in ovarian cancer, the Warburg effect genes typically altered in all other cancer types were not associated with the EMT score. Similarly, the expression levels of FA oxidation and lipogenesis genes were not associated with the EMT score in lung cancer. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). As the activation of aerobic glycolysis is evident in neoplastic tissues independent of the extent of vascularization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, one possible explanation may be that the alterations related to Warburg effect are early events in pathogenesis of ovarian cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, whereas the activation of lipogenesis has been previously reported in neoplastic lung tumors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. These patterns are reflected in the simplified schematics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A&#x02013;G</xref>, showing the expected influence of the genes significantly associated with EMT score in each cancer type. Here, we note that the processes that could elevate the FA pool were strongly associated with the EMT score. For instance, we observe significant negative correlation between the EMT score and the esterification gene (<italic>DGAT1</italic>) in 4 cancer types (BRCA, COADREAD, KIRC, LUAD), and significant positive correlation with lipase (<italic>LIPE</italic>) in 3 cancer types (BRCA, COADREAD, PRAD) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary tables 4&#x02013;10</xref>). Furthermore, the appearance of <italic>CAV1</italic> and <italic>CD36</italic> across all the cancer types in this study clearly supports the role of elevated cellular FA uptake and accumulation in the progression and maintenance of metastatic tumors. Overall, we observed that the genes in fatty acid uptake pathway constituted the largest percentage of significant genes associated with EMT score among the four categories analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5H</xref>). Additionally, the largest fractions of significant Warburg effect genes were contributed by the breast cancer dataset, whereas the colorectal cancer contributed the largest fraction of significant cellular FA uptake genes. The breast and colorectal cancer datasets together contributed nearly half of all the significant genes in this analysis.</p><p>We next derived a gene signature using a logistic regression based approach to calculate the odds ratio for the influence of each gene on EMT and patient prognosis in individual cancer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). The genes were ranked based on their influence on EMT score across all the cancer types using a cumulative rank-sum metric obtained from the odds ratio p-values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Based on the cumulative ranks, the top 5 genes identified were <italic>CPT1C, CAV1, CD36, MLXIPL,</italic> and <italic>CYP2E1.</italic> The fatty acid uptake genes <italic>CAV1</italic> and <italic>CD36,</italic> as well as the carbohydrate response element binding protein encoding <italic>MLXIPL</italic>, also exhibited significant accumulation of copy number gain in the pan-cancer metastatic tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). <italic>CPT1C</italic> was found to mediate the uptake of long-chain fatty acid across the mitochondrial membrane to activate &#x003b2;-oxidation, and promote tumor adaptation under metabolic stress conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. <italic>CYP2E1</italic> encodes the microsomal P450 2E1 protein that is involved in xenobiotic, acetone and fatty acid metabolism. <italic>CYP2E1</italic> binds to saturated fatty acids (C<sub>10</sub>-C<sub>20</sub>), arachidonic acid and linoleic acids, and catalyzes hydroxylation of fatty acids in the microsomal &#x003c9;-oxidation pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. The expression levels of <italic>CYP2E1</italic> were found to be correlated with accumulation of fats in animal models as well as in human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients, and resulted in elevated cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels as a byproduct of <italic>CYP2E1</italic>-mediated fatty acid metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>.

Using the 5-gene signature to classify the pan-cancer samples based on mRNA levels found the high expression cluster (Cluster 2) resulted in dramatic decrease in the survival rates of the patients (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>). In contrast, the clusters based on the bottom ranked genes did not influence the survival rates (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.421) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D</xref>). For validation, the prognostic value of the 5-gene signature were used to clustered two independent TCGA datasets that were not used to generate the gene signature &#x02013; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM). The clusters with high expression of the signature genes resulted in significant decrease in survival rates of both head &#x00026; neck cancer (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003) and melanoma (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006) patients. Thus, the metabolic gene signature identified in the analysis successfully predicted poor prognosis in unrelated cancer dataset, further supporting the role of fatty acid uptake and metabolism in metastatic progression of cancers.</p><p>In this study, the cellular FA uptake genes <italic>CAV1</italic> and <italic>CD36</italic> were found to be amplified in metastatic tumors, their gene expression patterns were consistently associated with EMT scores across multiple cancer types and emerged as members of the predictive gene signature.

Intriguingly, only 1 out of 187 oncogenic gene signatures were enriched in the low expression cluster, whereas nearly 29% (54 out of 187) of all oncogenic signatures were enriched in the high expression cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 12</xref>), thereby confirming the strong association between elevated expression of cellular FA uptake genes with cancer progression.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In recent years, deregulated glycolysis and fatty acid metabolism has been linked with resistance to chemotherapeutics in multiple cancer types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Consequently, the regulators of cancer cell metabolism have emerged as attractive therapeutic targets and primarily include genes that are significantly altered between normal and cancer cells, such as glucose transporters (<italic>GLUT1</italic>, <italic>GLUT4</italic>), hexokinase (<italic>HK1</italic>), pyruvate kinase (<italic>PKM2</italic>) and fatty acid synthase (<italic>FASN</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Given the prognostic impact of the activation of EMT program and metastasis, the objective of this study was to identify the metabolic alterations that are not only relevant to carcinogenesis, but are acquired during metastatic progression of cancer cells. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref> provides a summary of the genes with prognostic consequences that are significantly altered between primary and metastatic tumors (highlighted in red).</p><p>One of the prime requirements of rapidly replicating malignant cells is fulfilling increased energy demands. We found that mutations in the tumor suppressor genes that control Warburg effect, <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>STK11,</italic> uniformly influenced survival rates across all tumors. From a therapeutics perspective, gene therapy with <italic>TP53</italic> (rAd-p53, Ad5CMV-p53), and antidiabetic medication metformin, which indirectly activates <italic>STK11</italic>/AMPK activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, are currently being evaluated under multiple clinical trials for various cancer types (source: ClinicalTrials.gov). However, the mutation frequencies were not elevated in metastatic tumors, suggesting that the switch to glycolysis may occur during the early stages of cancer progression. Glycolysis produces ATP at greatly reduced efficiency as compared to mitochondrial OXPHOS and in vitro studies with malignant cancer cells have reported that OXPHOS may still contribute to the bulk of ATP produced by cancer cells depending on the availability of oxygen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. In such a scenario, alternate pathways must provide the acetyl CoA that is metabolized in the TCA cycle to produce NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> for ATP synthesis through OXPHOS. &#x003b2;-oxidation of fatty acids could be advantageous to cancer cells by providing a supply of acetyl CoA, NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> during aerobic glycolysis but would require a steady supply of the substrate, free fatty acids. The intracellular pool of free fatty acids can be positively influenced by lipolysis of stored triglycerides, elevated uptake of fatty acids from the environment, or lipogenesis using carbon from carbohydrates, amino acids or oxidized fatty acids. While the upregulation of <italic>FASN</italic> is well documented in cancer cells, we did not observe a significant change in metastatic cells. Instead, we observed significant amplification of <italic>PPARA</italic> and <italic>MXIPL</italic> in metastatic tumors which could upregulate the transcription of lipogenesis genes. Moreover, we found amplifications in the cellular FA uptake genes <italic>CAV1</italic> and <italic>CD36</italic> (MLXIPL, CAV1 and CD36 also impact patient survival rate individually, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). While recent studies showed that cancer cells activate lipid scavenging pathways during nutrient starvation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, our results suggest that metastatic cancer cells might increase the cellular FA pool by elevating the uptake of exogenous FAs. Furthermore, we observed gain of <italic>CPT1C</italic> and <italic>CYP2E1</italic> expression which may be indicative of increased mitochondrial &#x003b2;-oxidation and microsomal &#x003c9;-oxidation, respectively, in metastatic tumors.</p><p>In addition to providing energy, the elevated oxidation of FAs also affects cellular redox status by elevating the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by reducing the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>.

Recently, reduced NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratios were shown to drive the metastatic progression of MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenografts by activating AKT/mTOR and autophagy signaling pathways while increasing the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio inhibited tumor growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>.</p><p>We have identified a group of FA metabolism and uptake genes that are specifically altered in metastatic tumors, and demonstrated the clinical relevance of these alterations based upon their influence on patient survival rates. In addition, we suggest that the alterations driving the switch to aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect occur uniformly across primary and metastatic tumors. Further functional studies are warranted to understand the precise role of these alterations in tumor progression and their association with the activation of EMT program. Given the poor post-therapy survival rates in patients with advanced, metastatic tumors, the genes and associated pathways identified in this study could serve both as biomarkers as well as new therapeutic targets in future studies.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cancer-specific metabolic pathway model</title><p>We selected the enzymes and signaling or transcriptional regulators of glucose or fatty acid metabolism based on the criteria that they are altered in cancer cells. For glucose metabolism, we included the genes that are involved in the switch to aerobic glycolysis or Warburg effect in cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. This process is controlled by the oncogenes hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha or HIF1&#x003b1; (<italic>HIF1A</italic>), avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog or c-MYC (<italic>MYC</italic>) and POU domain, class 2, transcription factor 1 or OCT1 (<italic>POU2F1</italic>) that control the transcription of glycolytic enzymes, in addition to <italic>PDK1</italic> (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1) that prevents entry of pyruvate into TCA cycle by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase. The glycolytic enzymes activated by HIF1&#x003b1; include <italic>PFKFB4</italic> (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 4), which diverts glucose towards the pentose phosphate pathway, and <italic>PFKFB3</italic>, which promotes glycolysis. RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 or AKT1 activates mechanistic target of rapamycin or mTOR, which in turn activates HIF1A, whereas the tumor suppressor liver kinase B1 (<italic>STK11</italic>) activates AMP-activated protein kinase or AMPK (<italic>PRKAA1</italic>) which can inhibit the activity of mTOR. Activation of mTOR signaling results in HIF1&#x003b1; activation and expression of c-MYC and OCT1, thereby, enabling the glycolytic switch. <italic>PKM</italic> (Pyruvate kinase) catalyzes the final step of glycolysis converting phosphoenol pyruvate to pyruvate generating one molecule of ATP. However, the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase expressed at high levels in cancer cells inhibits the catalytic conversion step, and promotes the utilization of the substrates through the pentose phosphate pathway. The tumor suppressor p53 controls glycolysis by regulating the transcription of TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator or TIGAR (<italic>C12ORF5</italic>) and <italic>SCO2</italic> which regulates the assembly of ETC associated cytochrome C oxidase complex.</p><p>For fatty acid metabolism, in addition to the de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation genes altered in cancer cells, we included genes that may alter the availability of fatty acids to the cancer cells from external sources<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. ATP-citrate lyase (<italic>ACLY</italic>) controls the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from citrate, thus, linking carbohydrate metabolism to fatty acid synthesis. The conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonly-CoA is catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex (<italic>ACACA, ACACB</italic>). Fatty acid synthase (<italic>FASN</italic>) then catalyzes the condensation of malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA into fatty acid. The master regulator of fatty acid synthesis genes, Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins or SREBP (<italic>SREBF1</italic>), is in turn transcriptionally regulated by the Liver X Receptor (<italic>NR1H3</italic>) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha or PPAR-&#x003b1; (<italic>PPARA</italic>) that function as a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor (<italic>RXRA</italic>). Carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein or ChREBP (<italic>MLXIPL</italic>) regulates the transcription of lipogenic enzymes <italic>FASN, ACACA</italic> and <italic>ACACB</italic> and is activated by elevated glucose levels. The rate limiting step in mitochondrial oxidation is the transport of fatty acids across the membrane through carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). Among the different isoforms, the brain isoform <italic>CPT1C</italic> is expressed at elevated levels in cancer cells to increase FA oxidation and ATP production. PPAR-&#x003b1; induces expression of Cytochrome P450 2E1 or <italic>CYP2E1</italic> which is involved in the &#x003c9;-oxidation of fatty acids as a part of the microsomal cytochrome P450 complex. In peroxisomes, acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase (<italic>ACAA1</italic>) catalyzes the final step of &#x003b2;-oxidation yielding acetyl-CoA whereas the cytochrome P450 4A enzymes (<italic>CYP4A11, CYP4A22</italic>) catalyze microsomal &#x003c9;-hydroxylation of fatty acids in the endoplasmic reticulum. The dicarboxylic acid generated as a result of &#x003c9;-oxidation of fatty acids can serve as substrates for &#x003b2;-oxidation or serve as PPAR ligands. The balance between stored lipids and free fatty acids are regulated by diglyceride acyltransferase enzymes (<italic>DGAT1, DGAT2</italic>) which catalyze the esterification of fatty acids to triglycerides, whereas hormone-sensitive lipase (<italic>LIPE)</italic> and monoacylglycerol lipase (<italic>MGLL)</italic> produce free fatty acids by hydrolyzing triglycerides and mono-acylglycerids, respectively. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma or PPAR-&#x003b3; (<italic>PPARG</italic>) promotes lipid storage by regulating expression of esterification enzymes and opposes lipid synthesis, whereas peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta or PPAR-&#x003b4; (<italic>PPARD</italic>) promotes fatty acid transport and oxidation. The poly unsaturated fatty acid activated farnesoid X receptor or FXR (<italic>NR1H4</italic>) inhibits the activity of LXR and regulates <italic>SREBF1</italic>, <italic>PPARA</italic> and <italic>PPARG</italic>, and inhibits lipogenesis. Pregnane X receptor or PXR (<italic>NR1I2</italic>) induces the transcription of fatty acid transport protein CD36 but suppress expression of FA oxidation genes <italic>PPARA</italic> and <italic>ACAA1</italic>. The accumulation of fatty acids in the cells from exogenous sources is mediated by the transport proteins caveolin 1 (<italic>CAV1</italic>), cluster of differentiation 36 (also known as FAT, fatty acid translocase) <italic>CD36</italic> and fatty acid transport proteins FATPs (<italic>SLC27A1-6</italic>). In addition, the intracellular trafficking of fatty acids and their interactions with nuclear receptors like PPARs and LXR are regulated by fatty acid binding proteins FABPs (<italic>FABP1-7, PMP2, FABP9</italic>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mutation analysis</title><p>Pan-cancer gene-level somatic mutations data was obtained from the Cancer Browser (PANCAN AWG version 2014-08-22).

To identify the genes that were associated with activation of the EMT program in the individual cancers, we classified the genes based on their similarity to the EMT score using the nearest neighbor algorithm. The distances were calculated using Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient (family wise error rate controlled, Bonferroni&#x02019;s method), and the significant positive and negative neighbors were used to assess the overall effect on metabolism in samples in context of EMT.</p><p>We further evaluated if the expression levels of the individual genes can predict the stratification of the samples in a given cancer type by EMT score.
