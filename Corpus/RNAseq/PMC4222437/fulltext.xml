In order to elucidate the varietal dependent developmental regulation of primary and specialized metabolism, berry skins of Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz were subjected to gas chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based metabolite profiling from pre-veraison to harvest. The generated dataset was augmented with transcript profiling using RNAseq.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The analysis of the metabolite data revealed similar developmental patterns of change in primary metabolites between the two cultivars. Nevertheless, towards maturity the extent of change in the major organic acid and sugars (i.e. sucrose, trehalose, malate) and precursors of aromatic and phenolic compounds such as quinate and shikimate was greater in Shiraz compared to Cabernet Sauvignon. In contrast, distinct directional projections on the PCA plot of the two cultivars samples towards maturation when using the specialized metabolite profiles were apparent, suggesting a cultivar-dependent regulation of the specialized metabolism. Generally, Shiraz displayed greater upregulation of the entire polyphenol pathway and specifically higher accumulation of piceid and coumaroyl anthocyanin forms than Cabernet Sauvignon from veraison onwards. Transcript profiling revealed coordinated increased transcript abundance for genes encoding enzymes of committing steps in the phenylpropanoid pathway. The anthocyanin metabolite profile showed F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H-mediated delphinidin-type anthocyanin enrichment in both varieties towards maturation, consistent with the transcript data, indicating that the F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H-governed branching step dominates the anthocyanin profile at late berry development. Correlation analysis confirmed the tightly coordinated metabolic changes during development, and suggested a source-sink relation between the central and specialized metabolism, stronger in Shiraz than Cabernet Sauvignon. RNAseq analysis also revealed that the two cultivars exhibited distinct pattern of changes in genes related to abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis enzymes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Compared with CS, Shiraz showed higher number of significant correlations between metabolites, which together with the relatively higher expression of flavonoid genes supports the evidence of increased accumulation of coumaroyl anthocyanins in that cultivar. Enhanced stress related metabolism, e.g. trehalose, stilbene and ABA in Shiraz berry-skin are consistent with its relatively higher susceptibility to environmental cues.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Metabolite profiling</kwd><kwd>Grape berry metabolism</kwd><kwd>Grapevine</kwd><kwd>Transcript analysis</kwd><kwd>Metabolomics</kwd><kwd>GC-MS</kwd><kwd>LC-MS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Grape cultivars evolved from many origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and were distributed to geographical regions with different climates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] leading to the evolution of varietal specific physiology, morphology, growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Grapevine vegetative growth and canopy structure affects the amount of light reaching the grape bunch and modifies its microclimate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Moreover, the partitioning of photoassimilates and other metabolites to the bunch will also depend on the extent of vegetative growth during berry development and eventually it will determine the metabolite profile of the flesh and skin of the berry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Hence, a complex interaction between genotype, macro- and micro-climate and plant vigor will define berry metabolism and eventually wine quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Grape berry, a non-climacteric fruit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], follows a double sigmoidal growth pattern which is composed of three major phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], each characterized by changes in size, color, texture, metabolic composition and gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The hard green stage, phase I, is characterized by rapid cell growth and elongation with a concomitant massive accumulation of organic acids, hydroxyl cinnamic acid, amino acids and tannins towards the end of this phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In phase two, berry enlargement ceases, sugars start to accumulate at the expense of acids eventually leading to a rise in pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. During veraison, berries enter a second rapid growth phase with a progressive decline in acidity and increase in softness. Veraison is a stage that marks the beginning of phase III, it is associated with berry softening and fundamental metabolite changes such as the accumulation of sugars, aroma precursors and pigments, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] as well as other classes of specialized metabolites that will contribute to berry quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The rate of biochemical changes during berry development is varietal dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] as well as influenced by climatic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], irrigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and viticultural practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>The role of secondary metabolism in berries is not understood completely. Plants with fleshy and tasty fruits were likely favored during evolution by animal driven dispersal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and the pericarp and skin possibly evolved as protective tissues for developing seed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. As such, polyphenols, including numerous flavonoids as well as non-flavonoid compounds, play a central protective role in plant adaptation to the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Flavonols protect berries from UV radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], anthocyanins play a role in seed dispersal, provide protection from high temperature and UV radiation, and proanthocyanidins posses antifungal properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Flavonoids are biologically active compounds due to their antioxidant activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and contribute to organoleptic properties of the fruit and wine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>Since the draft sequence of the Pinot Noir grapevine genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], the regulation of berry development and the associated metabolic processes were the focus of an increasing number of whole-genome gene expression studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Nevertheless, there are extensive gaps in our understanding of the regulation of secondary metabolism and the differences in secondary metabolism amongst different cultivars. For example, recent transcriptomic and genomic studies on different commercial clones discovered hundreds of genes missing from the Pinot Noir reference genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Thus, more comparative studies are needed to fully elucidate the regulation of grape metabolism during berry development. Recently developed RNA-seq transcriptome profiling approaches, provides higher resolution and capability of detecting different isoforms of a transcript compared to the microarray based methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. To date, there are only a few studies in grape berry development that were performed using RNAseq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] and none in comparative studies. Moreover, given the significant post-transcriptional regulation of fruit metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], transcriptional studies are increasingly being supported by- and integrated with metabolic and proteomic data. Large-scale metabolite profiling has been applied to grape only recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] and mostly using targeted analysis of primary or secondary metabolism.</p><p>In the present study we used GC-MS and LC-MS based metabolic profiling of the berry skin to study the developmental processes characteristic of two red wine grape varieties Shiraz (SH) and Cabernet Sauvignon (CS) grown in the field in a semiarid environment in southern Israel. The gas chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (LC-MS) generated dataset was augmented with RNAseq-transcript profiles. The study aimed to examine varietal differences in the metabolism of developing berries and the underlying regulatory mechanism.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate metabolomics and RNAseq-based transcriptome data in a comparative study of berry development on two physiologically contrasting cultivars in grape.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and experimental conditions</title><p>The field experiment was conducted on four-year old commercial vines of two red wine grape varieties of <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L. (Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon) grafted on Ruggeri during the 2011 growing season. Both varieties were planted with 3&#x000a0;m spacing between rows and 1.5&#x000a0;m between vines. The vines were trained onto vertically oriented trellis in a East&#x02013;west orientation. The vineyard is located at 30.68&#x000a0;N 34.80E; with an average rainfall of 86&#x000a0;mm and an average potential evaporation of over 2000&#x000a0;mm. Soil water content was measured on an hourly basis and it is given in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1. Irrigation was applied every four days based on evaporation from evaporation pan Class A (ET<sub>pan</sub>) using an irrigation factor of 0.25. Plants were drip irrigated using in-line emitters at a flow rate of 2.2&#x000a0;L&#x000a0;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. To avoid any edge effects, only plants located in the middle of each row were used for the experiment. The experimental plot was bordered with vine row receiving a similar irrigation amount.</p></sec><sec><title>Berry quality related traits</title><p>Prior to each sampling, total soluble solids (TSS) in <sup>o</sup>BRIX were assayed from the berry juice of five different vines using a hand refractometer (Palette PR-100, Atago, USA). Berry weight was averaged from at least 15 berries selected from the middle part of representative bunches from eight plants of each cultivar on both sides (N and S) of the row. Titratable acidity measurement (g/L tartaric acid equivalents) was performed on the same samples according to the standard procedures used in Guymon and Ough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Sampling and metabolite extraction</title><p>Samples were taken for metabolic analysis at four developmental stages in both cultivars (number of days are given in reference to veraison stage): 30&#x000a0;days before veraison (DTV) (pre-veraison); veraison; 20&#x000a0;days after veraison (DAV) (post-veraison) and harvest 37 DAV for Shiraz and 53 DAV for CS. Shiraz and CS were differentially sampled at harvest in relation to the <sup>o</sup>BRIX measured. At all sampling dates, five berries representative of the middle portion of the bunch and at similar developmental stage were collected on both N and S side of a given vine-plant and pooled together. Six independent biological replicates, each consisting of the pooled berries from six separate vines, were collected in the middle section of the row in both cultivars. Skin was carefully peeled from the berries, gently removing the remaining flesh from the skin with a clean cloth. Immediately after, the tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further analysis. Ahead of extraction samples were freeze dried in a lyophilizer (VIRTIS GARDINER, N.Y. R525, Model 10-MR-TR). The freeze-dried samples were extracted for parallel metabolite profiling (LC and GC/MS) using a slightly modified version of the method described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich if not indicated otherwise. Berry skin tissue was ground using a RETCH-mill (Retsch Gmbh, 42787 Haan, Germany) with pre-chilled steel holders and grinding beads. For metabolite extraction, 70&#x000a0;mg of frozen powder were weighed and extracted in a pre-chilled methanol: chloroform: water extraction solution (2.5:1:1&#x000a0;v/v). Internal standards, (i.e. 0.2&#x000a0;mg/ml ribitol in water, 1&#x000a0;mg/ml ampicillin in water and 1&#x000a0;mg/ml corticosterone in methanol), were subsequently added. The mixture was then briefly vortexed, centrifuged for 2&#x000a0;min at 14000 RPM (microcentrifuge 5417R) and the supernatant was decanted into the new tubes. The supernatant was mixed with 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of chloroform (LC/MS grade) and 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of UPLC-grade water and then centrifuged at 14,000 RPM for 2&#x000a0;min. After that, 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of the water/methanol phase was dried in a vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf Concentrator Plus) for derivatization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>] for GC-MS analysis. The remaining water/methanol phase was transferred to UPLC vials for LC-MS analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>GC-MS derivatization and data processing</title><p>GC-MS samples from the above extraction were re-dissolved and derivatized. Eight microliters of a retention time standard mixture (0.029%&#x000a0;v/v <italic>n</italic>-dodecane, <italic>n</italic>-pentadecane, <italic>n</italic>-nonadecane, <italic>n</italic>-docosane, <italic>n</italic>-octacosane, <italic>n</italic>-dotracontane, and <italic>n</italic>-hexatriacontane dissolved in pyridine) was added.

The first three principal components accounted for 92.5% of the total variance and revealed most of the developmental and cultivar variation. The first principal component (PC1) contributed 61.45% of the variance and clearly discriminated developmental stages. Galactonate, pyruvate and leucine had high eigenvalues on PC1, indicating their strong contribution to sample distribution along this component (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S2). PC2 described 20.68% of the variance and discriminated the developmental stages veraison, mid-ripening and harvest as well as the two cultivars at harvest.

PC3 contributed 10.38% of the total variance, discriminating veraison from post-veraison stages and mainly described by caffeate, maleate, shikimate, fumarate, proline and arginine (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S2).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Metabolic shift of primary metabolism during berry development in Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz.</bold> PCA plot of PC1 versus PC2 <bold>(A)</bold> and PC1 versus PC3 <bold>(B)</bold> of metabolite profiles of Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz at four berry development stages.

Thus the data set was normalized to the values at veraison, log 2 transformed, and the relative changes at pre-veraison, post-veraison and harvest stages in relation to veraison were hence expressed as log2 [fold change]. Nevertheless, it should be noted that direct comparisons between developmental stages of the two cultivars is not possible, rather the cultivars will be compared by investigating the patterns of change of metabolites during berry development. Overall, central metabolites exhibited a similar pattern of change in the two cultivars (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The earlier stage of berry development was characterized by high relative abundance of central metabolites compared to later stages with a few exceptions. As expected, sucrose abundance followed an inverse trend accumulating progressively towards harvest. Fructose and phosphate conjugates of fructose and glucose increased toward veraison, later declining towards harvest. Other metabolites including myo-inositol and galactose also peaked at pre-veraison and declined thereafter. Raffinose exhibited the highest abundance at pre-veraison, followed by a steep reduction at mid-ripening and accumulation at harvest. With similar trend of sucrose accumulation in the two cultivars, trehalose progressively accumulated in both cultivars with higher magnitude in Shiraz. Glycolytic intermediates glycerate and pyruvate gradually declined during development in both cultivars but with significantly higher changes between developmental stages in CS compared to Shiraz (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S3).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of primary metabolite pathways with log2 transformed fold change normalized to the veraison stage of each cultivar.</bold> Different colors represent the increase (red) or decrease (blue) of the metabolites fold change as indicated in the color index. n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.

However, pyruvate derived amino acids, alanine and valine, had a constant abundance during berry development for both cultivars (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Coupled to a pronounced decrease in glycerate, amino acids, serine and glycine, that are derived from glycerate progressively decreased in relative abundance in both cultivars towards harvest but the reduction was higher in Shiraz compared to CS. The 2-oxoglutarate derived amino acids glutamate, arginine, ornithine and glutamine, and the oxaloacetate derived amino acids aspartate and threonine had a progressive decrease in relative abundance in both cultivars. Among shikimate-derived amino acids, phenylalanine showed maximum accumulation at veraison followed by a progressive reduction in relative abundance. The extent of reduction at harvest compared to its level at veraison was somewhat higher in Shiraz compared to CS. The other shikimate-derived amino acids, tyrosine and tryptophan, remained at relatively steady levels following veraison. In contrast to most amino acids, proline relative abundance increased towards maturity in both cultivars (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>TCA cycle intermediates, citrate, succinate, fumarate and malate showed similar patterns of change in relative abundance declining progressively towards maturity. However, the extent of decrease was variety dependent. For example, the major organic acid, malate decreased by 6-fold in Shiraz compared to 4-fold reduction in CS. Reduction in citrate level was also higher in Shiraz (~9-fold) compared to CS (7-fold). The lesser abundant organic acids, succinate and maleate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>], decreased toward maturity by 18-fold and 24-fold in CS compared to 4-fold and 6-fold respectively, in Shiraz (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>Quinate and shikimate links the primary metabolism to the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways. These metabolites exhibited high reduction across berry development. Quinate and shikimate decreased on average by 14- and 20-fold respectively, at harvest in both cultivars. Cinnamate, the immediate precursor of the phenylpropanoid pathway, showed higher accumulation at pre-veraison followed by a progressive reduction towards maturity in both cultivars.</p></sec><sec><title>LC-MS based metabolic changes across berry development</title><p>LC-MS based metabolic profiling revealed major changes in the relative abundance of berry-skin specific metabolites during development. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the dataset revealed a directional projection, on the first principle component (PC1), of metabolic changes governed by the developmental process in both cultivars (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>); namely PC1 explained the largest variance (82.96%, Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). PC2 explained 11.14% of the variance corresponding to metabolite changes occurring in the berry-skin between pre-veraison to veraison in both cultivars (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). When extracted the eigenvalues of the metabolite relative impact on the distribution of the samples on the PC plot, malvidin 3-<italic>O</italic>-(6&#x02033;-acetyl-glucoside), malvidin-3-glucoside and malvidin 3-<italic>O</italic>-(6&#x02033;-<italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-glucoside) appeared to be the largest contributors to the separation along PC1 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S2). The same metabolites together with tartrate, contributed to data distribution along PC2. Notably, cultivar variability was shown along PC3 but it explained only 4.86% of the variability within the dataset (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). Nevertheless we could identify metabolic changes specific to the two cultivars. Respectively, peonidin 3-<italic>O</italic>-(6&#x02033;-<italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-glucoside), petunidin 3-<italic>O</italic>-(6&#x02033;-<italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-glucoside), malvidin 3-<italic>O</italic>-(6&#x02033;-<italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-glucoside) and malvidin 3-<italic>O</italic>-(6&#x02033;-acetyl-glucoside) contributed to the distribution of the two cultivars on PC3 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S2). When investigating the metabolic data for the cultivar differences indicated by the PCA, the coumaroyl form of anthocyanin was shown to specifically and significantly accumulate in Shiraz at veraison, post-veraison and harvest, while high levels of malvidin 3-<italic>O</italic>-(6&#x02033;-acetyl-glucoside) relative to Shiraz characterized the berry-skin of CS during these stages.

The two cultivars have similar patterns of accumulation of the stilbene, resveratrol, which exhibited a progressive accumulation in the berry skin towards maturity. In contrast, the stilbene, viniferin, did not change in abundance during development in both cultivars, while the pattern of change in the glucoside form of resveratrol, piceid, differed between cultivars; it gradually accumulated in Shiraz while keeping at comparable levels in CS following veraison (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>Flavonols, the immediate competitors of the precursors for the anthocyanin pathway, showed mild induction following veraison stage with the exception of quercetin glucoside, which accumulated at pre-veraison and post veraison stages with a transient reduction in relative abundance at veraison. Unlike the other flavonols, kaempferol glucuronide and rutin decreased in relative abundance progressively towards maturity (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). All the flavanol classes (catechin, epicatechin and procyanidin dimers) decreased progressively in abundance towards maturity in both cultivars but the extent of reduction was more intense in Shiraz compared to CS (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) likely due to competition with the massive anthocyanin accumulation.</p><p>Anthocyanins, as expected, displayed progressive accumulation across development in both cultivars.

With flavonoid 3&#x02032;-hydroxylase (F3&#x02032;H), dihydrokaempferol is converted to dihydroquercetin and supports the biosynthesis of glucoside, acetyl and coumaroyl forms of cyanidin and peonidin (cyanidin-type anthocyanins), while with flavonoid 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032; hydroxylase (F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H) it can be converted to dihydromyricetin, that gives rise to the glucoside, acetyl, coumaroyl and caffeoyl forms of delphinidin, petunidin and malvidin (delphinidin-type anthocyanins). Cyanidin and peonidin glucoside biosynthesis had a mild but significant induction in ripening stages after veraison. In both cultivars the results indicated (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) that all anthocyanins derived from the dihydromyricetin pathway were highly induced compared with the parallel pathway derived from dihydroquercetin (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

Metabolites in the same biosynthetic pathway mostly displayed a positive correlation (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S4A &#x00026; S4B). The highest correlations were observed between primary and specialized metabolite classes. Anthocyanins and flavonols exhibited mostly similar trends of correlation, reflected in positive <italic>r</italic> values between the two classes and in negative <italic>r</italic> values with organic acids and most of other identified primary metabolites.

Taking together, the lower diameter of the Shiraz network (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S4C) suggests a tighter coordinated behavior of metabolism during the development of Shiraz compared to CS. This suggestion is also supported by higher transitivity score of the Shiraz network (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S4C), i.e. the probability of a network to form clusters with stronger interconnections.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptomic changes during berry development</title><p>Sampling berries with similar developmental stages can be difficult due to variability even between clusters on the same vine and among berries within clusters.

Interestingly genes involved in the hydroxylation of dihydrokaempferol via putative flavonoid 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032; hydroxylase (F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H) (VIT_06s0009g02970 and VIT_06s0009g02840) that lead to anthocyanin precursor, delphinidin, significantly increased as the berry developed from veraison to post-veraison stage in both cultivars. In contrast, the parallel biosynthetic pathway that utilizes the same precursor, dihydrokaempferol to another anthocyanin precursor (cyanidin) via the enzyme flavonoid 3&#x02032; hydroxylase (F3&#x02032;H) did not show significant increased expression in Shiraz while being downregulated in CS from veraison to mid-ripening stage (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S5). Previous studies showed that high expression of F3&#x02032;H and F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H correlated with the composition of flavonols, flavanols and some anthocyanins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>]. Hence, F3&#x02032;H as an early acting flavonoid gene can provide precursor for flavanol and cyanidin type of anthocyanin whereas F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H might divert the flux to delphinidin derivatives at later stages of berry development. Thus, the significantly higher expression of F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H transcripts at postharvest is presumably involved in polyphenol maturation. Our analysis of metabolites and transcripts suggest a consistent association between metabolites and related gene transcripts in the polyphenol biosynthesis (Figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p>The cuticular membrane of grape berry, which is composed of a wax layer that protects the fruit from desiccation and injuries. Three putative wax synthase-coding transcripts (VIT_15s0046g00590, VIT_15s0046g00520 and VIT_03s0063g00050) decreased significantly in abundance from veraison, while three other wax synthase-coding transcripts (VIT_15s0046g00470, VIT_19s0090g01340 and VIT_19s0090g01350) were induced significantly as the berry developed from veraison to the mid-ripening stage in CS; this was not so in Shiraz berry skins, where a down regulation of two of the wax-synthesis related genes (VIT_15s0046g00590 and VIT_15s0046g00520) was detected and only one was significantly upregulated (VIT_15s0046g00470) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S5). Our results partly contrast with previous microarray transcriptomic studies where maximum wax synthase-coding transcripts were shown at veraison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">99</xref>]. The two cultivars exhibited differential expression in two different transcripts coding for universal stress protein (USP). Shiraz exhibited greater changes (3.2- and 2.4-fold changes for VIT_06s0004g05670 and VIT_08s0007g01360, respectively) compared to changes in CS (2.4- and 1.7-fold changes for VIT_07s0005g01290 and VIT_08s0007g01360, respectively) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S5). These data are in line with previous results where we showed a more pronounced drought related response in Shiraz to progressive water deficit compared to CS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>].</p><p>Expectedly, many phytohormones related genes involved in the berry ripening process showed changes in transcription level (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S6) in both cultivars as the berry developed from veraison to post-veraison stage. For example, a total of 19 genes related to ABA metabolism showed differential expression in development and cultivar specificity, i.e. an upregulation of ABA related genes was shown in Shiraz, whereas a repression of the same process was evident in CS (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S6). The expression of genes related with ethylene biosynthesis also highly changed in expression during development while showing similar trends in the two cultivars (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S6). Similarly, brassinosteroid biosynthesis related genes were shown to change significantly in the two cultivars but to different extents. Namely, in CS, two genes upregulated and eight genes downregulated while in Shiraz three genes were upregulated while five were downregulated. In relation to jasmonate biosynthesis, the two cultivars upregulated one gene, while showing a greater downregulation of the process in CS (five genes) than Shiraz (two genes, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S6).</p></sec><sec><title>Gene enrichment analysis</title><p>The results of functional classification on classified genes using Expander enrichment analysis tool are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S5.

Among the classified genes, Shiraz exhibited higher enrichment in carbohydrate and specialized metabolic processes, whereas lipid, developmental and DNA/RNA processes were over represented in CS berries (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S5).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cultivar differences in berry metabolism and its regulation by endogenous and environmental cues during development give rise to the distinct varieties in wine flavor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">100</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">102</xref>]. Light, temperature and water demand are significant factors affecting plant growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">103</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">105</xref>] . In this respect, Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz were recently shown to harbor different hydraulic behavior and water use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">106</xref>], confirmed in the field in the present study measuring the volumetric soil water content (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1), and responded differently to terminal drought in respect to leaf metabolism and vegetative physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Previously, separate investigations on berry skin microarray analysis of Cabernet Sauvignon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and RNAseq of Shiraz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] reported transcriptional profile and dynamics of gene expression during the course of berry development. Here a comparative parallel analysis of metabolites and RNA transcripts by RNAseq of the two cultivars enabled a comprehensive description of the commonalities and differences in the regulation of the metabolic processes during berry development.</p><p>During the early stages of berry development the berry skin is entirely green and photosynthetically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">107</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">108</xref>], contributing locally to the biosynthesis of sugars and other organic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">109</xref>] that will later be used as substrate in the specialized metabolism. Following veraison, however, a progressive decline in the sugar content, as here shown, is known to occur in support of a continuous use of carbohydrate resources produced via photosynthesis as recently reported by Dai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Most of the identified organic acids showed progressive decrease in both cultivars from veraison to berry ripening. The metabolite profiles were supported by the transcript profiles indicating a down regulation of the TCA cycle in both CS and Shiraz as the berry developed from veraison to 20 DAV. Our results are in accordance with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] indicating that the progressive decline of TCA cycle activity likely matches the increased demand of supply for precursors in the synthesis of carbohydrates, amino acids and subsequent flavonoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Nevertheless a larger carbon demand may be channeled into the specialized metabolism of Shiraz and specifically in the enhanced production of anthocyanins, particularly coumaroyl forms (discussed below). For example greater sucrose accumulation was exhibited in CS than in Shiraz from veraison to maturation; lower accumulation of quinate and shikimate, precursors of the polyphenol metabolism, were measured in Shiraz during later stages of maturation, suggesting an increased integration into downstream processes (anthocyanins production). Correlation analysis further supported the evidence of highly coordinated metabolic changes between central and specialized metabolism. The occurrence of a greater number of significant correlations in the Shiraz metabolite profiling, the stronger properties of the metabolic network of Shiraz compared with CS and the relatively higher expression of flavonoid genes suggest that Shiraz metabolism has a relatively tighter coordination of the metabolic pathways investigated.</p><p>The progressive development to maturation was characterized by the increased expression of a high number of transcripts putatively encoding for phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), stilbene synthase, chalcone synthase and chalcone isomerase; these were upregulated in both cultivars, but more significantly in Shiraz. Concomitantly, at the metabolite level, shikimate content was substantially reduced. An intermediate metabolite that links primary metabolism to the polyphenol biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">110</xref>], shikimate is the precursor of aromatic amino acid, phenylalanine, which was decreased in relative abundance towards maturity in coordination with higher content of downstream polyphenols. Changes in metabolite (Phe) and related transcripts in Shiraz were greater than CS, indicating a coordinated shift of central metabolism fueling the biosynthesis of specialized compounds in both cultivars, but to a greater extent in Shiraz. The continuous supply of nutrients during ripening via phloem from matured leaves fuels berry metabolic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">111</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is tempting to hypothesize that the commencement of specialized metabolism in the skin at veraison is supported by the biosynthesis and accumulation of primary substrates, e.g. sugars and organic acids including shikimate, via localized production of photoassimilates during the pre-veraison stages. The role of photosynthesis in the fleshy fruits was addressed recently in developing tomatoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B112">112</xref>]. The results showed that at least under the conditions used fruit photosynthesis was not necessary for fruit energy metabolism or development, but it was necessary for properly timed seed development. The role of photosynthesis in organs shifting from autotrophic to hetrotrophic tissue was investigated in green seeds too. Here the results showed that photosynthesis contributed to maintain energy and oxygen levels over a metabolic-promotive threshold in a tissue that subsequently would become dense and hypoxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B113">113</xref>]. These contradicting results prompt for more work to elucidate the role of localized photosynthesis to tissue development. Berry maturation was also accompanied by enhanced stress related metabolism such as trehalose, stilbene and ABA suggesting for a more susceptible Shiraz to environmental cues, likely related with the conditions in the field, reflected in high radiation and temperature. In support of this hypothesis in a recent study under progressive drought conditions Shiraz responded with greater alterations in the central metabolism of the leaf and by the accumulation of stress related compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>].</p><sec><title>The two cultivars exhibited similar patterns in transcripts and metabolites of the flavonoid pathway, but differed in their magnitude of change</title><p>Anthocyanins make up a significant portion of berry skin flavonoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">114</xref>] and five classes (cyanidin, peonidin, delphinidin, petunidin and malvidin) are commonly found in <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> grape with their glucosides, acetyl-glucosides, coumaroyl-glucosides, peonidin and malvidin caffeoyl-glucosides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>]. Dihydrokaempferol is a common substrate for F3&#x02032;H and F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H to produce their corresponding cyanidin-type and delphinidin-type anthocyanins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The two enzymes, F3&#x02032;H and F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H, belong to the cytochrome p450 protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">115</xref>] and compete a common precursor for the synthesis of red and blue anthocyanins, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">116</xref>]. Previous phylogenetic analysis indicated that F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H was recruited from F3&#x02032;H before the divergence of angiosperms and gymnosperms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">117</xref>]. In the current study transcripts coding for F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H increased significantly in relative abundance from veraison to post veraison stages in both cultivars. The increase in F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H transcript abundance was coupled to a decrease of F3&#x02032;H transcript abundance and with higher accumulation of delphinidin-type anthocyanins in the downstream steps of this pathway. Presumably F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H plays a key role in driving the phenylpropanoid substrate flux towards delphinidin-type anthocyanin pathways. Mattivi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] also suggested that higher F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;OH activity would direct anthocyanin modification towards delphinidin-type anthocyanin forms. Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">118</xref>] demonstrated the greater increase in transcript abundance of F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H genes under UV treatment compared with the changes in transcript abundance of F3&#x02032;H genes in Antarctic moss. Perhaps, F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H genes are highly associated with strategies to cope with increased stress during berry ripening.</p><p>In the present study the coumaroyl form of anthocyanins were accumulated in Shiraz to a significantly higher extent compared to CS (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S8) towards the later stage of berry development and this coincided with the increase in the level of phenylpropanoid-related gene transcripts. The acylation step of anthocyanin biosynthesis is mediated by anthocyanin acyltransferase which links aromatic constituents to the C6&#x02032; position of the glucosyl group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">119</xref>]. This step of biosynthesis promotes color stability and intensity of anthocyanins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">120</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122">122</xref>]. Our results are in agreement with substantial cultivar variability in coumaroyl forms of anthocyanins as previously reported by Mazza et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">123</xref>] and Boss et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124">124</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Shiraz showed enhanced stilbene metabolism</title><p>A significant cultivar specificity was observed in the stilbene metabolism and regulation. Specifically, Shiraz displayed a significant upregulation of many STS genes during ripening, which was not observed in CS. The transcript profile was in accordance with the content of resveratrol and piceid, which accumulated in Shiraz more than in CS. These findings indicate a differential regulation of stilbene metabolism between the two cultivars and confirm the high correlation of STS transcript level and stilbene compounds abundance in grape berry skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">125</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B126">126</xref>]. Having said that, the branching between stilbene and flavonoid metabolism may imply a competition for the same precursors. However the concomitant accumulation of anthocyanins in Shiraz suggests that the entire polyphenol pathway is upregulated in this cultivar compared with CS, possibly as a result to local climate conditions (expressed by the stress related genes and metabolites) and at the expense of primary C substrates (e.g. sucrose).</p></sec><sec><title>Shiraz exhibited enhanced transcription of phytohormone related genes</title><p>The role of phytohormones in relation to berry ripening with their coordinated interaction with other signal molecules has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B127">127</xref>].

Endogenous ABA was associated with sugar metabolism in water stressed grapevine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B131">131</xref>].

Our data indicates upregulation of ABA related genes in Shiraz and indeed associated with varietal specific enhanced anthocyanin accumulation and specifically coumaroyl anthocyanin forms. Cramer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B138">138</xref>] demonstrated that among the genes related to hormone metabolism, ABA related transcripts changed the most in response to water and salinity stresses. Given the recently established differences in stress response between Shiraz and CS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">106</xref>], a possible explanation for the enhanced ABA-related genes and other stress related processes, could be related to magnitude of stress experienced by that cultivar under the condition of growth in the experimental field, e.g. high evapotranspiration and radiation and low humidity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present comparative study showed a tight coordination between polyphenol metabolism and respective transcripts in the developing berries of the two cultivars. The inverse regulation of the two committing steps of phenylpropanoid metabolism, F3&#x02032;H and F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H, sharing a common substrate, was reflected by the metabolite profiles of the two parallel downstream anthocyanin pathways.
