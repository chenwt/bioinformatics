New, curative medicines are needed urgently. Herein, we develop novel models to facilitate drug development: EGS strain <italic>T. gondii</italic> forms cysts <italic>in vitro</italic> that induce oocysts in cats, the gold standard criterion for cysts. These cysts highly express <italic>cytochrome b</italic>. Using these models, we envisioned, and then created, novel 4-(1<italic>H</italic>)-quinolone scaffolds that target the cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> complex Q<sub>i</sub> site, of which, a substituted 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinolin-4-one inhibits active infection (IC<sub>50</sub>, 30&#x02009;nM) and cysts (IC<sub>50</sub>, 4&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) <italic>in vitro,</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (25&#x02009;mg/kg), and drug resistant <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (IC<sub>50</sub>, &#x0003c;30&#x02009;nM), with clinically relevant synergy. Mutant yeast and co-crystallographic studies demonstrate binding to the <italic>bc</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> complex Q<sub>i</sub> site.

Although this parasite is present in the brains of 2&#x02013;3 billion persons worldwide, consequences are unknown. Neurobehavioral abnormalities and differences in serum cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were associated with seropositivity in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Estimates of costs for available suboptimal medicines to treat active, primary ocular, gestational, and congenital infections, in just the U.S. and Brazil, exceed $5 billion per year (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Current treatments against active <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites can have side effects such as hypersensitivity, kidney stones, and bone marrow suppression, limiting their use<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Latent bradyzoites are not significantly affected by any medicines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Atovaquone partially, and transiently, limits cyst burden in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, but resistance develops with clinical use<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Thus, <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection is incurable with recrudescence from latent parasites posing a continual threat. Improved medicines are needed urgently. Molecular targets shared by <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>Plasmodia</italic> make re-purposing compounds a productive strategy.</p><p>Critical flaws and limitations of available methods and models for developing medicines to cure <italic>T. gondii</italic> infections include lack of <italic>in vitro</italic> culture systems for cysts and scalable, easy to use animal models for screening compounds. To address these challenges, we characterized the EGS parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), isolated in 1994 from amniotic fluid of a congenitally infected Brazilian fetus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, that form cyst-like structures <italic>in vitro.</italic> In our characterization of EGS <italic>in vitro</italic>, herein, we discovered that true cysts develop, making EGS especially useful for drug development. EGS parasites can infect zebrafish, and we have characterized this, as well as a fluorescent tachyzoite and cyst assay in this new model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Further, cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> expression is markedly increased in encysted EGS bradyzoites suggesting cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> might be a viable drug target for this life stage. This mitochondrial membrane bound protein complex cytochome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>, part of the electron transport chain responsible for generating ubiquinone for pyrimidine biosynthesis in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, is the molecular target of the naphthoquinone, atovaquone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Partial efficacy, rapid emergence of drug resistance in malaria and toxoplasmosis limit clinical usefulness of atovaquone. We present new 4-(1<italic>H</italic>)-quinolone scaffolds that target the Q<sub>i</sub> site of cytochrome <italic>bc1</italic> in apicomplexan parasites. Our lead 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinolin-4-one compound, MJM170, is highly effective against apicomplexan parasites and has substantially enhanced solubility compared with other reported quinolones due to its&#x02019; new scaffold. Direct visualisation in the crystallographic structure opens the way to design a new generation of compounds for both parasites.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Characterization of EGS strain develops novel <italic>in vitro</italic> models to test compounds</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Genotyping and Phylogenetic Analysis of EGS</title><p>We isolated and sequenced genomic DNA from the EGS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> parasite, which formed cysts when grown in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) in culture, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> (left panel).

All other <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains cultured for more than 30 passages, as EGS was since the 1990s, lose the ability to produce oocysts when fed to cats (JP Dubey, personal observations, 1975&#x02013;2015).

Oocysts also formed 10 days after feeding cats mouse brains infected with EGS stably transfected with tachyzoite SAG1 promoter-driven mcherry, and bradyzoite BAG1 promoter-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP), and merozoite promoter-driven blue fluorescent protein, engineered to facilitate creation of automated, scalable <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays. <italic>In vitro</italic>, these promoters did not provide a fluorescence signal robust enough to detect differences between 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> and 650 parasites useful in scalable assays (data not shown).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>EGS is virulent in Mice</title><p>When these EGS oocysts were fed to mice they produced disease indistinguishable from other virulent Brazilian strains.

Interestingly, EGS transcription was influenced by host cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).

We have developed new models to facilitate discovery of curative treatments for toxoplasmosis. We have characterized the Brazilian <italic>T. gondii</italic> isolate called EGS that was known to be morphologically similar to encysted bradyzoites in tissue culture. We further validate the cystic nature of these EGS infected cultures, since they are able to induce the intra-intestinal life cycle when fed to cats ultimately resulting in oocyst secretion. This is the first such description of this phenotype and provides definitive proof that this unique parasite has a true cyst phenotype when maintained <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our data also provide a number of other major conceptual advances on EGS by demonstrating the following: (i) Genome sequencing of this EGS isolate demonstrates that EGS has a typical Brazilian virulent genotype and phylogeny, (ii) EGS is a haplogroup 4 <italic>T. gondii.</italic> Consistent with a genotype that is known to be pathogenic and virulent for mice, we demonstrate that EGS oocyst induced infection is similar to that of other virulent Brazilian parasites. For example, mice fed EGS oocysts demonstrated ileal parasites causing necrosis, as well as pneumonitis, encephalitis and systemic infection leading to death. This indicates that the ability to form cysts in culture does not alter the pathogenicity of EGS in mice. However, potentially relevant to its <italic>in vitro</italic> bradyzoite phenotype, full genome sequencing revealed that it has nonsynonymous single nucleotide repeat sequence differences from other Brazilian and canonical U.S. and European parasites which do not share its <italic>in vitro</italic> bradyzoite phenotype. EGS has a non-synonymous mutation in a bradyzoite repressor, Apetela 2(AP2) IV-iv, plant like transcription factor. AP2s interact with HATs and HDACs to modulate transcriptional signatures in apicomplexan parasites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>. This Apetela 2 plant like transcription factor gene is known to drive tachyzoite switch by repressing bradyzoite genes. If the observed substitution results in a defective or non-functional molecule, this could provide an explanation for the observed bradyzoite phenotype of EGS parasites. This is consistent with our findings that EGS in HFF forms cysts by 24 hours, characterized by BAG1, and Dolichos staining at 24, 48, and 96&#x02009;hours after infection. These cysts gradually enlarge until 48&#x02013;96&#x02009;hrs in culture, when single <italic>T. gondii</italic> begin to destroy HFF monolayers. These are the cultures of bradyzoites in cysts that when fed to cats ~48&#x02009;hours after infection form oocysts which are virulent in mice, providing definitive proof of an <italic>in vitro</italic> bradyzoite phenotype for the EGS strain of <italic>T. gondii.</italic></p><p>The transcriptomic studies with this EGS isolate have provided critical insights into host cell mechanisms that are a prominent part of the ability of the encysted parasite to persist in this untreatable life cycle stage, and biologic consequences of such persistent infection. RNAseq and miR seq of EGS infected human host cells included human fibroblasts, monocytic and neuronal stem cells with this encysted EGS strain parasite. These provide an understanding of the types of perturbations of biologically relevant host cells this bradyzoite life cycle stage can cause, providing insights into unique aspects of pathogenesis of this infection with untreatable cysts and its consequences. We found that EGS modifies critical host cell pathways. For example we find <italic>in vitro</italic> modulations of host cell pathways in human, primary neuronal stem cells are the same as those associated with modulation of host cell replication as seen with malignancies, and in neurodegenerative diseases. Further, it is noteworthy that the level of a microRNA that specifies apoptosis in eye and brain cells is markedly down modulated by this EGS bradyzoite which would inhibit host protective apoptotic mechanisms allowing parasites to persist in brain and eye without a critical protective mechanism. EGS, as an encysted bradyzoite, clearly alters biologic processes including cell cycle, cell death, alternative splicing, protein synthesis, protein folding and ubiquitination and down regulates hsa-miR-708-5p that specifies apoptosis in neuronal and retinal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>.</p><p>RNA and MiR sequencing and transcriptomic analyses of the EGS parasites also identified molecular targets that are critical for the bradyzoite life cycle stage in the parasite as well. These molecular targets include cytochrome <italic>b,</italic> as critically increased in dormant, encysted parasites.

Our work provides a new means to identify stage specific molecular targets, and emphasizes that cytochrome <italic>bc 1</italic> complex is a critical target. The transcriptome of EGS parasites in HFF over time are similar to those of <italic>in vivo</italic> bradyzoites in terms of known critical genes modified. Finally, EGS presents a much-needed assay for identifying novel molecular targets present in bradyzoites <italic>in vitro</italic>. EGS was also useful to evaluate the effect of inhibitors on encysted bradyzoites <italic>in vitro.</italic></p><p>Recent crystallographic studies with the bovine cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> complex allowed us to rationally design a novel compound to target the Q<sub>i</sub> site of cytochrome <italic>b</italic>.

Studies of yeast and malaria mutants, as surrogate assays, and co-crystallography studies with bovine cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> confirm the mechanism of action/target for MJM170. The co-crystal structure of MJM170 in complex with bovine cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> reveals a clear binding mode within the Q<sub>i</sub> site. Using homology models of the apicomplexan Qi sites, there are clear differences between the binding sites of the apicomplexan and mammalian orthologs which can be used to fine-tune the selectivity of our scaffold towards apicomplexan <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub>.
