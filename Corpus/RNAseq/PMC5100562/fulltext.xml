The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAP II recruits chromatin modifying enzymes to promoters, allowing for transcription initiation or repression. Specific CTD phosphorylation marks facilitate recruitment of chromatin modifiers, transcriptional regulators, and RNA processing factors during the transcription cycle. However, the readable code for recruiting such factors is still not fully defined and how CTD modifications affect related families of genes or regional gene expression is not well understood. Here, we examine the effects of manipulating the Y<sub>1</sub>S<sub>2</sub>P<sub>3</sub>T<sub>4</sub>S<sub>5</sub>P<sub>6</sub>S<sub>7</sub> heptapeptide repeat of the CTD of RNAP II in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> by substituting non-phosphorylatable alanines for Ser2 and/or Ser7 and the phosphomimetic glutamic acid for Ser7. Global gene expression analyses were conducted using splicing-sensitive microarrays and validated via RT-qPCR. The CTD mutations did not affect pre-mRNA splicing or snRNA levels. Rather, the data revealed upregulation of subtelomeric genes and alteration of the repressive histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) landscape. The data further indicate that H3K9me and expression status are not fully correlated, suggestive of CTD-dependent subtelomeric repression mechansims that act independently of H3K9me levels.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>02 November 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the Rpb1 subunit of RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II) plays key roles in regulating gene expression (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In humans and mice, the CTD consists of 52 heptapeptide repeats of the consensus sequence Y<sub>1</sub>S<sub>2</sub>P<sub>3</sub>T<sub>4</sub>S<sub>5</sub>P<sub>6</sub>S<sub>7</sub>, or variants thereof. The CTDs of the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> comprise 29 and 26 heptad repeats, respectively, suggesting that the length of the CTD repeat array may be correlated with complexity of the organism (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The CTD heptads are dynamically modified during the transcription cycle (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of serines 2, 5 and 7, threonine 4, and tyrosine 1, along with <italic>cis-trans</italic> isomerization of prolines 3 and 6, allow for a vast combinatorial complexity of CTD primary structures that inscribe a readable &#x02018;code&#x02019; to orchestrate recruitment, activity, and egress of numerous cellular factors that govern gene expression (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Different phosphorylation or modification states of the CTD have been shown to play important roles in coordinating the coupling of RNA processing pathways. For example, RNAP II recruits to its CTD histone methyltransferases that generate the relaxed chromatin necessary for transcription initiation (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Phosphorylation of Ser5 recruits enzymes that cap the 5&#x02032; end of nascent mRNAs. Indeed, in fission yeast, fusion of the capping enzymes RNA triphosphatase and RNA guanylyltransferase to RNAP II can rescue the lethality of mutants unable to be phosphorylated at Ser5, indicating that the chief essential function of Ser5 phosphorylation is the recruitment of the capping machinery (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylations are important in directing co-transcriptional methylation of lysines 4 and 36 of the histone H3 (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>During transcription elongation, Ser2 phosphorylation levels increase, and these have been shown to be important for recruitment of splicing factors such as Prp40, U2AF65 and U2 snRNA (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Others have followed this finding by demonstrating splicing defects of specific reporter introns in human U2OS cells and chicken DT40 cells containing <italic>S2A</italic> mutations (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Whereas global effects of the <italic>S2A</italic> mutation on gene expression have been examined previously (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), the methods used were not optimized to examine splicing, leaving unknown the full extent of the genome-wide impact of Ser2 phosphorylation on splicing. Here we used splicing-sensitive microarrays to examine pre-mRNA splicing in <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells mutated at CTD phosphorylation sites Ser2 and/or Ser7. Our results weigh against a role for CTD Ser2/7 phosphorylation in pre-mRNA splicing, but reveal an unexpected relationship with chromatin modification and gene expression in the subtelomeric regions of the genome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cell growth</title><p>Strains were inoculated in 5 ml of YES medium and grown to saturation at 30&#x000b0;C.

However, while RNAseq is superior to microarrays for <italic>de novo</italic> discovery of introns, the low read depths typically obtained for either exon-exon or exon-intron boundaries can hinder meaningful quantitative analyses of genome-wide changes in splicing efficiency. Therefore, the genome-wide effects of these CTD mutations were examined here using custom-designed, splicing-sensitive microarrays that assay changes in gene expression for all annotated protein-coding genes in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, while simultaneously assaying splicing efficiency for every known intron in the genome (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). For each of the four CTD mutants, multiple replicate arrays were performed comparing relative RNA levels in the mutant and <italic>WT</italic> strains (see Materials and Methods). As a basis of comparison, we also examined the splicing defect associated with a mutation in the <italic>prp2</italic> gene, the <italic>S. pombe</italic> homolog of U2AF-65, which had been previously examined using this same microarray platform (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, none of the CTD mutants showed a global defect in splicing. The data, which are displayed in groups of three (total mRNA, pre-mRNA and mRNA) for each of the mutants, were arranged such that the &#x0223c;4800 splicing events were ordered by the behavior of the pre-mRNA species, with those showing the largest increase appearing at the top and those with the largest decrease at the bottom. As expected, when examining the <italic>prp2-1</italic> data, pre-mRNA accumulation can be detected for the majority of introns in the genome. Accumulation of the pre-mRNA species in this mutant is accompanied, in most cases, by a decrease in the level of mature mRNA, consistent with the <italic>prp2-1</italic> allele causing a <italic>bona fide</italic> splicing defect. By contrast, very few pre-mRNAs accumulated in the <italic>rpb1-CTD</italic> mutants. Moreover, as seen in the top insets of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, for the relatively small proportion of transcripts for which the pre-mRNA levels did increase in the <italic>rpb1-CTD</italic> mutants, the majority showed a simultaneous increase in the level of mature mRNA.

Because SAM assesses the statistical significance of a change without necessarily considering the biological significance of those changes, we further restricted our analyses to those transcripts which both satisfied the SAM significance test and were at least two-fold changed in their overall gene expression. By these criteria, each of the mutants caused statistically significant changes in gene expression: a total of 192 genes were misregulated in the <italic>S2A</italic> mutant, 167 in the <italic>S2A/S7A</italic> mutant, 57 in the <italic>S7A</italic> mutant, and 137 in the <italic>S7E</italic> mutant (Supplemental Table S1). That more genes were misregulated in <italic>S2A, S2A/S7A</italic>, and <italic>S7E</italic> than in <italic>S7A</italic> correlates with the observations that <italic>S7A</italic> cells exhibited no discernible growth defect at temperatures between 18 and 37&#x000b0;C, whereas the other mutants did exhibit cold-sensitive or heat-sensitive growth defects (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In general, increases in gene expression outnumbered decreases in gene expression. Moreover, significant overlap of gene expression targets was seen between the different mutants, in particular for <italic>S2A</italic> and <italic>S2A/S7A</italic>, which share more than half of their respective targets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Effect of <italic>rpb1</italic>-CTD mutants on <italic>S. pombe</italic> transcriptomes.

In spite of technical differences in processing the samples (e.g. the use of total RNA versus poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA), reasonable correlations were seen between the RNAseq and microarray datasets comparing <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>S2A</italic> strains (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.54), as well as the <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>S2A/S7A</italic> strains (Perason correlation coefficient of 0.59). Likely owing to the smaller number of genes showing misregulation in <italic>S7A</italic>, a lower correlation was seen for these datasets (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.40). When only considering sets of genes that were identified as being statistically significantly misregulated by the two approaches, the correlation was high. For the <italic>WT</italic> versus <italic>S2A</italic> comparison, of the 155 genes that were identified in this work as significantly misregulated and for which RNAseq data were available, 61 genes (40%) were identified as significantly misregulated by RNAseq.

Nearly half of the genes that were identified in our study as being significantly misregulated but which were not called significantly misregulated in the RNAseq dataset were characterized by low numbers of RNA-seq reads (Supplemental Table S2). Further characterizations of the similarities and differences seen between our data and the published RNAseq data are described below.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>Global analyses of genes with altered expression in the <italic>rpb1-CTD</italic> mutants reveal limited enrichment by Gene Ontology</title><p>The protein-coding genes affected by the Rpb1-CTD mutations were examined to identify enrichment of functional gene categories as defined by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. The sets of genes that were either significantly upregulated or downregulated by our SAM analyses for each mutant strain were compared to the background distribution. Whereas some functional categories were identified by this approach (see Supplemental Table S3), overall the analysis failed to identify large groups of functionally related transcripts. For those categories that showed statistically significant over-representation, only a small number of specific transcripts were identified, leaving the misregulated expression of most transcripts unexplained from a functional perspective. An earlier RNAseq-based analysis of some of these same mutants in <italic>S. pombe</italic> reported changes in functionally related clusters of affected genes including meiotic genes, iron response genes, and phosphate homeostasis genes (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Although these multi-gene pathways did not exhibit overall enrichment within our dataset, an examination of the behavior of specific transcripts within these GO categories between the two datasets revealed broad overlap (Supplemental Tables S2 and S3), largely reflecting the overall similarities described above for these datasets. For example, the meiotic genes <italic>ste11</italic> and <italic>mei2</italic> that were previously demonstrated by Northern analysis to be affected by serine phospho-site mutations (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), were also misregulated within our data, showing decreased expression in the <italic>S2A</italic> mutant, increased expression in the <italic>S7A</italic> and <italic>S7E</italic> mutants, but intermediate levels in the <italic>S2A/S7A</italic> double mutant (Supplemental Figure S2).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-6"><title>Gene expression in subtelomeric regions is specifically affected by RNAP II CTD mutants</title><p>While examining the functions of the genes for which expression was impacted by the CTD mutations, it became apparent that a number of galactose response genes were upregulated in the <italic>S2A</italic> strain, notwithstanding that the cells from which the RNA was isolated were grown in glucose-containing medium. Indeed, four out of six galactose response genes (<italic>gal1, gal7, gal10</italic> and <italic>SPBPB2B2.11</italic>) showed significant upregulation in at least one of the four CTD mutants. We noticed that these four upregulated genes were located next to one another, and quite close to the right end of chromosome 2, suggesting that their increased expression could be a consequence of their similar chromosomal locations rather than any functional relationship.</p><p>To examine whether chromosomal location was broadly correlated with changes in gene expression resulting from the CTD mutations, sliding windows of gene expression changes were determined by averaging the log<sub>2</sub> ratio of mutant <italic>vs WT</italic> expression values for every coding transcript in 10 kbp windows along each chromosome. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, patterns of upregulated gene expression were apparent near the ends of chromosomes 1 and 2 for all four CTD mutants: statistically significant upregulation is seen for the 50 kb from the ends except for that of the right arm of chromosome 1 for the <italic>S7A</italic> and <italic>S2A/S7A</italic> mutants. Whereas increased gene expression was not observed for either arm of chromosome 3, the ends of chromosome 3 in <italic>S. pombe</italic> are different from chromosomes 1 and 2 in that they comprise arrays of repeated rDNA, which are typically transcribed by RNA polymerase I. On chromosomes 1 and 2, the regions of upregulation were large, extending &#x0223c;50&#x02013;100 kb from the telomeric ends of the chromosomes, and perhaps defining the subtelomeric regions of these chromosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, large regions with downregulated gene expression were also observed on chromosomes 1 and 2 immediately adjacent to the regions of upregulation, ranging in size from &#x0223c;25 to 80 kb and present on all but the right arm of chromosome 2. In contrast to these subtelomeric regions, the gene expression values across the remainder of the chromosomes were generally unchanged from <italic>WT</italic>, with only few exceptions.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Chromosomal location of gene expression changes in <italic>rpb1-CTD</italic> strains.

By independently examining the data from these studies, we detected similar increases in subtelomeric gene expression in the Saberianfar <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. data at the ends of chromosomes 1 and 2, but not chromosome 3 for the <italic>S2A</italic> mutant, the one allele common to all experiments (Supplemental Figure S3).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-7"><title>Validation of gene expression changes by quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses were performed to validate the changes in expression detected by microarray. Primers were designed targeting two or more genes within the subtelomeric regions of each arm for chromosomes 1, 2 and 3 that were within 50 kb from the end of the chromosome (Supplemental Table S4). In addition, genes outside of the subtelomeric regions for chromosomes 1 and 2 were examined. The RT-qPCR data confirmed significant upregulation of genes in the subtelomeric regions for each of the four CTD mutants, whereas expression of the non-subtelomeric genes were unchanged compared to <italic>WT</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and Supplemental Figure S4). We further used RT-qPCR to examine changes in expression of the meiotically regulated genes <italic>ste11</italic> and <italic>mei2</italic>, each of which had been previously shown to mis-regulate in the context of CTD mutants (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).

Given the increases in gene expression in these regions that accompanied the CTD mutations, we were interested in investigating whether changes in chromatin structure might be involved. ChIP-Seq was performed to query whether the repressive heterochromatin mark H3K9 methylation was altered in the <italic>rpb1-CTD</italic> mutant strains compared to <italic>WT</italic>. Consistent with our gene expression results, in the S2A mutant a general decrease in the H3K9 methylation levels was observed at the ends of chromosomes 1 and 2, but not chromosome 3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and data not shown). The decrease in the H3K9 repressive marks appears within the first &#x0223c;20 to &#x0223c;45 kb from the chromosomal ends; by contrast, the regions of increased gene expression observed by microarray were larger, ranging from &#x0223c;50 to &#x0223c;100 kb (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Nevertheless, genes with decreased H3K9 methylation overlap genes with increased gene expression in the subtelomeric regions in our mutant strains (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, Fishers Exact). Each of the other CTD mutations tested also altered the pattern of H3K9me, but in more complex ways. The <italic>S7A</italic> allele produced no clear decreases in H3K9me, but rather an increase in a subtelomeric region on right arm of chromosome 1. A similar phenotype has been reported in the <italic>leo1</italic>&#x00394; mutant, which encodes a subunit of the PAF1 elongation complex (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The <italic>S7E</italic> and <italic>S2A/S7A</italic> mutants produced mixed effects with increases at some sites and decreases at other (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). While the correlation between H3K9 methylation state and gene expression level were significant, there were also numerous regions of divergence. For example, for the regions directly adjacent to the telomere on the left arm of chromosome 1 and the right arm of chromosome 2, H3K9 methylation levels were higher than <italic>WT</italic> for the <italic>S2A, S7E</italic>, and <italic>S2A/S7A</italic> mutants. However, gene expression within these regions was derepressed in the mutant despite the increased levels of the repressive H3K9 mark (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These data indicate that the CTD mutants impact subtelomeric repression mechanisms beyond those determined by H3K9me levels.</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>H3K9 methylated histone levels are altered in subtelomeric regions of <italic>rpb1-CTD</italic> mutants.

Numerous lines of evidence over the past several years have demonstrated the co-transcriptional nature of pre-mRNA splicing (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Whereas several reports have suggested that this may be facilitated by direct interactions between the CTD and specific splicing factors, others have cast doubt upon these direct connections (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Using splicing-sensitive microarrays to assess the pre-mRNA splicing efficiency of nearly every annotated splicing event in the fission yeast genome, we detected almost no defect in pre-mRNA splicing in the background of any of the mutants examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Although small numbers of splicing events can be identified that show weak apparent defects in splicing efficiency, from a global perspective these data strongly support the conclusion that phosphorylation of Ser2 or Ser7 in the <italic>S. pombe</italic> CTD is not required for efficient pre-mRNA splicing genome-wide.</p><p>Absent defects in pre-mRNA splicing, we queried changes in gene expression. Several of the mutants examined here have been studied by others using either microarrays or RNAseq (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Overall, the global changes in gene expression detected here were reasonably well-correlated with those seen in previous studies, particularly given the differences in detection platform and sample processing (Pearson correlations between 0.4 and 0.59). As with previous studies, our data demonstrated mis-regulation of several genes involved in iron response, phosphate homeostasis, and meiosis. Nevertheless, a global analysis of the gene ontologies associated with regulated transcripts failed to provide a compelling functional relationship between mis-regulated transcripts. While the GO analysis did identify a handful of enriched functional categories, the total number of transcripts contained within these categories represented only a fraction of the total transcripts misregulated by these mutants. Together, these data suggest that the changes in gene expression caused by these CTD mutations cannot be readily explained by alterations in functionally-related transcripts.</p><p>A common trend among many of the genes we found to be significantly upregulated in our genome-wide microarray experiment was their location within their chromosomes. Many of the genes we identified were clustered near the ends of chromosomes 1 and 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These areas may define a functionally distinct so-called subtelomeric region of their respective chromosomes. Chromosome 3 in <italic>S. pombe</italic> has a different structure than the other two chromosomes in that ribosomal RNA gene repeats exist near the ends of chromosome 3, perhaps explaining the distinct expression patterns seen in the CTD mutants for chromosomes 1 and 2, but not chromosome 3. Other groups have examined global changes in gene expression in the <italic>S2A</italic> mutant in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), albeit using different experimental platforms. While these studies identified and discussed expression changes in genes involved in cytokinesis and meiosis respectively, our analysis of the data generated by Saberianfar <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. show an upregulation of genes in the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes 1 and 2, but not chromosome 3 (Supplemental Figure S3). Whereas a previous RNA-seq study with these CTD mutants (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) did not appear to uncover broad upregulation of gene expression within the subtelomeric regions, RNA-seq analyses typically remove from consideration sequences that align to repetitive regions such as the subtelomere. Indeed, many of the subtelomeric genes identified as being upregulated in our study have zero reads associated with them in the RNAseq dataset (Supplemental Table S2). Nevertheless, of the few subtelomeric genes that were preserved in that study, for example, the RecQ type DNA helicase <italic>tlh2</italic> was found to be similarly upregulated, matching our observation.</p><p>Given that the CTD mutations resulted in changes in gene expression within subtelomeric regions that are expected to exist in a heterochromatic state, we assayed the repressive heterochromatin mark H3K9 methylation using chromatin immunoprecipitation and subsequent sequencing (ChIP-seq). The H3K9 methylation levels were generally reduced in the first &#x0223c;20&#x02013;45 kb of chromosomes 1 and 2, but not chromosome 3, often overlapping the regions of increased gene expression in the CTD mutants. However, two regions were identified where the gene expression levels were high and yet the H3K9 methylation levels were also high. These regions, most prominently on the left arm of chromosome 1 and the right arm of chromosome 2, contain the <italic>tlh1</italic> and <italic>tlh2</italic> genes that encode RecQ type DNA helicases and are thought to nucleate heterochromatin assembly at telomeres (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Given that expression of <italic>tlh1</italic> and <italic>tlh2</italic> is increased despite elevated H3K9 methylation, their expression may be necessary or perhaps even privileged for proper heterochromatin formation at these sites. Alternatively, there may exist subtelomeric repression mechanisms that are dependent on RNAP II CTD status, yet are independent of H3K9me. Supporting this view, the regions of upregulated gene expression identified here seem to extend &#x0223c;50 kb further into the chromosome than the zones of decreased H3K9 methylation, consistent with the idea that subtelomeric chromatin is distinct from euchromatin (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>The precise mechanisms by which the RNAP II CTD mutations affect chromatin structure and gene expression remain to be elucidated. Several of the CTD repeat mutations examined here yielded similar yet distinct phenotypes, suggesting that the relevant CTD &#x02018;reader&#x02019; protein(s) may recognize more than one CTD residue. While future work will be required to identify the relevant reader(s), it is is tempting to speculate that disruption of phosphorylation events on the CTD alters recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymes such as members of the Set family of histone methyltransferases. For example, Set2 associates with the phosphorylated form of the CTD (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), and Set2 protein levels have also been shown to be destabilized in CTD phosphomutants (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Similarly, recent studies in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have shown that Set1 and Set5 act together to modulate subtelomeric silencing (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Whether these activities or components of the repressive machinery itself recognize the CTD in this current context will require a biochemical identification of the proximal recognition factor(s).</p></sec>
