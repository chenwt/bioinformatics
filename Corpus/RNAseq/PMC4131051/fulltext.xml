However, annotation needs to be refined and verified experimentally, as most predicted transcripts have been identified by comparative analysis with genomes from other species. The mosquito midgut&#x02014;the first organ to interact with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites&#x02014;mounts effective antiplasmodial responses that limit parasite survival and disease transmission. High-throughput Illumina sequencing of the midgut transcriptome was used to identify new genes and transcripts, contributing to the refinement of <italic>An. gambiae</italic> genome annotation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We sequenced ~223 million reads from <italic>An. gambiae</italic> midgut cDNA libraries generated from susceptible (G3) and refractory (L35) mosquito strains. Mosquitoes were infected with either <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> or <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, and midguts were collected after the first or second <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection. In total, 22,889 unique midgut transcript models were generated from both <italic>An. gambiae</italic> strain sequences combined, and 76% are potentially novel. Of these novel transcripts, 49.5% aligned with annotated genes and appear to be isoforms or pre-mRNAs of reference transcripts, while 50.5% mapped to regions between annotated genes and represent novel intergenic transcripts (NITs). Predicted models were validated for midgut expression using qRT-PCR and microarray analysis, and novel isoforms were confirmed by sequencing predicted intron-exon boundaries. Coding potential analysis revealed that 43% of total midgut transcripts appear to be long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and functional annotation of NITs showed that 68% had no homology to current databases from other species. Reads were also analyzed using <italic>de novo</italic> assembly and predicted transcripts compared with genome mapping-based models. Finally, variant analysis of G3 and L35 midgut transcripts detected 160,742 variants with respect to the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> PEST genome, and 74% were new variants. Intergenic transcripts had a higher frequency of variation compared with non-intergenic transcripts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This in-depth Illumina sequencing and assembly of the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> midgut transcriptome doubled the number of known transcripts and tripled the number of variants known in this mosquito species. It also revealed existence of a large number of lncRNA and opens new possibilities for investigating the biological function of many newly discovered transcripts.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1471-2164-15-636) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> mosquito is the primary vector of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, where this disease causes 139.2 million infections and 542,360 deaths per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Malaria control has relied mainly on vector control&#x02014;with insecticides and insecticide-impregnated nets&#x02014;and on antimalarial therapy of infected humans. These strategies have reduced malaria prevalence and transmission, but development of insecticide resistance in the vector and of drug resistance in the parasite limit their effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite population undergoes a major bottleneck in the mosquito, making it an attractive target for novel strategies to disrupt disease transmission. Mosquitoes become infected when they ingest host blood containing <italic>Plasmodium</italic> gametocytes, and fertilization takes place giving rise to a motile ookinete that invades the mosquito midgut epithelia. Usually only a few ookinetes (&#x0003c;5) are able to complete their development and multiply in the mosquito. The mosquito midgut is the first epithelial barrier that parasites must traverse to complete their development, and cellular responses of invaded midgut cells have been shown to limit parasite survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Sequencing of the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> genome was a landmark that provided a powerful platform to advance our understanding of the biology of this mosquito vector and its role in malaria transmission. The genome, published in 2002, was done using shotgun sequencing; gene prediction and annotation was done, in large part, <italic>in silico</italic> based on homology with known genes from other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This is a powerful approach, but it has some limitations, as there can be errors in the predicted gene models and many transcripts&#x02014;for example, those unique to <italic>An. gambiae</italic>&#x02014;could be missed. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, whole-genome tiling-array expression analysis revealed that the initial genome sequence annotation had missed 30% of the transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and in the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria parasite, the first genome sequence contained errors in 25% of the predicted gene models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Here we report the in-depth transcriptome analysis of the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> mosquito midgut using RNA-seq by Illumina sequencing with the goal of discovering new transcripts and improving the genome annotation, especially of midgut-expressed genes, as interaction of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> with this organ is critical for the parasite to establish an infection. RNA-seq has been used successfully to study transcriptional differences of previously annotated genes, between chemosensory appendages and whole body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and between insecticide resistant and susceptible <italic>An. gambiae</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. We explored the mosquito midgut transcriptome of two <italic>An. gambiae</italic> strains<italic>,</italic> the L3-5 refractory strain that was selected to melanize <italic>Plasmodium,</italic> and the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> G3 susceptible strain under different physiological conditions. Mosquitoes were infected with different <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species with a variable level of compatibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] to identify the maximum number of transcripts induced in response to infection. Samples were collected 24&#x000a0;h after feeding, a time when epithelial cells are responding to ookinete invasion. L3-5 females were infected with gametocytes from two different <italic>P. falciparum</italic> lines: 7G8 from Brazil, which is melanized and is almost completely eliminated, and the 3D7 strain that survives very well in this strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. <italic>An. gambiae</italic> G3 was infected with <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>, and midguts were collected 24&#x000a0;h after the first infection (na&#x000ef;ve response) or after a second infection (primed response) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We report a high-throughput RNA-seq analysis using a genome-based sequence assembly that generated novel transcript models and doubled the number of known transcripts for <italic>An. gambiae</italic>. Furthermore, several of the predicted transcript models were experimentally validated<italic>.</italic> A transcriptome using a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly&#x02014;a strategy that can be particularly useful in organisms whose genome has not been sequenced&#x02014;was also performed and compared with the genome-based approach. Finally, variant analysis of the sequence reads identified many new polymorphisms that could be useful for future genetic studies in this disease vector.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Genome-based analysis of illumina reads</title><p>Illumina sequencing generated a total of ~223&#x000a0;M reads from midguts of <italic>A. gambiae</italic> G3 and L3-5 strains.

This is expected, as the program also considers all the known transcript models based on the annotated genome, and not all of them are transcribed in the adult female midgut. To discard transcript models that had no read coverage (FPKM&#x02009;=&#x02009;0) or low coverage, a threshold was set and only transcripts with FPKM&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1 were considered for the rest of the analysis (see transcript experimental validation below). G3 and L3-5 transcript models had similar median read coverage values of 4.4 and 3.7 FPKM, respectively (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). Cufflinks generated a total of 22,889 unique midgut transcripts (with FPKM&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1) from both strains combined (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1).

Interestingly, 82% of NITs had an open reading frame that can code for a peptide of 50 amino acids or more. Independent evidence was obtained for the existence of 3,514 (40%) NITs, because they either had high sequence homology by BLAST (e&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup>) to the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> expressed sequence tag database (AgEST) (3,005 NITs) or to a Diptera protein database (1,072 NITs), and some transcripts had matches to both databases (563 NITs) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). The other 5,269 NITs (60%) had no match in any database and appear to be unique to <italic>An. gambiae</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Independent validation of transcript models</title><p>In total, 56 transcript models were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in independent <italic>An. gambiae</italic> midgut samples to confirm their presence in the midgut transcriptome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3). Transcript models for validation were chosen among low FPKM ranges, 0.86&#x02013;111.56, where 18 transcripts corresponded to previously known genes in the reference genome and 38 corresponded to transcripts that had not been previously described.

We found that 20% of transcripts with a complete match to known reference transcripts (5,483) had no identifiable functional annotation, while within the potentially novel transcripts (17,406), the unknown function class increased to 68.4%. The four most abundant functional classes were, in order of abundance, RNA processing/transcription/translation; signal transduction, metabolism, and cytoskeletal/storage/secretion/extracellular matrix/adhesion (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S6).

The immunity class consisted of 204 transcripts; 112 of them were novel, and 92 had been previously annotated. Of the novel transcripts, 88 (96%) were new isoforms of previously annotated transcripts, 8 were potential pre-mRNA transcripts, 6 had exonic overlaps to reference transcripts, 5 were exonic or intron overlaps to the opposite strand (directionality was predicted based on the consensus sequence of the splice junction), and 3 were intergenic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Analysis of Illumina reads using <italic>de novo</italic>assembly</title><p>A reference genome sequence is not available for many relevant insect vectors, and high-throughput transcriptome analysis can be very useful to begin to characterize candidate genes and develop new tools, such as microarrays, that would make it possible to assess broad transcriptional responses to specific physiologic conditions or experimental treatments. We carried out a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of our reads, independent of the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> genome sequence, and compared the output of this strategy with the genome-based analysis using TopHat/Cufflinks as described. This alternative <italic>de novo</italic> assembly was also used as a complementary approach to identify new reads and maximize the discovery of novel transcripts.</p><p>The RNA-seq reads for G3 and L3-5 were compiled together and put through an assembly by short sequences (ABySS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] pipeline (see Methods). The <italic>de novo</italic> strategy assembled 67,011 contigs of which 49,969 (75%) aligned to the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> genome (BLAST cut off e-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;E<sup>&#x02212;20</sup>) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Tables S7 and S8). Of the 17,042 <italic>de novo</italic> contigs that did not align to the genome, 83% had matches to an Apicomplexa protein database and are likely to be either <italic>P. berghei</italic> or <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transcripts, while 17% were neither <italic>An. gambiae</italic> nor Apicomplexan sequences and probably represent transcripts from bacteria, mouse, or human cells from the blood meal.</p><p>Overall, the <italic>de novo</italic> strategy generated more contigs, but they were shorter (about 3 fold) than the genome-based assembled transcripts (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This strategy was able to detect 98% of the transcripts from annotated reference genes detected by the genome-based strategy and detected 1009 additional transcripts from reference genes.

It is important to keep in mind that for the genome-based analysis only transcripts with FPKM&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1 were included in this comparison, and we know that up to 78% of transcripts with low read coverage (FPKM&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1) could be validated by qRT-PCR. In other words, several transcripts with low expression were probably eliminated when we established this quality threshold for the transcripts predicted using the genome-based methodology.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>

Overall, 160,742 variants were detected with respect to the genome (Agam3.6) of the pink-eyed laboratory strain (PEST) of <italic>An. gambiae</italic>. Of these 119,344 were not reported in the dbSNP database (version 125) and are therefore potential new variants.

Annotation of the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> transcriptome variants showed that 57,988 (42.3%) are located in intergenic regions of the annotated reference genome (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S9), and many of them are probably present in non-coding RNAs that tolerate more variation than coding RNAs. Intergenic transcripts have a higher level of variation (12.5 variants/transcript) than transcripts from annotated genes (5.3 variants/transcripts).

A total of 22,889 unique transcripts expressed in the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> midgut were detected. The number of potential novel transcripts identified (17,406) is surprising, as it doubles the number of transcripts currently reported in the whole genome database (14,974). Of these potential novel transcripts, 49.5% align partially to reference genome transcripts and represent new isoforms of 3,819 known genes; while the other 50.5% map to intergenic regions of the annotated genome (novel intergenic transcripts [NITs]) and define 7,745 novel genes. We present several lines of evidence that confirm the existence of a good portion of the NITs. First, 40% of them have highly homologous sequences in either the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> EST database or the Diptera database, indicating that similar transcripts have been previously found. Second, RT-PCR testing confirmed expression of 84% of transcripts, and sequencing confirmed 84% of novel splice junction. Previous reports have shown that microarrays are less sensitive and often unable to detect low abundant transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and some predicted transcripts may only be expressed in midguts from <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-infected mosquitoes. In spite of these limitations, we were able to confirm expression of ~800 NITs, 39% of a subset of 2,050 novel transcripts tested in a microarray analysis of midgut mRNA expression in females fed uninfected blood. Together, these data provide strong evidence that most of the novel transcripts reported are real and of high quality.</p><p>Interestingly, the protein coding probability analysis indicated that a large portion of the transcripts detected (43%) appear to be lncRNA (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). In fact, most of the NITs (78%) appear to be lncRNA, compared with 21% of the transcripts from annotated genes (genic); however, 82% of the NITs contain ORFs at least 50 amino acids long, suggesting that some transcripts could code for short peptides. Functional annotation of the NITs done by BLAST revealed that 68.4% of them do not have homology to any functional database. This percentage is significantly higher than the 20% of unknown function in the previously annotated transcripts. The larger percentage of unknown function within the NITs suggests that some of these transcripts may be unique to anophelines<italic>.</italic> Our finding of a large number of new transcripts and noncoding RNA in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> is consistent with some of the main findings of the ENCODE project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This project identified 73,325 novel transcripts in intergenic or antisense regions of the reference human genome, based on sequences from human cell lines, and increased the number of annotated transcripts by 45%. Moreover, 6,205 polyadenylated lncRNAs were found in genic regions of the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It appears that a large portion of the eukaryotic genome is transcribed, and while previous efforts have focused on short non-coding RNA, the function of most of the newly discovered lncRNA is still unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Recent reports indicate that lncRNAs are involved in diverse biologic functions, such as chromosome X inactivation in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and regulation of inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our detection of a large number of new transcripts is also consistent with a previous RNA-seq analysis of transcriptional differences between chemosensory organs and whole body <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, in which only 57.4% of the reads mapped to annotated genes in the AgamP3.6 genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>de novo</italic> strategy assembled 67,011 unique contigs, and 49,969 (75%) of them mapped to the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> genome. The number of transcripts found in the <italic>de novo</italic> strategy is in the same order of magnitude of transcripts reported (95,747) for a sugar-fed male and female <italic>An. gambiae</italic> transcriptome by RNA-seq assembled also with a <italic>de novo</italic> strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The genome-based strategy used here produced less fragmented models that were on average three times longer than those from the <italic>de novo</italic> strategy (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The genome-based analysis carried out with TopHat/Cufflinks can build transcript-spanning non-overlapping reads if there is a reference transcript; this generates larger and less fragmented transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Because the <italic>de novo</italic> strategy does not require a reference genome for contig assembly, it would still generate contigs in regions where genomic scaffolds may be missing in poorly sequenced or partially assembled genomes. The <italic>de novo</italic> assembly also has the advantage that it does not require a reference genome and is able to find most of the transcripts generated by the genome-based analysis. There were 371 transposable element (TE) transcripts in the RNAseq <italic>de novo</italic> assembly that were identified using a RPS-Blast search against a compiled database of mosquito TE's from pfam and Repbase (<italic>e</italic> value of 1e-15 or lower, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S8). In particular, long stretches (&#x0003e;1000&#x000a0;bp) were found for several Jockey, Copia and Outcast elements. Transcripts coding for near full-length transposases of Class II elements of the mariner, gambol and PIF elements were also found. Most of them appear to be functional genes, as they did not contain stop codons that are often found in pseudogenes. The presence of these transcripts could indicate active transposition of elements in <italic>A. gambiae.</italic> Alternatively, they could code for reverse-complement transcripts and represent TE suppression elements. We cannot distinguish between these two possibilities, because the libraries were not directional.</p><p>The variant analysis done in the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> midgut transcriptome identified 160,742 variants of which 74.3% are novel with respect to the SNP database. This shows the power of RNA-seq in finding variants and also the high level of polymorphism even within an <italic>An. gambiae</italic> lab colony. A large portion of the variants were found in transcripts that are intergenic with respect to the reference genome, and this class of transcripts have a higher frequency of variants (12.5 variants/transcript) compared with genic transcripts (5.3 variants/transcript), probably due to the higher frequency of non-coding RNAs that are expected to tolerate more variations than protein-coding transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The novel midgut transcripts presented here considerably expand the known <italic>An. gambiae</italic> transcriptome.

Samples were labeled with CY3 and the pooled reference sample labeled with CY5 using the Quick Amp labeling kit (Agilent). Labeled RNA samples were hybridized to a custom designed 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;44&#x000a0;K <italic>An. gambiae</italic> microarray (Agilent) consisting of 45,220 probes including 22,287 unannotated transcripts with 60-mer probes designed using e-Array software (Agilent) with the base composition method. Microarrays were scanned with an Agilent G2505C microarray scanner, and image analysis was performed using the Agilent feature extraction method. Entities were filtered separately for each time point based on probe sets as &#x0201c;detected&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;not detected&#x0201d; in at least 1 of 3 biological replicates using Genespring GX 12.5.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>PCR validation</title><p>Primers for PCR validation of selected transcripts in the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> G3 midgut transcriptome were designed using primer3 and custom scripts. PCR was performed with cDNA made with an independent <italic>An. gambiae</italic> G3 midgut sample 24&#x000a0;h after <italic>P. berghei</italic> infection. cDNA was prepared with the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). For samples that failed the first validation with PCR, a second primer pair was designed and tested. Genomic DNA from G3 mosquitoes was used as a positive PCR control.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>RNA protein coding potential analysis</title><p>Midgut intergenic and nonintergenic transcripts were analyzed with the coding potential assessment tool (CPAT v1.2.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] to determine a coding potential probability score. The <italic>An. gambiae</italic> reference genome (AgamP3.6) was used to calculate the in-frame hexamer frequency table. The default coding potential cutoff of&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.39 was used to infer high probability of being a coding transcript. Default start and stop codons were used to define ORFs.

A limiting qual value, q&#x02009;=&#x02009;7, was used in all assemblies. The resulting Abyss assemblies were further assembled by a pipeline consisting of blastn and CAP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] iterations as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], consisting of iterations with a decreasing blastn word size inclusion strategy. A master program sequentially sent each transcript to be blasted using an initial word size of 200 (blastn switch -W 200) and a maximum limit of 1,000 matches (&#x02212;v 1000, using tabular output mode &#x02013;m 8). Matches were marked as collected as they were retrieved from the blastn program, and these matched sequences were not sent for blastn when their turn arrived, thus avoiding duplicating the BLAST task. The second iteration was done with a word size of 134, the output of which was in turn used for the next round, but now using a word size of 90, then 60, then two more rounds of 48 to produce the final output. The resulting assembled sequences larger than 150&#x000a0;bp were combined into a FASTA file and used as a query against the Cufflinks transcript model database.
