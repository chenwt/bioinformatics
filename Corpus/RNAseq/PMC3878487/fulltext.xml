Genes encoding erythromycin biosynthesis are organized in a gene cluster, spanning over 60 kbp of DNA. Most often, gene clusters encoding biosynthesis of secondary metabolites contain regulatory genes.

We have identified a putative regulatory protein SACE_5599 which shows significantly higher levels of expression in an erythromycin high-producing strain, compared to the wild type <italic>S. erythraea</italic> strain. SACE_5599 is a member of an uncharacterized family of putative regulatory genes, located in several actinomycete biosynthetic gene clusters. Importantly, increased expression of SACE_5599 was observed in the complex fermentation medium and at controlled bioprocess conditions, simulating a high-yield industrial fermentation process in the bioreactor. Inactivation of SACE_5599 in the high-producing strain significantly reduced erythromycin yield, in addition to drastically decreasing sporulation intensity of the SACE_5599-inactivated strains when cultivated on ABSM4 agar medium. In contrast, constitutive overexpression of SACE_5599 in the wild type NRRL23338 strain resulted in an increase of erythromycin yield by 32%.

Most actinomycetes are characterized by mycelial growth, multicellular behaviour, complex physiological and morphological differentiation and highly regulated biosynthesis of secondary metabolites with a broad spectrum of biological activities. Many of these natural products are of enormous industrial and clinical importance, e.g. as antiinfectives, anti-cancer agents and immunosuppressants. Soil-dwelling actinomycetes grow as vegetative mycelia of branching hyphae which explore the environment for available nutrients. When nutrients become scarce, for example after a few days of growth on an agar plate, aerial hyphae emerge from the colony into the air using the lysed vegetative mycelium as substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Typically, antibiotic biosynthesis is initiated at this time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Aerial hyphae then undergo several morphological stages, leading to subdivision of apical cells and finally to the release of spores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These differentiation steps as well as biosynthesis of bioactive compounds (secondary metabolites) are coordinated by the complex regulatory pathways, which have been so far mostly studied in model actinomycetes, such as <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>. Important roles of some of the identified genes in differentiation, predominantly genes with regulatory function, have been elucidated based on the classical genetic studies. The obtained mutants, deficient in differentiation mainly fall into two phenotypic categories: mutants with &#x0201c;Bld&#x0201d; (bald) phenotype, which fail to make aerial mycelium and the &#x0201c;Whi&#x0201d; (white) mutants, which can form aerial mycelium but cannot produce spores and the spore pigment (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]).</p><p><italic>Saccharopolyspora erythraea</italic> is an important filamentous actinomycete used in industrial fermentation processes for production of erythromycin, a medically important polyketide antibiotic. Semi-synthetic derivatives of erythromycin, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, are widely used in clinical setting to treat infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens. In addition to its industrial importance, <italic>S. erythraea</italic> has been used as a model actinomycete system for studying the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites of polyketide origin, particularly the macrolide antibiotics, synthesized by modular type I polyketide synthase (PKS) genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Basic structure of the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster was found to span over 60 kbp of DNA and to comprise 20 genes transcribed in four main polycistronic units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Three centrally located large PKS genes <italic>eryAI</italic>, <italic>eryAII</italic> and <italic>eryAIII</italic>, involved in the biosynthesis of macrolide core (6-deoxyerythronolide B), are flanked on both sides by the genes involved in post-PKS processing, biosynthesis and attachment of desosamine and mycarose sugar moieties to the erythronolide aglycone and erythromycin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Reflecting its industrial and scientific importance, the genome of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> wild type (WT) NRRL 23338 strain has been sequenced recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. With the aim of achieving higher erythromycin productivity and fermentation processes scalable to industrial-scale bioreactors, the WT strain and the corresponding bioprocess have been improved for decades mainly by iterative methods of random mutagenesis and selection, resulting in industrial high-producing strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Due to very high industrial importance of erythromycin, the efforts towards improved <italic>S. erythraea</italic> strains are continuing by genetic/metabolic engineering as well as classical methods, assisted by genomic and transcriptomic approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In most actinomycetes, timely and coordinated expression of large genetic clusters for polyketide biosynthesis, essential for efficient biosynthesis of the corresponding bioactive compounds, is achieved by several levels of regulatory control. First, pleiotropic (globally acting) regulatory genes, link signals from the environmental stimuli and life cycle progression to the biosynthetic machinery of the strain. Pleiotropic regulators are thought to activate transcription of pathway-specific regulatory genes, most often located inside biosynthetic gene clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Pathway-specific regulators, such as the SARP (Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein) family regulators or the LAL (large ATP-binding regulators of the LuxR family) family regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] then coordinate transcription of the biosynthetic genes most often located inside the corresponding clusters. In several actinomycetes engineering of regulatory mechanisms has shown a promising potential for increasing yields of natural products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In some cases pathway-specific regulatory genes, naturally present in the biosynthetic gene clusters, have been overexpressed using strong constitutive promoters. In one example, overexpression of <italic>tylS</italic> and <italic>tylR</italic> regulatory genes in WT as well as in industrial overproducing strains of <italic>Streptomyces fradiae</italic> resulted in a significant increase in yields of tylosin, a macrolide antibiotic structurally related to erythromycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Similarly, yields of the immunosuppressants rapamycin and FK506 have been successfully increased by overexpression of the pathway-specific regulatory genes <italic>rapG</italic> (and <italic>rapH</italic>) in <italic>Streptomyces rapamycinicus</italic> and <italic>fkbN</italic> in <italic>Streptomyces tsukubaensis</italic>, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In striking contrast to the predominant regulatory cascade, present in most actinomycetes, the erythromycin gene cluster in <italic>S. erythraea</italic> does not contain pathway-specific regulatory genes, which has for some time precluded a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms governing erythromycin biosynthesis. Importantly, microarray-based transcriptional studies revealed coordinated expression of most erythromycin biosynthetic genes and therefore the very likely existence of a common regulator for the <italic>ery</italic> cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It was later demonstrated that this function can be carried out directly by BldD, a global regulatory protein with a key role in <italic>S. erythraea</italic> morphological differentiation. BldD was found to bind with a high affinity to all five promoter regions of the <italic>ery</italic> cluster, and the inactivation of the <italic>bldD</italic> gene reduced erythromycin production 7-fold in the WT strain of <italic>S. erythraea</italic>. In addition, <italic>bldD</italic> inactivation resulted in the Bld phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], analogously to the better characterized role of the <italic>bldD</italic> orthologue in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Based on a comparative proteomic approach and transcriptional analysis, carried out in the industrial cultivation conditions, we have identified a novel putative regulatory gene SACE_5599, which shows significantly higher expression levels in an industrial high producing strain of <italic>S. erythraea</italic>, ABE1441, compared to the WT strain. SACE_5599 is homologous to the putative regulatory genes located in several biosynthetic gene clusters of actinomycetes and its overexpression in <italic>S. erythraea</italic> NRRL23338 resulted in an enhanced erythromycin production (32% increased titre) at the shaker level, while its inactivation in the industrial strain led to significantly lower erythromycin yield, accompanied by a drastic reduction of sporulation on solid agar medium. Advancing our understanding of the regulation of erythromycin biosynthesis is of key importance as it will likely contribute towards increased efficiency of industrial fermentations of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> and potentially other industrial antibiotic-producing actinomycetes. In addition, this work demonstrates the potential of omics approaches for strain development in the industrial setting when analyses are carried out in industrially relevant conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of differentially expressed protein SACE_5599</title><p>Regulatory mechanisms that control <italic>S. erythraea</italic> life cycle and erythromycin biosynthesis remain poorly characterized, which limits the genetic engineering efforts towards improved strains with increased yields of erythromycin. Based on the genome sequencing data more than 1000 genes with putative regulatory function are encoded in the <italic>S. erythraea</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, their possible role in the life cycle or secondary metabolism is hard to predict based on the genome sequence alone. With the aim of identifying potential regulatory elements involved in regulation of erythromycin production during the fermentation process, we employed a comparative proteomic approach. We invested significant efforts to develop media from which high quality proteome and transcriptome data could be generated, at the same time ensuring relatively high yield of erythromycin, and maintaining key process conditions comparable with the industrial large scale fermentation process. Two <italic>S. erythraea</italic> strains, the WT NRRL23338 strain and an industrial erythromycin high-producing ABE1441 strain, developed from the WT strain through an intensive strain improvement program, were cultivated at 5&#x000a0;L bioreactor scale in medium and fermentation conditions simulating industrial fermentation process for production of erythromycin. In these conditions the NRRL23338 strain typically produces less than 100&#x000a0;mg/L erythromycin, whereas the ABE1441 strain produces approx. 2000&#x000a0;mg/L erythromycin (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Representative samples of complete fermentation broths were collected at multiple time points during the erythromycin fermentation, cell-free protein extracts of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> were prepared and subjected to quantitative proteomic analysis. Relative quantification was performed using the spectral counting methodology, which compares numbers of detected MS/MS spectra for each of identified proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Relative expression of SACE</bold>_<bold>5599 and erythromycin biosynthesis of the WT and industrial high</bold>-<bold>producing ABE1441 strains.</bold> Data from one representative fermentation process are shown, normalized to expression of 16S rRNA.

It was our goal to obtain a small number of promising candidate regulatory proteins that could be further evaluated by gene inactivation and overexpression experiments with the final aim of increasing erythromycin yield through genetic engineering approaches. Interestingly, in addition to over 20-fold higher erythromycin yield achievable by the industrial strain, the WT and ABE1441 strains also differ significantly in intensity of sporulation on the ABSM4 and R5 agar media (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), similarly to what has been previously observed for other erythromycin high-producing strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].

In fact, peptides derived from this protein were undetectable in protein extracts of the NRRL23338 WT strain, whereas several peptides of the SACE_5599 protein showed relatively high abundance in samples of the industrial ABE1441 strain (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Genomic context and amino acid sequence of SACE</bold>_<bold>5599.

Genomic analysis revealed that the SACE_5599 gene is located on the reverse strand at approx. position of 6.292 Mbp, inside the &#x0201c;non-core&#x0201d; region, believed to mainly contain genes related to conditionally adaptive functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, SACE_5599 lies very close to the limit of the predicted &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; region of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and is located 2.7 Mbp away from the <italic>ery</italic> cluster on 8.2 Mbp chromosome, surrounded by genes with no apparent role in erythromycin biosynthesis or secondary metabolism (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). Similarly, the <italic>bldD</italic> (SACE_2077) regulator of transcription of erythromycin biosynthetic genes is also encoded relatively far away from the <italic>ery</italic> cluster and is located close to the other limit of &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;non-core&#x0201d; regions in the circular <italic>S. erythraea</italic> chromosome (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). Interestingly, both the SACE_5599 and <italic>bldD</italic> lie approx. 2 Mbp from <italic>oriC</italic> in opposite directions. Importantly, the genome sequences of NRRL23338 and ABE1441 are identical inside the ORF and putative promoter region of SACE_5599 as well as of the adjacent genes (&#x00160;F, HP, GK - unpublished results). SACE_5599 ORF was originally predicted at the time of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> genome annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], however, an additional upstream start codon can also be envisioned, resulting in the length of the ORF of 184 or 219 amino acids, respectively (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B).</p><p>In addition to examining the genomic context, it was our aim to obtain more information about the possible function of SACE_5599 by identifying its potentially better characterized gene homologues in related bacterial species. A BlastP search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] in the &#x02018;nr&#x02019; database of NCBI identified a family of 29 thus far sequenced homologues with the E value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10<sup>-5</sup>, nearly all of them located inside antibiotic gene clusters in the genomes of <italic>Actinomycetales</italic>. The length of predicted polypeptide chains of most homologues varies between 180 and 250 aa. The first member to be sequenced was the <italic>lmbU</italic> gene from the lincomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from <italic>Streptomyces lincolnensis</italic>. The <italic>lmbU</italic> gene contains a TTA codon in its nucleotide sequence and was therefore assigned a putative regulatory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The TTA leucine-encoding codon is extremely rare in actinomycetes and is often involved in synchronized regulation of expression of differentiation and secondary metabolism-related genes through regulated expression of the corresponding BldA-tRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Sequence alignment of the homologues reveals a series of strikingly conserved tryptophan residues as well as numerous conserved arginine residues (arginine amounts to 14.2% of all amino acid residues of SACE_5599) in the N-terminal and central part of the protein (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Theoretically predicted pI of the protein is 9.9, suggesting its possible function in nucleic acid binding. In addition, secondary structure prediction algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] predict a very high proportion of &#x003b1;-helical structure. Unfortunately, none of the homologues of SACE_5599 have been characterized so far at the biochemical or structural level, therefore little information is available on the roles and mechanism (s) of action of this family of proteins. Nevertheless, the notion of regulatory role of this family of proteins was further strengthened by gene-inactivation experiments of the <italic>novE</italic> homologue, located inside the biosynthetic gene cluster for novobiocin biosynthesis. When <italic>novE</italic>, also containing a TTA codon, was inactivated in <italic>Streptomyces spheroides</italic> NCIMB11891, the yield of novobiocin was reduced from 37&#x000a0;mg/L to 1.5&#x000a0;mg/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Interestingly, the TTA leucine codon is not present in the sequence of SACE_5599.</p></sec><sec><title>qPCR analysis of SACE_5599 expression in NRLL 23338 and ABE1441 strains</title><p>In the next step we decided to compare in more detail the expression of SACE_5599 gene in the WT and erythromycin high-producing ABE1441 <italic>S. erythraea</italic> strains. We carried out a bioprocess for production of erythromycin at the scale of 5&#x000a0;L bioreactors, closely resembling industrial conditions, and samples for RNA analysis were harvested every 2&#x000a0;hours. Performing qPCR with SACE_5599-specific oligonucleotide primers we confirmed that transcription of SACE_5599 in the WT strain was very low throughout the bioprocess duration, peaking at around 70&#x000a0;h. In accordance with the results of the proteomic analysis, the expression of this gene was up to 20-fold higher in the high producing ABE1441 strain, particularly at the later stages of the cultivation process (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Inactivation of SACE_5599 in the industrial overproducing strain of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> reduces erythromycin yield and has profound effect on morphological development</title><p>The observed differences in expression levels of SACE_5599 between the two strains suggest that this gene might be involved in the regulation of erythromycin biosynthesis of the ABE1441 overproducing strain and, possibly, also in the observed morphological differences between these two strains (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). However, in order to establish whether there is a clear causative relationship between the drastically different expression levels of SACE_5599 and erythromycin yield we carried out the SACE_5599 gene inactivation in the industrial overproducing strain ABE1441. The pKC1132-based plasmid pABE110, containing 344&#x000a0;bp of the central region of SACE_5599 and not capable of replicating in <italic>S. erythraea</italic> was constructed and transferred into <italic>S. erythraea</italic> by conjugation from <italic>E. coli</italic>, thereby inactivating the putative regulatory gene by a single crossover gene disruption. The correct insertion through homologous recombination into the SACE_5599 locus and interruption of the ORF were confirmed by PCR and sequencing. 20 independent SACE_5599-inactivated ex-conjugants were obtained and all of them showed a morphologically modified phenotype, compared with the parent ABE1441 strain. On the ABSM4 solid medium, these mutant strains showed significantly reduced sporulation, which was also delayed for several days as compared to the original ABE1441 strain (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Moreover, the mutant strains with inactivated SACE_5599 also produced substantially higher amounts of an unknown black pigment when grown on ABSM4 agar.</p><p>Further on, we tested the obtained mutants for erythromycin productivity in laboratory scale (shake flask level). Inactivation of the SACE_5599 gene resulted in a significant decrease (37%) in erythromycin yield in these mutant strains, compared to the original ABE1441 overproducing strain, which produced approx. 2.1&#x000a0;g/L erythromycin under the cultivation conditions used (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Clearly, the decrease in erythromycin yield was not as drastic as to drop to the yield observed in the WT strain (around 60&#x02013;70&#x000a0;mg/L) despite a complete lack of SACE_5599 expression in the SACE_5599-inactivated strains. Therefore, it can be concluded that the effect of differential expression of SACE_5599 on erythromycin yield in the high-producing ABE1441 strain seems to represent one of several factors, which contribute to increased erythromycin yield and likely form a complex interdependent regulatory/metabolic network. At this point it is not possible to speculate whether SACE_5599 is directly involved in transcriptional regulation of the <italic>ery</italic> genes or the effect of SACE_5599 on efficiency of erythromycin biosynthesis is indirect, possibly acting through regulation of so far unidentified metabolic/regulatory pathways, intimately associated with the differentiation process.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Yield of erythromycin produced by different mutant strains of </bold><bold><italic>S. erythraea.</italic></bold> Bars encompass 95% of the sample population.

In order to evaluate the suitability of the used vector/promoter system, cultures were sampled after 72&#x000a0;h of cultivation (estimated time of intense erythromycin biosynthesis in shake flasks) and SACE_5599 transcript levels were evaluated in strains transformed with different plasmids by qPCR. As shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, qPCR analysis revealed significantly increased transcription levels in the transformants, constitutively overexpressing either 219 aa or 184 aa variant of SACE_5599, compared to the WT strain. Interestingly, transcription levels in transformants of the WT strain (with the second copy of SACE_5599 <italic>in trans</italic> under P<italic>ermE</italic>* promoter) were still relatively low compared to the levels observed in the industrial high-producing ABE1441 strain, also determined in this qPCR analysis (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). In order to confirm functional expression of the SACE_5599 protein, cell free protein extracts of the transformants with HA-tagged variants of SACE_5599 were subjected to western blot analysis. Importantly, we could detect strong specific bands of apparent molecular mass of (33&#x000a0;kDa) only in the samples in which longer variant of the gene was constitutively expressed, either without (pABE106) or with RBS (pABE107) in the 5&#x02019;-UTR of the transcript (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). In contrast, the bands corresponding to the shorter 184 aa variant (expressed from plasmids pABE102, pABE103) were observed at the molecular mass of 25&#x000a0;kDa but were very faint suggesting extremely low expression level. This suggests that the 219 aa variant of SACE_5599 protein is likely physiologically relevant. We hypothesize that the shorter 184 aa polypeptide variant might fold much less efficiently into a stable three-dimensional structure and is more rapidly degraded. Further on, similar intensity of the bands was observed in all 219 aa transformants, regardless of whether 5&#x02019;-UTR with or without RBS was used (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). The estimated molecular masses of both HA-tagged variants are slightly larger than their theoretically calculated values, possibly due to the very high pI of SACE_5599.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Evaluation of </bold><bold><italic>in</italic></bold>-<bold><italic>trans </italic></bold><bold>expression of SACE</bold>_<bold>5599 in </bold><bold><italic>S.erythraea. </italic></bold><bold>A)</bold> qPCR analysis of expression levels of SACE_5599 (normalized to expression of 16S rRNA) in WT and strains with additional copy of SACE_5599 (pABE53, pABE104), compared to the ABE1441 high-producing strain. <bold>B)</bold> Western blot analysis of <italic>in trans</italic> expression of 219 aa (lanes 2&#x02013;5) and 184 aa (lanes 7&#x02013;10) SACE_5599-HA and the control NRRL23338 strain with pSET152 (lane 1).

A very weak band of apparent molecular mass of 25&#x000a0;kDa was observed when shorter variant (184 aa) of SACE_5599 was expressed, either without RBS (plasmid pABE102 &#x02013; lanes 7 and 8) or with RBS (plasmid pABE103 &#x02013; lanes 9 and 10).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1475-2859-12-126-5"/></fig><p>In the next experiment, erythromycin yield was determined in fermentation broths of the NRRL23338 strain transformants containing <italic>in trans</italic> copy of the longer 219 aa variant of SACE_5599 (plasmid pABE104) after 7&#x000a0;days of cultivation. Transformants containing the plasmid pABE106 with the HA-tagged version of SACE_5599 for which high overexpression was confirmed by western blot, were also included in the analysis. Erythromycin yield of the WT-based strains was determined by the microbiological assay based on <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> growth inhibition (see Methods), considering that at low erythromycin concentrations (below 200&#x000a0;mg/L) the erythromycin present in the broth cannot be reliably quantified by the used HPLC method. Indeed, erythromycin yield in SACE_5599 overexpressing strains was increased on average by 32% (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) compared to the WT level and addition of HA-tag to the C-terminus did not significantly influence the effect of SACE_5599 overexpression. It is noteworthy that the yield increase as well as observed expression levels of SACE_5599 are relatively low, although we used the constitutive P<italic>ermE</italic>* promoter, which has previously been demonstrated as relatively strong promoter in <italic>S. erythraea</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Nevertheless, in this way we have clearly demonstrated a positive influence of SACE_5599 overexpression on erythromycin yield in the WT strain.</p></sec><sec><title>Complementation of the SACE_5599-inactivated high-producing strain ABE1441</title><p>In parallel with <italic>in</italic>-<italic>trans</italic> expression in the NRRL23338 WT strain, we also introduced the 219 aa version of the gene SACE_5599 into the ABE1441 high producing strain, as well as into the SACE_5599-inactivated mutant of ABE1441. Interestingly, when SACE_5599 was over-expressed <italic>in trans</italic> in the high producing ABE1441 strain, using the plasmid pABE104, the yield of erythromycin was not significantly increased (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), suggesting that the underlying regulatory mechanisms have already been optimized (improved) in this industrial strain through random mutagenesis and selection procedures. Further on, one of the 20 SACE_5599-inactivated strains of ABE1441 high producing strain (see above) was complemented with the longer 219 aa variant of the gene. In this case, a thiostrepton resistance cassette was added to the pABE106 vector, which was used for selection, because the apramycin resistance marker is already present in the plasmid used for inactivation of the native SACE_5599 copy (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Normal sporulation phenotype, observed in the parent ABE1441 strain, was restored in about 80% of the ex-conjugants, which had SACE_5599 disrupted strain and then complemented <italic>in trans</italic>. Interestingly, erythromycin productivity was restored to the levels of the ABE1441 high-producing strain, which coincided with the recovery of original sporulation capacity (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In contrast, in strains which failed to regain sporulation capacity, erythromycin yield also remained at the level of SACE_5599-inactivated mutants. It is important to stress that decreased yields of the strains which did not sporulate on ABSM4 agar medium, were not caused by poor growth/biomass formation, as evaluated by the pH and packed cell volume (PCV) measurements of vegetative media before inoculating the production media (not shown). Therefore, the effect of SACE_5599 on erythromycin biosynthesis seems to be closely related to its role in morphological differentiation, similarly to what was observed in the case of the <italic>bldD</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Moderate increase in erythromycin yield is achieved by overexpression of BldD in <italic>S. erythraea</italic> NRRL23338</title><p>It was one of important objectives of our work to evaluate the biotechnological potential of regulatory genes, known to influence erythromycin yield, in an effort to obtain further improved <italic>S. erythraea</italic> strains.

Indeed, <italic>bldD</italic>-overexpressing strains produced on average approx. 30% more erythromycin compared to the wild type strain (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), resulting in similar yield improvement as observed with SACE_5599 overexpression.

The difficulty of identifying key regulatory genes, crucial for improvement of erythromycin yield, is reflected by the fact that among about 7000 predicted ORFs in <italic>S. erythraea</italic> genome 15.5% are putative regulatory genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Even a recent comparative genomic analysis of the natural and industrial erythromycin over-producing strain identified 40 genomic variations affecting genes related to the regulation of transcription and translation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In this work we have identified a putative regulatory gene/protein SACE_5599, based on a comparative proteomic analysis of erythromycin high-producing ABE1441 and WT <italic>S. erythraea</italic> strains, cultivated in industrially based medium. After <italic>bldD</italic>, SACE_5599 is only the second putative regulatory gene identified to date to affect erythromycin yield. This finding shows a promising potential of the non-gel based proteomic techniques to detect and identify differentially expressed regulatory proteins, which are generally of extremely low abundance. The results of gene inactivation and overexpression experiments carried out in this work showed that this gene is indeed involved in the increased yield of erythromycin in the industrial high-producing ABE1441 strain. In addition to decreasing erythromycin yield, inactivation of SACE_5599 also resulted in the morphological phenotype with drastically reduced sporulation of the resulting mutant strains. While levels of expression of SACE_5599 are clearly related to erythromycin biosynthesis, an important question remains about the mechanism of action of this putative regulatory protein as well as of its homologues in other actinomycetes. Considering the high predicted pI value of SACE_5599 and reports of putative regulatory roles of its homologues in other actinomycetes it can be speculated that SACE_5599 acts as transcriptional regulator by binding to specific DNA/RNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, a profound effect on morphological development of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> was observed when <italic>bldD</italic>, the first identified regulatory protein involved in the regulation of erythromycin biosynthesis , was inactivated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Our results thus support the idea that the regulatory network involved in morphological differentiation interconnects very closely with erythromycin biosynthesis. Moreover, the propensity of aerial mycelium formation seems to correlate well with erythromycin production among spontaneously rifampicin-resistant mutants of the NRRL23338 strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], suggesting that from the regulation aspect, morphological differentiation and erythromycin biosynthesis are very closely related phenomena. In another recent study, the <italic>bld</italic> phenotype of <italic>bldD</italic>-inactivated strains was shown to be overcome by inactivation of the SACE_7040 gene, a regulator of the TetR family. Unfortunately, it was not reported whether re-established morphological phenotype also led to the return of original erythromycin yields in that double mutant strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Another recent study revealed the role of the SACE_0012 gene in morphological differentiation of <italic>S. erythraea</italic>, however, in this case, no significant change in erythromycin productivity was observed in the SACE_0012-inactivated strains in spite of the observed early aerial hyphae formation of this strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>In an attempt to analyse how our results correlate with the previous work of other groups in <italic>S. erythraea</italic> and to gain a more comprehensive insight into the roles of SACE_5599 and <italic>bldD</italic>, we took a closer look at the data of recent high-throughput studies, carried out with <italic>S. erythraea</italic>. In particular, we analysed how the transcription of these two regulatory genes correlated with erythromycin biosynthesis at different phases of cultivation. In most studies in the past, cultivation of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> was carried out in soluble non-industrial media. In contrast, we made particular effort to develop media and bioprocess parameters closely resembling the industrial conditions. Interestingly, the SACE_5599 gene was one of the few genes that were not included in the microarray design of most previous transcriptomic studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], therefore no information is available about its expression profiles in these studies. In contrast, transcription levels of <italic>bldD</italic> were studied in most of the published studies. In an initial attempt to characterize transcriptional changes in <italic>S. erythraea</italic> WT strain during different growth phases, the expression <italic>bldD</italic> (SACE_2077) was found to decrease during transition from initial growth phase (phase A) to growth slowdown phase (phase B), similarly to expression of erythromycin biosynthetic genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, when the same transcriptome data was later reinterpreted the <italic>bldD</italic> gene was not categorized into the same co-transcriptional module as the erythromycin biosynthetic cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Interestingly, when different rifampicin-resistant mutants of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> were later profiled by DNA-microarrays, <italic>bldD</italic> transcription levels were lower in strains with higher transcription of erythromycin biosynthetic genes and increased erythromycin yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Moreover, in this study <italic>bldD</italic> levels were higher in strains with decreased erythromycin yield, thereby not suggesting a close link between the BldD expression and erythromycin yield. In contrast, a spontaneous streptomycin-resistant mutant containing a mutation in the <italic>rpsL</italic> gene (encoding the S12 ribosomal protein) showed a markedly increased erythromycin yield which correlated with an increased BldD expression at the late stages of the bioprocess [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In a further comparative study transcriptional profiles of the NRRL23338 and an erythromycin overproducing Px strain were evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In this study the erythromycin-overproducing strain showed higher levels of <italic>bldD</italic> transcription compared to the WT in the initial phases of the fermentation process. However, after 35&#x000a0;h <italic>bldD</italic> transcript levels were comparable in both strains, whereas most prominent differences in erythromycin productivity between the two strains were observed between the 48&#x000a0;h and 72&#x000a0;h time point. An RNASeq analysis of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> transcriptome was also carried out recently, which permitted us to analyse expression of SACE_5599 as well as <italic>bldD</italic>. Indeed, transcription of some of the genes from the erythromycin cluster was found to correlate well with SACE_5599, while no correlation was apparent with <italic>bldD</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. During the preparation of this manuscript, another comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of the WT and high-producing <italic>S. erythraea</italic> E3 strain was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Importantly, industrial growth media were used for <italic>S. erythraea</italic> cultivation in this study and SACE_5599 was included in the microarray design. Similarly to our observations SACE_5599 showed significantly higher expression levels in the high producing strain, compared to the WT in all time points of the fermentation process. In contrast BldD expression was significantly decreased in the high producing strain.</p><p>In summary, different studies report different degree of correlation between expression levels of either <italic>bldD</italic> or SACE_5599 and erythromycin biosynthesis. There are at least three possible reasons for these discrepancies. Firstly, it is reasonable to expect that the preparation of total RNA or construction of microarrays can vary significantly, thereby influencing the outcome on transcriptional analysis. Secondly, different media and cultivation conditions were applied, which clearly have effect on secondary metabolism and differentiation. Finally, the discrepancies between different studies might be related to the fact that due to the lack of pathway-specific regulation, erythromycin biosynthesis is regulated directly through globally acting regulatory elements which at the same time also control morphological differentiation of <italic>S. erythraea</italic>. Therefore, differential expression of multiple regulatory genes might play a key role in increased erythromycin yield in each individual high-producing strain, considering that every strain was developed through an independent media and process development in combination with classical mutagenesis and selection programs. Further experiments are necessary in order to elucidate regulatory mechanisms by which SACE_5599 as well as <italic>bldD</italic> can affect erythromycin yield. Interestingly, after the regulatory network of BldD orthologue has been studied in significant detail in <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>, the actinomycete model organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], a more complex relationship between BldD expression and erythromycin biosynthesis in <italic>S. erythraea</italic> has been recently suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Regardless of the poorly understood underlying regulatory and metabolic pathways, the <italic>S. erythraea</italic> production strain and bioprocess for production of erythromycin have been improved for over 50&#x000a0;years. A significant increase in erythromycin yields has been achieved, compared to the WT strain. However, considering the annual world production and commercial importance of erythromycin and its semi-synthetic derivatives, current yields remain relatively low in comparison to other antibiotic production technologies, e.g. tetracyclines or penicillin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Therefore, there is a clear commercial incentive to further improve erythromycin production technology. In addition to the classical methods of random mutagenesis and selection, which have been already exhausted to great extent, metabolic and biosynthetic engineering are now expected to have a key role in future improvement strategies. For example, engineering the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (mcm) enzymatic activity has been shown to have good potential for increasing the flux through the feeder pathway of methylmalonyl-CoA, the main precursor of the erythromycin polyketide chain. Inactivation of mcm lead to yield increase in carbohydrate-based medium and overexpression of the mcm operon enabled significant yield increase in an oil based medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, improvement of erythromycin titres by manipulation of expression of regulatory genes has so far not been demonstrated. In this work we show that using a comparative proteomic approach combined with an extra effort to cultivate <italic>S. erythraea</italic> in conditions simulating the industrial setting, regulatory genes relevant for increasing erythromycin yield in genetic engineering approaches can be identified. Interestingly, SACE_5599 could also have been envisioned as a possible candidate gene based on a very recent comparative transcriptomics study, also carried out industrial media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Our results thus open new possibilities for increasing erythromycin yields by overexpressing globally acting (pleiotropic) regulatory genes involved in key processes of development and differentiation. Specifically, approaches aimed at achieving higher levels or optimum temporal control of <italic>in trans</italic> expression of SACE_5599 could result in further improved yields. Further on, other candidate regulatory genes in <italic>S. erythraea</italic> genome, identified by recent omics analyses, carried out in industrial conditions should be evaluated for their potential of further improvement of the yield. Particularly, regulators providing further yield increase in industrial high-producing strains would be desirable for biotechnological applications. In this way, manipulation of expression of regulatory genes will become a complementary strategy to manipulation of metabolic genes which has already led to significant improvements of erythromycin yields.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we have identified a new putative regulatory gene SACE_5599 in <italic>S. erythraea</italic> that influences sporulation during the life cycle of this actinomycete and importantly affects erythromycin yield of the WT and high-producing <italic>S. erythraea</italic> strains. While the detailed regulatory mechanisms of this protein remain to be elucidated, we have observed that erythromycin biosynthesis and final yield in <italic>S. erythraea</italic> are strongly interrelated with regulatory networks involved in morphological differentiation. We have also shown that overexpression of SACE_5599 and <italic>bldD</italic> gene (SACE 2077) can improve the yield of erythromycin in the <italic>S. erythraea</italic> WT strain, suggesting that modulation of expression of globally acting regulators may lead to improved producers of polyketide natural products. Importantly we have shown, that omics approaches are valuable tools to identify industrially relevant regulatory genes, however, it is of key importance that samples for omics analysis are collected in conditions which simulate real industrial setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cultivation and transformation of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> strains</title><p>The <italic>S. erythraea</italic> NRRL23338 type strain and ABE1441 industrial overproducing strain, obtained by iterative methods of classical mutagenesis and selection, were propagated on ABSM4 agar plates (1% corn starch, 1.1% corn steep liquor, 0.3% (NH4)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.3% NaCl, 0.3% CaCO<sub>3</sub>, 2% agar) or R5 agar plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] for 14-days at 30&#x000b0;C.
