The complexity of cancer can be reduced to a small number of underlying principles like cancer hallmarks which could govern the transformation of normal cells to cancer. Besides, the growth and metastasis of cancer often relate to combined effects of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Here, we performed comprehensive analysis for lncRNA expression profiles and clinical data of six types of human cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and identified six risk pathways and twenty three lncRNAs. In addition, twenty three cancer risk lncRNAs which were closely related to the occurrence or development of cancer had a good classification performance for samples of testing datasets of six cancer datasets. More important, these lncRNAs were able to separate samples in the entire cancer dataset into high-risk group and low-risk group with significantly different overall survival (OS), which was further validated in ten validation datasets. In our study, the robust and effective cancer biomarkers were obtained from cancer datasets which had information of normal-tumor samples. Overall, our research can provide a new perspective for the further study of clinical diagnosis and treatment of cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Cancers are the consequence of a process of somatic mutation and break the balance controlled by gene expression programs and cellular networks that typically maintain intracellular homeostasis and prevent unnecessary expansion. Cancer hallmarks and important biological processes, such as cell growth, and cellular differentiation, were able to reveal neoplasia, growth and metastasis dissemination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The identification of cancer related pathways was conducive to the comprehension of the potential mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Recent studies have linked multiple important biological pathways to the oncogenesis and progression of cancer, such as nuclear factor kB (NFkB) signaling pathway and Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Accurate regulation of NFkB activity is essential for physiological homeostasis, and was found that NFkB was over activated in a variety of cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway was suppressed by Frizzled-8, thus playing a crucial role in regulating numerous aspects of tumor development, including lung cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The study on the regulation mechanism of pathways provides a framework for better understanding the diversity of cancers.</p><p>In the past, the majority of studies for the mechanisms of carcinogenesis mainly focused on protein-coding genes. Recently, abnormal expressions of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) identified by the next-generation sequencing technologies are related to different types of cancer. The integration of lncRNAs expression profiles offers an impactful approach to study the lncRNA regulation mechanism of cancer-related pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. LncRNAs are non-protein-coding RNA molecules which could regulate gene expression at diverse levels, containing histone modification, transcription, and/or posttranscriptional regulation. They act as activators, guides, or scaffolds for proteins, DNA and RNA, and would be possible drivers of carcinogenesis biology and work as clinical biomarkers.</p><p>Emerging investigations have found that lncRNAs could regulate pathways to act as a main contributor to carcinogenesis. In previous studies, the individual lncRNA contributions to a single pathway in a specific cancer were taken into account from the experimental perspective. For example, lncRNA CCHE1 indicated poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by activating the ERK/MAPK pathway to promote tumorigenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Lnc_bc060912 whose expression increased in human lung and other tumors and affected cell apoptosis via PARP1 and NPM1 which were two DNA damage repair protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>However, the joint effect of common lncRNAs contributing to a complex cancer was not assured by previous studies. In fact, one pathway could be regulated by multiple lncRNAs in various cancers, and one lncRNA could regulate different pathways associated with different cancers. For example, lncRNAs AK126698, CASC11 and UCA1 regulated the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway in non-small cell lung cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, colorectal cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and oral squamous cell carcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Moreover, many studies have shown that a number of lncRNAs were involved in the p53 pathway. For example, tumor suppressor response lncRNAs LOC572558 and MT1JP regulated the p53 signaling pathway in bladder cancer and other cancers, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. In addition, functional lncRNAs used in this study were annotated to biochemical pathways by LncRNA2Function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, which considered all lncRNAs in the pathways as equal, rather than discovered their potential relationship with human cancers.</p><p>Thus, this study focused on the joint effect of common lncRNAs which have not studied and reported in regulating common cancer related pathways in pan-cancers. Based on lncRNA expression profiles and clinical data of human cancer patients from TCGA, we examined differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs for multiple cancer datasets. Above all, cancer risk pathways and lncRNAs were identified using Wilcoxon signed-rank test and permutation test which were closely associated with not only prognosis-related functions, but also survival of cancer patients. The robustness of these lncRNAs was verified by independent profiles from another platform. By investigating lncRNAs and their regulating pathways in cancer patients, our study would provide insights into the oncogenesis and progression of cancers.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Abnormal mRNAs and lncRNAs for cancers</title><p>For each type of human cancer, DE protein-coding genes and lncRNAs were identified through t-test, controlling False Discovery Rate (FDR) at 5%. Through calculated reads per kilo bases per million reads (RPKM) values for the lncRNA or mRNA in human normal and cancer samples from TCGA, 19901 mRNAs and 14373 lncRNAs expression were recognized.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cancer risk pathways</title><p>Cancer associated candidate pathways were defined as significant pathways using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test after 1000 permutation tests (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) in each cancer dataset. There were 419, 835, 1048, 398, 1457 and 677 biochemical pathways which were identified as cancer associated candidate pathways in BLCA, BRCA, KICH, KIRC, LUAD and PRAD, respectively. These 6 cancer risk pathways were shared among six cancer datasets: &#x0201c;Anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) -mediated degradation of cell cycle proteins&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Cyclin B2 mediated events&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;PLK1 signaling events&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Mitotic Prometaphase&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Beta defensins&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Defensins&#x0201d; pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and were thus termed as common cancer risk pathways.</p><p>APC/C-mediated degradation of cell cycle proteins pathway has been confirmed to involve in colorectal cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Due to a better understanding of APC/C which involved in mitosis and established a stable G1 phase, the understanding of DNA damage or perturbation of the normal cell cycle had been greatly improved<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In many renal cell carcinomas, prostate cancers, basal cell carcinomas and oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC), Defensins pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> might participate in the regulation of oncogenesis and changed the expression of &#x003b2;-defensins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. A new study had indicated that &#x003b2;-defensins could mediate specific antineoplastic immunity and enhance antineoplastic consequences, in which also suggested that &#x003b2;-defensins deserved further examination as potential neoplastic immunotherapy immunogenes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The over-expression of &#x003b2;-defensins in cancers was found by Semple F<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In addition, the rest of the cancer risk pathway: Mitotic Prometaphase pathway and Cyclin B2 mediated events pathway, which usually show abnormal activities and will result in poor prognosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> in patients of breast cancer.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cancer risk lncRNAs</title><p>As lncRNAs may be pivotal in many biochemical pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, we explored whether cancer risk lncRNAs from different cancer datasets display a similar regulation pattern with their cancer risk pathways or not. A total of 23 lncRNAs which involved in the regulation of cancer risk pathways were identified as cancer risk lncRNAs in the six cancer datasets. The performance of identifying cancer risk pathways of 23 cancer risk lncRNAs was evaluated in each cancer dataset for 1000 permutation tests, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1</xref>). Most cancers showed no significance of permutation p values for their corresponding risk pathways (Wilcoxon signed-rank test &#x0003e;0.05). Then, 3% of the smallest permutation p values were selected as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>. No matter the real p value of 23 cancer risk lncRNAs or the real p value of entire lncRNAs, both of them were remained in the boundary of the 3% of the smallest permutation p values. In addition, the p values of 23 cancer risk lncRNAs were smaller than the p value of entire lncRNAs for each cancer risk pathway. During the process of using lncRNAs to identify pathways, the p values of 23 cancer risk lncRNAs were much smaller than the p values of the whole lncRNAs within pathways. The result suggested that 23 cancer risk lncRNAs having better cancer risk pathway detection efficacy than the whole lncRNAs.</p><p>A number of studies have indicated that these 23 cancer risk lncRNAs were closely related to the occurrence or development of cancer. For example, Hassan M suggested that AC005076 might be a functional lncRNA to intervene apoptosis, and might be associated with cancer therapies clinically<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. LINC00654 and STK4-AS1 were served as prognostic lncRNAs for cancers like breast or prostate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Particularly the lncRNA RP4-612B15 showed delicate changes of genome in mantle cell lymphomas (MCL), a subset of B-cell non-Hodgkin&#x02019;s lymphomas, and had been acknowledged as candidate neoplasia functional lncRNA, which suggested its potential as suppressor lncRNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Besides, viral infection is related to the development of lots of cancers, such as cervical cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and liver cancer. NRAV, which expressed in numerous tissues, had been considered as a pivotal contributor of antiviral innate immunity. NRAV could be associated with the pathogenesis of cancers caused by viruses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Evaluation of the performance of cancer risk lncRNAs</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Functional annotation of cancer risk pathways and risk lncRNAs</title><p>Abnormal pathways generally take place in human cancers and usually cause insensitive treatment of cancer. Even though the biological characteristics of cancer are extremely complicated and which can be reduced and expressed by a small number of cancer hallmark-associated GO terms which can lead to tumor growth and metastasis dissemination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. These hallmark-associated GO terms provide a framework for comprehending the noteworthy multiplicity of cancers. To reveal the cancer risk pathways regulated by 23 risk lncRNAs that may have functions in tumor-promoting or suppressing, lots of cancer hallmark-associated GO terms were enriched in cancer risk pathways (hypergeometric test, FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>It was demonstrated that each cancer risk pathway enriched at least one hallmark-associated GO terms of cancers. In total, six cancer risk pathways were enriched in fourteen hallmark-associated GO terms of cancers. Among them, two cancer risk pathway &#x0201c;APC/C-mediated degradation of cell cycle proteins&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Defensins&#x0201d; were enriched with nine hallmark-associated GO terms, respectively. &#x0201c;PLK1 signaling events&#x0201d; enriched with eight hallmark-associated GO terms and &#x0201c;Beta defensins&#x0201d; enriched with three hallmark-associated GO terms.</p><p>It was shown that some hallmark-associated GO terms were shared by several cancer risk pathways. Especially, four of six cancer risk pathways: &#x0201c;APC-C-mediated degradation of cell cycle proteins pathway&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Cyclin B2 mediated events pathway&#x0201d;, &#x0201d;PLK1 signaling events pathway&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Mitotic Prometaphase pathway&#x0201d; were enriched in &#x0201c;Hallmark mitotic spindle&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Hallmark spermatogenesis&#x0201d;, these two hallmark-associated GO terms were important for cell division<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Hong tao Yu<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> pays attention to the corrected positioning of the mitotic spindle. Due to sister-chromatid not accurately attached to the mitotic spindle, the spindle checkpoint facilitates the assembly of checkpoint protein complexus that restrain the action of APC/C, resulting in the steadiness of securin, protection of sister-chromatid cohesion, and a delay in the beginning of anaphase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The &#x0201c;Hallmark apoptosis&#x0201d;, a common feature of cancers, was enriched with APC/C-mediated degradation of cell cycle protein, Cyclin B2 mediated events and PLK1 signaling events, highlighting their roles in the development of cancers. In addition, these three cancer risk pathways were also enriched in &#x0201c;Hallmark E2F targets&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). E2F transcription factors acts a functional role in cell proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, and is deregulated pRB pathway, which is a very recurrent occurrence in human cancer, suggesting these three risk pathways might be carcinogenesis traits of cancers. In addition, &#x0201c;Cyclin B2 mediated events&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Mitotic Prometaphase&#x0201d; were enriched with &#x0201c;Hallmark allograft rejection&#x0201d;, respectively. Meanwhile, these cancer risk pathways were enriched in core hallmark-associated GO terms related to cancer, such as, apoptosis, mitotic spindle and glycolysis, suggesting risk lncRNAs will impact greatly on our knowledge and understanding of cancer risk pathways in human cancers.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>The classification ability of the identified cancer risk lncRNAs in six internal test datasets</title><p>With expression values of 23 cancer risk lncRNAs obtaining from the training dataset as entered features, the SVM classifier was used to discriminate cancer patients and normal samples in six internal test datasets.

Thus, the robustness of these lncRNAs was verified by eight independent profiles from another platform. The validation datasets contained two independent cancer datasets (KIRP and LUSC) from TCGA IlluminaHiSeq RNASeqV2 data, other eight additional independent validation datasets (BLCA, BRCA, HNSC, KIRC, LIHC, LUAD, LUSC and UCEC) from TCGA IlluminaHiSeq RNASeq data.

In order to confirm the high classification performance and stability of the cancer risk lncRNAs identified by our approach, we used the naive Bayes to evaluate the classification performance taking the cancer risk lncRNAs expression values as the classification features in the same way.

These cancer risk pathways were not only significantly enriched functional specificity with hallmark classes of human cancer, but also widely confirmed associated with cancers by literatures. In addition, significant cancer risk pathways identified by lncRNAs for six cancers could not be found by mRNAs using the same approach. In brief, these six cancer risk pathways would be regulated by lncRNAs in the carcinogenesis.</p><p>Notably, 23 common lncRNAs within six cancer risk pathways were considered as cancer risk lncRNAs. In the identification process of cancer risk pathways, the significance of 23 cancer risk lncRNAs was higher than entire lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). In other words, 23 cancer risk lncRNAs could represent entire lncRNAs while identifying cancer risk pathways. In addition, SVM was adopted with 23 cancer risk lncRNAs expression values as classification features to distinguish normal and tumor samples. And then classification performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) was estimated by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to further evaluate the relationship between cancers and these 23 cancer risk lncRNAs. These cancer risk lncRNAs not only had a good classification result in the six test datasets, but also achieved good results in two validation datasets and eight additional independent validation datasets. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">7</xref>) It suggested that these risk lncRNAs could be new and potential biomarkers for human cancers.</p><p>Furthermore, the weighted voting classification algorithm was adopted to investigate the classification ability of 23 cancer risk lncRNAs for normal and tumor samples. Firstly 23 risk lncRNAs were ranked according to signal-to-noise metric. Then the average number of misclassified patients of the 5-fold cross-validation in 1000 permutations was calculated when increasing numbers of top ranked predictive lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). As a result, one specific lncRNA was identified as optimal cancer-related lncRNA for each cancer dataset respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Four lncRNAs were found to be the optimal cancer-related lncRNA for six cancer datasets. Especially, NRAV as a key regulator of antiviral innate immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> had been identified in three cancers (BLCA, KICH and KIRP). RP4-612B15 showing subtle genomic alterations in mantle cell lymphomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> had been found in BRCA and PRAD. In summary, the result above suggested that 23 cancer risk lncRNAs had the potential to be candidate tumor lncRNAs.</p><p>In addition, 23 cancer risk lncRNAs had a good classification performance for samples, and were able to separate samples in the entire cancer dataset into two groups with significantly different OS. With 23 cancer risk lncRNAs for each cancer dataset, the Kaplan-Meier analysis for OS demonstrated a significant difference between the groups predicted to be high expression group or low expression group (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.44e-15, log-rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). The Cox regression p values and Log rank p values were not only significantly associated with OS in the six test datasets, but also in two validation datasets and eight additional independent validation datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Therefore, 23 cancer risk lncRNAs within six cancer risk pathways could identify the survival difference between two groups of samples in sixteen cancer datasets, and these risk lncRNAs could be potential prognostic biomarkers for human cancers with stability and robustness.</p><p>We apply a relatively novel perspective way to identify cancer risk pathways and potential lncRNAs of human cancers. Indeed, focusing on the combination of pathways and lncRNAs could help reveal many potential lncRNAs which capable of taking effect in the occurrence and development process of cancer. It was worth noting that 23 cancer risk lncRNAs identified by our approach were obtained from diverse cancer tissues, while lncRNAs were generally considered to be associated with specific tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The cancer risk pathways regulated by these lncRNAs were also the cardinal factor in the progression and metastasis of various carcinomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Thus, our findings highlighted the cancer common features shared by pan-cancer.</p><p>In our study, the robust and effective cancer biomarkers were obtained from cancer datasets which had information of normal-tumor samples. For cancers without normal sample information, our approach could also be used to identify biomarkers related to molecular subtypes of cancers in their clinical outcome. Overall, our research can provide a new perspective for the further study of clinical diagnosis and treatment of cancer.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Materials</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>TCGA datasets and clinical information of cancer patients</title><p>Illumina RNA (IlluminaHiSeq RNASeqV2 and IlluminaHiSeq RNASeq) sequencing data for eleven types of human cancers which contained cancer and normal samples with clinical information (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>), were obtained from TCGA through Data Portal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.
