However, in South America these strains are rarely isolated and instead a great variety of other strains are found. <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains differ widely in a number of phenotypes in mice, such as virulence, persistence, oral infectivity, migratory capacity, induction of cytokine expression and modulation of host gene expression. The outcome of toxoplasmosis in patients is also variable and we hypothesize that, besides host and environmental factors, the genotype of the parasite strain plays a major role. The molecular basis for these differences in pathogenesis, especially in strains other than the clonal lineages, remains largely unexplored. Macrophages play an essential role in the early immune response against <italic>T. gondii</italic> and are also the cell type preferentially infected <italic>in vivo</italic>. To determine if non-canonical <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains have unique interactions with the host cell, we infected murine macrophages with 29 different <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains, representing global diversity, and used RNA-sequencing to determine host and parasite transcriptomes. We identified large differences between strains in the expression level of known parasite effectors and large chromosomal structural variation in some strains. We also identified novel strain-specifically regulated host pathways, including the regulation of the type I interferon response by some atypical strains. IFN&#x003b2; production by infected cells was associated with parasite killing, independent of interferon gamma activation, and dependent on endosomal Toll-like receptors in macrophages and the cytoplasmic receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) in fibroblasts.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Toxoplasmosis is caused by the protozoan parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>. The parasite is found throughout the world. When humans are infected, few have symptoms because a healthy immune system usually prevents the parasite from causing illness. Nevertheless, cases of severe disease in otherwise healthy individuals have been observed. These cases are usually a result of infection with less common atypical strains of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. Factors associated with virulence in the atypical strains are not well understood. Here, we infected host cells with 29 different strains of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, and performed high-throughput RNA sequencing of both host cells and parasites. We found significant differences in gene expression profiles between strains. Host cell transcriptional response also varied substantially depending on the infecting strain. Specifically, we found that a small group of atypical strains are able to induce production of type I interferons, which are immunomodulatory cytokines. Interferon production is a result of the elimination of internalized parasites through a novel killing mechanism. The dataset we generated is a valuable tool for identification of host cell targets of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> secreted effectors and can contribute to our understanding of why certain <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains are more prone to cause severe disease in humans.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>JPJS was supported by National Institutes of Health R01-AI080621, a NERCE developmental grant AIO57159, the Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences and a Robert A.

Using genome-wide SNPs, it was shown that even within these haplogroups there is often significant diversity and many strains did not fit into the 15 proposed haplogroups. Instead, many strains appear to have formed through recent recombination events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Minot1">[18]</xref>.</p><p>The relationship between strain genotype and virulence in the mouse model is well established; type I isolates, and most South American strains, are highly virulent (LD<sub>100</sub> &#x0223c;1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Khan5">[19]</xref>, whereas type II and III strains are less virulent, with LD<sub>50</sub> of &#x0223c;10<sup>3</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup>, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Saeij1">[20]</xref>. <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> invasion and modulation of its host cell is mediated by proteins secreted from three secretory organelles, called micronemes, rhoptries and dense granules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Dubey1">[21]</xref>. Using crosses between type I, II and III it was determined that strain differences in virulence in mice can be largely explained by the exact allelic combination of the <italic>Toxoplasma ROP18</italic> and <italic>ROP5</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Khan5">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Saeij1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Saeij2">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Taylor1">[25]</xref>. ROP18 and ROP5 are a secreted rhoptry kinase and pseudokinase, respectively, that cooperatively inhibit the murine IFN&#x003b3;-induced immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Fentress1">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Behnke2">[29]</xref>.

For example, the secreted rhoptry kinase ROP16 from type I and III, but not from type II, is involved in constitutive activation of the STAT transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Saeij2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Rosowski1">[31]</xref> while the secreted dense granule protein GRA15, from type II, but not from type I and III, mediates high levels of NF&#x003ba;B activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Rosowski2">[32]</xref>. Expression level differences in ROP38, another secreted rhoptry kinase, mediates strain differences in gene activation along the MAP kinase pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Peixoto1">[33]</xref>. Thus, the precise allelic combination of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> secreted effectors likely determines how distinct <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains modulate the host immune response.

The few severe congenital toxoplasmosis cases in Europe seem to be caused by atypical strains (not type I, II or III) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Ajzenberg1">[35]</xref>. In North America the incidence of more severe human congenital infections is higher compared to Europe and this seems to be associated with a higher prevalence of non-type II strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-McLeod1">[9]</xref>, most likely type 12 strains as these are also prevalent in North America. North American atypical strains have also been associated with severe ocular disease in non immunosuppressed patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Grigg1">[36]</xref>.

Because these atypical strains are correlated with more severe disease manifestations, it is important to determine how they differ from the canonical strains in modulating the host cell. To identify host cell signaling pathways uniquely modulated by atypical <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains we infected macrophages with 29 different strains, representing world-wide diversity, and obtained global transcriptional profiles of both the host and parasites. The parasite transcriptomes showed large differences in gene expression, including expression of host effectors, which correlated with differences in expression of transcriptional regulators such as the Apetala-2 (<italic>AP2</italic>) factors. Combining genome and transcriptome data also identified that some strains had large structural variations that had an impact on gene expression levels. Analysis of the host cell transcriptomes revealed activation of several signaling pathways in a strain-specific manner. For example, only a few atypical strains induce macrophage type I interferon production, which was associated with parasite killing, independent of interferon gamma, that leads to the release of parasite ligands that trigger intracellular Toll-like receptors and cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensors. This resource provides insight into the host response to a large variety of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains and, together with the SNPs dataset we recently published for these strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Minot1">[18]</xref>, can form the basis for the discovery of novel <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> effectors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Co-regulated host and parasite gene clusters are enriched in functional annotation</title><p>We used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of poly-adenylated RNA, obtained after infection of primary murine bone-marrow derived macrophages with 29 different <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains for 20 h, to capture the mouse and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> transcriptomes. We detected 51% (13,179) of murine genes and 93% (8,138) of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> genes (RPKM&#x0003e;1 in at least 1 sample) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003779.s013">Table S1</xref> available online).

We focused on 2,451 differentially expressed <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (RPKM&#x0003e;10 in at least 1 sample and at least 4-fold different between 2 samples) and 5,016 differentially regulated host genes (RPKM&#x0003e;5 in at least 1 sample and at least 2-fold different between any 2 samples). To identify co-regulated host and parasite genes we clustered the macrophage and parasite gene expression profiles and also clustered the experiments (strains) to identify parasite strains that modulate host gene expression similarly or that have similar parasite gene expression profiles. Clustering the macrophage and parasite expression data independently into 9&#x02013;13 major clusters each adequately partitioned the data into co-regulated gene clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003779-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003779.s002">Figures S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003779.s003">S3</xref>). Most clusters had significant functional enrichment in biological processes and the promoters of the genes in the clusters were significantly enriched for transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) indicating that these clusters represent differential modulation of host/parasite signaling pathways by the different <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains. The induction of host genes in some clusters correlated with strain type: for example, cluster 1 is induced by all type 12 strains, cluster 5 is mainly induced by type II strains or strains that have part of the type II genome and cluster 7 and 9 by type 6 strains, possibly indicating host cells responding to genetic differences between strain types. Genes in the other clusters were differently regulated by strains of the same clonal haplogroup (<italic>e.g</italic>, ME49 and DEG for cluster 6 and 8) possibly indicating host cells responding to epigenetic differences between strains.</p><fig id="ppat-1003779-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1003779.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Transcriptome analysis of host cells infected with 29 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains reveals clusters of co-regulated genes enriched in functional annotation.</title><p>(A&#x02013;B) Representative heat maps are shown of differentially expressed mouse (A) or <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> gene clusters (B).

Indeed we detected strong correlations between some host and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> gene expression clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003779.s014">Table S2</xref>). For example, host gene cluster 6 and 8, which are negatively correlated (R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.93), have a significant negative (R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.86) and positive (R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.85) correlation with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> gene cluster 1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003779-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Host cluster 6 was enriched for genes and pathways that were previously shown to be modulated in human fibroblasts by the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> secreted kinase ROP38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003779-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Peixoto1">[33]</xref>. Roos and colleagues have shown that ROP38 overexpression has a profound effect on host cell gene expression and modulates host genes enriched in mitochondrial function, metabolic processes and proteasome function and genes modulated by ELK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Peixoto1">[33]</xref>, a transcriptional activator belonging to the ternary complex factor (Tcf) family. This is consistent with the functional enrichments seen for cluster 6, suggesting that this cluster might be regulated by strain differences in ROP38 expression and that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> might be subsequently responding to the different environment established by ROP38. Consistent with this notion the expression level of <italic>ROP38</italic> is highly variable among <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains ranging from low expression in RH (RPKM&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.1) to extremely high expression in CEP (RPKM&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;505) and positively correlates with cluster 6 (R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.49) and negatively correlates with cluster 9 (R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.51).</p><p>Differences in expression levels of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> transcription factors could also affect a large number of genes. To determine the putative <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> regulators that could modulate the gene expression clusters we used Genomica <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Segal1">[43]</xref>, which takes a set of putative regulators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003779.s013">Table S1</xref>) and assumes that regulators are themselves transcriptionally regulated, so that their expression profiles provide information about their activity level. Although there are many exceptions to this assumption (<italic>e.g.</italic> activation by phosphorylation of signaling transducers, nuclear translocation of transcription factors upon activation or activation by non-variable polymorphic transcriptional factors), the expression level of specific AP2 factors, which are known to be involved in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> gene expression, correlated highly with the expression of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> genes in different clusters. For example <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> cluster 5 and 6 are enriched in genes expressed in the bradyzoite stage and each of these clusters correlate highly with AP2 factors that are known to be upregulated during bradyzoite development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Behnke3">[44]</xref> (AP2X-10 and AP2Ib-1 for cluster 5 and AP2IX-1 and AP2-IX-9 for cluster 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003779-g001">Figures 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003779.s003">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003779.s013">Table S1</xref>).

To test this, we infected HFFs monolayers with a non-activating type II (PRU strain) or the activating COUGAR strain.

There is some evidence that this is associated with atypical strains (not type I, II or III), mainly present in South America.

Also in North America atypical (non type I/II/III) strains have been associated with more severe disease symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Grigg1">[36]</xref>. However, it is currently unknown if these atypical strains differ in their interaction with host cells. Here we provide the complete murine macrophage and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> transcriptomes after infection with 29 different <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains.

Indeed, different host species display large differences in susceptibility to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and different <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains often differ in virulence in the same host species suggesting that specific <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains might have adapted to certain hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Saeij3">[50]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Sergent1">[52]</xref>. Our data indeed show large differences between strains in the modulation of host genes. One of the most consistent observations is the large difference between <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains in the activation of an inflammatory response. Here we show that this is mediated by differences in the sequence and expression level of GRA15, which can activate the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF&#x003ba;B, and by differences in the activation of the type I IFN response. Other <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> effectors, such as the ROP16 and ROP38 protein kinases, can inhibit this inflammatory response. Therefore, the exact sequence and expression levels of GRA15, ROP16 and ROP38, determine the potential of different <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains to induce inflammation. In general the type II, type 12 and COUGAR strains are more pro-inflammatory while type I, type III and type 6 are the least inflammatory. However, even within clonal haplogroups, large differences in the induction of host gene expression exist. In North America, non-type II strains have been associated with more severe toxoplasmosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-McLeod1">[9]</xref>.

For the COUGAR strain, that was also confirmed in human cells. Type I interferons (IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;) are potent coordinators of antimicrobial responses, controlling both cell autonomous innate responses and T cells memory and effector functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Huber1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-MacMicking1">[54]</xref>.

We observed that the exotic strain COUGAR, is more susceptible than type II strains to IFN&#x003b3;-independent killing, which leads to an early IFN&#x003b2; production. This strain specific difference in timing and magnitude of type I interferon response may result in different disease outcomes. We have observed that expression of type I interferons by infected host cells is followed by induction of IRGs, which have a major role in controlling parasite growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Martens1">[30]</xref>. Indeed, it has been previously shown that IFN&#x003b2; can control <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> growth both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Orellana1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Schmitz1">[69]</xref>. Nevertheless, these studies were performed by pre-treating cells or animals with high doses of recombinant IFN&#x003b2;, and lack an assessment of the role of type I interferons in physiological conditions. In this regard, type II strains of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> were shown to stimulate type I interferon production <italic>in vivo</italic> by intestinal cells following oral infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic> cysts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Minns1">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Foureau1">[71]</xref>, however no detailed analysis of the role of this cytokine in disease progression has been performed. Thus, even though induction of IFN&#x003b2; could potentially be beneficial for the host by controlling intracellular parasite growth, it is striking that in the mouse model COUGAR parasites are significantly more virulent than type II strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Khan5">[19]</xref>. It is currently unclear if this enhanced virulence was due to increased parasite burden or enhanced pathogenesis possibly due to a strong pro-inflammatory response. Because COUGAR is genetically quite different from the type II strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Minot1">[18]</xref> it is possible that its enhanced virulence is unrelated to its induction of IFN&#x003b2; and due to differences in other polymorphic effectors. However, in the context of recent observations that type I IFN suppresses type II IFN-triggered human anti-mycobacterial responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Teles1">[72]</xref> it is plausible that the type I IFN response induced by some of the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains could be associated with increased pathogenesis in human patients.</p><p>The simultaneous capture of both the parasite and host transcriptomes has also provided us with important insights into the crosstalk between the host and the parasite. We observed significant correlations between the expression of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and host gene clusters. It has been previously observed that the state of the host cell can modulate <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> gene expression. For example addition of compound 1 to host cells induces differentiation of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> into bradyzoites and the knockdown of CDA1, a nucleosome assembly-related protein, demonstrated its involvement in cell cycle arrest and negative control of cell proliferation, mimicking the effects of compound 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Radke1">[42]</xref>. A potential role for the host cell cycle state in modulating <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> growth and differentiation has also been observed by others, for example, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> spontaneously differentiates into bradyzoites upon invasion of terminally differentiated skeletal muscle and neuronal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-FerreiradaSilvaMda1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Jones1">[74]</xref>. Recently it was shown that the dense granule protein GRA16 is secreted beyond the PVM and traffics to the host cell nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Bougdour1">[75]</xref>, where it could potentially regulate host cell cycle. It was suggested that GRA16 downregulation of cyclin-B1 could be the main cause of the GRA16-induced G2 arrest, which has also been observed by others to be associated with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Brunet1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003779-Molestina1">[77]</xref>. Many of our strain-specifically regulated host gene clusters are also enriched for processes involved in cell cycle regulation suggesting that this is an important target for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> effectors. For example host expression cluster 9 is enriched for host genes modulated by P53 and the CDKN1A kinase. It is also enriched in genes involved in regulation of the host cell cycle, especially G2/M checkpoint regulation. Because these are highly similar to the processes regulated by GRA16 it is tempting to speculate that strain differences in expression of GRA16 and/or sequence of GRA16 might be involved. All together, our study provides global insight of host cells and parasite transcriptional responses upon infection with both canonical and exotic <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains, and allows identification of novel strain specific host cell responses and parasite effectors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All experiments involving animals were in accordance with guidelines set forth by the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science (AALAS).
